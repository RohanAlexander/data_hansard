If those are not the facts, will the Minister state what haB happened in regard to the production of power alcohol in Australia?",19

If so, will he copy of the agreement on the table?",20

Mr BLAKELEY,-Is the Prime of Minister aware that recently the names conof certain persons in Tasmania have been I placed on the prohibited list, and that parcels nor letters addressed to been them will be delivered to them by the Postmaster-General's Department, and yet the Commissioner of Taxation receives through the post from the managers of Tattersall's sweeps letters containing money. In view of this anomaly will . the right honourable gentleman see that regulations are made which will permit the carriage by thePostmaster-General's Department,, not only of letters from Tattersall's to the Taxation Department, but also of applications - for tickets in sweeps made to other persons in Tasmania ?'",20

17,Mr WEST,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is correct,, as reported, that the Honourable A. S. Rodgers, Assistant Minister for Repatriation, is to act as Assistant Treasurer during the""' Prime Minister's absence in London. If that is the intention of the Government, will they consider the desirableness of making some other arrangement, in view of the fact that the honourable gentleman's duties as Assistant Minister for Repatriation are so heavy as to' cause delay in dealing with Repatriation cases, in respect of which expedition is urgently needed in the interests of the soldiers and the general public.",21
18,Mr HUGHES,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"It is not true that my honourable colleague, Mr Rodgers, is to act as Assistant to the Treasurer during my absence. He is to remain in that Department in which he has done such excellent work, and which, more than any other, calls for the closest attention of the Government. ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES, 1920-21.",21
19,Mr GREGORY,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"I desire to ask the Treasurer whether, in view of certain' large and unexpected expenditure incurred this year, but not included in the Estimates, and having regard also to otlier new proposed expenditures, not provided for, he willsubmit additional Estimates for the present financial year.",21
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,I shall have either to bring down additional Estimates or to ask for a substantial increase to the Treasurer's Advance Account. I hope such action will be taken very shortly. _ I shall then avail myself of the opportunity to make a full explanation of the present state of the finances of the country. TELEPHONE SERVICE'S. LACK OF MATERIAL .,21
21,Sir ROBERT BEST,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"In view of the thousands of applications for telephone connexions that are being made from all parts of Australia, and the invariable reply of the Department that there is a great shortage of cables, I desire to ask the Postmaster-iGeneT.al what prospect there is of immediate' relief being granted to those who are so anxious to obtain these business and other connexions. Mr Wise' - As I said in this House last year, we sent away, in August last, orders for material representing a total expenditure of over £1,000,000. Included in these were orders for some 626 miles of cables; but the material has been coming to hand very slowly. We are doing all we can to expedite delivery, but with the enormous arrears existing in America - and the Old Country, we cannot expect to obtain delivery as quickly as do those at the doors of the manufacturers. WHEAT POOL.",21
22,Mr CUNNINGHAM,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"Will the Prime Minister state whether the Government has taken into consideration the advisableness of participating in the Wheat Pool for 1922, and, if so,-what decision has been arrived at?",21

I shall refer to wheat, and the attitude of the Government towards the Pool, as well as to wool and finance. PUBLIC SERVICE ' .SUPERANNUATION BILL .",21
24,Mr BOWDEN,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"In view of an assurance given recently by the Minister for Works and Railways, on behalf of the Leader of the Government, that a Bill providing for a superannuation scheme would be introduced immediately, although he was unable to say whether it would 'be introduced in this House or another place until after the next meeting of the Cabinet, I would ask the Prime Minister whether any decision has been come to as to the House in which the Bill shall be introduced.",21
25,Mr HUSHES,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"The position, as I understand it, is that a Bil l was drafted, considered by the Government, and, after it bad been referred to a Committee, was redrafted. It is now in the hands of the Treasurer, and as soon as my .right honourable colleague has considered it it will be introduced in the Senate. Later:",22
26,Mr WEST,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has not made an error in regard to the Public Service Superannuation Bill, inasmuch as I understand the course he proposes to take in regard to this measure is unconstitutional. All money Bills, or Bills which create expenditure, should be introduced in this House, and not in the Senate.",22
27,Mr HUGHES,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"As to that, every man has his moods and his days on which he is bright or dull-hi s days when he is a fountain of information on different subjects. This is not my day for exuding information on constitutional points, and so I must ask the honourable gentleman to console himself as best he may. ' AUSTRALIAN LEAD AND ZINC OUTPUT. REPORTED OFFER FROM RUSSIA.",22
28,Mr CONSIDINE,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"In view of the published statement in the daily press of Australia that M . Krassin, the Russian Trade Representative in Britain, had stated, in an interview, that the Russian Government were prepared to take the whole of the lead and zinc output of Australia, and to pay cash for it, I desire to know whether the Prime Minister has taken steps to get into communication with that gentleman by cable. If he has not done so, will he, on his visit to Great Britain, get into communication with him, with the object of facilitating such a sale?",22
29,Mr HUGHES,ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR,"We have not received any communication from Great Britain in regard to this matter;-but I desire to say that I can appreciate the position of the base metal industry of this country. It is not for us to pick and choose as to buyers. We must sell our goods to whomsoever will buy them. I certainly shall not allow any prejudices that I may have conceived, rightly or wrongly, against the Soviet Government to interfere with any proposition that the Government of Russia may make for the purchase of our base metals or any other commodity. NA DEPARTMENT. EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS.",22
30,Mr ROBERT COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is it the intention of the Post and Telegraph Department to dispense with ithe services of all returned soldiers holding temporary positions ?,22
31,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Not that I am aware of. WHEAT POOLS. COMMISSION PAID TO AGENTS-WINDIN G UP OF EARLIER POOLS.,22
32,Mr BRENNAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In the interests of the wheat-growers of my electorate, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that "" the amount paid in comjnission to the selling agents of the Wheat Pools is equal to the whole profits made by the merchants before the war?""",22
33,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Whil e I understood perfectly the first part of the honourable gentleman's question, when .he was seeking no inspiration from the little document he holds in his hand, I have to say that if he will hand that document to me I shall endeavour to answer the question; otherwise, I cannot. The material part of the newspaper extract which the honourable member has handed to 'me is to the effect that the amount now drawn in commission-by the selling agents is equal to the whole of the profits made by the merchants before the war. I am not in a position to make any statement whatever in regard to the matter. I .do not believe the statement is true; but I shall ascertain what the commission is, and what it amounts to in the aggregate. If , as the honourable member suggests, the selling agents are making more by way - of commission than they made before the war, that provides this Government iand this House with an unanswerable argument for not renewing the Pool.",22
34,Mr STEWART,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has promised to make a statement tomorrow concerning our wheat, wool, and other primary products, I desire to ask him whether he will endeavour to ascertain what is causing the delay in the winding up of the earlier Wheat Pools? Will the right honourable gentleman state definitely tomorrow is.causing the delay, and when the P00I3 will be wound up?",22
35,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I quite appreciate the importance of the matter to which the honourable membeidirects my attention. I , of course, do not profess to be in posmercantile session of the information myself. shall endeavour, however, to obtain it becost fore tomorrow, and, if I do, I shall place the House in possession of it. If not, I of each? shall ask my right honourable colleague (Sir Joseph Cook) to announce the inforof mation to the House when it comes to building hand. OIL EXPERTS IN PAPUA.",23
36,Mr WATKINS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"When the Prime Minister is .at Home, will he inquire whether the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has seut out thoroughly competent oil low :experts to develop the industry in Papua? Will the right honourable gentleman satisfy .himself that the intention is really to produce oil within the Commonwealth territories ?",23
37,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There was an arrangement, the details of which I placed before the House, some considerable time back, made between the British Government and ourselves to each pay half the expenses of prospecting for oil in Papua. As the result of that arrangement, exper ton. perts were sent to the Possession. They have been at work for a considerable time, Erriba. and they have supplied, and are supplying, us with progress reports of their operatons; tions. I can assure the House that it is the opinion of this Government, and of the cally British Government, 'that we have secured the services of the best available experts in the world. If there is oil in Guinea I feel certain that the men whose and services have been placed at our disposal will find it. REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT. MEDIC.AX SERVICES.",23

RepatriaNATURALIZATION OF ITALIANS .",23
41,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Minister for New Home and Territories, upon notice I. What number of applications have been made for naturalization by Italian aliens residing in Western Australia during the last three years? 2. What number of such applicants have become naturalized citizens? 3. What are the chief factors disqualifying the unsuccessful applicants?  honourable member's questions are:1. The information desired by the honourable member could not be obtained without the exbe penditure of considerable time and labour, as it has not been the practice to classify under the heads of nationality and State of residence the applicants who have been refused tion or who have failed to comply with all the requirements of the law in respect of naturalization. 2. Twenty-seven. 3. The factors of disqualification in the of Italians are the same as in the case of aliens, and include(a) failure to complete the qualifying period of residence; (6) inadequate knowledge of the English 'language. (Prior to the 1st ary, 1921, inability to read and write English was a disqualification) ; \c) unsatisfactory record. I may add that during the war period, and prior to the ratification of the Treaty of. Peace, men of military age were not accepted for naturalization. DEFENCE FORCES. COURT OF APPEAL .",23
42,Mr FLEMING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact, a3 reported, that the Minister for Defence is about to establish a Court of Appeal to consider complaints concerning injustices suffered by high officers while on active service ? -2. If any Court of Appeal is established, will the Assistant Minister see that it will be such as will also hear complaints of the rank and file, and so constituted as to give rankers a fighting chance of redress of their grievances, consideration, for losses, and indignities suffered hy them? . Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE - The answers to .the honourable member's questions are a3 follow:1. No; the report is inaccurate. 2. See answer to question 1. STRIKE BREAKING.",24
43,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Has his attention been called to the report in the Melbourne Herald, of 21st April, that Mr Kennedy, Tasmania, speaking at the Australian Manufacturers' Conference in Launceston, suggested "" that the proposed federation should act and not speak. He urged the adoption of the German system, where 70,000 volunteers had been enlisted to break down strikes. The German Government had subsidized .this movement."" ? 2. Will the Minister make inquiries to ascertain whether such report is correct; and, if so, does he think that such manufacturers should protected by means of the present Tariff if tliey urge the introduction* and organization of strike breakers, so that manufacturers may obtain all the advantages of the Tariff whilst naturalizathe workers are to get none?",24
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not yet in a .position to answer these questions, but case the information I have gathered so far other is to the eifect that Mr Kennedy was not a delegate to the conference; he was a visitor, and made a speech on the lines indicated in the question, but it was Janurepudiated by members of the conference. o BASIC ""WAGE COMMISSION.",24
45,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On the 21st April the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) asked how much the Basic Wage Commission's investigations had cost, and how long the Commission was to continue. I promised to obtain the information. I now desire - to state that the Basic Wage Commission has completed its investigations. The cost to date is £21,041 4s. 7d., but accounts amounting to approximately £1;000 have yet to be paid. NA ASSOCIATION. APPLICATION TO ARBITRATION COURT.",24
46,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"On the 26th November, 1920, the honourable member for . Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) asked1. I3 it a fact that the representative of the Government in the Arbitration Court (Mr. Skewes) has stated his intention of. applying for an amendment of the proviso to clause 1 of the award of the Commonwealth Public Service Clerical Association for the purpose of depriving senior fifth class officers, certified to be efficient by the Public Service Commissioner, of the benefits granted by such proviso? 2. In view of the Prime Minister's statement of the ,23rd November, 1920, to the effect that the Government had a solemn obligation to see that the Commonwealth employees had sufficient wages or salaries, and his admission that such was not the case at present, will the Prime Minister state whether or not he is in favour of the application being made? 3.. In the event of the Prinie Minister not being in favour of the proposed application being made by the Government's representative, will heissue instructions that the action be not taken? 4. Does the Prime Minister consider that the proposed application, if granted, would tend to promote contentment and loyalty in the Publici Service? It was then intimated that inquiries would be made in the matter, and I now desire to inform the honourable member1. Application was made by the Public Service Commissioner to the Court in December last, and Mr Justice Starke suspended the operation of the provision referred to as from 1st February, 1921, in order that the Public Service Arbitrator might later on have an opportunity of reviewing the matter. 2,. 3 and 4. In connection with the general question of providing a reasonable wage for members of the Public Service the Government approved of. certain provisional increases as from 1st November, 1.920; the further consideration of the matter is being left to the Public Service Arbitrator who was recently appointed. GRADINGOF DAIRYPRODUCE .",24
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"On the 13th A p r i l the honourable memlfer for Lilley (Mr . Mackay) asked the following questions : 1. Whether it is a fact that in the State of Queensland there are State and Federal inspec-' tors emploved in the grading of dairy products ? 2. If so, are the producers called upon to pay fees to both State and Federal Departments ? 3. What is thr> total cost per annum to the Commonwealth for the grading of dairy products in Queensland? 4. What amount - of revenue is obtained? 5. Is it not possible that arrangements could be made with the State officials to carry out this work to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth, and thus avoid this duplication of officials? I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following in formation :1. Yes. 2. Prior to 16th April producers, who were exporters, were called upon to pay fees to the Federal Department only. State Government regulations which came into operation oh the l6,th April, 1921, while not imposing inspection or grading fees, make a charge for every 100 lbs. of butter, cheese, condensed and other milk manufactured in a factory. 3'. £1,518 for the year 1919-1920. 4. £1,29S for the year 1919-1920. 5. No. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. PROFIT ON SERVICES.",25
48,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether the telephone, telegraph and postal service of the Commonwealth was responsible for a profit of £1,012,597 for two years ending 30th June, 1920, and was this made-possible by excess charges? 2. If so, will the Minister consider the revision of rates to enable the service to be conducted at the minimum"" of cost, and not to require excess charges to provide a profit?",25
49,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low' :1. Yes, but this profit was not due to excess charges. 2. See answer to No. 1. TARIFF. In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 8th A p r i l (vide page 7336), on motion by Mr . GREENEThat duties of Custom and duties of Excise(vide page 726), first item, be imposed.",25
50,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Kooyong) [3.34] - I hope that now that the preliminary business has been disposed of we shall have an opportunity of giving continuous attention to this Tariff, Already it has been in operation for a r>eriod of upwards of twelve months, aud that has been' a very anxious time for the manufacturers, traders, commercial meii and consumers by reason of the uncertainty as to the duties. May I say in tMs regard that we might take a lesson from America and their hurricane methods? As soon as a revision of the Tariff was mentioned a few weeks ago, a committee representative of Congress was appointed for the purpose of a close in vestigation of the subject; that committeehas been busily at work, and I read in recent cables that it is contemplated thatCongress will be in a position to deal with the Tariff early in the month of July. So Ear as any information can be gathered in regard to the proposed new Tariff' it is important to remember that, even though America has already a very high Customs Schedule, the object and intention of the revision is not to decrease the duties, but to further increase those which have been found ineffective. The last twelve months has been a very disturbing period for those engaged in trade and commerce in Australia, and particularly for the manufacturers, and these delays for that reason should not take place. The Tariff should be disposed of as soon as possible after its introduction. However,-we have had the advantage of twelve months' experience of the working of the Tariff, and, speaking generally, I am justified in saying that I do not remember any previous Tariff which was so generally accepted by the community as has been the one we are now considering.",25
51,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Was it acceptance or resignation ? Sir ROBE RT BEST - I admit that on the part of a percentage of the people the new duties were accepted only with resignation ; but by the great majority of the people this Tariff is regarded as a fair and genuine effort on the part of the Government to stimulate the industrial l if e of Australia.,26
52,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,At the expense of the primary producer.,26
53,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I shall come to that point later, and endeavour to disillusionize the honourable member. is nothing in this Tariff which justifies his interjection. t community, after an experience of upwards of twelve months, has practically settled down to these duties, and they and I are hopeful that it will be u mately confirmed substantially in its present form, except in so far as mistakes have occurred. The Government has set out particularly to recognise those industries which came into existence during the war under conditions of great difficulty, stress, and. strain. They have given special consideration to key or basic industries with a view to their further development. At the same time they have sought to extend existing industries, and to give all reasonable encouragement to the creation of new ones. Of course, the Tariff is a very inexact instrument, and there is no doubt that the utmost difficulty obtains in adjusting a Tariff to the immediate economic conditions of the.country; but I think the Government have made a reasonably succe3sful effort to do that. I may have another opportunity at a later stage, of indicating developments which have occurred in other countries, and ideas that are held regarding: the nature of some of the duties that have been imposed. The Committee has to rely to a large extent upon information which has been officially obtained. We have been told a good deal in regard to various in dustries, and as to certain of them which are alleged to be favoured at the expense of others. I hope all honourable members are conscientiously anxious to develop all in dustries in any way native to the country and entitled to our encouragement and consideration. Therefore, I am very disappointed at the attitude assumed by the Country party towards this Tariff. They have not, I believe, given full consideration to the operation of previous Tariffs, and it shall be.my endeavour to prove to them that the protective duties upon agricultural, implements have been of substantial benefit to the farmers, and that those who , are engaged i i i the farming industry ought to be especially interested in the stabilization and expansion of the agricultural implement industry. I wish to demonstrate that the imposition of duties on agricultural implements has never been a source of disadvantage to the farmers, but, on the contrary, has There distinctly benefited them by reason of the fact that it has led to the establishment The general of factories in Australia for the manufacture of these implements. I can readily show that the farmers have not paid the increased duty levied from time to l t i- time on this class of machinery. Indeed, a close study of the operation of the various Tariffs from 1906 onwards will conclusively establish this contention. As a matter of fact the stimulation .which was given to the manufacture of agricultural implements locally by the imposition of the 1906 Tariff resulted in a decrease in the price of these implements, which began to take effect almost from the year following the imposition of the duty.",26
54,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Agricultura l implements are dearer today than they have ever been before.,26
55,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"They are cheaper today in Australia than they are in Free Trade countries. No more legitimate comparison can be made than between the prices in Australia and those in New Zealand. The Minister (Mr . Greene) has conclusively proved that, although we have a duty of 25 per cent, and 30 per cent, on agricultural implements, this class of machinery is cheaper in Australia than it is in New Zealand, where in many respects no duty is i m posed, and where the maximum impost upon agricultural implements is 10 per cent. A. little while ago New Zealand imposed a duty on imported agricultural implements, and under the stimulus of that protection certain establishments were started for the manufacture of this class of machinery ; but subsequently a Free Trade Government removed the protection, with the result that the agricultural implement manufacturing industry gradually dwindled. The New Zealand farmer being thus placed absolutely at his mercy, the importer thereupon conirnencsd to exploit him. I could quote a dozen instances to supplement those given by the Minister to show that agricultural implements are cheaper in Australia today than they are in New Zealand. The Country party ought to be specially interested in the local manufacture of agricultural implements, because it affords to the farmer the surest guarantee that the price of the machinery he uses will be reasonable. A significant statement was recently made by Mr Massey, the Prime Minister of New Zealand. He deplored the fact that, although the Dominion was practically Free Trade in regard to agricultural implements, the production of wheat was gradually diminishing, whereas in Australia it was materially increasing.",26
56,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Does the honourable . member maintain that the higher the duty is the cheaper the article will become?,27
57,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"No ; I am endeavouring to prove that where the market is made subject to the exploitation of importers, the farmer suffers most materially; whereas, when the importers are obliged to compete with well-established local industries the farmer gets the benefit of that competition.",27
58,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Of course, there is such a thing as exploitation by the local manufacturer!",27
59,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"If that is so, it should be subject to regulation by the local Parliament; but the operations of importers cannot be regulated in the same way. I lay down definitely two propositions, the first of which is that the imposition of Customs duties, so far as they have ^established local agricultural implement industries, have materially benefited and helped the farmer; and the second proposition I lay down is that the farmer has not, speaking generally, paid the increase in duty placed upon his machinery. No increase of price followed the imposition of the 1906 Tariff. On the contrary, as a result of the operation of the - duties, then imposed, there was a gradual reduction in the price of agricultural implements. I have never concealed my view that high Protection is necessary, as regards many of our industries, yet when I stood for the Senate the vote of the farming communiby went overwhelmingly in my favour. Of course, I speak only for Victoria ; but I say of this State that I have never known the farmers to be Freo Traders. On the contrary, they realise that their interest is in the encouragement of the secondary industries, by which they substantially benefit.",27
60,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Eac h Tariff is higher than the last. When is the increase of duties going to stop.'',27
61,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I should say that it ought not to stoo u n t i l we-have evened up our conditions here, and our local industry is strong enough to fight the world on even terms. A legitimate competition between the importer and the local manufacturer would then take place. The honcirable member who has just interjected represents Mildura. That - settlement is a product ofProtection. No duties were too high for the settlers there, and by reason of the encouragement it has received it is one of the most flourishing settlements in the Commonwealth, and a credit to Australia. Th© honourable member for Swan (Mr . Prowse) 6tated that these duties are calculated to k ill the farming industry. I have now dealt with that statement. But he surprised me by describing the Tariff as prohibitive. To show that it is not so,. I have only to mention that, according to official figures, the total importation of merchandise into Australia for the eleven months ending 28th February, 1920, was valued at, roughly, £77,700,000, whereas that for the year ended 28th February, 1921, it was valued at £152,500,000. As this Tariff has been in operation slightly over twelve months, it will be seen that it is so little prohibitive that the importations under it have been nearly twice what they were in the preceding year under the last Tariff. I wish to point out that the imposition of import duties is only one way of encouraging industries,- and"" that there are other methods of encouraging them. Por instance, last year the honoraible member  Westralian Partners' Agreement Bill , which was passed into law as "" An Act to approve the agreement made between His Majesty's Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and Lathrop Murray , of Perth, in the State of Western Australia, Managing Director of the Westralian Farmers' Limited,and for other purposes."" That Act legalizes the advance of a sum not exceeding £500,000 by the Commonwealth of Australia to encourage the farming industry of Western Australia. Another means of encouraging industries is the granting of a subsidy; yet another, the making of concessions. We are all, I take it , in terested in the encouragement of our local industries, and in their progress and prosperity. I urge, therefore, that we dare not take a limited view of this matter. We must regard our industries as a whole, and, whether by subsidy, bonuses, loans or the imposition of Customs duties, we must help them wherever the opportunity offers. Some little time ago I read an excellent little book; by ai well-known political economist, Mr I a n D . Colvin, which was entitled Take Cover. Its argument was that the Mother Country had been so neglectful of its own in terests in various directions that the more astute German had taken advantage of, and profited by, this neglect. The book contains many striking sentences, and the writer, I think, legitimately describes the position when he saysThere seems to he this difference between the Free Trade and the Protectionist Government: The Protectionist Government exploits the other nation; the Free Trade Government betrays - its own. Free Trade arguments are novel, and perhaps out of date and of place in Parliament now, and have not been justified experience; and I would remind honourable friends that the of Free Trade by the Mother resulted in the ruin of her agriculture and the throwing out of cultivation of some millions of acres. futile, at this time of day, for any one to suggest that Protection acknowledged national policy of Australia. It has been so proclaimed at many , general elections, andthere could be no more significant evidence of the fact Sir Robert Best. than the introduction of the present Tariff by a Government which numbers among its members the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), the Treasurer (S ir Joseph. Cook), the Minister for Defenfie (Senator Pearce), the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E . D . M ill e n ) , .and the MinisBasil ter for Home and Territories (Mr . Poynton), who, with the late Sir George Reid; were the.great champions of Free Trade in the early days of this Parliament. But they all came to acknowledge that the people of Australia, benefited by the object lesson and the experience of nearly every nation, had made Protection the national policy of the country. America introduced Protection to establish the manufacture of iron and steel and otlier great industries. At the time, her industries were in danger of being, swamped by the importations from the Mother Country. As a result of the adoption of Protection by the United States of America, the iron and steel in dustry has been developed there to a colossal extent, and a vast number of other industries have been established; and whereas iron and. steel were at one time very dear, of late years, because of competition between the manufacturers of America, Great - Britain, and Germany, they have been obtainable at comparatively low prices. The vast expansion of industry and trade which took place in America as the result of the adoption of Protection by that country was followed' by a similar - expansion of industry and trade in Germany under the same p o l i c y . ' Neither country has ever attempted to go back on that policy, but, on the contrary, both have i i o t ' hesitated to give it fuller application.' The diversion of trade and industry brought about by Protection in every somewhat country has resulted in the increase of population, and the creation they of home markets which have by our benefited the farmers as well as' my the workers in secondary - industries. adoption It cannot fairly be suggested by my honCountry orable friendsof the Country party that . the home market is not of very great advantage to the primary producers, nor It would be that an increase of population is not also of the greatest moment to them. An in is not the crease of population means an increase in primary production. None of us is^justified in attempting to exalt any particular industry at - the expense of another. I will go'further, and say that'the history of the world teaches us that no nation can advance without the fullest inter-relationship between its primary and secondary industries. The two need to go hand in hand. The field and the factory must be brought together. That is what we have successfully achieved in Australia, and we are seeking today to continue the same policy. I have never attempted to eetalt a secondary industry at the expense of a primary industry, and an examination of the operation and experience of previous Tariffs will show that, as in this case, their outstanding objective has been to bring about the harmonious working together of our primary and secondary in dustries. In that way only can we have a guarantee of progress. Once we have full and harmonious co-operation on the part of our primary and secondary industries, the progress of Australia will make rapid strides.",27
62,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Does not the honourable member think that a Tariff schedule such as that we are now discussing should be approved by a Committee or Board, as the practice in the. United States of America, before it is submitted to Parliament ?",29
63,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The honourable member will recollect that when the M i ister for Trade and Customs was introregard, ducing this Tariff I asked whether he i tended to provide for the creation of Board to deal with it . My views in that regard are in complete accord with those of my honourable friend. There should be a Board of experts charged with the duty of watching the operation of every item in the Tariff, as well as the movements - of trade machinery abroad. A f t e r a close consideration of our imports local production, that Board should be required to report to the Parliament the rewheat ? sult of its investigations and experience. Parliament would then be able to act with greater knowledge, and thus to do greater justice to both primary and secondary industries. I have. always strongly advocated the creation of such a Board, and I hope we shall have from the Minister an assurance that something in that direction will be done. Honorsumption able members are undoubtedly at a great disadvantage in dealing with a Tariff less they have the benefit of expert vice. It is true that an investigation freightage. was made by the Inter-State - Commis-sion",29
64,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Whose reports were completely ignored in the preparation of this Tariff.,29
65,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"They were i g nored because conditions in the meantime had been revolutionized. What obtained in 1914, or thereabouts, when the investigations of the Commission were made, does not obtain now, so that the Inter-State Commission's recommendations, as submitted at that time, would not be of any great value to us today. A self-contained Australia is a legitimate aspiration. Australia may well look to its own preservation. Self-preservation is the first law of individuals as well as of nations, and the war drew our attention more and more to the necessity of industrial independence. The idea of a self-contained Australia is one which we can only hope to work up to, but . it is a very legitimate one, and our legislation for the encouragement of industry should undoubtedly be in that direction. Every nation recognises that its - internal trade is the most valuable that it has, and .by the recognised process to which I is have referred-by the impositifta of duties for the establishment of industries - w e can materially and substantially increase our internal trade. Primary and secondary industries are alike entitled to n - the home market, which, particularly in to the secondary industries, is of n - the very greatest value. I would remind a the Committee of an apt and cogent statement made on this subject by President LincolnTf you purchase from .the foreigner you get the goods but the foreigner gets the work, the wages and the profits. But if you purchase at home yon get the goods and also the work, the and our wages and the profits. ",29
66,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It undoubtedly does, so far as our local consumption is concerned, and the farmer has received th© .most material encouragement, help, and protection that the Government could extend to his industry. The wheat production of Australia, after the local conhad been, provided for, would have been absolutely valueless to us duruning the war but for the interposition of adthe Government to secure the necessary  try does need .protection ?",29
67,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Yes , and that is the character of the protection it has received at the hands of the Government. The Government relieved the farmerand also, I admit, Australia-fro m bankruptcy, by their interposition when they secured the requisite freights for the re- 12 per cent. moval of our grain to other countries. Without such action on the part of. the Government every farmer would have become bankrupt. The Government went even further on behalf of the farmer, they sold to the Mother Country some £300,000,000 worth of primary products which would otherwise have been valueless.",30
68,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,It would have been a bad lookout for the Mother Country if those primary products had not been available for her to buy.,30
69,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Sh e was the only cash purchaser, and she paid her money for produce of which she could not obtain delivery for two years. In the circumstances, therefore, the honourable member's remark is ungenerous. Mother Country undoubtedly endeavoured to u£lize the primary products which she purchased from us, but by reason of the shortage of shipping could turn to account only a limited portion of them. The outstanding fact is that as the result of the action taken by the Government to encourage and protect our farmers by taking possession of their products and subsequently selling them  where would Australia's credit have been ?",30
70,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I admit that it was a national movement on the part of the Government, and it met with our unanimous approval. The only point I am endeavouring to make is that the Government have never failed to recognise the claims of the farming community, and to take action for their encouragement and stability. I would also point out that Australia is especially interested in the development of secondary industries by reason of the fact that she is a producer of enormous quantities of - raw material. The wool, wheat, metal, and other kindred industries are basic and key industries of the greatest value and moment to Australia, and there is ample room for their practically unlimited development. The wool industry, no doubt, is suffering seriously, but only temporarily, and needs the assistance and encouragement of the Government; there is ample room for action on the part of the Government towards its fuller development. Our production normally is something like 700,000,,000 lbs. of wool per annum; whereas our home consumption of wool is only some 10 per cent, or An ideal which we may reasonably work up'to is that, instead of so much of our wool being exported in a greasy state, it should be worked up here. Even if it were only converted into wool tops, employment would thus be found for a vast number in many industries. I am. not so idealistic, however, as to think that this can be done in three, four, or five years.",30
71,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,How did the woollen manufacturers of Australia treat the community when it was impossible to obtain supplies from abroad? They exploited the. public for all they were worth.,30
72,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Our woollen manufacturers manufactured at a price The which, was fixed by the Government.",30
73,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,And that price gave them profits which returned to them the whole of their capital within three years.,30
74,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"They may have had a good time, but they were working under strict Government regulation. The Government fixed the price.",30
75,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,They made a profit of 95 per cent.,30
76,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"They had a glorious time under this "" strict Government supervision"" of which the"" honourable member speaks.",30
77,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The fact remains that they worked under the supervision and control of the Government. The Government fixed the price, and said to the woollen manufacturers, ""We will take all the cloth you can manufacture at that price."" The manufacturers at once set to work as far as possible to increase their plants and kept them running twenty-four hours a day in order to meet the demand that was made upon them. If those operations resulted in profits, then the woollen manufacturers were entitled to them. Do not let us asperse them unfairly. I repeat that what they did was done under Government control. They were working under disadvantageous' conditions, at a time of great stress and strain. The farmers should be® the last to cast reproaches; for they themselves were equally benefited by war conditions, and were recipients of higher prices than they had ever obtained be. fore, all by reason of action on the part of the Government, so that the remark made by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) does not come well from him.'. I repeat that the producers of wool, wheat, and other primary products obtained higher prices than they had ever secured before during the same period. It is not reasonable for my honourable friends to heatedly attack the secondary industries because they happened to benefit under war, conditions by manufacturing, at the request of the Government, at prices fixed by the Government. In the same little book to which I have referred, there is another striking sentenceThe woollen industry was recognized as the foundation of English power. Later on, the' writer saysEngland was weak when she produced only wool. She grew stronger when she produced cloth. She added still further to her strength when she was able to build ships, and found cannon and forged swords, and then alone was she able to secure her independence. Then, in yesterday's Age there appeared an excellent article on .the subject of Australia's lost wealth. This article dealt with the woollen industry, and what its development'means, and summarizes the position as follows:Perhaps a more definite idea of what the conversion of Australia's wool clip into textiles would mean will be conveyed by the accom- panying table:Value of raw wool . . .. £32,000,000 Value, if converted into textiles 72,000,000 Number of hands necessary . . Number of persons supported . . Value of extra food consumed at 10s. per, head per week . . £12,540,000  with Protection?",30

79,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"For the reasons I have already explained-that it is going to be Australia's"".strength. As I pointed out, there is a vast opportunity open to us. I have here a most significant return, [317] which will be of interest to honourable members. It is an official return which I received only yesterday from the Commonwealth Statistician, and it contains - the following: A comparison of the imports of apparel and of woollen piece goods during ^he eleven months ended 28th February of the years 1920 and 1921:COMMONWEALTH or ATJSTKALIA.

Remember, all - these importations are under the operation of the n'ew Tariff.  not manufacture these goods?",31
80,Sir ROBERTBEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I agree that she should do so; but Australia requires the protection the T a r i ff is affording; that is the very object of 114,350 440,000 the Tariff, and there is a vast field for the expansion of our industries. It is within our power to capture a' large part of this trade, and the T a r i ff is formulated with that particular object. I am dealing only very shortly with these mat-ters; but, apart altogether from what I have said, we must remember the associated trades of wool scouring, fellmongering, tanning, and soap, glue, and candle manufacturing, and the corresponding expansion which would follow. We should give the metal industries substantial encouragement. D u r in g the war efforts were made towards the establishment of those industries, and vast sums of money have been expended to that end. Apart from being able to produce various alloyed steels, we are able to manufacture steel rails, steel plates, boiler plates, sheet metal generally, and steel castings.",31
81,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"We cannot buy steel rails at Newcastle now. i Sir ROBERT BEST -.Hithert o have been unable to purchase in Australia the particular articles T have ferred to, and have been entirely dent on imports from abroad. There is one point I desire to size, and it is in connection with dumping. The Minister for Trade and Customs has stated his intention . to introduce some legislation in this conday, nexion, and it is a precaution been taken in other Protectionist countries as absolutely essential. Dumping, in these times, is scientifically organized, and the object of the dumper is to preserve his home price. The home market importation of primary products inter is that which is most valued by the manufacturer, and, as there is bound be a surplus, the manufacturer, in order to maintain the home price,. can afford to dump abroad, and, perhaps, ultimately secure the foreign market by the extincof tion of foreign industries. Our dustries here cannot, stand up against - dumping, and it is essential that the - amplest provision should be made in this connection. In Germany, matters are so organized that the State joins with the great financial and manufacturing houses and corporations for the purpose of grantout ing subsidies or concessions of various kinds, and gives other financial assistance. In this way, the German manufacturers' get their prices in the valuable home ket, and then are able to sell their plus goods abroad infinitely cheaper than they did in the home market. the United States of America there been passed what is known as the Webb Act, the object of which is the exploitaMinister tion of foreign markets; and all the for the prevention of Trusts and other monopolies' are held not to apply to porations formed under that Act for this exploitation. The Webb Act deals with the export trade only, and empts corporations formed for the purposes of that trade; in fact, monopolies are legalized and encouraged. The obwithin the Empire? ject, of course, is to secure the world's markets, and we know that, if once local industries here or elsewhere can be annihilated in this way, the American manufacturer can capture the market, and then dictate his own prices.  the United States of America Protection we is given to the primary industries?",32
82,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,In precisely rethe same way as we are doing here by depenincreasing the duties.  emphathe primary producers' implements.,32
83,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Not at all ; - that is only a phase of the AmericanCanadian Constitution. Only the other . in the United States of America, a that has duty was imposed on wool.",32
84,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Would the honourable member agree to increase all the import duties on all primary products ?,32
85,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"So far as the T feres with our primary production, yes. to Another proposal that I welcome, and one in which I have been greatly interested, is that for British preference. I had the pleasure, when, as Leader in the Senate the Deakin Government, of introducining and passing the necessary legislation providing for the first time for preference of the kind. In 1907-8 it was provided that the preference to Britain should be a voluntary offering so far as Australia was concerned; it was a voluntary gift to the Mother Country, with the hope, but withany stipulation, that there would ultimately be a reciprocal arrangement. The object aimed at was Intra-Imperial trade, marso that our efforts should not go towards surbuilding up the wealth and strength of a possible enemy, but to building up In our own Empire. I am desirous that has every British Dominion should be included; and we have been told by the that that is the intention of the laws Government. When British preference was originally introduced, I think the corimports from the Mother Country represented something like £40,000,000, and the preference extended to about 61 per expressly excent, of that amount.",32
86,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Why not make a proper job of it , and have Free Trade ' Sir ROBERT BEST - I do not think that Australia is sufficiently advanced for that to be done, nor do I think it desirable in our interests. But we desire to divert all the external trade of Australia in the direction of the Mother Country -.that is the object of British preference. We originally provided for a 5 per cent, remission of duties amounting to something like £10,000,000, and by a Bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) when in office, the preference was made to apply to some £32,000,000 of importations from the Mother Country, representing 79^ per cent., and the remission thereby provided for was about per cent., representing, approximately,* £2,000,000. That was a very substantial remission; but I do not pretend to say, nor do I think it desirable, that our. industries should be sacrificed. There is, of course, greater competition between the local productions and those of the Mother Country. I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs on the fact that he has increased the preference substantially. Never at any time was the Mother Country entitled to greater consideration than she is now, having regard to her colossal war services for the protection of the Empire. She is burdened with £8,000,000,000 of debt, and during the war her export trade was annihilated, her factories _ were turned into munition works, the whole country became a vast arsenal; and she' made all those mighty sacrifices whilst America, Japan, and other countries were vastly increasing their production and-wealth. Under the circumstances we are justified in awarding a substantial preference to Britain, and I welcome the fact that the Government have seen fit to do that. I feel sure that the Committee will readily recognise the claims of the Mother Country, and that the result will ultimately be, , without making any condition or stipulation, the establishment of a >- reciprocal arrangement between the Mother Country and the Dominions, with the aim and object of developing inter-Imperial trade, and further building up the British Empire.",32
87,Mr LAZZARINI,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Werriwa) [4.38] I congratulate the honourable member Kooyong on his concluding remarks, alunder though to my mind there was in them little too much of Britain and not enough of Australia. Whilst I am a ProtecUnited [317]-2 tionist, and am prepared to support most of the duties mentioned in the, schedule, I object to this Tariff on the grounds that it is designed purely for the production of revenue. It was not conceived for the purpose of building up the industries of Australia so much as for the purpose of gathering in money. That is proved by the increased revenue which the Customs Department has collected during the last twelve months. I think that the figures of Customs revenue to the end of March showed an excess of about £2,000,000 over the Minister's estimate for the whole year.",33
88,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The Department collected £321,700,000 during the twelve months ended 31st March.",33
89,Mr LAZZARINI,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"As a means of raising revenue or imposing taxation the Tariff is the most'immoral system of all. There are in this schedule many items against which I shall vote. I have no objection to the granting of a moderate preference to the Mother Country; but I think I recollect the Minister, saying that, although the British Government had been approached in regard to a re>ciprocal preference to Australian products, up to the present time no such arrangement had been made.",33
90,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"That is not quite correct. Britain does give a preference; but it does not affect many Australian items. I said, however, that that preference was an earnest of what might happen in the future.",33
91,Mr LAZZARINI,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It should happen in the future. Any preference that we give should be reciprocated. If it is good for the Empire that Australia should give preference to the products of Great Britain, it must be equally good for Britain to give preference to the products of Australia. I notice that the preferential duty on bananas is Is. 6d., and the , general duty 2s. I suppose that British Crown Colonies also get the benefit of the preferential Tariff.",33
92,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,That preference was given with the idea that it might be possible to arrange a reciprocal Tariff with other parts of the Empire.,33
93,Mr LAZZARINI,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"This means that - - bananas grown 'in other parts of the for Empire by black labour can be imported a Tariff too low to give protection a to bananas grown in Australia by white labour. The preference is given to the Kingdom, and as no bananas are grown there the preferential duty on that f r u it should be struck out. Amongst other items to which I object is the high duty on cotton hosiery. The quantity of this article-manufactured in Australia today is comparatively insignificant; I do not think it is sufficient to supply wants of the community for a week. By requiring the .consumers, most of whom are amongst the working classes, to pay a 40 per cent, duty on this article we are giving an opportunity to some manufacturer in one corner of the Commonwealth to get rich quickly. The principle is altogether wrong.  of other articles in the schedule.",33
94,Mr LAZZARINI,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It does apply to other articles, and I shall vote against them. We are simply allowing a couple of Australian manufacturers to follow the principle, which has invariably been adopted by the Australian manufacturers, of getting rich quickly. These duties are too high, and they play into the hands of those gentlemen. My experience is that the textile manufacturers have not used the Tariff for the purpose for which we were told it was instituted, namely, to build up industries in this country, but rather as a means of rapidly increasing their own wealth. They should be made to understand that if they continue that policy the protection will be withdrawn. Of course, I know that the duties will not be reduced, because the national exchequer is empty. The Government are uot sufficiently courageous to go to the sources that should be exploited when they want revenue; instead of tapping the accumulated wealth of the nation, as they should in a time like the present, they impose what ismainly a revenue Tariff. For that reason I shall oppose many of the items on the schedule.",34
95,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Dampier) [4.46] The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Eobert Best) spoke of the necessity for the creation of' a Board to report in connection with Tariff matters, and he referred to the system adopted in the United States of America Congress, where Committees deal with the Tariff, but we have heard no protest in regard to the manner in which this Tariff schedule has been prepared. It involves an enormous tax upon the people, and surely we are justified in asking whose conception it is. We are satisfied as to the integrity of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), but we have reason to doubt his inexperience. The In ter-State Commission travelled throughthe out the Commonwealthand took evidence over a period of many months, but the reiommsnnlations of that body have never been taken into consideration.",34
96,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,They were considered in regard to every item on which the Commission reported.,34
97,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"If they were considered, at anyrate, effect was not given to them.",34
98,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"For very good reasons, which I shall state when - the individual items are reached.",34
99,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"If the Minister can show good reason for the proposed ad valorem duty on copper, in face of the recommendations of the Commission, he will be a very clever man indeed, particularly if he can convince us that that duty is in the interest of Australia.' I ascribe that duty and others to the Minister's inexperience.",34
100,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I think I can justfy it.,34
101,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The Minister will have a difficulty in justifying an ad valorem duty of 45 per cent, on copper when the Commission - recommended a bonus of £3 'per ton. Recently the price of copper was £160 per, ton, and honourable members will realise what an ad valorem duty of 45 per cent, .would mean. It is time that Parliament took some action in these matters. During the 1917 election campaign the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) saidWe propose to deal with the Tariff in the same way as does almost every other civilized country in the world. It must no longer he the tool of parties. . . Its proper and reasonable adjustment should be suggested by experts who are absolutely disinterestednot by a Board of Trade composed of manufacturers and others who are interestedand with due and proper regard to all the interests concerned. The late Lord Forrest, speaking during the same campaign, saidThe Tariff is an important and practical question, and must be dealt with on broad and national lines. I think that in the past we have, to a large extent, been groping in the dark, having as our guides on this question very often partisans and enthusiasts. The Liberal party proposes to have a permanent Board to study continually production and trade, and to advise Parliament upon .the matter. When complaints were made in regard to the Tariff, and when reference was made by members of the Country party to the many grave anomalies contained in it , they were immediately made the subject of all sorts of imputations, and were branded as a "" foreign "" party. Tn this connection I shall call attention to a paragraph which appeared in the Age a little while ago. The Chamber of Mines of ' Western Australia had prepared a great deal of information in connection with the effect the Tariff was likely to have upon the mining industry, and prior to the recent by-election campaign in the Kalgoorlie division they asked me to look after their interests in this House. 1 brought this request under the notice of my fellow members of the Country party, and they then asked me to represent their interests in the House, and specialize upon the effect the Tariff was likely to have upon the primary^ producers of Australia. In these circumstances, if any representations had been made to the Country party, or to those opposed to the protective nature of. the Tariff, I would be likely to hear of them. I would certainly have had some knowledge of any funds which had been collected for the purpose of influencing members of Parliament. The article in the Age to which I have referred appeared on the 27th February. In my opinion, it emanated from the editor of the Industrial Australian and Mining Standard. pointed out that no one would be surprised to learn of the creation of a huge Free Trade f u n d , which would probably - ^ £150,000, and that the money would be used for the purpose of rendering nugatory the schedule of duties brought down by the Minister. The veiled insinuation was that this huge sum of money was to be used improperly. I ask the Minister (Mr Greene) to institute an inquiry into the funds collected by any party interested in this Tariff, in order to ascertain how they have been spent. Here is one letter circulated in Sydney in connection with the Australian Industrial Protection League, drawing attention to the necessity for fundsI t is confidently hoped that you will respond to the appeal now being made for funds, in a manner not only commensurate with the present magnitude of your business, but with that which you hope to extend it to in the near future. On the other side of the sheet is a list of New South Wales manufacturers who have contributed large sums of money in connection with the propaganda work of the league. I shall not read out their names, but I would be only too pleased if the inquiry I suggest were undertaken in order to ascertain how the money collected for any party, Free Trade, Country, or otherwise, has been utilized.",34
102,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I have had none of it .,35
103,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It is not likely that any of the money would go to the honourable member, or to myself, or, indeed, to any honourable member of this Parliament; but it might be utilized by blackmailers who pretend that it does reach the pockets of honourable members. The Country party has not declared itself to be a Free Trade party. At the same time, it is hopeful that many of its requests for the free entry of goods will find support from honourable members on the other side of the chamber particularly, and if it can be proved that the protection asked for is not required for the purpose of developing an industry, but will merely serve to build up a monopoly, I very much doubt whether honourable members opposite would dareto vote for increased duties in such circumstances. The Industrial Australian and Minin g It Standard of the 14th A p r i l contains a very bitter and dirty attack on the Countrv ' party. The members of campaign that party have always realized what total the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) says, namely, that the industries of a country must be interdependent, and they are prepared to contribute towards the development of other industries; but while they are willin g that other industries should be created, they do not, want to be robbed by assisting in the establishment of a monopoly. All ' they ask for is a f a ir deal all round, and that they should get the same consideration as is given to any other section of the community.  worse form of monopoly, one formed through Protection or one established through Free Trade?",35
104,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It would be a grave mistake for Australia to .have absolute Free Trade and let the people of other countries manufacture the goods we require, while not contributing 6d. towards the cost of the government of our country. It would be foolish to ask for the adoption of such a policy. In 1894, when the honourable member for Kooyong was president' of the Protectionist Association in Victoria, he saidThe greatest an jury which has been done to the Protectionist cause in this country has been the ravings of the prohibitionists. I remember the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) saying that thei'e were enough people in Australia to .manufacture all the machinery required i u Australia - doubtles s foreign.",36
105,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I said that if we were to manufacture all our own requirements, we would not have enough people here to do so, but would .need to get workers from other parts of the world to help us.",36
106,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The honourable member is a prohibitionist, who would put a wall of China around this country and prevent the importation of goods from any other country.",36
107,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,""" Australia first"" is my policy all the time.",36
108,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Some people do uot, recognise that they are killin g the goose that lays the golden egg. B y error, we often destroy instead of building up. Referring to the Country party, the IndustrialAustralian and Mining Standard saysand one grain of honesty would compel the party to name itself outright the Foreign Country party. . . . As . . . As if to accentuate its treason, this miscalled party has the audacity to posture as the mouthpiece of the farmers of Australia. In their opening speeches the Free Traders boldly claimed authority to speak for and on behalf of .our primary producers; and thus they insidiously maligned scores of thousands of men and women whose patriotism has no flaw. There are, of course, individual Cobdenists to be found in every country district in Australia. It is no less true, however, that the vast bulk of our farmers are sincere Protectionists. To suppose otherwise, indeed, would be to insult most outrageously and undeservedly the intelligence of our rural population. The Foreign Country party, therefore, merits universal obloquy for. its mean attempt to make it appear that it has for partners in its anti-Australianism that huge body of splendid citizens who, ever since Federation, had voted more and more strongly for Protection at every successive election,! and who during the war proved their patriotism so magnificently on the battlefields of Europe. . . . But it is too late in the day for such shallow but malignant methods to succeed. Ours are evidently shallow and malignant efforts because we dare to question the schedule brought down to this chamber. Let me point out that this Parliament has - not given detailed cpnsideration to any Tarif f since 1908. The article continues^We dare to prophesy that the Foreign Country party will machinate in vain against the Tariff. It has already shown us that it is possessed of limitless effrontery. We are informed that it is supported by a secret organization endowed with enormous fighting funds I have already quoted the Age paragraph which declared that a sum of £150,000 had been collected by the Free Trade party. The Industrial Australian and M in i ng Standard now says- We also hear that it will be assisted in {he campaign by professional foreign lobbyists of great experience and*monumental astuteness. In other words, we are said to be receiving money from outside organizations for the purpose of helping to build up foreign industriesBut all these combined forces will strike harmlessly on a Tariff which accurately images the honesty of purpose and common sense of the Australian people. This article is just on the verge of being libellous,, but I protest against the grave insinuations cast upon honourable members who dare to question in the slightest * degree the schedule of duties submitted by the Minister.",36
109,Mr GUEENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I do not claim that the schedule is perfect. I merely stand for the principle which it reflects. >,36
110,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I am afrai d it reflects a want of principle, and for that reason I propose to fight it . In regard to the suggestions in the press that i m moral and illegal methods have been adopted in order to secure T a r if f reform, here is an article which appeared in the Age in regard to the duty on explosives., . which I propose to fight very hard to have removedThe union, besides arranging to make representations to Parliament, has decided to urge coal miners and other workers who are the principal users of explosives' to refuse to handle any but Australian-made explosives. The insinuation is that the union should endeavour to have all explosives other than those made in Australia declared "" M a c k "" by the various miners throughone out the Commonwealth. If we are be threatened with such action, the Minister ought to take a hand in cause the matter. The Minister has told us that the investigations made by who the Inter-State Commission had been our given serious consideration in the framing of the Tariff. In this regard, I want to get to "" h o l t s "" with h The Commissioners made no recommenWhilst dation for the imposition of a duty on now explosives. The following evidence was given before them by Mr G-. A . Evans, the manager of the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company, Deer Park:It might. naturally occur to the Commisthe sioners that the imposition of a duty on ported explosives might receive their conopposing sideration df asked. We recognise at once the labour hopelessness and the impropriety of making a proportion such a request. Apart from the Government coloured labour.of But Cordite Factory, we' are the only manufacone in which the decision turers of nitro-glycerine and nitro-glycerine plosives generally in the Commonwealth. On the other hand, we have a languishing mining industry .which could not stand, and would not stand, the increased prices for explosives the imposition of.a duty would entail. He recognised not only the hopelessness, by but' also the impropriety, of submitting request for the imposition of a duty on imported explosives. The Coal Miners Union, the Australian Coal and Shale sent form. Employees Federation, the members which provide their own explosives, are, therefore, interested in this matter, hearing of the duty, sent the following South A f r i c a . protest against it to the Minister. Their letter is signed by the president, vicepresident, and secretary of the federatiju. They sayAs the miner has to purchase the it will affect him, and not the coal-owners. sequently the miner is not disposed to bear the increase. We may state that explosives fuse have increased in some instances since 1914 fully 120 per cent., and the wages of miner have only increased onan average per cent. You will, therefore, understand, the first place, why we resent any further increase on explosives. We recognise the Government's policy to encourage and protect industry, to which we agree, subject, of to the burden being shouldered by the munity; but in this case the miner is asked to carry the burden. We raise no objection to testing stations being erected, or against manufacture of explosives in this Commonmembers wealth, but we regard it as quite improper to has suffered of late years. prevent outside competition, when we have not got suitable explosives at a reasonable price. Our.coal seams in all States of the Commonwealth vary. An explosive that is suitable in mine may not suit another in view of the to nature of the seam. Another point we desire to impress is the fact that if the Tariff is accepted, it will be regarded as a prohibitive and obviate competition, in which the miner will be left to the explosive combine, would have a monopoly, and, in support of contention, we refer you to the findings of the Inter-State Commission, Tariff investigation, miscellaneous groups No. 7. i m straight way. They say furtherthe interests of enemy ownership may have disappeared, the combination known as the High Explosive Trade Association remains, and it must be obvious from the evidence taken in this investigation that any Tariff encouragement which will tend to benefit and strengthen their monopoly must be accompanied by corresponding loss and injury to Australian mining industry. The lever imwhich has been used up to the present time in the extension of British preference of 5 per cent, to South Africa is the "" black "" question. It w.«uld appear that only the labour employed is even so, the question is should be guided by exthe best interests of Australian industry. We want cheap explosives for the purpose of developing our mineral resources, and also desire to extend a preference to every bona 'fidswhich industry conducted in the United Kingdom. If, however, such preference, as it appears lo have been in the present ease, has been utilized means of a Combine for the purpose of una duly inflating prices to thu advantage of an Australian industry, then there appears to be no justification for its continuance in its preof There was a Combine formed by Nobel and of Hamburg, and Nobel of Glasgow, and we then started to get explosives from",36
111,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Canno t the honourable member deal with these matters when we come to the particular item? Otherwise he will have to repeat then everyexplosives, thing that he says now. Con- - Mr GREGORY - I am afraid that a and combination of circumstances will enable the Minister to have his own way in rethe gard to the schedule, though I hope that 39£ he may compromise a little, realizing in bhat many of the duties are excessive, .and likely to prejudice the primary prolocal ducers. My object in speaking now is to course, inform the residents of every pastoral, comfarming, and mining district of what the Government are doing by this Tariff to the destroy the primary industries. Honourable know how the mining industry Mine after mine has been closed, and hundreds and thousands of persons have lost their employment. Railways which previously were worked at a profit are now being worked at a loss, and the country has suffered an enormous diminution of wealth and revenue. Therefore, we should not put an impost, on any of the requirements of the mining industry unless f u l ly satisfied that it can bear it .",37
112,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,How much farmers pay annually for explosives ?,38
113,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The farmer is not interested in this matter to anything like the same extent as the miner, although a large quantity of explosives is used in clearing heavily-timbered country and in other agricultural operations. My desire is to do all I can for our primary industries and render reasonable assistance for our secondary industries, I have here samples of paper made in Western Australia of wood pulp from Australian timber, the trees used being the silky oak of Queensland, the mountain gum of New South Wales, the mountain ash of Victoria, and the karri of Western Australia. These samples are of bleached and unbleached paper, and are of first class quality. They were made in a laboratory, but they show what can be done.",38
114,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Would you put a duty on paper ? Mr GREGORY.^-That depends. would sooner see a bonus given, so that every person in the - community would have to contribute his share.",38
115,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The samples referred to were made by the Bureau of Science and Industry ?,38
116,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Yes , in its Perth laboratory. The paper is 100 per cent, wood pulp. At first, only silky oak fibre could be used without the addition of other substances, varying percentages of rag pulp being used in connection with wood pulp; but the fourteen or fifteen samples which I have here were made wholly of wood pulp.",38
117,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Do you not think that we should encourage the industry?,38
118,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Decidedly . It may become a big industry, and, I think, should be encouraged by a bonus, and by assisting those interesting themselves in it to obtain the necessary machinery. At present, howover, the process is merely at the laboratory stage. The Western Australian Chamber of Mines has pointed out that the proposed duty on explosives will increase the expenditure on the mines of Western Australia by £23,162 annually. This is whatt it saysOn the present price of explosives the duty to be imposed on1st January, 1922, will tax the gold mining industry of Western Australia to the extent of £23,162 annually. This calculation is based on the tonnage treated in 1914, the last year when it may be said the industry was working under normal conditions. The do the imposition of this tax was strongly resented by all connected with the gold mining industry. No compensating advantage can accrue to Western Australia in any shape or form, and it is clearly understood that the object of its imposition is merely to create a breach of the Explosives Combine in Western Australia, who will operate somewhere, in the Eastern States, employ a small amount of labour, principally junior and female, and find directors' fees for a local. board whose duties will be nominal. For this trifling advantage to one of the too. Eastern States, although the benefits to a few individuals may be considerable, the gold mining industry of Western Australia is to be taxed to the extent of over £20,000 a year. The impost probably means, in many cases, the difference between profit and loss. I feel sure thab we shall be able to show, when we come to the item itself, that the Minister was ill-advised in proposing this duty on explosives. I have a complaint from the Chamber of Mines that while the war was in progress gelignite of a low grade was being supplied, and that when representation I on the subject was made to the Imperial Government, a higher grade of explosive - was sent out; but when it came to hand the Commonwealth Government refused to allow it to be used. This is what the Chamber of Mines says on the subjectDuring the war the Imperial Government did everything possible to maintain the supply, and when representations were made to it to the effect that the grade supply was not economical in use, it immediately shipped the required quantity of higher grade. But this offended the Commonwealth authorities, and they actually forbade its use, and insisted on its remaining in the magazines during many months, where it naturally deteriorated, despite all appeals made to them to allow it to be used, and so increase production.",38
119,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I know nothing of the matter; but I doubt whether the Commonwealth Government had anything to do with it ,",38
120,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I have a high respect for the Minister's integrity; but gravely doubt his wisdom in adopting this schedule. He told us that he believed that it would prove satisfactory to the manufacturers of Australia. If it is not considered satisfactory by them, the only thing that would give them' satisfaction would be a wall like the Great Wall of China, shutting us in entirely, with an absolute prohibition against importation. Honourable members mUst bear in mind that imports have not only to pay the high duties imposed by this Tariff , but also freights,, insurance, and handling charges, which constitute a natural protection to local manufacturers of anything from 20 to 100 per cent.",38
121,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Does the honourable member believe that?,39
122,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I can give the M i nister many instances. A circular'from the Auto Club, which was sent to honourable members today, mentions a case in which the Protection thus given amounts to 100 per cent. Why should such a duty be imposed? A r e not motor cars and motor trucks largely used ? A r e not traction engines necessary in primary industries, and do we not want to reduce as much as possible the cost of production? We certainly desire to build up industries in Australia;, but we should' build them up by fair and honest means. I shall quote later on figures showing the natural protection which the manufacturers of machinery receive in addition to the protection afforded them under this - Tariff. The party of which I am a member has never asked for Free Trade; b ut we are justified in urging that industries in Australia shall be so built up that they maybe self-supporting and self-reliant. When the 1908 Tariff was submitted, the Protectionist's were fairly well satisfied. In 19l4 a Tariff which gave to our manufacturers a much higher protection was introduced and carried, and we now have this further increase of duties proposed. Are we going in this way to make our manufacturers more self-reliant , than they have Been? I have a profound belief in the Australian workman. We know him to be assertive and self-reliant. He is usually possessed of sound judgment. He has more than the average intelligence, and all that he needs to make him the master tradesman of the world is good, sound, technical training. If we destroy competition, and lead the workers to believe that in each and every circumstance the Government are prepared to build up a huge Tariff wall, we shall destroy that individuality and personality, as well as that trait of originality, which during the late war won for our people their claim for nationhood. There is no doubt that if the Australian, workman is led to believe that he must rely upon his own resources-if our manufacturers and our workers are taught to realise bhat it is only by reason of their work, and the metheds they employ in building up their industries}, that they can hope to secure success-w e shall have . great industries established in Australia. But if we induce them to believe that Parliament is prepared, year after year, to build the Tariff wall higher and higher, our secondary industries wiU never be successful. Our party desires fair conditions for every class. Competition, however, is the very life and soul of progress, and rivalry that is subject to fair conditions must conduce to self-preservation and national efficiency. If , on the other hand, we destroy competition and honest rivalry, we shall destroy the individuality of our people, and tend to make them careless, effete, and impotent. In the speech which he made when in troducing the Tariff, the Minister for Trade, and Customs seemed to have, more concern for the interests of the manufacturer than for those of the worker. He certainly said that he regretted the refusal of .the people of the Commonwealth to grant us wider constitutional powersH e wanted them, he said, to give this Parliament greater eonstitutional powers so that he might bring in a more scientific Tariff, and one that would enable him, to use his own words, to give the workers in all industries their full share of the benefits of Protection. Was that a mere political sop., or did the Minister honestly believe in what he said ? Has he any desire £o bring in what he terms a more scientific Tariff, which will give .the workers in all industries their full share of the benefits of Protection ? The honourable gentleman did not tell us whether or not he favoured the so-called New Protection. In no othes way of which I can conceive could the Minister give the worSers the full benefit of these duties.",39
123,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Is that .an admission on the part of the honourable member that the workers would get - the full benefits of these duties under the policy of New Protection?,39
124,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"No. . I think that all restrictions of the kind make more difficult the position of the worker. In every instance where Parliament interferes in matters of this kind, the conditions of the . people are made 'worse instead of better. The Minister might very well tell us whether he is in favour of the New Protection. And, since *he has spoken of a desire to give all workers the benefit of these high protective duties, will he be good enough to show us what provision is made in the Tariff to give the dairy farmer, the potato grower, - the onion grower, the miner, and the general farmer their full share of the benefits?",39
125,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"it is a very simple proposition, and I will try to tell the honourable member later on, if he does not know already, how that can be done.",40
126,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,We have heard many statemeuts of the kind. . Mr MASSYGREENE - I say that the primary producer reaps more benefit from the Tariff than any other section of the community. That is why I believe in it.,40
127,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Our view 6*f the Minister's contention is that it is absurd. The honourable gentleman says that he wants to give the full benefit of Protection to all the workers, and the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), in discussing this subject, said he wanted no cheap labour. May I ask whether, in connection with the agricultural industry of New South Wales, either the Minister or the honourable member for West Sydney, during the last few years, did nothing to secure for the labourer in that industry something like value for the labour he put into his farm? Was any attempt made by either of them to see that the farmers in New South Wales got something like a fair return for their. labour ?",40
128,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Yes , they got good prices. The Government is always spoon-feeding them.",40
129,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Le t me . quote a few figures. In 1916, the farmers of New South Wales put under wheat 4,188,865 acres, for which they received a return of £12,382,000, or approximately £3 per acre. In 1917, they put under wheat 3,806,604 acres, and received a return of £5,002,000, or an average of £1 6s. per acre. Did that pay them? In 1918, they put under cultivation 3,329,371 a«res, for which they received a return of £6,080,000, or £1 16s. per acre. In 1919, they put under wheat 3,409,669 acres, and received in return £2,934,000, or £1 4s. per acre. I invite the special attention of honourable members to thesefigures,in view of the assertion made this afternoon by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) that production in Australia is increasing. In 1920, farmers in New South Wales put 1,450,540 acres under wheat, and received a return of £139,000, or less than 2s. per acre. Was there any effort on the part of the Minister to see that those people received something like a fair return for their labour? I question it. The Minister, , especially when framing his Tariff, failed to consider the interests of the farmers. No Tariff schedule hitherto introduced in this Parliament, has affected the worker so heavily as does that now under consideration. The Tariff of 1914 made a very big increase in the cost of all clothing to the worker; but this Tariff has made an exceptional increase in the cost of all his requirements. The Minister went out of his way to' point out 'that increased duties were imposed on such things as soaps, potted meats, pickles, confectionery, sauces, and such like commodities. He might very well have said, when introducing the Tariff, that on everything that the worker wears, and indeed needs, he was imposing heavy duties. At a time when prices were soaring, this huge Tariff wall was made even higher; but the honourable gentleman gave the Parliamentand the country the comforting assurance that a reduction was being made in the Excise duties on brandy and whisky!",40
130,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Does not the honourable member think it better to put a duty on pickles, and so encourage the production of pickles made from Australian-grown products, than to encourage the introduction ef such commodities from abroad ?'",40
131,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It was simply a question of increasing the duties, and giving to those who were in these industries even greater profits than they were enjoying.",40
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,That does not answer my question.,40
133,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I shall answer the honourable gentleman's question by putting another to him. Will he tell the Committee why, when by the imposition of the import duties he increased the cost of all those things which the worker re- . quires, he reduced the Excise duty on brandy and whisky? The reduction was' not sought, nor was it expected. It was a most extraordinary and unfair action to take.",40
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"When I reply I shall deal with that matter, and show that primary producers have far more to gain las the result of - that action than have any other section of the community. The reduction was made in the interests of the vignerons of this country. ' Mr GREGORY - Then I am afraid that the distillers alone will benefit by it Tho honourable gentleman, when giving encouragement to our manufacturers,' has never made the least effort to see that thab which they produce shall go to the public by the cheapest possible means. He knows perfectly well that there are many Combines in Australia. | He knows thab there are manufacturers here who will not sell direct to the retailer, but in sist upon all their goods reaching him through the Flinders-lane warehousemen.",41
135,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The honourable member knows thab we have no constitutional power to deal with thab matter.,41
136,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,During the war the Government had full power to deal with all such matters. In many instances they exercised a far greater power. Mr . GREENE - And we never attempted to exercise ib without opposition on your part.,41
137,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Will the Minister tel l us how he dares to insist, or why he insists, on all metals going oub of this country being sold through a member of the Metal Exchange?",41
138,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Tha b is nob so; the honourable member is wrong. Mr . GREGORY - The Minister must 'know thab that has been done withi n the past few days. Where does, the Minister - get the power bo do ib?",41
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Addres s that question to the Attorney-General?,41
140,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I shall not ; it was done through the Customs Department under the Commerce Act . I have for a long time been fighting against these 'embargoes. When I inquired about them at the Customs Department, I found they were'in charge of the Attorney-General's Department. Attorney-General's Department that we are to find the expert on mining who - advises whether or not an embargo shall 'be placed on metals?",41
141,Mr JAMES PAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"You had a chance to.alter that the other day, but you nob do so.",41
142,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The Tesulb would I have been too a w f u l !,41
143,Mr JAMES PAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"That is - jusb the point-: it is the Labour party you have a "" set "" on.",41
144,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Le t us get back to the question. We ought to have been bold by the Government whether this Tariff was intended to be a protectionist or a revenue Tariff.,41
145,Mr JAMES PAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I bhink it is both.,41
146,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It ' is mainly a revenue Tariff, and we have'as a result of Government interference the facb that mining is destroyed, and the pastoral industry will have a wretched market. I do not like to appear as a pessimist, bub I do nob think we are going to get good prices for our primary products for many years.  orable member wishes to send more money out of the country in order to buy overseas !",41
147,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"How ar© we going to send our products oub of bhis country ? Will ships come specially to take ib away for us ? Have farmers to produce simply for the purpose of keeping th© city people of Australia fed ? ' How long will the farmer take all the risks of production to enable city dwellers to live in conditions superior to his own ? The result can only be a cessation of production, wibh the consequent unemployment and destitution. The Minister appears to> have been given instructions to introduce a Tariff that would bring in revenue; and, so far as I can judge, the reports of the Tariff Commission have been almost wholly ignored - ThiB is a departmenbal Tariff, and undoubtedly a revenue Tariff, while at the same time, the Minister has made himself "" all r i g h t "" with the.big manufacturers-and damn the rest!",41
148,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I b is a .libtle difficulb to Understand how a Tariff can suit the manufacturers, and at the same time bo a revenue Tariff.",41
149,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,It has become a revenue Tariff. I suppose the Minister Is ib in the was advised of the enormous orders bhat have been sent Home and of the large quantities of goods on the way here.,41
150,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The honourable member is getting a b it mixed, is he not ?",41
151,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I bhink the Minister did must have been very much "" m i x e d "" when he prepared this schedule.",41
152,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It seemB a libtle mixed when the honourable member suggests bhat this is a revenue Tariff, and, at the same time, a manufacturer's Tariff.",41
153,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Not necessarily. thin k it could be shown that large revenue is 'received on many textile goods that cannot be made in this country. ; Mr GKKE'NE - Perhaps the honourable member, would like the land tax in ",42
154,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Is that a threat to facilitate the passing of the schedule? The Minister' has tried to help the big monopolists; and I do not call this a Protectionist T a r i ff in the true sense at^all. The duties on iron, steel, and copper are merely placed on the schedule for - the purpose of aiding one or two monopolist, concerns, and the cost of everything required in general mamif acture will be in creased. The Government are building up the big concerns, and giving little assistance to the small ones. In the matter of soap, surely we all know the enormous profits made by. the manufacturers of that commodity, not only, in the Old Country, hut in Australia. However, I shall not weary the lioupe hy dealing with these matters^ but will quote the following, communication which appeared in the Australian Motorist:Borne months ago motor-body builders asked fbr a section under the banner of the Chamber of,.Automotive Industries (formerly the Motor Traders' Association .of Victoria,). Evidently the rule's of the Chamber of Automotive Industries, which prevent price fixing, did not meet the.. approval of many bodybuilders, who. formed - an association under the banner of, the Victorian - Autoinebile Chamber of Commerce., (formerly - the Retail Motor Dialers' Association). The members have now drawn lip a.schedule of prices to be charged for motor boiliSs, and. the figures are interesting. The. Australian, Motorist is always.' suspiciousof combinations of traders who fix prices, because,.as a rule, the.consumer suffers, and in this case the motor importer, as well as the consumer, runs a good chance of having a pistol placed at his bead. Nninformation is; available concerning the names of members of this new combine, but it should be fought before it can take root. There is a prohibitive duty on motor bodies, and if this combine becomes firmly established, then the car importer nnd consumer will be the nut in the jawsof the cracker. Tinder this precious combination the price.of a Ford bod; is to be £165, or £100 if six bodies are ordered at one time. Before the body embargo, the imported Ford body was invoiced at £15, so our readers can realise the "" slugging up "" process-, planned, .now that the Goverrfmcnt has-given the. Australian motorrbody builder a monopoly. Then, in the'Industrial Australian,'page 690, there is the following:I Out of the fierce competition of the Chamber of Automotive Industries of Australia (formerly the Motor Traders' Association), and the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce (formerly - the .Retail Motor Dealers Association), some sparks are being struck that will entertain the motor-buying public. On behalf of "" automotive industries,"" it is alleged that the Automobile Chamber of Commerce has allied with the body-builders, and 1 has encouraged the latter to combine and fix prices *t an extraordinarily high, figure. The price of Ford bodies, it is alleged, has been fixed at £165, or £160 if six bodies are ordered at one time', and this is contrasted with the fact that before the embargo was placed on imported bodies the Ford body was invoiced at £15. Further revelations are awaited with interest. It is strange that these occurrences are n ot watched by the Government, for they show how combines are built up. Is this ; to be the result of the T a r i ff ? A r e we toimpose these enormous duties merely fortius purpose of creating one OT twogreat monopolies, and enabling certain conditions to be given to the city workers that cannot be given. to workers generally throughout Australia? It is apparently outside the knowledge Of the Ministerfbr Trade and Customs how. the hindertwine industry is handled in this country and a monopoly has been created. Then, again, the position of the cigar in dustry has bfeeii ventilated a good deal of late in the newspapers. In . this eon-' nexion, a deputation of cigar manufacturers waited On the Minister, Who wassympathetic, aiid favourably considered adecrease in the Excise' duties'. Mr GREENS: - I am sympathetic with everybody who-comes to se6 me; including the honourable member himself.",42
155,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The Mudster has always.been fair to me; hut in the case of the cigar manufacturershe showed hissympathy by his action in making theconditions better for them. It is said, that all the tobacco used in the manufacture of these cigars comes from a black-labour country;",42
156,Mr JAME SPAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Not all.,42
157,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I do hot think any Australian tobacco is used in the m a n u facture of cigars.,42
158,Mr JAMES PAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Yes , quite a lot.",42
159,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Then , only smokers like the honourable member himself must smoke the cigars, for I am sure no one with a weak stomach could. monopolies are being created rn the cigar trade; and m y great point is that the Tariff will ; to a great extent, induce people to. leave their country homes for the cities. We know the danger of this city concentration; and there is no doubt that such action as that taken in the case of the cigar industry will mean an extraordinar y state of affairs. The other day I asked some questions in connection with the cigar industry, and I should say there would have been little difficulty in supplying me with departmental figures. However, I understand that at the 30th June,, 1920, there were 733,328 Ibe. of cigarj heing made in this country, with a duty on the leaf of 2s. 6d., Excise 2s - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN 8d., and an actual Tevenue received of £153,759.. If those cigars had heen i m ported, on a duty of 12s.,, the revenue collected would ""have amounted to £439,996; in other words, a special bonus of £296,237 is given to a few people engaged here in making cigars - As a writer in the press has pointed out, we could alford to pension all those employed in the in dustry, and then show a better financial position. Is this the sort of industry we propose to build up, with a view to developing the country?. Sir GRANVILLERYRIE . ' - A r e . you favour of having no duty on cigars and .tobacco ?",42
160,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I desire that there shall be a duty in order to produce ret venue. I approved of the action of the Government in September, when they creased the duties on wines, spirits, cigars. This is the time when we ought to' raise money; and every person who afford luxuries ought tQ be taxed on luxuries. That is why I object to the Minister reducing the Excise on brandy and whisky, although he later increased both duties and Excise,, leaving a margin of Is. still to the advantage of the tiller. I object to special concessions the Tobacco Combine of Australia, which consist of a few manufacturers; who, w two imported machines, which worked by a few boys and girls, turn out huge quantities of cigarB. I desired figures from the Minister the other in order to ascertain the enormous profits which these people are making out of public of Australia. The duty on every However,, item of children's clothing has been, in creased; yet at the same time, bigger Protection, is being given to the local woollen mills. I would like to see those mills increase; but did the companies play the game during the war? Regardless of whether or not the Government were responsible for fixing prices, it was simply monstrous that an industry with a capital of a little over £1,000,000 should, in a littl e under three years, make profits exceeding that capital. The. local manufacturers took every advantage of the market,",43
161,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,So did the importer.,43
162,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"But we are not subsidizing the importers by the imposition of high duties. - What does the , honourable member propose in regard to motor bodies ?",43
163,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I would he prepared to place a reasonable duty upon them.. But is £ 1 6 5 a fair price today for a motor body which, before the embargoon . imports, was selling at . £ 1 5 in* America?",43
164,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,We should Doable to make all of the bodies we require-.,43
165,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Yes ; and in Adelaide there is a magnificent factory operating on a large scale. The manager told in me that he waa exporting motor bodies to Singapore, and I believe thab when this establishment gets properly going, it will be able to supply a good deal of Australia's requirements. But if there is r u t h in the statement that has been made in regard to the existence of a comi n - bine amongsb the manufacturers and and those who sell motor cars to f ix huge prices so that bigger commissions and can profits may be made, we must put our those foot down so that the people may get a fair deal. ' We know perfectly well that 70 per cent, or 80 ""per oent. of the motor cars imported int o Australia are intended for the development of the country. We need to extend motor transport; and a dislarge proportion of the work on the to farms ought to be done by motor power. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - We ought to i th be able to make motor bodies in compecan he tition with the world.",43
166,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"We should be able to do so. If I were once satisfied that day, there existed a combination on the. part of manufacturers to regulate the price of the their products, I would remove the duty at once. When these people put their heads together to make huge profits with the aid of the Protection which Parliament gives them in order to foster their industry, they become parasites on the rest of the community, and their whole business is immoral. I would make it a criminal offence for manufacturers or salesmen in combination to fix the selling price of their articles. - Mr BEI* - What about wheat?",43
167,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I say the same of the - producers of wheat. But the farmers have never asked for a combine of that sort. These "" gentlemanly agreements "" by which the selling price of an article is fixed should be made a criminal offence. Moreover, there is not ay item in the Tariff that should continue to receive protection for a single day if the manufacturers will not agree to sell their goods direct to the retailers. We know what happens in the boot trade, for instance. A pair of boots is produced at the factory for, say, 14s. or 15s. They are then' sent into Flinders-lane, and from the warehouse they are sold to the retailer at an advance. There are about 50 per cent, too many boot shops in Melbourne and Sydney, and they have to hiaxe a profit of about 50per cent, in order-to keep going. The consequence is that a pair of boots manufactured for 15s. is retailed at 30s. or 32s.",44
168,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The honourable member's objection applies equally to all imported goods. We cannot discriminate. The same conditions are found to an even greater extent amongst the importers. Mr GREGORY.7-rWhen I was in business in Yictoria, about thirty years ago, I was' able to indent goods direct from. England. The agents of English houses used to call upon me and other business men throughout the country, and we could indent our requirements direct from the manufacturer.",44
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,A great many of the manufacturers whose goods are imported into Australia will not sell except to their duly-appointed agents.,44
170,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,There are other firms that are only too glad to sell direct to the retailer - Mr MASSYGREENE.*-It is not so described by,44
171,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,A great many of the Australian manufacturers will directly to the retailers.,44
172,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Ver y few of them.,44
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I know quite a number of them who do that.,44
174,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,-Before I was interrupted I was speaking about the woollen industry. I have received from the Sydney Chamber of Commerce a letter in reference to blankets. The Minister was asked to make a special reduction in the duty on blankets in order to enable cheap blankets to be imported for the coming winter. He was reminded of the enormous increase in the price of blankets in Australia.,44
175,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The people who made that request knew perfectly well that it was not within my power to grant it . ' It was simply part of a campaign.,44
176,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I cannot understand the Minister saying that it was not within his power to grant the reguest, because if there is one thing against which we might reasonably protest it is the power that has been assumed by the Minister. I have been pointing out how the Tariff has increased the cost of living and clothing. Even the price of kiddies' foods has been increased. In 1914 a duty was imposed on Glaxo. In 1917 the Minister decidedthat Horlick's Malted Milk should no longer be allowed to enter free as an infant's food, although the Tariff distinctly and clearly states that infants' foods shall be admitted free of duty.",44
177,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Is the honourable member quite sure of that? Item 55 refers to ""Infants' and invalids' foods as prescribed by departmental by-laws."" That means that until I , by. Ministerial act, include a particular article amongst the infants' foods, it does not become an infants', - food, and is dutiable.",44
178,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Horlick's malted milk has been'-imported to Australia for many years, and hitherto had always been admitted as an infants'-food.",44
179,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,But the same power that put it amongst the infants' foods can take it out.,44
180,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Are we to understand from the Minister that Horlick's malted milk is no longer an infants' food ? departmental by-laws. Parliament has sell deliberately .put that power into the hands of the Minister.,44
181,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Apparently the Minister considers that this article, which is undoubtedly an infants' and invalids' food, should be dutiable in future.",44
182,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,This particular action was taken in the interests of the dairying industry.,45
183,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Not in the interests of the children? ,45
184,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Yes .,45
185,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Messrs . F in k, Best, and Miller, the lawyers for Horlick's, state, in a letterThe Minister and Comptroller have sought to justify the departmental action, but we were ultimately able to convince them that Horlick's was primarily and commercially an infants' food. Apparently the Minister was quite satisfied upon that, point at that time; hut when pressure was brought to bear upon him, and it was found by the Department that Horlick's malted m i l k was used, by some of the tea-rooms and shops, it was removed from the free list. The agents were advised by a representative, who made inquiries for themI am informed by the Department that, the refusal to place Horlick's malted milk on the free list is not' caused on account of their being dissatisfied with the analysis made, nor from the fact of its being used in shops, but' owing to the fact that Horlick's has been found to be exactly the same as a local product, and the decision of the Minister is that, any local product shall receive preference through the Tariff. Here is an infants' food prescribed by the medical faculty, but ' because the Minister is satisfied that similar foods are made in Australia the imported article is transferred to the dutiable list.'",45
186,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Is the honourable member satisfied with the duty on condensed milk, which is often prescribed as a food for infants?",45
187,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,We do not need that duty.,45
188,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,What I desire to know is whether the members of the Country party are Protectionists?,45
189,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"We aremoderate Protectionists; but we. are quits satisfied that the demand of some honourable members for Protection will extend u n t i l they get absolute prohibition. .Nothing short of that will satisfy them. The farmers aTe quite prepared to pay their share of Customs duties, but what hurts me is that whilst the worker believes that the Tariff is designed for his good, I do not think the poor devil was even thought of when the schedule was prepared. whole thing was drafted in favour of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, Port Kembla, Lysaght's, Hoskins, Dunlop, and MCKay. During the twelve months ended 31st March, the Customs revenue amounted to £32,074,408, representing an average of £ 6 3s. per head of the population. Thus a man with a wife and three children pays, during the year, Customs taxation amounting to £ 3 0 15s. But that is not all that the people pay. We must realise that the selling price includes, not only the indent price plus the duty, but also interest and profit on the capital involved. The people of Australia pay, in duties, £32,074,408. But as an importer, particularly in war time, when trade is disorganized, will ask for at least 20 per cent, upon his outlay in the payment of duties, we must add £6,414,881 to the amount which the Australian consumers are asked to pay upon imported goods, On top of this amount also must be added the retailers' profit, which I estimate at 33$ per cent. In other words, a further amount of £12,829,763 must be added to cover retailers' profits, so that actually the consumers pay, not £32,074,408, but £51,319,052. But that is not all the price, we pay for Protection. Despite what has been said by the Minister (Mr . Greene) and the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir RobertBest), every time the price of an imported article is in creased the price of the article locally manufactured is correspondingly . in creased.",45
190,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"If we' agree to drop that £32,000,000, in what way can we make good the shortage of revenue? By taxing land?",45
191,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"We would need to economize; but, as I said a l it t l e while ago, it is not my duty to point to avenues in which we could increase our revenue. I want a heavy duty on all luxuries, and I have always been a strong Bupporter of the proposal to impose a duty by means of a stamp or otherwise upon the person who cares to purchase expensive goods, and I can see no reason why there should not be .some revenue derived from an impost on tea. The total value of goods manufactured in Australia in 1918 was £225,000,000, and I estimate that at least £150,000,000 would be the value of The the goods protected by duties. And as the manufacturers' extra charge upon the people, owing to the operation of the protective Tariff, is at least 25 per cent., the consumers are called upon to .pay another £37,500,000 in the "" shape of local manufacturers' extra charges. Furthermore, we all know that a portion of the locally manufactaire'd goods passes through many hands before reaching the consumers. The product of the Denton Hat Mills and of hoot factories goss into Flinders-lane, and then from' Flinders-lane out to the retailers. The profit on an article .passing through so many hands in this way would amount to at least 50 per cent. I propose to allow not->more than 33 per cent.; but even that would cause the Australian consumers to pay at least another £25,000,000 in the shape of wholesale and retail profits on locally manufactured articles.. Thus I arrive at the. following figures:Customs duties collected, £32,074,408. Wholesale profits, £6,414,881. Eetail profits, £12,829,763; Local manufacturers' extra cVarge under Tariff, £37,500,000. Wholesale and retail profits factures, £25,000,000. Thus £113,500,000 is paid directly and. indirectly by a little 5,000,000 people. We are, no doubt, building 'up many important industries in this country, but we are being specially taxed, hy the imposition of duties, for the purpose of building up some wretched little industries to turn out articles for which the demand is so slight that it cannot possibly pay to make them here except at extortionate prices. Our Tariff hitsthe .consumers very hard, In Canada, in 1919, the Customs and Excise revenue was £ 4 9s. per head. Here we pay £ 6 -3s. per .head. In New Zealand, in the years 1917-18, the Customs and Excise revenue was £ 3 12s. per head. In the TJnited States, in 1919, the revenue from this source was £ 1 Is. 6d. per head. The Minister in his speech made frequent reference to the operation of the United States Tariff. It might be well for him to learn that agricultural machinery is allowed into the TJnited States of America free of duty.",45
192,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,That is beof cause they had already built up their dustries by good Protection.,46
193,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,But themanufacwill turers of agricultural implements in the United States of America have far more ing.' competition from Canada than have the manufacturers of other parts of the world. Dr'MALONEY - Would the honourable member be willing to accept the United States Tariff!,46
194,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Mr Knibbs, on page 616 of the 1919 Tear-Book mentions the proportion of free.goods to the total importations of Australia as compared with other countries. He shows that in 1919 the percentage of free goods imported into Australia was 38.30. The list of free goods has since been considerably reduced by the Tariff now before us. The percentage of free goods imported into Canada in the same year was 42.45; into New Zealand, 54.57; and into the United States of. America, 73.91. Thus, although the - United States of America have a Protective Tariff a far greater proportion of goods is admitted free to that country than is admitted here.",46
195,Mr CORSER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Because the United States of America, have built up large inon local manudustries on Protection;",46
196,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Bu * I have pointed out that agricultural machinery is adover mitted free. The American Government has realized more than has any other Government the necessity of building up agriculture. When the war started they voted £7,000,000 annually for the purpose of building roads, not only to increase settlement, but also to decrease the cost of living. They are spending enormous sums of money in establishing agricultural universities, and quite recently, in view of the decline in production, they have imposed import duties on agricultural and other primary products in order to give greater assistance tu the man on the land, If we told the workers of Australia that we were proposing to put a direct taxation on them of £6 3s. per head of the population we would have a revolution. We can tax. the worker's food, clothes, and boots, and there is no complaint in anv shape or form, because Protection is his fetish. He simply goes blindly along cursing the profiteer and the high cost living, and - with the most sublime inr faith awaits the Minister's promise to bring in a more scientific Tariff, which produce the happy millennium of short hours, high wages, and cheap liv",46
197,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,If he did not pay that £6 3s. he would lose it in the shape o£ wages.,47
198,Mr GEEGOEY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Prior to Federation the people of Victoria preached the policy of Protection, and adopted a high protective Tariff, whereas the people of New South Wales adopted a Free Trade policy. Which, colony made the tetter progress? Our statistics show that there never was graver destitution in Australia than occurred in Victoria ahout the year 1892, and for many years afterwards.",47
199,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Did the Protection policy cause it?,47
200,Mr GEEGOEY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,To a great extent it did.,47
201,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,No ; financial chicanery was the cause.,47
202,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Honourable members know of the destitution and awful conditions that prevailed in America for many years after the MCKinley Tariff came into force, and they also know that the result of that Tariff was the building up of huge monopolies, which I am satisfied the schedule now before us will also tend to create here. The Minister referred to the necessity for developing this great country - He spoke of our undeveloped resources, and said that we had not one-quarter developed our primary industries. I agree with him, and in dealing with this Tariff I consider that our first consideration should be the building up of our primary industries. We have 3,000,000 square miles of territory peopled by just over 5,000,000 persons. The TJnited States of America has 111,000,000 people in an area whioh is not so large as Australia. Our continent is fourteen times greatev than Germany, which has a population of 68,000,000. We have twenty-seven times the area of Italy, which has a population of 36,000,000. Australia has an area equal to two-fifths of the whole area of South America, yet there are 59,000,000 people in South America. It should be the ambition of every honourable member to try to build up industries here, which our population can support. Particularly every effort should be made to build up primary production.",47
203,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The first thing you ought to do is to give decent working conditions to the workers of this country.,47
204,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The honourable member forgets that the primary producer has to comply with the world's conditions. We certainly have better conditions than apply in other parts of the world, but our farmer, or pastoralist, has to sell his wheat or wool in the markets of the world. The price he gets is what he can get in the Old Country.",47
205,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Le t us turn our wheat into flour here and manufacture our own wool.,47
206,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"But others may not buy our flour. They will only buy our wheat. If they cannot get wheat from us they will buy it elsewhere. Which is the more progressive policy to adopt: that which will still further increase the drift of population from the country to the cities, or that which will give full and generous encouragement to the man on the land ? In Sydney there is now congregated about one-half of the population of New South Wales, as in Melbourne we have half the population »f Victoria. The produotion of our city populations bears no comparison with that of the country. Which, then, is the better policy, to give a subsidy paid for by the sweat of the worker and the producer fo big octopus corporations, or to encourage immigration, fill up the empty spaces to which the Minister refers so glibly, and double or treble our production; to promote the interests of fawning, greed^ monopolists who may respond faithfully to the party's call for funds, or'to build up a nation of hardy, resolute, and self reliant people, whose industry and toil would bring back to us our old financial prosperity, and enable us to meet our war obligations ?",47
207,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,What is the difference between a manufacturing monopolist and a grazing monopolist? <,47
208,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The graziers of the country have to compete in the markets, of the world. To-day, the Sydney Trades Hall is cabling to the Old Country to urge men not to come here, while the honourable member and others are saying that our artisans would do better by go-' ing to Russia. That seems to suggest something wrong. This is a wonderful country, possessing marvellous powers of recuperation, so that 'after a drought or a set-back of some other kind it quickly recovers, its prosperity; Our enly sane policy is to encourage our primary producers.",47
209,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,They cannofc sell the primary products of Broken Hill . Is that the fault of the men there?,48
210,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"At Broken Hill two rival organizations, which had no quarrel with the employers, had a dispute, which has resulted in the crippling of industry, and has brought about starvation at Broken Hill. Those responsible can well be described as the starvers of little chil- 1918-19. dren and the beaters of wives. ' As every honourable member must recognise, there has been during the past few years a migration from the country to the cities, and this has been largely the result of artificial conditions. Mr Carmichael, at one time a member of the New South Wales Parliament, has recently called attention to the fact that since 1910 the rural population of New South Wales has decreased by about 15,000, while the population of the metropolis has increased by about 170,000, and that in the same period the number of sheep carried has dropped from 45,000,000 to 38,000,000. Then Mr Erazer, the Chief Railway Commissioner of the State, pointed out about twelve months ago that, although the mileage of its railways had been largely increased, there had been no corresponding increase in goods traffic to the ports. I have taken the trouble to consult the Commonwealth Year-Boole on the subject, aud find that, whereas in 1914 12,901,000 tons of merchandise was carried on the railways, the quantity so «arrieddecreased, in 1915, to 11,666,000 tons; in 1916, to 11,60.0,000; in 1917, to 11,400,000; and in 1918, to 11,000,000; while in 1919, with an increase of 700 miles of railway, it was only 12,469,000 tons. The area under wheat in New South Wales was 3,200,000 acres in 1914, 4,188,000 acres in 1916, 3,329,000 acres in 1918, 2,409,000 acres in 1919, and 1,450,000 acres in 1920. Last year, because of the guarantee .and the special effort made by the Government, there was a big increase.",48
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Those figures are very 'largelv seasonal.,48
212,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Soldie r settlement has had a great deal to do with the increase.,48
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,It has had something to in character. do with it.,48
214,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"In 1916, the area production, under crop in Australia was 18,528,000 fco stifle or retard that development will acres, and in 1919, when we might have been expecting to get back to normal conditions, it was only 13,332,000.",48
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The year heforrt was so dry that,the land could not be fallowed.",48
216,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The figures relating to the Federal Capital Territory are not an advertisement for Government control, the area under crop there decreasing from 4,870 acres in 1914-15 to 1,779 acres in",48
217,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I thought that your party favoured a Government-controlled Wheat Pool?',48
218,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Not in any shape or form. We are asking ourselves whether the Tariff will help the farmer, the pastoralist, and the miner, and whether it will increase production. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) referred to a speech in which the Prime Minister of New Zealand stated that the cost of agricultural implements was now so high that farmers could not afford to buy machinery. If that be so, is this the time to make the cost of reapers and binders and otlier requirements of the farmer still higher by increasing the Customs duties? Sitting suspended frojn 6.SO to 8 p.m.",48
219,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I have pointed out that one of the effects of this Tariff must be to accentuate the present drift of population from the country districts to our cities, and so to create an industrial, political, and social menace. There has been a huge increase of the population of Sydney and Melbourne as against a decrease in the agricultural districts of New South Wales and Victoria. In a memorandum that I receivedfrom Mr. Knibbs, the Government Statistician, some five or six months ago, the following paragraph occurredBut from recent indications it appears probable that the proportion has increased since, the last census, and that not less than 50 per cent, of the present population of Australia is urban in its character. I feel satisfied that when the figures of the census taken at the beginning of this month are available, it will be found that considerably more than 50 per cent. of the population of Australia is urban Our progress and future development depend wholly on primary and any cause or action likely 1 bring upon this country ruin, destitution,. Tariff. [27 APRIL , 1921.] and chaos. To niy mind, this Tariff, as submitted to us, will have a most serious effect on primary production. I repeat that the Country party is not asking for Free Trade. We have always looked with pleasure to the creation of a home market, and we are""quite prepared to pay our share of the cost. We recognise that many of those who have been brought up in the country prefer to go into trades and similar callings in our cities, and we are prepared, under fair conditions, to give the fullest assistance to the building up and development of secondary industries. No complaint was made by the primary producers with regard to the Tariff of 1908, which produced from £9,500,000 to £10,000,000 of revenue per annum, and was pronounced to be' sound Protection by stronger Protectionists than we have in this Parliament today. All the old Protectionists of Australia were here at the time, and they had demanded a protective policy for this country. Tariff, however, was denounced by the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), the present Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), and other occupants of the Treasury bench today.",48
220,Mr STORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,But they have 6een the light since then.,49
221,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"On the contrary, they are entering into utter darkness. No man who' is alive to the facts can fail to realise that a Tariff which is causing a d r if t of population to our cities must be dangerous to the country.",49
222,Mr GABB,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The same thing has happened in Free Trade countries.,49
223,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I am not advocating Free Trade. That being so, why does the honourable member make such an absurd interjection? The Tariff of 190S was approved by the Protectionists. 1914 there was introduced another Tariff which gave us still greater protection, and increased the Customs revenue to the extent of from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000 per annum. Again we were told that the Protectionists were satisfied, but in 1920 yet another Tariff, that now before us, was introduced, and in it still further demands are made in the interests of the manufacturers.",49
224,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The honourable member knows that it is the fault of our. economic system. Tariff. 7805,49
225,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"And the honourable member knows that it is impossible to satisfy the manufacturers. They lead the workers to believe that an increased Tariff means increased wages and better conditions, but they overlook the danger of such a Tariff to the country. We are prepared to give a reasonable bonus for the encouragement of our secondary in-dustries. The primary producers desire that our manufacturers shall be just as self-contained, so to speak, as they are. But what proportion of the revenue derived from the Tariff is paid by the manufacturer, or the professional man? I venture to say-not one sixpence. The burden falls on the shoulders of the working man and the primary producer. Machinery is essential to every industry, and new inventions should be encouraged. But how can we hope to have new inventions brought into the country under such a Tariff as this? There might be a new labour-saving machine ""which would lead That to increased production",49
226,Mr STORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Ne w machines are in vented in this country.,49
227,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"There may be some, but the bulk of the machines employed in our big factories ""come from all parts of the world. Surely if we are'to build up in Australia, not only secondary,' but primary industries, we should take advantage of the brains of the world. We find, however, that heavy duties are imposed upon all the requirements of the agricultural and mining industries. The machinery used in those industries is but short lived. The reaper and binder and the plough of the "" farmer, the mining battery, of the miner, have a life of from five to eight years, whereas the machinery used by the average manufacturer has, in most cases, a life of fifty years. Under this Tariff, the Minister is In assuming that he has the absolute right to reduce the duty on machinery or any other goads whensoever he pleases to do so, and he has used this power most in equitably. That is a preposterous claim.",49
228,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,He claims that under certain conditions he may do so.,49
229,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I am going to show that the Minister, in removing certain duties, has acted most unjustly to some industries compared with the treatment extended to others. Item 175 in the Tariff Schedule of 1914 has been omitted 7806 ' Tariff. from the present schedule. It provided thatAny dutiable machinery or machine tools or any part thereof specified in any proclamation issued by the Governor General in pursuance of a joint address passed on the motion of Ministers by both Houses of the Parliament, stating that such machinery, machine tool, or,part cannot be reasonably manufactured within the Commonwealth, and that it should be admitted free, shall be free. That provision was a recognition of the fact that the Parliament, and not the Minister,, should have control of all such matters. It has been omitted from this schedule, and the Minister claims that he has the power to remove the duties on any machinery or other articles now dutiable under the Tariff.",49
230,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,It is ouly right to say that I do not make that claim.,50
231,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I shall quote the honourable gentleman. Before doing so, I would stress the point that there should be the strongest possible protest from honourable members generally with regard to the delay in dealing with this Tariff. The Tariff of 1914 was passed without any discussion whatever. I admit that it was allowed to go through in that way because, at the time, we were-at war. Mr RICHA BD FOSTER - It was ninny Tariff.",50
232,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It was not ; it provided for a big increase of duties. It introduced by a Labour Minister of Trade and Customs (Mr Tudor), who realized his obligations honestly and fairly brought it in as a protective, policy which he believed would aid in the buildmaking it here ing up of our secondary industries."" I have not looked up the speech which the honourable member made, in introducing it , but I believe he told us that it was designed to protect the industries of the Commonber wealth. I want this Parliament to retalking assert its position. We have had .too of the practice of malting important appointments and spending public money without the authority of this Parliament, and in absolute disregard of constitutional methods. We should insist that in regard, not only to the Tariff, but other matters, the Parliament shall be supreme. I have spoken again and again in this House embargoes placed by the Minister on importation of certain goods and the [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff. of the Minister in that way, to destroy the business of any outside man. God knows what would happen if s'^ch a power were in the hands of a dishonest Minister. I have absolute confidence in the integrity of the present Minister for Trade and Customs, but, because of information I have received since the introduction of the Tariff, I have not the same confidence in his judgment. Parliament has no right to give to any Minister the power to which I have referred. Such a power should be exercised by Parliament itself. The action of the Minister in placing an embargo on the importation of sheep dip was a most grievous one. We were told at the time that it was taken at the instance of the British Government, but, from my reading of the paper, I am satisfied that it was taken at the instance, not of the British Government, but of certain traders in Australia.",50
233,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The British Government were anxious to help the sheep d i p people.,50
234,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"An dfcheydid try to help them. The Prime Minister, when in England, gave, through Colonel Amory, a written promise to the manufacturers of sheep dip in the Old Country, that they would be allowed to land it here subject a picato their entering into a bond to pay any duty which the Parliament might thereafter impose on it . Notwithstanding that written promise, however, the Gowas vernment refused to allow it to come in until the whole matter had been full y ventilated in this House, and pressure had , and been brought to bear upon them.",50
235,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,And now they - are,50
236,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,As ' they were before.,50
237,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,They were not.,50
238,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The honourable memhas not the remotest idea of what he is about. At the time there was a much co-operative firm in New South Wales, which had been making sheep d i p for years. At the instance of Mr Leggo and Sir John Higgins, they came over here to discuss the question of making Australia's requirements. They had a' big trade in New South Wales, where they advertised that they did not want a protective duty, nor did they want an emof bargo on importations of sheep dip. the They were induced, however, to make power large quantities of sheep dip on the understanding that in - that way they would be helping the nation at a time of stress. They were told that an embargo would be placed on the importation of sheep d i p ; but the Minister knows that that solid little firm was absolutely ruined through governmental action.",50
239,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I was referring Cooper's sheep dip when I said it was now being made here.,51
240,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Cooper' s sheep dip was not made here before the war, and the embargo was aimed against the introduction of that particular brand of sheep dip. If the Minister is to have this power, it is bound to end in Tammany methods. No such power ought to be given to a Minister. I ought to say that it was not the present Minister who put the embargo on.",51
241,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The honourable member is wrong; I was the Minister who put the embargo on, but I was not the Minister who was responsible for the promise that there would be an embargo.",51
242,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I am glad of that correction. The Minister discussed at some length the Tariff Bill he proposes to introduce; and it is unfortunate that it has not been laid on the table. We cannot debate the measure, for the simple reason that we do not know what it contains; but when it does come before - as; Parliament should insist on a provision that any - general Tariff schedule*, which comes before us, and is not approved by Parliament within six months, shall then become inoperative.",51
243,Mr JAMES PAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Will the honourable member's colleagues vote for that?,51
244,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Most decidedly.,51
245,Mr JAMES PAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,As a party?,51
246,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I never speak for anybody but myself. Doe3 any - one imagine that the honourable member could pledge his party?,51
247,Mr JAMES PAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Yes ; I - will say for the Labour party that, if you submit such a proposal, we shall support you.",51
248,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Then , I say that minor amendments of the Tariff should become inoperative if not approved by Parliament within three months. I have referred to the embargo on sheep-dip, and to the action of the Government in refusing to permit the explosives provided by the Imperial Government to be used in Western Australia. The Minister, in the final sentence o i his speech, said that he hoped, without yielding to influence or pressure, to be able to control his Department in a way that would commend itself to the public and Parliament; but that has, not been the result so far .as these embargoes are concerned, for they ' have been in the interests of individuals, and are certainly not in the in to terests of the country. I have also referred to the embargo on the export of metals and the pressure that was exerted on the big mining companies to absolutely coerce them into, entering the Zinc Producers Association, which had absolute control of all output for fifty years. *",51
249,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"What about the. "" little fellow "" ?",51
250,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The Government have ruined him . All this was done under the Commerce sections.,51
251,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Was it not under the War Precautions Act?,51
252,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It was done during war-time, but there was nothing in the War Precautions Act to permit it . While I have every confidence in the Minister, I have no confidence in his judgment, or in the judgment of his Department. Some time agothe importation of rennet was forbidden. We all know how i m portant the cheese industry is ; but the Minister, owing to pressure, or recommendations made, put an embargo on the importation of this commodity, although the circumstances are such that it cannot be properly made in Australia. It was not long, however, before the Minister removed that embargo, for he began to realise that if he did not do so the cheesemaking industry would be ruined. I have letters here from over 100 manufacturers dealing with this matter, and _ every one bears out the contention that locally made rennet has never been found of any value. One letter saysIn response to your circular of the 8th, we beg to inform you that we have used the locally made rennet, but the manager of our cheese factory instructed us not to send same any more unless the imported article was unprocurable. - He complained of the slow action of the locally made rennet, and that almost twice the quantity was necessary as compared with the imported article. AgainIn reply to your letter inquiring about the prohibition of' imported rennet, we beg to state ""we have used Australian rennet, and find it much inferior in strength and reliability to the imported article. It would be well if those responsible for the prohibition were brought facturers took to their senses. It is only last year that the Government expert was writing in the papers the against the use of local rennet There is case after case of the k in d, ing the results of the action of the t ter. Then we had the Minister putting the total capital invested. a special duty on navvy shovels. The had made such articles dear enough, cost rising from 4s. 6d. or 5s. to 16s. 6d. people. each. The Minister discovered, however, that somebody was making shovels i Australia, and he immediately removed them fro m one class into another, made them liable to a duty of 35 per oent. Then-.there were the steps taken paid for? in regard to hosiery yarn. We all know how great the need for hosiery yarn amongst our women for making socks mending stockings, and so for t h ; what was next door to an embargo was placed on its importation. This is cular letter that was sent out in this nexionIn connection with - your application of January, 1920, for a licence to import hosiery people. yarn, the necessaiy licence is inclosed herewith. With regard to future importations of claimed goods, you are recommended to cure the licence before ordering same, as issue of future licences will depend upon inability to obtain supplies from Australian manufacturers. There was nothing said about a fair price for this yarn.",51
253,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,It could not obtained.,52
254,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"It was almost i m - bouble-bed - possible to obtain it , even in the Old Country. There was no restriction, as I say. in regard to the price, and the M i ister for Trade and Customs told the duty importers that they would not be perso mitted to introduce hosiery yarn unless fchey made a declaration that supplies - were not obtainable locally.",52
255,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"That was not done to help the industry, but for another purcompetition. pose.",52
256,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,What purpose ?,52
257,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"They'di d not want i brought from abroad. , Mr - GREGORY - Why prevent it blankets from being brought from abroad ?

261,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The Government was ought to have got that money from them and under the War-time Profits Act; There but is no doubt that during the war one section of the community was giving their a cirall while another section was waving conflags and robbing the community; and if I had my way I.should endeavour to ex13tli tract some of those profits . from those I wish to draw the attention of the proMinister to a circular letter sent to him proby the Sydney Chamber of Commerce h i the October last, having reference to the scaryour city of blankets. That letter contains the following: - ' We desire to bring under your notice certain features of the Customs Tariff as they affect the general public, and, by way of example, be would, at present writing, draw your attention to ""blankets. Prior to the war, a satisfactory pair of blankets was sold by the Australian manufacturer at about 13s Gd. per pair delivered. The lowest gradeEnglish double-bed . nblankets could, at the same period, be landed, of 25' per cent, - paid, for about l is . 0d (duty 2s. 3d.), but these were very rough, and obviously inferior to the local article that the Australian blankets always sold in preference. We believe the local mills sold thenwhole output without trouble, and if they had - been able to supply unlimited quantities, practically no English blankets would have sold in The first phase of the present position regarding blankets is that there are not enough t blankets now in Sydney to equal the demand of one week, and none are expected to coine forward before next winter. That being so, no will be sold during the next six or ' seven months, and when winter comes round again the demand will be acute. We believe position is identically the same throughout The second phase is that local blanket manufacturers have informed the wholesale and retail traders of Australia that they will not receive more than one-fifth or one-fourth of their orders for next winter, and the cost price will .be 37s. 6d. per pair. Therefore, the natural thing would be to endeavour to import the remaining four-fifths of the blankets estimated to be required; but English prices, coupled with the duty, present serious difficulties. I shall not read the rest of the communication, but merely point out that the woollen manufacturers had magnificent contracts with the Defence Department. They got the best wool at the appraised price, on the Is. 3 k L average; they did not have to pay the high prices that were paid in England. They were supplying the blankets at 13s. 6d. per pair before the war; but after the war they not only advised short supplies for the future, but raised the price to the figure I have mentioned. M-r. CONSIDINE --How much wool was there in the blankets?",52
262,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I do not know; I can only quote from the letter 6ent to the Minister; but I should say that the wool in the blankets will be the same this year as last year.,53
263,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"You ought, in fairness, to say that the English price was a little more than double that.",53
264,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I mentioned the price being charged for the English blanket; but the English manufacturer was carrying on under difficulties, namely, those of war conditions. What did Australia do in regard to the making of munitions? Nothing. The Minister has stated that I was incorrect in my statement concerning rebates being granted on machinery imported into this country, in regard to which I protested against the remission of duty from certain special lines while it was allowed to remain on others. Perhaps the Minister will recall a deputation which waited on him fro m the Shepparton F r u it Preserving Company. On that occasion he pointed out that item 174 of the Tariff was specially framed to enable duties .to be remitted for the encouragement of Australian industries. I noticed some little while ago that the Minister had put machines for the making of ""barbed wire on the free list. It is not so long since he actually put coal-cutting machines also on the free list ",53
265,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,What does the honourable member suggest?,53
266,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"That the Minister should not have the power, except upon resolution of this House, to do such a thins. I . do not believe that interestedparties who may have the opportunity to get the ear of the Minister, or of the Department, should benefit, by getting their goods in free, while others, less fortunately situated, should be compelled to continue to pay duty.",53
267,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"You want the "" lobbying "" distributed ?",53
268,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I do not want "" lobbying "" at all"". I do not wish to secure from the Minister, for any interest or industry which I may represent, a concession which any other interest or industry may not also have. The Government have - brought in a Tariff schedule which, as I have pointed out, means not only the placing of a heavy penalty on the people of Australia, but the creation of hardship throughout our .primary industries at the most inopportune time imaginable. The world has but recently emerged from the greatest of all conflicts, in which more than 20,000,000 men were deflected for several years from their ordinary avocations into the making of war or of warlike materials. The ordinary operations of industry practically ceased.",53
269,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Not in Germany. The manufacturing plants are all intact.. They remained in good order throughout.,53
270,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,The honourable member surely remembers that during the years of the war Germany was receiving no raw materials.,53
271,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"But her factories were unharmed, and were ready to - begin producing immediately.",53
272,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I am speaking of the time when this Tariff was introduced. I invite the honourable member to read the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs. He will notice that the quotation in regard to wire revealed an in crease of 300 per cent., and that there were other increases mentioned even up fco 400 per cent. The - Minister quoted galvanized iron and other goods which, during the war period, had risen in cost fco enormous heights. . No time could have been chosen for the introduction of the Tariff which would have been more certain to create industrial chaos. The immediate effect was to gravely increase the cost of living. In view of the extraordinary prices ruling everywhere, one would have expected that the imposition of increased duties would have been the very"" last thought in the minds of the Government. I desire to show the effect so far as the primary producer was, concerned. Fencing .wire prior to the war cost £8 10s. per ton. The Minister quoted £50 as the price ruling when he made his speech. The duty was raised from 8s. 4d. to £4 10s. per ton. Freight was £1 Is. 6d.j it is now £5. Who has to pay all that? The '.' poor cocky."" Barbed wire increased by 250 per cent, fco 300 per cent. Although there was a great increase, both in freight and insurance, and in other handling charges, the duty was also increased from £2 12s. 6d. to £5 5s. Prior to the war, sheep netting was £7 lis. 6d. a mile. Its quotation rose to £40 5s. per mile; and then, whereas it had been duty free, a duty of £1 15s. 6d. was imposed. We have instituted numbers of soldier settlements in different parts of Australia. I know personally of many instances where new settlers went out into virgin country and, without fencing, cleared a little bit of land and put in a crop. Then, in came the rabbits; and, because there was nothing to stop them, they ate up everything. Those poor fellows, struggling to get a start, are today paying tremendous prices for wore netting, plus duty. Rabbit netting cost £17 4s. 6d. before the war. It went up to £92 10s. a mile during the war. Freight increased from £2 12s. 6d. to £9 12s. 6d.; and, instead of this essential commodity being free, as hitherto, a duty of £2 Is. per ton was imposed. Is this a time, in all our history-just we are doing our best to encourage new settlers, most of them returned soldiers-to enforce sijch severe additional burdens? The Minister has come forward with a proposal to impose in the near future an enormous duty on galvanized iron. Is there anything .more essential for the building up of our outside country and for the .general purposes of the poorer people in our community? Yet, in order to foster some big monopoly in New South Wales, a heavy duty is 4o be put on galvanized iron. There have been great increases on steel bars and steel rails, and even on wire nails. In the last mentioned, a machine has been invented in connection with which all one has to do, in order to manufacture nails, is to feed a roll of wire into the machine. The whole of its operations are automatic, right down to the packing of the nails in "" Mr Gregory. the case. The man who imports this machine has been given a remission of duty in connection with its importation in order that this wonderful nail-making industry may be established in this country; and, then, further to bolster him, a special duty is imposed. Thus, instead of the country getting the benefit of this invention, the man who has bought and so favourably imported the machine secures the whole gain. Now I desire to turn to the main items in the Tariff. They have to do with what I describe as the key industries of this country. I refer to iron, steel, and copper. There is no honourable member present who would not wish to do everything possible to build up iron and steel works in Australia. Apart from the encouragement of primary production, the best way in which to advance Australia is to assist in the establishment of iron and steel manufactories. Honourable members would rather confer an advantage upon a small manufacturer than on an extensive operation. If the Minister for Trade and Customs could prove that it is essential that a duty be placed on iron and steel, I think this House would be justified in concurring in the imposition of some small measure of duty. But it should not be forgotten that iron and steel will be sold through the merchants, and that every manufacturer in Australia must pay an increased price, plus the duty, before he can manufacture the material. We must take the greatest care when before imposing any duty upon any one of our key industries. We should concur in such an imposition only upon being absolutely assured that such a course is essential for the encouragement of our industries. I have had statistics prepared showing what the effect of the Tariff is going to be. All these figures have been based upon importations for 1913; that is, assuming that this year we shall be importing into. Australia the same quantity of steel and iron goods as then. I want honourable members to realise what this duty means. It is the subsidy whioh we are giving to the local manufacturer. If honourable members will look at item 136 of the Tariff it will be appreciated just what we are giving to the manufacturers of iron and steel in Australia. On that one_ item alone, assuming that we shall be importing as much this year as in 1913, the duty imposed under, the 1920 Tariff will amount to £1,026,233. On. It e m 136, using the 1913 figures as member trying to point out? the basis of the 1920 imports, I find that the duty payable can be set down as folamount lows :'136 (A) Pig iron .. (B) Ingots, blooms, &c. .. 27,705 (o) Bar, rod, angle, tee . . 391,455 (n) Plate and sheet (n) (in 1922) . . (E) Wire .. (F) Hoop ..",53
273,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,If were favourable we would be importing great deal more at the present time.,55
274,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"In deciding whether a Tariff is necessary, honourable members per ton. ought to consider the price the manufacturers are likely to receive for their goods in comparison with pre-war prices. ing -1913 as the base period, and bringactually ing the figures up to the 1918 19 period, were here. the,last for which I have statistics, following increases have come about: Item 136 A,' 231 per cent.; B . , 366 per cent.; C, 302 per cent.; D , 323 per cent.; E, 288 per cent.; P, 313 per cent.",55
275,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,If we have anwar. other seven years like the seven years that ditions. have elapsed since 1913 we might have none of these goods in Australia if we not have our own manufacturers here.,55
276,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I think that I shall be able to show that Protection is not necessary for the Broken H i tary Company. As these duties are at fixed rates they are not affected by price of the article. The total value of these imports in 1913 was £1,958,700. But as the price has risen f of 100 in 1913 to 293 on the average in 1819, the corresponding value of the imports of - these goods under Item 136 would be £5,739,000. The duty would be equivalent to an ad valorem rate of 52 per cent, on the 1913 values, and 18 per cent, on the 1918-19 values. But , as a matter of fact, all these items were free in 1913. The increased duty on girders is £47,462, and the duty on tubes shows that, assuming that half the pipes and tubes imported come from the TJnited Kingdom, and half from other countries, the duty would amount to £794,000, so we can easily realise what we are paying, for the purpose of promoting that particular industry.

283,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,What are we to do with our coal if we shut up our.industries ?,55
284,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"We are not going to shut up our industries; but I am not prepared to give a duty where it is not asked for. The Broken Hill Proprietary people did not ask for these duties. ' What I am endeavouring to point out is that, under present-day conditions, our manufacturers at Newcastle can get their coal at a price which is 250 per cent, less than the price paid for coal' in England. Furthermore, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company boast of the fact that at I r o n Knob, in South Australia,-they have the greatest deposits of iron ore in the world. It contains from 68 to 69 per cent, of iron; whereas the average, ore in G-reat Britain contains from 35 to 36 per cent, of iron; in Germany from 30 to 32 per cent.; and in America from 35 to 36 per cent. No other country can boast of such huge and magnificent deposits of iron ore as we have at Iron Knob, in South Australia. I glory in the magnificent worts established at Newcastle, and I want to see them continue; but I do not believe that a protective duty is essential for them. Mr - Delprat, the Managing Director of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, speaking recently at a function, pointed out that the company's works at Newcastle had produced 786,000 tons of pigiron, and 823,000 tons of steel. He said that since the establishment of the works, the company had spent £12,000,000 in plant.",55
285,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The actual figures are in my possession, but they are nothing approaching the amount which the honourable member has mentioned.",56
286,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I am quoting from a press report of Mr Delprat's speech. I think it appears in the Industrial Australian and Mining Standard. rate, prior to the war, Mr Delprat gave evidence before the Inter-State Commission, and said that his company did not want a duty. Here is an extract from the evidence given by him :I presume you are going into these works which saysbelieving that yon can compete successfully, so far as iron and steel are concerned, with markets of the outside world?-Yes . I suppose you will not ask that any import duty be put on iron and steel to assist you in your industry?-No , we have decided, that if we cannot carry on without Government support or assistance we shall not proceed with the works at all.",56
287,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Did the. Government run after them and give them this assistance?,56
288,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Probably there were outside firms who had subscribed well to the Protection League. If necessary, I am prepared to proceed a good deal further in regard to this matter of funds to assist the Protection League.",56

290,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The grossly offensive statements made in the press ought to be sheeted home to those who made them or justified. I have asked the Minister to institute an inquiry. In 1914-15 the dividends paid by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company amounted to £177,000, in 19i5-16 to £236,000, and in 1916-17 to £177,000.",56

292,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"To some extent on watered capital. When I am endeavouring to quote figures, it is very unfair of the honourable member to interrupt me for the purpose of trying to throw me off the track. The profits for 1914-15 were £321,000; for the next year, £486,000; for the next £426,000; for the next, £650,u00; and for 1918-19, £652,000.",56

297,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I have a letter here The company is not very anxious to inform the the Government and the community of the heap of profits capitalized in the past twelve months, and the danger of its not being able to regain the old 50 per oent. dividend level unless "" adequate"" aid wore forthcoming. Thus, when the company decided to establish steel works it increased its share register from 060,000 of 8s. each to 1,500,000 shares of the same denomination. Of the new scrip 221,000 were placed for over £350,000, and debentures for £1,000,000 were subsequently issued. Later still, the company placed 318,944 of its 8s. shares in reserve at 40s. each among the shareholders. Next, without calling upon share- . holders for any cash, it not only converted shares of 8s. each into those of 20s. each, but it gave to holders, as a bonus, 600,000 of 20s. each. Now, sad to say, it is only paying dividends at the rate of 3s. per share yearly on the 20s. scrip, as against 4s. on Ss. shares in pre-war days. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - Are the profits 3hown plus or minus the war profits tax?",56

Mi"". GREENE - Does the honourable member know the duties under which Canada and America established the iron and steel industry?",56
299,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,No ; and probably the Minister does hot.,57
300,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,They were a great deal higher than ours. I have all the figures here.,57

Tariff which reflects least credit on the Minister is the item imposing duties copper wire and copper sheets at 30 per been done. oent. British, and 45 per cent, foreign, ad valorem-. The value of electrolytic copper varies. It has been as high £165 per ton, and, at present, is between £71 and £74 per ton. Yet the duties imported. copper wire and copper sheets are the same ad valorem, whether electrotubes lytic copper is high or low. Telephone communication is an'-urgent need throughall out the country, yet, recently, when I asked for 8 miles of light double telephone wire for a line for which the posts already erected, I was informed by the Postmaster-General's Department that would cost £400.",57
302,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Why did you not accept galvanized wire? Australia. CanadaMr GREGORY - It would not have s. d. s. d. done, and surely it is preposterous that we cannot get copper even at a fair price. Recently the Public Works Committee was informed that prior to the war it was estimated that copper wire cost from £15 to £17 per ton more than the price of electrolytic copper-that manufacture, freight, commission charges, and handling were covered by the figures I have given. Now, the Government have entered into some arrangement with the Port Kembla works, fixing the price of wire at £57 10s. per ton,above*the price of electrolytic copper, and the Deputy Post32 10 master-General for Queensland told the Committee, on the 7th March last, that he had received word that the price of copper wire was £154 per ton. I have not - ascertained what electrolytic copper the cost at that date, but on the 14th March, of its price was from £71 to £74 per ton, so that the Department is now giving for copper wire £80 more than the price per and ton of electrolytic copper.",57
303,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,I suppose the honourable member knows why?,57
304,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Because the Government has entered into some special arrangement with the Port Kembla Company.,57
305,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,It is because we are trying to keep the copper mines going.,57
306,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The action of the Government, in interfering with mining has led to the closing down of a number",57
307,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,When we get to the item on we can discuss the reasons for what has,57
308,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"This impost is one of the most discreditable in the Tariff. as The Inter-State Commissioners recommended a bonus of £3 per ton on all copon per and brass plates, and a bonus of £5 per ton .on all copper and brass pipes, and wires, yet the Minister has put a duty of 45 per cent, ad valorem an copper wire and copper sheets* imported from the TJnited States of America, the big copper producing country of are the world. He thought that £4 per ton would be a fair duty, but the Minister it has imposed a duty of 45 per cent, ad valorem. If any one will compare the prices of the Colonial Ammunition Company with those of the British, American, and Japanese importers, he will find that the local concern charges the purchaser with the full amount of the duty. In conclusion, I wish to show how the Tariff prejudices the primary producer. We have to consider the risks taken by the farmers and the miners, and the short life of the machinery which they use compared with that of machinery used in factories. Regard must also be had to the millions of pounds that their industry puts into circulation, and to the fact that Were it? not for our primary production, there wouloVbe no manufacturing at all in this country. I hope; therefore, that members generally will assist in considerably reducing the duties on machinery. The Minister has removed the duty on coal-cutting machinery, although coal mining is on a much safer footing than other mining and than farming. Given anything like a decent seam, in coal mining a profit is certain, but in other mining, everything depends on the fluctuating value of the ore, just as in agriculture everything depends on the season. According to the Western Australian Chamber of Mines, the Tariff has increased the costs of machinery, stores and material 59 per cent, over the costs of .1914, and only two of the big mines in that State are making a profit today. The mines employ thousands of workmen, and they in their turn carry four or five times as many in other occupations. The number of persons that the producer carries on his shoulders is wonderful. According to the Chamber of Mines, on a tonnage basis the duties now in force impose an additional burden of £36,103 per annum. The duties coming into force in January, 1922, impose an additional tax of £34,286 .per 'annum, making a total of £70,389, or 6.21 pence per ton on every ton of ore treated. No one can say that the farmer had a good time during the war. The Age, in a special article published recently, shows that during the war the Australian farmer, received on an average 4s. 9d. for our wheat, whereas the United States of America farmer received 9s. 5d., and the Argentine farmer 7s. 9d.",57
309,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,A very wicked and misleading statement. We had to Mr Gregory. ' ' contend witli rot of that kind throughout the war.,58
310,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The statement was made by the Age. The figures were used for quite another purpose. They were dealing with the war period, and they, may not be quite absolutely correct.",58
311,Mr STEWART,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"If they are not more reliable than the Age's figures generally are, they are not worth quoting. I believe, however, that in this instance they are right.",58
312,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Accordin g to the Age the average price which the Australian farmer received for his wheat during the war was 4s. 9d. per bushel, whereas farmers in the TJnited States received 9s.. 5d., and farmers in the Argentine 7s. 9d. per bushel. I do not know, and have no means of ascertaining, what price was actually obtained in America; but I would stress the point that farmers in the United States of America and Canada have a better market than we have for our produce. They are nearer the markets of the world, and their position in every respect is superior to that of the farmers of Australia. Nevertheless, primary producers here are compelled to pay enormous duties on all the machinery they require, and at the same time have, to sell their produce at world's parity when . they can get it. Unlike the manufacturer, the farmer cannot say that the price paid for his product shall be, not the world's parity, bufc the price at which it can be obtained from another country. Thafc is what happens in regard to all the machinery required by the farmer. If he wants an oil engine from the United States of America or a reaper and binder, from Canada, he has fco pay freight charges, commission, and insurance, plus the duties on such pieces of machinery. On the other hand, when he wants to sell his wheat he has to accept the price ruling in home markets less all those costs and charges. Why should the agriculturist or the miner have to pay these duties? If we prevent machinery coming into Australia we shall lose the value of great inventions and labour-saving appliances. Which is the better policy? The policy of fair competition or the policy'of monopoly and restriction ? The one applies a constant stimulus to improved methods of con- struction, and safeguards the quality and prices of our commodities. The other opens the door to the worse of Tammany methods. We pay a dear price indeed when we destroy the former, and there are few here who openly dare to state that they support legislation in favour of the monopolist. I do not propose to give the figures relating to the value of primary production in this country. They have often been quoted and need not be repeated. I desire, however, to show the natural Protection which local manufacturers of machinery enjoy. Let us take, for instance, item 162-dis c ploughs. This is a distinctly American line introduced and popularized by the importers before the Australian maker oommenced copying it a, few years ago - Under the 1911 Tariff the duty was. 20 per oent.; under this Tariff it is 35 per cent. In 1913 the nat u r al Protection on a three-furrow set disc plough was 31.03 per cent. It is now 47.84 per cent. Mr MCKay's retail price for the light three-furrow size is £40. The price of his heavy three-furrow size is £ 4 7 . The present price of the Massey-Harris three-furrow plough, which in weight comes bebween Mr MCKay's light and heavy plough, is £ 5 7 . dently no Protection is required on this line. Coming to the four-furrow stumpjump mouldboard ploughs, the duty in 1911 was 25 per cent., whereas under the present Tariff it is 40 per cent. In 1913 the natural protection on the four-furrow size was 32 per cent. It is now 49.79 per c.nt. The present natural protection on the four-furrow size amounts to £ 1 3 Is. l i d . The present duty on the same size is £11 13s. '2d., without taking into account the cost of exchange. again, we have the reaper-thresher, which is dealt with in item 165 (a). According to a paper which I have before me, this machine was invented and developed in Australia by the Massey-Harris Company as an improvement on the stripper-harvester. Several local makers have been experimenting with ' similar machines in recent years, but until the last harvest none of them made more than experimental of introductory sales. It is reported that Mr MCKay buil t and sold about 1,000 of them for last harvest. As this machine was a combination of a reaping machine-cutting , instead of stripping-eun d a thresher, and as both of those machines were on the free list when the reaper-thresher was introduced, the importers attempted to have it classified as duty free. The Department, however, held that as it did the same kind of work as a stripper-harvester, it should carry the same duty as that machine. Under the 1911 Tariff the duty was £ 1 2 ; under the new Tariff it is 40 per cent. The Massey-Harris Company ceased importing stripper-harvesters in 1908. The International Harvester Company continues to import 200 to 300 annually. The Australian manufacturer has still 90 per .cent, of the trade in this class of harvester machine. In 1913 this machine had a natural protection of 29.19 per cent. In 1920 it had a natural protection of 38.05 per cent. The duty in 1913 was £ 1 4 ; the present duty is £ 5 0 le. 5d. at M in t par rate of exchange. As the exchange rate varies from day to day, it is not possible to give the exact rate, except on an individual importation. The retail price in Australia for the 8-ft. reaper-thresher has always been from £20 to £ 2 5 higher than' for the 8-ft. stripper-harvester; consequently, the reaper-thresher has been introduced at a substantial disadvantage in price, and ho claims for unfair competition with the Evi- Australian machine can be advanced. The natural protection in 1913 on this machine amounted to £ 1 6 9s. lOd. It is not likely to be as little as that again for very many years. It is now more* thanthree times that amount, and if the Australian maker cannot compete with such a substantial natural advantage, he should not ask for Customs House protection. I would also direct attention to the duties in regard to hay rakes, reapers and binders, and mowers, which are Then, dealt with in items 171 (a), 171 (6), and 171 (c). These, according to the paper before me, are all machines that were in troduced from America and England and established by the importers, and were always on the free list u n t i l made dutiable afc 5 oer cent, under the 1914 war Tariff. Under the Tariff now before us, it is proposed to'make rakes dutiable at £3, or 45 per cent., whichever is the higher, and honourable members may rest assured that the duty collected will always be 45 per cent. Binders and mowers are also ! made dutiable at £10 and £4 respectively, or 45 per cent., whichever is the higher. Coal-cutting machinery and ' that used for the manufacture of barbed wire as well as in connection with many other manufactories come in free of d u t y; but hay rakes, reapers and binders, and mowers are subject to a duty of 45 per cent.. None of these machines has ever been produced for sale by Australian makers. I have here a statement thatAfter - the 1920 Tariff was brought down,' MCKay made a few experimental counterfeits of the Massey-Harris binder, and, evidently with the object of impressing the Ministry, has been booking orders for them subject to the following condition:- "" I 'agree that the attached order is subject to the Federal Parliament confirming the duty on reapers and binders as per clause 171 of Tariff."" The announcement he made to his sales staff by circular letter on 20th September. 1920, was as follows:"" The first Australian reaper and binder. The Sunshine Harvester Works have embarked on the manufacture of reapers and binders. Comparatively few machines will be available this year, but if Parliament confirms the proposed new Customs duty mass production will be commenced forthwith. With this proviso the price for delivery in time for 1921 harvest is as follows :"" The price for Victoria was £98; for Kew South Wales, £103. The insincerity of MCKay's statement that he intends to give the Australian farmers a fair deal is evidenced by the fact that he is asking £9S in the State of production for his machine, the farmer to pay all outward freight, while the original machine was sold at retail, with freight prepaid to the farmer's nearest railway station, during the last Canadian harvest in the State of production in Canada at £53. MCKay is only asking Ahc Australian farmer £45 more for his machine than the Canadian farmer pays for the original. The natural protection on a binder in 1913 was 30.29 per cent.; it is now 60.99 per cent. In 1913 it was'39.24 per cent, on a mower; it is now 62.01 per cent. In 1913 it was 32.45 per cent, on a hay rake; it is now 55.72 per cent.",58
313,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The price quoted here for the imported reaper and binder was £130, but as soon as Mr. MCKay quoted £100 for his machine the price of the imported article dropped.  quoted by the honourable member are not in keeping with those in the printed pricelists.",60
314,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"I have not the official list at which these machines are being quoted here. I am simply pointing out that Mr MCKay is asking £98 in the State of production, and £103 in New South ""Wales, for a machine which can be purchased in Canada for £53, so that the Australian farmer is asked to pay for his machine £45 more than the Canadian farmer pays for the original.",60
315,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,Will the honourable member give the price at which that Canadian machine is being offered to the Australian farmer?,60
316,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,No .,60
317,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Then I shall do so. It was quoted first of all at £130, but was subsequently reduced ""to the price asked today for the MCKay machine.",60
318,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"The honourable member would lead honourable members to believe that Mr MCKay was producing these reapers and binders for sale last year. That is not correct. His firm issued - doubtless will manufacture a great many, but only one such machine was manufactured by him last year. The figures quoted by the Age show that the Canadian farmer, who is much nearer the world's markets than we are, gets a better price for his products, and we are justified, therefore, in expecting our manufacturers to supply our farmers with machinery at something like the prices at which that machinery can be obtained in Canada. If we are, to build up these secondary industries, surely we can expect them to give us something like the position obtaining in other countries. In 1913 the natural protection on binders, without any duty, was 36.29 per cent., whereas now it is 60.99 per cent., and on mowers it was 39 per cent, as against 62 per cent. now. The newspaper gives all details of the natural protection on agricultural machines; and if , to a natural protection of 60 per cent., we add duties amounting to 45 per cent., it is not fair to our farmers and general producers. According to Kelly's Customs Tar if s of the World, a standard work, some sixtyeight countries out of 109 admit agricultural machinery free. This is done by the TJnited States of America, although that country is alongside the big Canadian manufacturers. The ccst of such machinery has increased, I should say, by 250 per cent., in addition to in creased charges for freight. In the United States of America the Tariff not only gives special protection to primary industries, but adds the additional advantage I have just mentioned. We in Australia have to compete in the markets cf the world. The men who are going back, and further back, and building up this country, have to pay increased railway rates, increased cartage charges, and increased, prices for every thing they require. Every action and utterance of the Government show that the Ministry realise that the future of Australia depends wholly and solely upon the building up of the primary industries. Whenever it is desired to raise a peace or other loan, the Government protest to the people about the necessity 'for the production of wealth, and for immigration; and that is for the one purpose of inducing people to go into the^ country and produce wealth. We have an enormous area and must increase our population, and this can only be done by developing our resources; yet we find the representative of the Labour party in New South Wales proclaiming to the people of Great Britain that there are thousands of unemployed in that State. This is wholly due to pandering to the crowd, and destroying the life blood of the country. I am prepared, and, I believe, the party to which I * belong, and the public generally, are prepared to accept a moderate Tariff. Extreme duties, more particularly on agricultural machinery, I am not prepared .to accept; and I am satisfied that, unless Parliament considerably alters the schedule, the Tariff will bring ruin and destruction upon the country. I hope that when we come to consider the items we shall have the assistance of honourable members of all sides in making the Tariff equitable, not only to the manufacturers, but also to the producer.",60
319,Mr WIENHOLT,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"Moreton) [9.36] I shall not attempt to go deeply into the question of Protection versus Free Trade, a question more, perhaps, than any others in regard to which it may be said"" 'that "" doctors disagree."" I think it can ""be taken that this is a strongly Protectionist House, and I willingly admit that, at the present time, at any fate, Australian sentiment is to a very great extent in favour of a Protectionist policy. For myself, I do not believe that high Protection, which tends to become higher and still higher, is, in itself, by any means the cure and solution of our industrial and commercial troubles. Nor do I see that it is quite logical for any one who complains about the high cost of living to advocate extremely high Protection; that seems to me a somewhat anomalous position to take up. A few days ago the Prime Minister, Mr Hughes, made an important and interesting speech, which had a world-wide influence, and was taken'notice of in many countries. The whole of that speech was an explanation of how dependent we are for our national safety on the possession by Great Britain of an 'adequately strong fleet. I do not believe I should be in order in quoting the exact words of the Prime Minister, but throughout his remarks he impressed on us strongly that Great Britain has built up her Empire by sea power, and by sea power alone can it be kept. He told us how importajit her fleet is to the safety of the people of Australia; and I think every one of us agrees with him. I do not say that the right honourable gentleman told us anything new, but he urged that Great Britain should not allow herself to drop behind, and, in Naval matters, become a second or third-rate - power. If I may quote just one phrase, the Prime Minister, speaking of Great Britain, said, ""She is exposed now to the fiercest industrial and commercial competition."" He explained the troubles Great Britain is going through-the huge war debt she has to face, and how it may become impossible for her now to keep up an adequately large Navy on which, not only her safety, but the safety of the Dominions depends. I understand that the Prime Minister is going Home to point out and urge on the British people that, although .the British taxpayer is struggling under an. enormous war debt, Australia looks to her for our protection. It seems to me that when we are discussing the Tariff we have an opportunity to help Great Britain to raise funds for the maintenance of the fleet which we believe so necessary. Now is the time to show in a practical form the interest we have in England remaining prosperous-in her keeping her people at work, and her finances sound. I do not consider that we are giving sufficient preference to British goods in this Tariff we are shortly to discuss. I saw from the newspapers this morning that the Prime Minister's stolen motor car had been recovered, and also that it is a Hudson, an American car. If we go into the streets of any Australian city we see American care swarming. I think that better even than additional preference by means of the Tariff would be the education of our people as to the necessity, and advantage, of wherever possible buying British as against foreign goods. That I believe - is not only a right instinct, but a good business instinct-to give ^preference in buying to British made goods. I know that honourable gentlemen opposite especially, and, I believe, all here, vote moneys, for military and Defence purposes, to a certain extent grudgingly, although these purposes must of course be provided for. Personally, I feel there is something about defence expenditure that no one likes. But it is quite certain that if Great Britaim behind in this regard, we shall have to increase our own expenditure on defence. Very much better, then, than that increased expenditure, would be for us, as part of our duty, to give a much bigger preference in every way, right through the Tariff, to British goods of every kind.",61
320,Mr HAY,PUBLIC SERVICE CLERICAL,"New England) [9.45] I have listened with close attention to the remarks of honourable members, and particularly to those of the honourable  West Sydney (Mr Ryan), and of my deputy leader, the honourable membeT for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I have been a Protectionist all my life. . I have always recognised that Australia is so remote that we must preserve to ourselves our own identity and must secure ourselves in the event of any disturbance from outside. As one reads criticisms in the press which today are hurled against the Government, and, indeed, against many ih high places, one is reminded of the words of ByronOh! Nature's noblest gift-m y gray goose quill! Slave of my thoughts, obedient to my will, Torn from thy parent-bird to form a. pen, Tliat mighty instrument of little men. We have to think today not in terms of party or corners or sections. We have to consider not so much what is coming into this country as how to get rid of what this country is producing. ' We are bound to recognise not only the laws which we have created, but those also that were created for us. We must eventually perceive and take into account this important factor, namely, the earning power of the world, for the earning power of the world is the consuming and purchasing power of the world; and until we restore the position of earning we can not discover the point of spending. We have been told by many, and rightly, that the home market is our greatest market. During .the unhappy period of industrial trouble at Broken Hill between £11,000,000 and £12,000,000 worth of products was not sold into the world's markets for the reason that those ordinarily engaged in production at the Barrier had ceased from producing. If that £11,000,000 to £12,000,008 worth , had been sold to the world and consumed, the earning power drops , involved' would have been, probably, £7,000,000, which would have been so much purchasing power in our own market. During the shipping strike between £1,250,000 and £1,500,000 was lost in wages to those engaged in that particular industry. In addition, thousands of others were thrown out of employment, and there was a huge loss of earning power for the consuming of our products. I believe in a.policy of self-preservation, which is said to be the first law of nature. As an individual I insure myself for my own safety and for the protection of those who may be dependent on me. This country must insure itself similarly, especially in regard to defence. We have our great coastline extending for 13,000 miles, and we have on the mainland about 5,000,000 people. The problem is how best to employ 5,000,000 people in the task of defending 13,000 miles of coastline. This is simplified by the reduction of those miles to yards. Thus we get a divisible quantity. If every man, woman, and child in this land were placed around the seaboard fishing, or surf bathing, or in any other way comporting themselves, the distance between each would amount to about 4£ yards. Our defence, therefore, is and must, be a problem in regard to which we are bound to rely on some higher measure' of insurance than that of personal guardianship. Every day we are importing a product which is one of the basic products in our undertakings. I refer to sulphuric acid. If we will not engage ourselves in establishing this basic undertaking we render ourselves,liable to be cut off from supplies. All our chemicals and agricultural fertilizers are produced from sulphuric acid - It has been truly said that the next war will be a chemical war. It will be a war of science. I believe that we should take for our first principle the motto, "" Peace on earth, and good-will toward men."" Here, we are living in the lap of plenty, and still we cannot find the* necessary finance with whioh to carry on our undertakings. No one can convince me that any artificial undertakings oan undo the universal law of supply and demand. We must restore to the ruined countries a condition of credit. We must discover some way of restoring people to industry, and to the undertakings in which they were engaged before the war. It is our duty, as units in the greatest of fill Empires, to repair the damage which others have inflicted; and I see no hope of artificially doing that. I have been engaged in many of the undertakings with which human endeavour has linked itself. have gone to fapua in order to produce vegetable oil. I have gone out into the Gulf country to raise cattle. I have pxoduced wool, and I have been in undertakings to produoe metals. Thus, I have been engaged in almost all the primary undertakings, because I felt that if one should fail the others would succour me. But, in all our primary undertakings we at present find it difficult to finance ourselves in order to carry on. This is not the time for contesting political advantages and opportunities. We should all put our shoulders to the wheel and endeavour to seek salvation from our joint efforts. I am not going into the details of Tariff schedule at this stage - Such an opportunity will he afforded later. situation confronting us is very grave. We must resolve ourselves into a comthe people, we ought mittee ' in order that the best of common tense shall bs employed for responsibilities the safety of our country. Buskin, the greatest peace-lover the world haa known,, said, "" I regTet hut I must acknowledge the fact that war is the foundation of all the arts and sciences known to mankind. We degenerate in peace."" It is the diffithe culties of life that make us strong war be the foundation of all our arts sciences, swely we haye had enough war to establish all the and sciences that may be quired for the present day. Our duty is to relieve the burden of human toil. We can only do that by applying our efforts to the establishment of better ditions in Australia. On the sea-board of New South Wales we have some 300,000 horse-power rushing to the sea every day, and yet nothing has been done [318] to harness it. Are we to continue allowing this power to go to waste when we ought to apply it to the relief of mankind? I have seen much of this country, I love it, it is my country; but it is useless to talk about increasing the population unless we make Australia attractive to people from other countries. Our bur'den of responsibility can only be relieved by millions of immigrants. We are at the nethermost part of the world, and we bave to pay heavily to deliver the goods we produce in the markets of the world. The other day, on a motion subI mitted hy the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) the House discussed the question of oversea freights. We are paying heavy freights because our population is BO small. With a larger population Australia would not have ships coming here with empty bottoms to take away our produce. If ships come here in ballast we shall he obliged to pay double freights in - order to send away bur goods to the world's market. This is a country wliere science ought to be employed, and - whero the very best thought-out methods should be applied to our undertakings. ' If we fail in this respect we are not doing out duty to our people. Though I have a great belief in Australia. I recognise that its prosperity the cannot be created by narrow mindedness or the pursuit of personal ambitions. I The belong to no party. I belong to the country. As representatives of to have our great thoughts, and should view our in a becoming way, putting aside all personal and party feeling and directing our minds towards the bettering of the oondition of our people. If we' do this I have no doubt as to the future; because the more attractive we can make country the more prosperous ib will If become. The people we acknowledge aB and fit to come here will only come when we of make our country prosperous. We cerarts tainly have the power available to give rerelief to our workers, but it must first be harnessed and applied. To harness the 300,000 horse-power going to waste daily on the sea-board of New South Wales conwould give great relief to all those who have access to it . The drudgery of the people on the land today can only be reduced by the application of scientific means of. production. In the centre of New South Wales the climate is of the beet, the soil is fertile, and all the conditions exist there to make men, women, and children happy if we could only give .them some relief from the burden of human toil. The great benefits enjoyed by the consumers of Australia today are derived from the sacrifice and industry of the producers. If those who are engaged. in dairy production were paid time and a half for the hours worked after five o'clock in the afternoon and before eight o'clock in the morning, I am afraid' that the consumerswould be obliged to pay about 5B. per lb. for butter. honourable member for South Sydney (Mr. Riley) says that the Australian consumer should not be called upon to pay more than 4s. per bushel for wheat, leaving the farmer to get the best price he can for his surplus. The primary producers can only carry on at existing prices, because of their industry, determination, sacrifice, and frugality. If they were to insist on having applied to them the conditions which are exacted by those who are engaged in other undertakings controlled by Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards, tiheir position would be very different. However, I recognise that we live upon our primary undertakings and exist upon our secondary industries, and that sacrifices must be made by all sections of the community. I am prepared to meet every item in a fair spirit, and I hope that this Parliament wilt do the same. I do not wish to be misconstrued. The position of Australia is very grave, and we must be careful in regard to what we do, because later on we shall be judged by our present' actions. I have already quoted some words from Byroni I shall quote a few more lines from that poet. He saysWhat Athens was in science, Borne in power, What Tyre nppear'd in her meridian hour, .'TiB thine at once, fair Albion! to have beenEarth's chief dicta-tress, ocean's lovely queen: But Rome dooay'd and Athens Btrew*d Hie plain, And Tyre's proud piers lie shattered in the main; Like these, thy strength may sink, in ruin hurl'd, And Britain fall, the bulwark of the world. We have to play our part wherever we may be in the British. Empire in order that the bulwark of the world to which Byron referred shall continue to he what it has heen in the past. Progressreported.
