(2) Is it possible for an individual with $100,000 in assets, apart from the family home, to invest in a complying income stream and still claim the full age pension. (3) Is it possible for a couple who retire with $500,000 in superannuation to invest $200,000 in a qualifying annuity and still qualify for a part age pension. (4) If sums invested in qualifying annuities have been excluded from the means test is there a limit on the amount that can be invested. (5) If there is no limit on the amount that can be invested in a complying annuity, can a couple invest (a) $300,000, (b) $500,000, (c) $700,000 or (d) $lm and still qualify for a part pension. (6) Are tests carried out before approving companies or individuals to provide long-dated annuities; if so, what. (7) Are large income earners who pay little or no tax in Australia able to be major equity holders in companies that provide long-dated annuities. (8) What impact will the new rules have on the number of persons receiving the age pension. (9) Did the Minister state that she does not want to see $1,000,000 retirees on the age pension; if so, what assurances can the Minister give that this is not occurring.",146
23,Mr ANTHONY,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the follow'i-g - nswer to the honourable member's question: (l) Retired individuals who hold an approved lifetime or long dated annuity, can successfully claim the age pension providing they meet the residency, age and means test requirements. These NA requirements can be found on the Centrelink Internet site at http://www.Centrelinkgov.auJ (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) No. (5) (a) (b) (c) and (d). Yes, providing they are otherwise qualified to receive payments under the income and assets test. The income and asset test limits can be found in the Centrelink Internet site at http://www.Centrelinkgov.auJ (6) The Treasurer has advised that paragraph 9(1)(d) of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (the Act) provides that a contract that provides for the payment of an annuity for a term not dependent on the continuance of human life but exceeding the term prescribed by the regulations constitutes a life insurance policy. The Life Insurance Regulations state that the prescribed term is ten years. A consequence of the above provisions is that only registered life companies may issue annuities with a term greater than ten years. Further, registration of companies is undertaken by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in accordance with the Act. Subsection 21(3) of the Act provides the grounds on which APRA may refuse to register a company as a life company. (7) The Treasurer has advised that the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 restricts a person's (or company's) shareholding in a life insurance companies to 15 per cent of the voting capital. The Treasurer may approve a higher percentage limit on national interest grounds. Approval under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 may also be required. (8) It is not possible to accurately estimate the impact of the new rules on the number of customers who will receive age pension. The behavioural responses to the 20 September 1998 changes are complex and varied and cannot be modelled·with any degree of accuracy. For that reason, no allowance has been built into the age pension forward estimates for changes in customer numbers arising from the 20 September 1998 initiative, beyond the estimated initial impact on existing customers. (9) No. However, the Minister did express concern that financial planners were advertising that you could be a millionaire and still get a social security pension.",148
