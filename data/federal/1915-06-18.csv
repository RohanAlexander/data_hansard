2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"So far as my knowledge goes, it was a conversion loan, and not affected by the agreement between us and the States. REFERENDUM LEGISLATION.",4
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister, in view of what he has spoken of as the urgency of getting the Estimates passed, if he will agree to make their consideration the only business for the time being, leaving the other important proposals which are on the notice-paper to be dealt with later on their merits?",4
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,As regards the formal introduction of certain Bills,4
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is not for m a l .,4
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Then it is the more necessary that their introduction shall be made part of the business.,4
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should like an answer to my question. honourable member will , I think, see on reflection that what he has said is not an answer. My question to him-and I put it in all.sincerity, and beg of him to consider it seriously-is whether he will put aside what he regards as the formal stages of certain Bills, but what we do not so regard, and agree not to persevere with those proposals, u n t i l the Estimates are through the House?",4
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am unable to do that, notwithstanding the request of the right honourable member. If it is . a challenge to the Government I accept it .",4

10,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA B,"for Sir JOHN FORREST)' asked the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticeIn the report of the EnRineer-in-Chief for Houways, placed on the table of the Senate on the 10th instant, it is Btated- "" The conveyance of water from the Mount Charlotte Reservoir and the bore at 344 miles, in pipes along the line, has been fully inquired into and is impracticable ""- (1) Why is it impracticable ? (2) If the Mount' Charlotte Reservoir is not high enough for gravitation could not the water gravitate from the Bullsbulling Reservoir T",4
11,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA B,This proposal was considered to be impracticable on account of its cost.,4

This nae been completed for some time, and a considerable quantity of water has been conserved. The other, an excavated tank, is completed except lining and roofing. , 3. There are. no other tanks in the western end, but in the eastern end one has been completed at 53 miles, and about 500,000 gallons of water conserved. The principal supply of water in the eastern side is from wells. The r i g h t ASSIGNMENT OF WAGES. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (for Mr.. KELLY) asked the Treasurer, upon notice-.

COROWA RIFLE - RANG E,  Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether the Minister will establish a miniature rifle range in connection with the drill hall proposed to be constructed at Corowa, New South Wales?",4
14,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA B,"Yes . TEMPORARY CLERKS,",5
15,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA B,"for Mr RRUCE SMITH ) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeWill he inform the House what steps have yet been taken, or are contemplated, in order to make temporary clerks who have been employed for some years in the Federal Public 'Service permanent public servants? Mr ' FISHER - No steps have been taken, and none are in contemplation. FEDERAL CAPITA L DESIGN. '. MrJ GREENE (for Mr RKUCE SMITH .asked the-. Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Is it true, as stated by Mr Griffin correspondence laid on the table, that ' made for the carrying out of his plans had exaggerated to the extent of 300 per cent.? 2. Who made these estimates? 3. Has the Minister taken steps to alleged exaggeration confirmed, or falsified ' impartial _ quantity experts ? .! i i If. not, will he lhave those estimates mitted to such experts as soon as practicable?",5
16,Mr ARCHLRALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA B,"It is not known to what Mr Griffin, refers. Parliament to refer these matters to Public. Works Committee f o quiry, I am removing them from departmental investigation and giving the fullest .opportunity for refuting any alleged erroneous statements. TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES.",5
17,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA B,"for Mr RKUCE SMITH asked the Prime Minister, tipon noticeIs he aware that the Public Service Inspector of New South Wales is presenting a printed ' form to every man seeking temporary employto;? ment, informing him that before being stained as a possible employee he must become - a member' of 'some trades union, and that, unless he replies in the affirmative within 1 seven-days, his .name will, be struck off the of candidates? - Mr FISHER - The answer to the honourable member's question isNo. The Public Service Commissioner advises that the instructions issued to all Inspectors were that a communication,be.sent to . all persons at present on the register .for temporary employment asking , for. replies, to the following questions:- , -, 1. Are you a member of. a trades union or industrial organization?. . - 2. If so, state name of union or organization; adding that if no reply is received within seven .days the person will be deemed to be a non-unionist, and will be so recorded until he notifies to the contrary. : TRA DE UNIONIST SOLDIERS. ! Mr FLEMING asked the Prime M i nister, upon noticeAs none of the fifteen questions put to persons enlisting before attestation for service - abroad elicit the information as to whether the person' enlisting is or is not a member of a trades union, will he state the source of information which enabled him to state that 70 per cent, of those who have gone to the front are trade unionists? . Mr FISHER - I would be obliged if f the honourable member would furnish me ) with details of the report alleged, viz., that I stated that ."" 70 per cent, of those who have gone to the front are trade in the unionists."" I might, however, direct the estimates honourable - member's attentiont o an been article, in the Argus of 25th March, 1915, - quoting the. result of inquiries made by have this the Commonwealth Statistician from ; by trade .unionsthroughout the Commonwealth,, which showed that of the number subqf unionists.in the Commonwealth eligible '.for active, service, 6.77 per cent, had enlisted in. the. Expeditionary Forces, while In asking of the number ofother persons eligible the by. age and not members of unions 4 per r public in - cent. had. enlisted. WOUNDED SOLDIERS. . Mr GROOM asked the Assistant Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon .notice- - Whether he will endeavour to arrange that ) in the message sent to the Department notifying that an Australian soldier is wounded, that information should also be sent of the hospital in which the wounded person is being attended enter- . . Mr JENSEN - The answer to the adding honourable member's question isI t is not thought that this request is feasible list when the nature of the task is considered. It r has to be borne in' mind that immediately a wounded man is discovered, the first consideration is to tend his wounds, and, according to the degree of severity, he would be despatched to the nearest hospital that could efficiently deal with the case. In the course of a few days, and as Boon as able to be moved, he would, in all probability, be removed to some other centre, so as to make room for fresh cases from the front. These hospitals are scattered over a wide area, including the iEgean Sea, Dardanelles, Alexandria, Cairo, Assouan, Malta; while many of the wounded are in or en route to England. The lists of wounded would be compiled as the men were despatched from the scene of operations, and the compiling officers would, in all probability, not have the slightest idea of their destination. - In view, therefore, of the fact that wounded must, in - most cases, necessarily be moving on from hospital to hospital, it is not deemed to be of any practical value to delay the notification of our casualties while the information is being obtained. Information is now being obtained from different sources showing the hospitals in which numbers of the wounded are located, and this is transmitted to next-of-kin from time to time as received. SLAUGHTER OF FEMALE CALVES.",5
18,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA B,"On the 10th inst. the honourable member for Oxley askedHas the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs been called to that portion of Mr. .Justice Street's report in which he lays stress upon the unrestricted slaughter of female calves, and suggests that some legislation should be brought in dealing with the matter? Has the Minister communicated with the respective State Governments with the object of carrying out Mr Justice Street's recommendation? I was unable to answer the question at the moment, but I have now ascertained that letters were sent to the Premiers of the States on the 30th A p r i l , 1915, giving figures in regard to female stock slaughtered at export works, and suggesting that on the return of normal climatic conditions action be taken by the States to restrain the indiscriminate slaughter of female stock. The collectors have been directed to forward monthly returns of the number of female stock slaughtered for export. Totals for the year 1914 have been supplied, and details are available from the 1st January, 1915. NA (TRADEANDCOMMERCE ) BILL . national safety. Motion (by Mr HUGHE S) proposed - That leave be given to bring in a Bill Act to alter paragraph (i.) of section 51 Constitution.",6
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [10.44] - I move an amendment That the following words be added :- "" as soon as adequate provision has been made by the united energies of the Government"" and Parliament for the successful prosecution of the war."" OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",6
20,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is a motion of want of confidence. Several other honourable members interjecting,",6
21,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is quite evident from the interjections across the chamber that there is a little excitement this morning. I appeal to honourable members not to continue in that strain, because it will compel me to take very severe action, which I do not desire to do. I ask honourable members on both sides of the House to assist me in maintaining order.",6
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On e grows accustomed to these taunts from honourable members on the Ministerial side in relation to this matter; therefore, one interjection here and there does not matter very much. I rise this moming to do my duty as I conceive it , and although there has been no formal consultation to decide on the steps to be taken- I desire that to be distinctly understood- I believe that in the amendment I have moved I am interpreting the sentiments of the bulk of the honourable members on this side of the House. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear! .",6
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I believe I am voicing the sentiments of at least half the members on the Government side.,6
24,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You are speaking for the Employers Federation.,6
25,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order !,6
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I desire to urge reasons why this party strife should not be entered .upon in this Chamber at the present crisis in the Empire's history. Assuredly any one reading the newspapers must be impressed with the gravity of the international situation, but beyond all else there comes to us from over the seas a call to suspend party politics and concentrate our united energies on the prosecution of the war to a successful conclusion. That is the supreme matter of In the first place I ask myself whether for an the Constitution ought to be amended of the when 60,000 citizens are at the war, and unable to vote. - Mr Fenton - They will vote at the front. Several honourable members interjecting,",6
27,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I again appeal to honourable members to discontinue these interjections. The honourable member for Parramatta bas appealed to me for protection against this continuous interruption. If honourable members persist in these tactics I shall he obliged to take a course to prevent further disorder of the kind.,7
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members on the Government side have fought many valiant battles to acquire for the people of Australia the right to determine, without let or hindrance, their own destiny as far as it is possible for them to do so under the laws of the country in which we live, but there is the outnot believe it. standing fact that 60,000 of our citizens have left these shores to fight for the safety of the remainder in Australia, and by these proposals the Government are submitting the most supreme of all questions, the Constitution which governs them as well as us, and which fixes the destiny of all of us, to a referendum of people in the absence of those soldiers, and without affording them the privilege of voting on the issue. Surely that is a complete subversion of democratic rule aud principle. Moreover it is a political crime of the deepest dye against those brave fellows who are fighting at the front. Ought the Constitution to be amended in the absence of 60,000 of our citizens who are fighting for their lives, and, above all, for our lives? Is it treating those soldiers fairly to persevere with these proposals at this time? The 4,000,000 people living at home in safety are asked to decide this great issue in the absence of the 60,000 who are at the front helping to keep the fire-sides of the 4,000,000 warm and safe. I care not of what complexion the absent vote may be. Honourable members opposite claim that it would be a labour vote. Let it be so; I am not concerned with that point, but I am concerned with the fact that 60,000 men are deprived of the right to vote, and were not told that in their absence the Constitution would be altered, and made a different sort of instrument altogether. That is my first indictment against this procedure of the Government - that on democratic grounds these men have as much right to be consulted in the alteration of our Constitution as we who are still in the country have.",7
29,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There will be 100,000 there before the Rill is through.",7
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If what we are told is correct, before these Bills are submitted, there will be 80,000 soldiers away from these shores. Is this procedure fair to them?",7
31,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Provisio n was made for the Canadians who were at the front to vote, and they did vote.",7
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do honourable members think that it is possible to make provision for voting in the trenches?,7
33,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Canadians were in the trenches, and they did vote.",7
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I simply do,7
35,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You mean to say that I am telling a lie; but they did.,7
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say that I do not believe that they were able to vote. In the meantime all we are doing in Australia is to talk about the reconstruction the of a house while the house is burning. Is this the time to be tinkering with its reconstruction-wit h its alteration here and there in detail? Surely the first thing you should do is to get the fire engines, and to devote all your energies to putting the fire out. Then, afterwards, you may do what you will with its structural position. If there be one man more than another who sees the light in this respect it is the Attorney-General, who is in charge of these Bills. No man saw it more clearly than he did a little while ago. I cannot do better than quote his language.",7
37,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You could not see it then.,7
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was at a time when there was no Parliament in existence, when it was not possible to do what he suggested. Now it is possible. There is a Government, there is a Parliament, and all we are asking is that this Parliament should concentrate its energies upon the supremest of all questions, putting away these considerations until we are able to devote ourselves to them without the intrusion of the war. On the 11th August, the Attorney-General statedFor the time being there is but one issue It wa's not this issue either. It is clear what the one issue wasFor the time being there is but one issuethe war, aud upon this we are united. We cannot criticise. What then remains. How can Mr Cook consult us and we co-operate with him, and at the same time go on with party warfare. We cannot at once have party warfare ' and united action.",7
39,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear! What d id you say to that?",8
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I said to that what I - say now.,8
41,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I will read what you said on the first occasion. ' Mr JOSE PH COOK - I wish you would. Then the Attorney-General went on' We cannot go on to the platform and denounce the Government, and at the same time work with the Government. The choice lies between party and the welfare of the nation. It rests with Mr Cook to make his choice. He says party strife must continue throughout the Empire. His is the only voice that says so. I say that, throughout the Empire today, his-the Attorney-General's of Australia-is the only voice that says party strife must continue. May I in this connection call honourable members' attention . to the weighty words of the Imperial Prime Minister, which came to us only yesterday, and I want to put the two statements in contrast, because they seem to me to so completely put the setting of things as we are seeing them today, after ten months of war? If things were serious then, and the honourable member was so anxious to stop party strife, so anxious to help us to do everything in the prosecution of the war, surely matters are even more serious today. . Speaking in the light of this graver situation, Mr Asquith uses this languageI come reluctantly to think that there should be a' broadening of the basis of Government, so as to remove even a semblance of a one-sided party character. That would demonstrate to our people at Home, our fellow-subjects across the seas, to our Allies and enemies, as well as neutrals, that the British people were more resolute than ever in their one aim and purpose. Mr Asquith states also that they were determined to obliterate all distinctions until every personal and political, as well as moral and material, force was devoted to the prosecution of the Empire's cause. The Prime Minister of Great Britain stated, in fact, that the national emergency demanded the unreserved and whole-hearted co-operation of all parties. Its Government was reconstructed, so as to intimate to the British people over the seas that there was not a shred of party difference in Great Britain . Everything savouring of party has been put away. Everything is being concentrated with the one object of effectively prosecuting the war. Contrast this with the statement of our Prime Minister. He saysWe are not here as children playing in a dangerous place.",8
42,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear!",8
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to have that confirmation of his attitude. We are not here as children playing in a dangerous place, likely to be attacked by the enemy. If we do not exercise our power and authority whilst we are practically at peace, when shall we? That was a scandalous statement for the Prime Minister to make, but the Prime Minister repeats it here, and now. '",8
44,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear!",8
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I tell him to his shame and scandal,8
46,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Order ! The honourable member must not use language of that description, and I ask him not to repeat it .",8
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I withdraw it . I ask the House to look at this statement. Are we practically at peace? Is this the attitude of the Government? Is it the attitude of the party behind the Government that we are practically at peace? And that there is no let or hindrance to our proceeding with our ordinary party programmes and party propaganda? Here is the statement, repeated and emphasized, this morning, that there is no dangerthat we are practically at peace, and, therefore, that we should not be obsessed, as the Attorney-General was nine months ago, with the one idea of the war,, but that our first business here should be the perpetuation of party conflict, puttingthis great national war as far into the background as possible. I should like our men in the trenches to hear this statement by the Prime M in ister. They would tell hi m a differenttale.",8
48,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear!",8
49,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are like a lot of heathens.,8
50,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have appealed several times to honourable members to refrain from interjecting; but various expressions continue to be hurled across the chamber. I ask honourable members to desist, and give them timely warning that if they persist in disregarding my request, I shall probably hear, in an official sense, one or two of these interjections.",8
51,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I desire, Mr Speaker, to draw your attention to a n ' objectionable epithet applied by the honourable member for Wakefield to the Prime Minister. . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - To the whole of the Government side.",9

58,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I had just appealed to the honourable member to withdraw the expression, and as an old parliamenfirst tarian he must recognise that offence was a thousand times worse than the original one. I tell honourable mem bers on both sides that if they defy the direction of the Chair I shall take a course that will prevent any recurrence cf such conduct. The honourable member for Wakefield in the further statement that he made was insulting not only to me, but to the whole House.",9
59,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,As a matter of personal explanation,9

However, , I was speaking of the gravity of the situation. I repeat that, in my judgment, the international position was never so grave as at this moment. Do honourable members realise that, as a result of all our struggles to date, we are just about where we were eight months ago? I was reading in the Times only the other day a carefully-drawn statement by the military correspondent of that journal, who declares emphatically, aiter Pigott, H. R. M. full investigation, that we have not moved one foot further forward in Flanders than we were six months ago. Surely we cannot go on as we are, with all our resources here, and the resources of the Empire, yet unorganized ? We cannot, surely, proceed calmly to the perpetuation of our party strife, and the carrying on of our party propaganda, as if there were no war? I confess I do not understand such an idea; to me it is inexplicable. The Attorney-General speaks of August last, and says that, because T then took up a certain attitude, he is justified in taking up that same attitude now. Meantime, I do wish my honourable friend, if he will, to realise what is going on.",10
84,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do realise it .,10

86,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I realise that.,10

Bean, our own correspondent, tells of the tremendous struggle that is going on, and his article is headed in both papers, ""Wanted , More M e n ! "" Here is our own correspondent in the field sending an appeal for more men; and yet the Prime Minister tells us that we are at peace, and should get on with our business^-that there is no danger-that we are not in a dangerous position. This I cannot understand. I am inclined to think that the right honourable gentleman does not read of what is going on, or he would not make such statements. Times has, I suppose, the best military correspondent on the Continent today, and he tells us that, as the result of our efforts-as the result of our sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of lives, and the desolation of hundreds of thousands of homes-w e are practically where we were, except that our resources are being gradually better organized. Then, again, my newspaper this morning informs me about a battle in Galicia. In reading these cables, we must remember that all have been heavily censored-that much has been taken out-and yet we are permitted to know that the Russians are being heavily tried. Reading between the lines, that means-if it means anything at all-that the Russians are being beaten right out once more. We are told of a British advance, and of some trenches having been taken; but a little further on, General French reports thab these trenches were retaken by the Germans. These are all heavily censored messages, it must be remembered, and this is the news that is coming to us every day. Let me read it SHELLS FOE THE ARMY. LABOUR TO BE MOBILIZED. ABOLITION OF UNION RESTRICTIONS. And let us not forget that the abolition of union restrictions at Home is being agreed to by the union leaders.",10

89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , I see our old friend Ben Tillett, than whom I suppose there has never beena more flaming propagandist in the interests of all that relates to the well-being of the worker, has been on a visit to the front , and he makes this statement in the paper this morning in the course of an interview in Paris on his return-, I have learned"" a new meaning for the word "" strike."" We have got to strike now, and with every ounce of British grit, energy, gold, and brains behind the blow. When the workers of England realise the situation, they will get' their coats oil, and give our soldiers the proper backing. We want shells and gas, and every death-dealing device conceivable. "" Give our soldiers the proper backing."" That ought to be the keynote of our action here.",11
90,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",11
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member say that we can give our soldiers the proper backing while we are discussing these proposals here, and in The dulging in this party warfare?",11
92,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why should it be party warfare ?,11
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why should it be party warfare? For the simple reason that it is intended by the honourable member to be party warfare. It is in tended by the Government to carry out the decision of the Inter-State Conference in Adelaide the other day.,11
94,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not so.,11
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is intendedto carry out the party propaganda on which they have consulted the country a number of times, but have refused to take the country's decision. Why should it be party warfare? Surely the honourable member, as well as his leader, has his tongue in his cheek when he asks should these referenda be the subject of party warfare.",11
96,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do ask it .,11
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thes e proposals aim at the radical alteration of our Constitution by the complete elimination of the Federal principle, and yet the honourable member asks, "" Why should it be regarded as a party question?"" Is there any other question in the whole purview of our party relations which has.one tithe of the party tincture that these questions have? How absurd, therefore, is the statement that this is not a party matter. Besides, this is only a new cry. Hitherto these question's have always been regarded as the dividing line-as marking the great distinction between parties in this Commonwealth ; but now that the war is overshadowing us the honourable member makes the appeal that they should be regarded as a great national matter, and not as a party issue at all. I repeat that our part of the Empire is the only one where this kind of thing is taking place. What for? What is the motive underlying it? Members opposite, of course, say that the cost of living is going up. But is not the cost of living going up everywhere in the world just now ? Is not the cost of living in Australia up just now because of the drought? Would not the cost of living have been up had there been no war? What has the war done in Australia, so far as our financial relations are concerned? So far as our business relations are concerned, with one or two singular exceptions, we have had enough money to finance ourselves. There never was a war conducted where there was so much available money, and so many business operations, as there are at present in connection with this war. I venture to say that the war is not responsible for the increase in the cost of living in Australia, except to a slight extent, and that slight extent is far below the extent to which prices have risen all over the world. For instance, we are told that the price of beef is up, and the honourable member for Indi asked a series of questions as to the increase in Victoria, carefully singling out those articles affected by the drought-beef , bread, sugar, and such like things; Well, as to beef, may I remind honourable members what they probably read in the papers only yesterday, that beef in Austria is 3s. 4d. per lb. There is a result of the war if you like. And I say that, considering that a world war is being waged, we ought to be profoundly thankful that beef is no higher than it is in Australia today. That is my feeling in this matter. And I want to know now how will these referenda proposals, if carried, help to bring prices down ? Is it necessary to tear up our Constitution and interfere with our preparations for war because the price of beef is a little high just now? Surely there is a strange want of proportion in the settir-g of the whole case.",11
98,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Attorney-General recognises that he has power already.,12
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Besides , Mr. Justice Street has delivered the final word on this matter of beef prices. He says that, after a full investigation, the Trusts aimed at in this propaganda are not causing any injury to Australia so far as our present beef prices are concerned. Then we are told that there is a sugar monopoly ; but yet the other day, on thefloorof this House, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was careful to tell us that we had cheaper sugar in Australia than anywhere else in the world.",12
100,Mr RODGEKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Cheape r than before the war.,12
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , that is a fact. The Minister himself had to admit in Adelaide that there were worse combines than the Sugar Combine. Well, let it be so. But cannot these combines wait a little longer while we are finishing this combine of the Germans and the Austrians? That is the combine we have to face just now, for that is the combine the removal of which brooks of no delay. It will submit to no arbitration. It has to be fought out and down before there can be national peace again. And then we are told that the price of bread is up. I regret that bread is up a little, but, surely,, it is because of the drought and not because of the war. In Sydney the Necessary Commodities Commission the other day decided not to grant the bakers any further increase in. the price of the loaf. Will any one say that in war time a 4^d. loaf is a thing to require the elimination of the Federal principle from our Constitution? Can it be said, that because bread is temporarily dear, that is a reason for entering at this time of all others upon a great constitutional struggle? These are the cases that honourable members opposite cite. I want to see cheap beef, cheap sugar, and cheap bread, but I say you will not make them one whit cheaper by political strife.",12
102,Mr HAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But you will by political action.,12
103,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Attorney-General says that he has all the power at present.,12
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All I have to say in reply to the honourable member for Bendigo is that, between his party and the five Labour parties of the States, they have all the political power they require at present. What they have not got in this Parliament, their confreres have in the States. Between them they have a totality of the political power of the Continent.",12
105,Mr BURNS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How can they exercise that power with the Legislative Councils constituted as at present.,12
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not wish to discuss that matter now. In my judgment the Labour party have the power. What power you have not in the Federal Parliament you have in the States. What the Commonwealth Labour Governcrisis. ment have not got, the Labour Governover the world. ment of the States have, and it is only a question of distribution. I come back to my main point. urge the ceasing of party strife u n t i l the gaged. war is over. Then all these matters will fall into their proper place, and we may resume our former relations, dividing ourselves on party lines, and proceeding at our leisure with the discussame sion of these great questions, which can in Great Britain . then be considered in the calm, cold light of reason, with our judgment unperturbed by the war or any outside disturbance. What has occurred elsewhere? these referendum proposals of more tish pressing importance to the Labour party here than is Home Rule to the Irish? Yet we find Mr Redmond cordially acquiescing in the postponement of consideration of that question until war is over, and concentrating his divided attention, and that of his lowers, on assisting Mr Asquith, Mr their political platform. Bonar Law, and Sir Edward Carson, bitter, life-long opponents, and asking questions about party propaganda. have here in Melbourne a further evidence in the attitude of the Age newspaper of how during this life-and-death struggle the higher patriotism can prevail over every other consideration. When the Age and the Argus lie down together, and drop their - party strife, there must surely be some overmastering compulsion upon them both. I think that i a noble statement for the Age to publish when it renounced yesterday its right to the immediate revision of - the Tariff until the conclusion of the war. wonder whether that is the reason for alteration in the tactics of my friends opposite. They have been telling us ever since the session began that the moment the Estimates were out of the way the consideration of the Tariff would be first business taken. Now it is no longer fco be the Tariff, but we are to have referendum proposals. What has caused the change? It is a change in tactics only, and I am pleading for a bigger change. Not only do I want the Tariff to be left alone until after the war, we are made secure, but I desire that be truly said of the other side. these greater questions shall also be l e over, so that they may at the proper time be considered. The press of Australia has set us an example which I think should follow in this time of national What I propose is happening all Hitter, unrelenting Socialists have joined the Cabinets of Continental nations for the better proseI cution of the war in which they are ear Where shall we find one more devoted to Socialism than the present Minister of War in the Belgian Cabineta man of life-long convictions, who has sacrificed everything for his ideas. The thing has happened in France and A r t h u r Henderson, the Leader of the British Labour party,has joined hands with Mr Bonar Law. He has put all party considerations aside, and is urging his confreres outside to do A r e the same. He, as a member of the B r i Cabinet, is devoting all his energies to the speedy ending of the war, and they are doing the same. This Labour Government and the party that supports it the are the one Government, and the one the partu in the Empire who are prosecuting unnot a national, but a party war, who folgive party matters the first place on It is against that that I protest in the most earnest no way that I may, and for that reason, We alone, have I moved the amendment.",12
107,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.37] - We have had this morning in this Chamber additional evidence of the patriotism of the Opposition. I am glad that we have had it . I felt that this was coming, because there is a long trail of events leadt was ing up to this action. The evidence is to be had not only in this Chamber, but outside as well. The Leader of the Opposition complains that while the newsI papers and certain influential people are the saying so-and-so, we are doing something different. We were sent here for that purpose. We are here to do justice to the people, and to fulfil the pledges that we gave when the issue was fought before the the country. I wish to pin the right honourable gentleman down' to the statement the which he interpolated just now, when he said that I had admitted this morning that the first duty of this Government was to its party. I have not said that, and it is not so with us on this side. But and there is abundant evidence that it may Day f t after day, the press, which voices the poll-tical opinions of the Opposition, not those of the Labour party, has attacked the we most prominent and the best Minister iri Australia-the Minister of Defence- a man who is most embarrassed at the. sent time, and who has done most during his Ministerial life to provide for the effective and efficient defence of Australia. He is a native of this country, and his name will probably endure ldnger that of any one yet known, because of ability and sincerity. What is the pep© and intention of the amendment?",13
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,To fight this spirit to the death.,14
109,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Government had agreed to a coalition, which is a magcould be said. nificent method of doing nothing for a long time, there would have been no trouble and no display of feeling. Had the right honourable member for Parrament matta and those sitting with him been returned to power ab the last election, they would have scorned to take the adwelfare vice of the Labour party. I charge myself with neglect of duty in matter. I fel t at the last election whatever the consequeuces might be, the courage of the men in office, notwithform standing their great ability, only oozed out on party matters. When the great issue of war Tell upon us, the responsinot very generous. bility was not gripped by them with both hands, as we expected it to be gripped. I do not question their patriotism intentions, nor their readiness to sacrifice themselves could they bring the war to fair. a close, b ut I challenge their political actions and the help that they are supof posed to have given to this Government since we have been in office. To come to the business of the House, I have redone, strained my colleagues in the Ministry from pressing on with business to enable the Opposition to get what is called "" full fling."" I have pleaded with Leader of the Opposition and with others to allow us to get the Estimates through, so that we might deal with the business the session. Again and again we have always. failed to do so. Days and weeks have passed, and we are no further forward. Now comes an outburst of patriotism from the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him , in the shape of a mocourse ; to pursue. tion of want of confidence. The great Dr Johnson had something to say about that kind of patriotism. I have these tactics before in this Chamber. have seen honourable members who had gone to the country on issues to which they were diametrically opposed, and who and had denounced each other's policy, when should seeking election, coalesce and fuse to opprepose the reform policy of the Labour party. Those to whom I refer went back on their pledges to their constituents, and would have governed the country contrary to the wishes of the people if than they had had the power. A remnant of his that party forms part of the Opposition purto-day, and their ideas still prevail. In office all is well; out of office nothing party is right. That is their history.",14

115,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As regards the efforts the Ministry to provide means for the successful carrying on of the war, nothing has been done that ought not to have been and nothing has been left undone that ought to have been done-for party reasons. The ideas of honourable members a of the Opposition, and persons outside the Parliament, have been investigated and dealt with. The policy of the Government is that the preparation for the conduct of of the war is our first duty now and We may be wrong, we may have committed errors, and we may have overlooked certain things, but we have never been lax; we have ever been vigilant in trying to discover the best But day after day in this Parliament, and through the organs of the press-and I may remind seen honourable members opposite that in the I newspapers they have a thousand pipe organs by comparison with our puny whistles-ther e have been suggestions criticisms as to what we do.

Before the war broke I said, at Colac, that the situation Europe looked most unsatisfactory, that if , in the tur n of events, it become the duty of the Mother Country to resort to arms, we in Australia should give her our most kindly and sympathetic consideration; and, in the final resort, after everything that wisdom could gest and honour permit had been done vain fco maintain peace, it would be the duty of the Australian bourne. people generally to provide last man and last shilling to help i struggle.

129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In the meantime, any man. you say that he did not speak in your half ?",16
130,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My view then was, it is now, having been confirmed over over again, that the character of Government made it impossible for to carry on the war, or anything else, cessfully. They were a Government who sought to conciliate every interest, to do nothing that would disturb their political existence or make any suggeslimit tions that would alienate one vote. That is not the way in which to conduct a Gothat vernment during a crisis. Ten times better is it to say "" yes"" here, "" n o "" there, and take the consequences. One statement only did I make regarding our attitude upon the war issues, and think that, as a party, we have adhered to our word. Now we turn to the party proof gramme. We have emphasized above original everything else the fact that the present Constitution is an unworkable and imposthe sible instrument to do its duty to the people. Every day our sitting of this House opens with a prayer that we other may be able to do something for two the true welfare of the people of Australia, and every day that petition goes unheeded by members of the Opposition, even when the opportunity afforded them. I defy any honourable member opposite to point to a single piece of Labour legislation that has not done good; indeed, much of it has done the soldiers who are fighting at the front. all the good we predicted of it . But every one of those measures has been nounced by the honourable members who there today are challenging the position of the hy it. Government. Let me deal now with the great point in the argument"" of the ral Constitution? Leader of the Opposition, that the sons of Australia and the Mother Country are in the trenches fighting for the honour and glory of the Empire and our Allies, and that, therefore, we should cease in this Parliament. Was that a condition imposed by our soldiers when they ento listed? The honourable member for Parramatta waxed enthusiastic about the soldiers fighting in the trenches, is patriotism in fighting the battles one's country qualified by conditions? Any man who has taken the oath of allegiance knows that he goes to the front to perform his duties and to give his life if he is asked to do so, and that is the highest honour that can be given to If it can be arranged that beour soldiers at the front may make their voices heard on the referenda proposals, I as shall be glad. My whole life has been and spent fighting in order that every the late person might have a say in the them government of his country. What such as been the attitude of honourable members opposite? Their political lives and and the lives of persons holding their views, have been spent in endeavouring to the citizenship of their country, in setting up the paltry, outrageous pretence they, being superior individuals, possessed of property, should have two votes and whilst others had none. The occasion may be recalled, when my honourable friend, the member for Maranoa, with I thousands of the. best men in. Australia, worked throughout the harvest leading a nomadic life, after having been deprived their rights of citizenship. I saw an letter from a justice of the peace in one of the districts concerned, asking Minister to take the names of these men off the roll because they were Labour. That came from a magistrate, and yet individual citizens could get seventyvotes, with which they were able to vote in every electorate in Queensland.",16
131,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What has that to is do with this question?,16

Is he prepared to submit to a referendum the question of whether we should have party warfare during this Parliament?",17
139,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am against putting to the country hy referendum any question as to whether party interests shall be observed or not, for this reason: The people by whom we were elected assume that we are honest as well, as patriotic.

We might go with those who are moving honourable members, and live happily ever afterwards at the expense of the progress of this country. Far better to die an honourable death.

141,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ! Mere shouters for the Empire have been too much in evidence recently. The merits of the question on which this amendment is moved are not involved at all by this proceeding. This amendment amounts to nothing more than a vote of no-confidence in the Government. It . can have no other object than a political object. It cannot add one penny to our financial resources; it cannot bring a. single man more into the firing .line. If it. does anything at all it can only disturb the public mind. My last words are not to this House; they are to the citizens of Australia, to the fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters of this country upon whom depend largely what troops and equipment shall be sent to the front; upon whom will rest the responsibility of raising the forces that we need. Notwithstanding any political disturbance that may arise, the hearts of the people. I believe, are beating true, irrespective of politics, irrespective of party warfare. The nation is in trouble. We are determined to see the trouble through; and, having provided all these forces of both men and money, it is our business to proceed with the ordinary work of government, and especially is it our business^ in my opinion, to proceed with this necessary amendment of the Constitution, so as to enable the Commonwealth Government to give effect to the will of the people, and to protect the people's interests.",17

I am not going to speaK of the matters which the. Prime Minister referred to as having occurred in the past. Surely the present, and the immediate future, contain problems sufficient for us without raking up party animosities arising out of what has been done long ago. What is the meaning of this amendment? It does not imply a refusal to permit the consideration of amendments to the Constitution. It is not directed against the introduction of these measures. It seeks that their discussion and consideration-involvin g as this does the most bitter political conflict that can possibly be raised in Australia at the present time-be postponed until adequate provision has been made by the united energies of the Government and the Parliament, for the successful prosecution of this war. The Prime Minister, in the course of his speech, referred - true , the reference was made in language which was not a direct accusation-bu t his reference left the imputation that this amendment had been launched with a view of displacing the Government, and of enabling those who support the amendment to take their places.

During the Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - I did not "" say "" anything; I simply asked a quest i o n ; and, although the ordinary rules of courtesy in this House prevent me from expressing my disbelief in any thing that is actually said here, I , like every member of the public, am entitled, notwithstanding the Attorney-General's denial, to form my own conclusion as to the necessary inference to be drawn from the facts. What is the present position? It is one of the defects of the system under which my honourable friends opposite conduct But- their parliamentary proceedings, the system by which they are appointed, and through which they gain their places in It is this House, that they are given, from time to time, general sailing orders by a political Conference. They have now placed over them a political executive, the object of which, as stated in the motion published in the press, is to see that the resolutions and objectives of the Conference are carried out by the Labour party in this Parliament. One of the objectives of that Conference is the immediate introduction of these Bills. The Attorney-General now wishes to appear as a free, responsible Minister, acting upon his own judgment in introducing this Bill .",18
147,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I say that emphatically.,18
148,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The more emphatically the honourable member makes his denial, the more it comes into striking contrast with the facts as we know them. The Government, acting under the directions of a political Conference which was held some weeks ago, and which itself was composed of representatives who had been appointed some little time before, are now placing these Bills before Parliament, in order to carry into effecta resolution affirmed, I believe, some considerable time ago. I want to show the Government that they are blind if theydo not see that, even within the short space of time that has elapsed since this Conference was held, a complete change' has come over the spirit of the peoplethat a complete change has come over the views of a large number of those who placed the Labour party in power. I read this from a hundred different signs. I know it from my own personal experience. Less than a week ago, I had the privilege of addressing a huge gathering consisting, as I am assured, and firmly believe, to a large extent of people who are either direct supporters of, or sympathizers with, the Labour party in this Parliament. And I can assure honourable members that that gathering was unanimous and most enthusiastic in the determination that there should be an end to this wretched party conflict until the war is over. The Prime Minister made the statement that this Government had done all they could to aid the Mother Country; that they had given to the Mother Country kindly and sympathetic consideration. Good heavens! are we blind? Are honourable members opposite blind to the danger which hangs over us at the present moment? The Leader of the Opposition has sketched the present position in Europe. Let me deal a little further with it. Any one who reads the newspapers can see that, on the Eastern war frontier, the power of Russia to actively participate for the present in any serious blow against the coalition of our enemies is either broken or being broken, and that before long the 700,000 or 800,000 enemy troops who are in one part of the Galician movement will be thrown back to aid the Germans in their attack upon our own men in Flanders. In addition to that, we must not lose sight of the fact that the cable news which we read in the papers from day to day has been censored, and that what is more, everything is put in the most favourable light to us. That cannot be denied. Our own men who are fighting in the Dardenelles are backing up an almost impossible position. calling to us.",18
149,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I cannot think of any speech more calculated to hearten the Germans in their business than this speech by the honourable member.,19
150,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hurl that accusation back in the honourable member's teeth. If the Attorney-General and his party persist in throwing down this bone of contention, they and their Government will fall under the imputation of not being sincere in carrying on this war. The honourable member knows this and knows it well. Do we not also know that an efficient censorship has been provided in order to enable us here to speak the truth concerning matters affecting the welfare of Australia without danger of information being given to the enemy? The only reasonable conclusion that we can draw from the facts is that the result of this war hangs in the balance, and that we are now at the most critical point in the most dangerous war that has ever threatened our safety. And yet the Prime Minister talks in this way of the Mother Country! What stake has the Mother Country, great as it is, compared with the stake that we in Australia have ? Is there an honourable member opposite who will venture to suggest that if we are beaten in this war Australia will not come tinder the domination of Germany?",19
151,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that the passing or non-passing of these Referenda Bills will decide the great issues of the war?,19
152,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not. It is well-known that I personally would go a long way towards the object that the Government have in view in the desire to enlarge the powers of the Federal Parliament. The passing or non-passing of these referenda proposals, when they are ultimately submitted to the people, will, have no effect on the war. But this invitation to the whole of the people of Australia to engage in what we all know will be a bitter political conflict, will have a very deleterious effect on Australia's share of the war. That is my answer to the honourable member. Several honourable members interjecting,",19
153,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Order ! Honourable members on both sides are again interjecting, notwithstanding my request that they They are should desist. I ask the honourable member for Barrier and the honourable member for Calare to cease interjecting.",19
154,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not intend to occupy much further the time of the House. We desire, in the most emphatic way, to make an appeal to honourable members to open their eyes to the actual situation confronting them. We appeal to the Prime Minister, above all others, to take his courage in both hands and to come forward and lead the people of Australia. He alone is in a position from which he can lead the people of this country along a path that will mean a successful termination to the terrible war which threatens our very existence, and lie should subordinate all other consideratinued tions to that design. I disclaim and repudiate the idea that any political advantage could possibly accrue to the Position from the amendment which has ! )een submitted by our leader. Everyone knows no such advantage could accrue to us, and to use this amendment, as afraid the Prime Minister has done, as means of endeavouring to throw upon us mediate the onus of making a party move in this connection, of raking up ancient and buried subjects of party differences, will not tend to strengthen the Parliament in the duty which lies before it I have only one or two words to add in regard to what the result would be-wha the result would be to the Government supporters-supposin g the British domieven ination were broken and Germany took possession of our country, as most suredly they could, and as most assuredly they would. One would imagine, from what one sometimes hears outside, that when the millions of Germans, who are seeking a fro9 outlet for their energies other countries, entered into this country, the first thing they would do would be enroll themselves in the ranks of the Trades Hall! Why, if they came here, they would come to conquer on the same lines as they have carried on the war. would come here to make our people hewers of wood and drawers of water; and the sooner the people of Australia recognise that fact, the better.",19
155,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear!",20
156,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am glad to learn that the Attorney-General recogfrom nises the fact.,20
157,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have always recognised it, and I was one of the first to point it tion. out.",20
158,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then it not be too frequently asserted from sides of the House. No one can disHouse; pute thab all the ancient rules, not merely as to the civilized conduct of war, but to the treatment of a conquered country, have been cast to the winds by this new force that threatens us. Do not imagine for one moment that if we are beaten, and the Germans come here, they will treat as we treated our former enemies in South Africa.",20
159,Mr HAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why this scare speech,20
160,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Do not be imagine that they will give us, as we gave the Boers, a constitution, and conpossession of our property.",20
161,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Conservatism,20
162,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Le t us Opleave out all talk of Conservatism. Cannot the honourable member for one moment forget the miserable party issues that divide us? Cannot he forget them for I am only one moment? Surely there will be a time hereafter, when we are over this imcrisis, for us to fight thoss battles to the uttermost ? There is no reason why we should not. Considerations that under ordinary circumstances are of great party moment become paltry and insignificant . in the face of the huge danger that threatens us. It has been said that I am t making an alarmist speech; and perhaps I am. If I am, it is because I believe that, now, the great mass of our people in Australia have not realized what this war asmeans to them. And I say that we have not yet done-w e have not yet half done - ou r duty in connection with the war. A ll the united energies of Parliament and people are hardly sufficient to enable us into cope with the enormous difficulties confrontingus without the introduction of to. issues that must split us asunder into parties incapable of harmonious action.",20
163,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Attorney-GeneralWest Sydney) [12.34] - Wit h what the They honourable member for Flinders has just said I entirely agree. The position of this country in regard to the war is such that language cannot exaggerate the danger of our situation. Long before the war broke out, and since it has broken out, I have never disguised from myself, nor others, the danger in which, not only this country, but England, stood. But we are not. now discussing this quesThis morning we are discussing whether certain proposed laws, which the canGovernment desire to submit to the both people, should be brought before the but the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable' member for as Flinders have introduced into'this matter - severel y formal as it is-a n atmosphere which, if it be not party, I do not know what party is. In what way could they have assailed this Government more effecus tively than that in which they have assailed us this morning? What charge could they have levelled against us more ? deadly than that we are not awake to the danger of the nation. If party warfare not the making of charges calculated to damage opponents in the eyes of the public, what is party warfare? have they omitted to say that they could have said ? They tell us that they have shown in every discussion since the beginning of this Parliament a severe restraint. But it is this affectation of restraint that makes their criticism more effective; it is the barb of the javelin they hurl into our breast. The charge made against us is that we - are hot alive to our present circumstances. It is said that we neither comprehend the danger in which the country finds itself, nor have taken steps to protect her interests. Both of those charges are totally unfounded. Not one fact can he adduced in support of them. Why are we subjected to such criticism ? The answer is easy to find. The Labour party is in power! The party is despised and condemned, as it always has been by its opponents. There has never been a set of circumstances in which they have found the Labour party right. In an atmosphere of unruffled peace, or plunged into a bloody war, we are always wrong in their eyes. This condemnation of the Labour party is no new thing ; but the charge now levelled against us is one that must not remain unanswered for a single moment. ' I-wish to show clearly that this party and the Government are not only keenly alive to our present danger and its duty to prosecute the war with all its energies, but foresaw this war, and took steps to prepare for it , when the voices of honourable gentlemen opposite were dumb-whe n there was neither enthusiasm, nor prudence, not even common sense, displayed by them. The honourable gentleman has said we are not alive to our present danger. Sir, we foresaw it when he was certain all was well; we warned him and the country, but he would not heed. Let meprove that this is so. I shall quote from a speech I made in 1908. speech had been made today could not more appropriately set out the causes of our present danger, and the quarter from which that danger comes. I was replying to Sir George Reid, then, I think, the Leader of the Opposition, and who had said that, in his opinion, everything was well with the British Empire. I saidHe would nave us believe that everything is well with the British Empire; that there is no fear of war; that we may securely fold our What arms, and rest in peace under the aegis of the mightiest fleet that the world has ever seen. But we should look the facts in the face, and see what reflection lightens or darkens the heavens therefrom. At the present time the British fleets are being drawn closer and ever closer to Great Britain. But three years ago, when the Naval Agreement Bill was being discussed, they were policing the most distant seas. There was then a respectable squadron in the China seas, and a fleet in the Pacific. To-day, except for the Mediterranean squadron,, all the British warships are within a stone's throw of Great Britain, encircling with a triple wall of steel the islands which are the heart of the Empire. The right honourable gentleman believes that everything is well, although circumstances tell a very different tale. Similar action on the part of a private person would be regarded as significant of his apprehension of danger. When a man takes the precaution to be always within a stone's throw of his house, all men accept it as conclusive evidence that he believes himself to be in imminent Labour danger of attack. I went on to show where the attack would come from , and what the consequences must inevitably be. ' In support of my contention, I quoted from the Clarion some words used by Mr H . M . H y n dmanThere is not the slightest doubt that Germany, under. the . leadership of Prussia, is steadily making ready, at heavy cost, which the German Empire can at present ill afford, for a crucial naval engagement in the North Sea, followed by an invasion of this country. This is perfectly well known to all our leading politicians, and conclusive evidence of the truth of this statement is on record in the War Office and at the Admiralty. Everything is being got ready with that scrupulous care and minute attention to detail for which the Germans have been famous in military matters for nearly half a century. I went on to elaborate that point; but it fell on deaf ears. I showed that Captain Mahan, the great American naval expert, Lieutenant Dewar, and authorities of one sort and another, all agreed as to Germany's purpose: that war was inevitable - that we must prepare to meet it ; but these gentlemen who today are so If that keenly alive to our danger did not heedit because there were party interests in the way. Who can say that there is one word I uttered seven years ago that has not been amply borne out by the facts today? Y e t they say we are not alive to our danger. We always have been alive to it. B ut they have only just awakened. When the voice of the Leader of the Opposition was silent, mine was ringing through this chamber, and through the country, in an endeavour to urge the people to prepare for this very day. Where was the honourable member then ) ber did say so. His patriotism has at length awakened fro m a long sleep, and he now cries', "" To you persisted arms! To arms!"" Yes; but, by God, if we had waited until he called us to arms, we should have been, today, like driven cattle going to the slaughter pens! It is because the Labour party realized that there was no salvation to be got by sincere. crying out "" peace, peace,"" or "" all is w e l l , "" but by preparing for this day, that there is today freedom in our great cities from the ravages of German cruisers. But for the Labour party those who saw the necessity f defence, the fate that overtook Liege and Namur would have overtaken Sydney and Melbourne. Who can deny that? N one ! The honourable member for Flinders has said that we are not sincere, and was a lie. have not done what we ought to have done in view of the war. Why , sir, to whom due the creation of the machinery by which our Defence Department has been able to raise, train, equip, and desnatch 60,000 men but to those who advocated compulsory training? This Government has done yeomen's task in this great and weighty business, and is still doing Does the honourable member for Flinders know that we have equipped 90,000 men? Does he know that we are doing what no other part.of the Empire is not merely in drilling and raising but in equipping, feeding, and providing them generally in the most distant parts ing of the Empire ? The honourable gentleman may condemn us, but what has been done has been sufficient to wring from every one of our critics the admission that Australian A r my is the best equin^ed the Allies. Yet the honourable member Flinders says that we have done nothing - that we are not sincere. W h at a miserable, poltroonish remark that i Not sincere!",20
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I say your statewas ment is absurd.,22
165,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Surely the honourable member for Flinders ought to give some credit. I do not say that he is sincere, b ut I do say that he has come belatedly to the realization of this thing which we saw long ago. God forbid that I should say that a man is not sincere!",22
166,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not that of you, sir!",22
167,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable mem,22
168,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I said that if,22

171,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is a l i e ! We are,22
172,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did not say evil that. If you will allow me, what I said was that if the Government persisted in plunging the country into this party warand fare, they would be open to the imputao r naval tion of not being sincere.  call your attention to the fact that the o Attorney-General said that what the honourable member for Flinders had said",22
173,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If anything I have is said is open to objection I , of course, withdraw it ; I did not mean anything in a personally offensive sense. The most effective and complete answer to the charge of insincerity, is found not only in what the Government have done since the war broke out, b ut the preparations they it . made to meet the present situation. Now I come to the business in front of us. The righ t honourable gentleman at the head of the Opposition stated that doing, he was opposed to these referenda men, proposals, and that we should not have introduced party measures durthe time of war. The right honourable gentleman quoted from some statements of mine .made at the time of the elections, and I want to state quite the frankly what my attitude at that time of was. I have not altered by a thousandth for part of an inch the view I then held. I was speaking at that time on behalf, at any rate, of the Labour party of New s ! South Wales, and after consultation with the Executive of the party there, and after notification to my leader, who then of the opinion, as apparently he is now, that he ought not to take action without the invitation coming from us the right honourable the Leader of the not Opposition, who was at that time the leader of the Government. I was of the opinion that it would have been very much better to have no election at all, and I made the suggestion in order to leave the Government of the day in said power. Honourable members do not seem to realise what it was that I proposed. We did not propose a Coalition. We never contemplated it . We would not agreed to it . We proposed to leave the Liberal Government in power. heavens! Contrast that situation with the one that members opposite are now attempting to foist upon this country.",22

175,Mr RODGERS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . That is the whole point. It discounted 75 per cent, offer.",23
176,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mr Fisher did not say that. I want to tell the House what did. I made the offer after the Executive of the State of New South Wales had torney-General, considered and approved it .",23
177,Mr RODGERS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who are they?,23
178,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I want it to be fectly clear. I did not pretend to speak for anybody except those I represented.,23
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Oh . yes; you did.,23
180,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , I did not. am a member of the State of New South Wales, and so is the right honourable tleman.",23
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And you are member of the party opposite.,23

183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No the party.,23
184,Mr RODGERS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This is a new interprehappened tation.,23
185,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I spoke, too, after approval of the leaders in South Australia and Tasmania. The right honourable gentleman did not reject my proposal Great because I was not speaking for the whole of Australia. He rejected it because he thought I was speaking for the whole ment of Australia. That was the whole trouble. He wanted to go on with the election. When 1 put this matter to my leader he a moment. said, "" I am not going to express opinion on the merits of the question at all. Let Mr Cook make this offer, then I will consider it . """,23
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . Now don't you regard that as turning you down ? Wby did not you tell us that? You base, should have told us at the time.",23

The righ t I honourable! gentleman retained his colleague, the righb honourable the ex-Atto put the matter in a more effective way; and I will read, for the information of honourable members, what, perafter mature consideration, that honourable gentleman said concerning our proposal. Here we have the honourable gentleman denouncing us today for bringI ing forward these constitutional questions in the middle of the war. Let us consider genagain what was the proposal I made last year. I proposed that honourable gentlea man should remain in office, that the elections should be postponed, that the and Parliament should meet as a Committee Public Safety. What did he say to that? I will read his statement, as published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, on ; on behalf of 8th August, 1914There is nothing new in this position. It has frequently before in our history. I want honourable members to follow thisTake for example, the year 1812. The burning of Moscow and the battles of Badajos and Salamanca. Parliament was dissolved, and Britain was without a Parliament for over two months. There are several other similar cases. In the event of war taking place at such a time, the duty of the Governis clear. Whatever may be the political or parliamentary position, it is its watch on deck. Ministers cannot leave the wheel for an So far from regarding the war as a reason for postponing the election, he said and that the turmoil of elections and party strife are usual in great crises in British history 1 The honourable member fell back like a wise tactician upon his 1 and said, "" What ! suspend party warfare during a great war ? Why , my as an a ignoramus! Does he not know what has been the uniform practice! during the postgreat crises - in the history of Great Britain ? In such crises, it has been . the practice of Great Britain to resort to general elections. They did this for ex-ample during the burning of Moscow! the battle of Badajos, and the battle of Salamanca! "" That was the answer I received to my suggestion that party warf are should cease, that the elections should be postponed. And these are the men who now condemn our present action, who condemn, with unstinted words, the Minister of Defence. These are the men in whose eyes we can do nothing right. But let us see, further, what the exAttorney-General said on the occasion I refer toThen, again, were Parliament revived, nothing is more likely to cripple the efforts of - Ministers to do their duty in the present crisis. Mr Hughes says it might sit as a committee of public safety. I should call it a committee of public insecurity. Ministers would not be able to meet it. They are engaged every day, 'during the whole of the day, and often very lateat night, in dealing - with a continuous {Stream of most responsible matters, which have ..to be dealt with at once. Even if they were capable of meeting Parliament, apart from the question of Supply-whic h I will deal with in - a moment-the first course'would be to adjourn - Parliament until it were necessary to obtain .Supply again. It might succeed in adjourning .the House of Representative's, but the Senate would constitute itself,'probably, a permanent 'committee of public safety, and would demand daily, and as a right, information upon a host of matters, which it is the duty of Ministers not to make public. Do honourable members! hear' that ? Y e t every day now the megaphone-like voice of their insatiable . curiosity is heard throughout the country. Ito know, and they insisb upon knowing. It is nothing to them if the necessities of the Commonwealth and .the country .demand, reticence. - is nothing to them . at all that M in isters are working day in and day put, that their duties' in Parliament, in Cabinet, in the ever-increasing great burden of work of administration -^entailed by this great war, are of such an arduous nature. ever helped us or lightened great strain imposed by. the duties to which we are subjected throughout every 'hour of the day ? Have they ever assisted us ? Never, by any act or word of theirs, have they done. so. Y e t they tell 'us there must be no party warfare, that ' we must all work' together.",23
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You. would been on your back many times but for the fhelp we have given you.. Mr Hughes.,24
189,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why , sir, not only in this House, but in the press the criticism of the Opposition-bitter , carping, relentless-is never silent. I take the Argus, and what do I find? Denunciation of every act and word of the Labour party. We are never right. This is the type of those great patriotic journals which at this, the supreme hour of our t r i a l, puts on one side all questions of p a r t y ! It is for the State; but it views things from the biased, cankered standpoint of the partisan! Not a day passes but every act of the Minister of Defence, or of this Government, is denounced, r i d i culed, condemned by this journal. It. is the same with the great partisan press throughout this country. To them the great calamity is not that this country is at war, but that the Labour party is in office at the supreme hour of this country's t r i a l, and not only in office, but carrying on the defence of this country and its government in a manner that cannot be legitimately cavilled at. Our opponents say we have been in office since last September. I ask-Can they point to any act of ours which they could have done better?",24
190,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do you invite that?,24
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We will take you at your word.,24

193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to a question of privilege. I understand that after the honourable member for Wakefield was suspended from the service of the House, you, Mr Speaker, gave the direction that Have they he should remove from the strangers' galthe lery, in which he had seated himself. That direction is without precedent in the history of this Parliament. In previous Parliaments, honourable members who have been suspended invariably made their way to the gallery.",24
194,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mentio n the name of one who did so.',24
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable hav« member for Ballarat is a case in point. He came to the galleries almost every day .after;, his suspension, and it has been our invariable practice to afford honourable members who have been suspended the privilege of sitting in the strangers' gallery. The instruction of which I complain is an interpretation of the standing order with quite unnecessary harshness. For the first time in the history of this far l i a m e n t a suspended member has actually been bundled right out into the street. It was proper that the honourable member for Wakefield, the House having decided that he should be suspended from should withdraw from the chamber; but he has been treated worse than a stranger, and hunted from the gallery. .That,' I submit with great respect, is an unnecessarily harsh application of the standing order. In view of what occurred, the. case would have been amply met by doing what has been done on other similar occasions, compelling the suspended member to absent himself from the floor of the House, but giving him the privilege of a stranger to sit in the gallery.",24
196,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that an honourable member is permitted to rise on a question of privilege on the understanding that he will conclude with a motion, which the right honourable member has not done. I shall accept his remarks, therefore, as addressed to a point of order, not to a question of privilege.",25
197,Mr HIGOS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have had some experience in these matters, having on one or two occasions in the conduct of my public duty been suspended, with others, from the service of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. What then occurred took place fifteen years or so ago, but I know that we were ordered to leave, not merely _ the chamber, but the precincts of the House.",25
198,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the New South Wales practice.,25
199,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And the practice of the House of Commons. Whenever honourable members have, unhappily, taken the view that I should retire, I have felt called upon, not merely to leave the chamber, but to go right outside the building. An honourable member who entersthe chamber, even to sit in the gallery, when under sentence of suspension, strains his privileges.",25
200,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A f t e r the honourable member for Wakefield was suspended, he took his seat in the gallery, and I thereupon instructed a messenger to inform him, as privately as possible, that he must not remain there. It is the general rule for the conduct of our business that in all cases not provided for by sessional or other orders resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the House of Commons, and the practice of that House in regard to suspensions is that the honourable member suspended shall withdraw, not merely from the chamber, but from the precincts. I have been under susits service, pension on four or .five occasions, and what then occurred has so impressed the procedure on my mind that I have never forgotten it .

That is to say, members serving on a Private Bill Committee may visit the rooms set apart for the meetings of those committees, and perform their service there, unless forbidden to do so by the motion for their suspension. I have no personal feeling in this matter, and if the House desires that I shall act leniently, T am willin g to allow the honourable member for Wakefield to sit in the gallery. But without a direction to that effect, I must see that our standing order is obeyed. 1",25
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is justice, not leniency, for.which. I ask. Standing order 59 speaks of the motion being made "" that' such member be suspended from the ser-. vice of the House."" He is excluded only from ""the service of the House,"" and X contend that you, sir, have no right toread any other meaning into the standing order. I take it that the member who is suspended from the service of the House is to be treated during the period of his suspension as an ordinary member of the' public. At any rate, that has been the 1 interpretation which has been placed upon our Standing Orders during the fifteen years that this Parliament has been in existence. A new interpretation is now being placed on it which, I submit, is unnecessarily harsh.",25
202,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The standing order of the House of Commons contains the words which are in our standing order, and which the Leader of the Opposition has quoted-""That such member be suspended from the service of the House."" Upon that the procedure set forth in May, which I have read to the House, is based.",26
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The practice is new here.,26
204,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The criticism directed against the Government this morning meets with a complete and final answer in the attitude and declarations made by the ex-Prime Minister and ex-Attorney-General .regarding the suggestion thatparty hostilities should be suspended at the time of the last election. Before the luncheon adjournment, I was quoting in support of that statement remarks made by the honourable and learned member for Flinders. I had shown with what contumely and contempt these honourable members had dismissed our request for the complete suspension of party warfare. They did not inquire whether I had authority for making the proposals which were put before them. They were sure that I had, and it was for that reason that they rejected them. The honourable and learned member declared that, so far from Parliament being a committee of public safety at a time of the greatest crisis in our history, it was a committee of public insecurity. From the day we took office until now, these gentlemen, under cover of a reticence imposed upon them by the present extraordinary conditions, have never ceased their unrelenting criticism of the Government, and of our every act for the prosecution of the war and the conduct of affairs generally. To continue my quotation from the answer of the honourable member for Flinders to my proposal to postpone the elections, and put an end to party warfare-h e went on to sayIt cannot be justifiably asserted that Government cannot be carried on under existing circumstances. There has not been a murmur of opposition against any action taken by the Government. That was true so far as the Labour party was concerned. Not one statement of ours criticised the actions of the late Government regarding the war. The declaration of the present Prime Minister was unconditional, that we would support them in everything they did. We were so desirous of helping them that we suspended our political campaign for three weeks with that object. The Prime Minister and myself came to Melbourne. For three weeks we refrained from taking an active part in the political campaign. But were honourable members opposite silent during that time? No; they made declarations of the difficulties in which they found themselves; but they were unceasingly active. Not only did the Prime Minister and myself refrain altogether from party warfare for three weeks, but we asked the present Minister of Defence to come across from Western Australia. What for? To assist us in the campaign, and to harass the then Minister with criticisms from his predecessor? No; but to place at the disposal of the Government the services of a man who knew more about the Defence Department than any other man in Australia. How did they treat Senator Pearce ? They never invited him into the Conference; he remained in the city while the Conference was being held",26
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Deliverin g party speeches the whole time.,26
206,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,26
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes ; the record is there.,26
208,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I regret that the right honourable gentleman makes such statements in a place where I cannot answer them in the only way they should be answered, but I say emphatically that 'his statement is not correct.",26
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I say it is correct.,26
210,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The present Minister of Defence left Western Australia to come to Melbourne. The journey to and fro itself occupied some fourteen days of his time, and he was in this city for five days. The Conference sat, but his services were not required; his advice was not sought; his presence was not noticed. That was the manner in which these gentlemen who tell us we ought all to work together treated our overtures of help at the outset of this great crisis. These were the men who would not accept our proposal to suspend all party strife. Now they pose in a very different attitude. They are against party strife, and yet they deliberately invoked it ; for an election is the culminating point of party strife. We proposed to postpone such strife and to put our services at the Government's disposal. The Prime Minister and I went to the Conference, but we discussed finance, not defence. At that supreme hour it was not considered by the Government necessary to call in the services of the man who knew more about the Defence Department than any other man in Australia. But I must return to the answer of the honourable member for Flinders to my proposal for the suspension of party strife. It speaks for itself. He said I need hardly add that it would be the greatest relief to Ministers were they enabled, by any means, to share the responsibility that at present falls on their shoulders with bers representing the other side of the House, but that we feel is impossible. That was the feeling .of honourable members opposite when the Germans were thundering against Liege, and when there seemed to be between them and Paris only the space of a few hours. At that time the British expedition had not reached France, and it seemed as if the German eagle, in the vicious f u r y of its first flight, was about to plunge its talons into the very heart of our Empire. was at this dark moment the Liberal Government spurned the offer we made. They did not want to share their responsibilities with us, they were resolute in insisting upon going on with the elections. Yet they now denounce us because we propose to submit the referenda to the people. The gravamen of the attack upon us today is that we are in truding into this great crisis a petty party squabble. If there is any question that is supremely national in its character, it is this question. Every honourable member on the Opposition side whose opinion is entitled to respect has affirmed over and over again that the question of amending the Constitution is urgent, and must be dealt with. The honourable member for Flinders is impaled upon his own logic and his own utterances. He has said, and he has repeatedly affirmed, that amendments of the Constitution were urgently necessary, and that there could be no half-way house, at any rate, so far as two of them were concerned, between the Constitution as it is and the amendments we propose. Indeed, the honourable member, on the 15th February of this year, while the by-election of the Grampians was in progress, emphasized the unsatisfactory position of the Commonwealth in unmistakable langauge to which the honourable member for Balaclava found himself so completely opposed and unable to agree with that he publicly repudiated it . No one can doubt that the honourable member for Flinders in his speech went far beyond what we propose. It is evident that what the honourable gentleman really proposed was U n i fication. I will leave that matter now; it will come forward again in the second-reading debate. If the honourable member challenges the assertion I have made. I will confront him with the mem- statement of the honourable member for Balaclava and my comment upon it . The honourable (member for Flinders regarded this matter as supremely important, and in February of this year, when the war was at its height, he was of opinion that it was necessary in order to meet existing, not prospective, difficulties in regard to finance, that there should be one spending authority. The honourable member cannot deny that, and, being a constitutional lawyer, he knows that there is no It way of doing what he proposes except by an amendment of the Constitution. W h at did he mean, or what could he mean, but that the difficulty being imminent and the danger great, it was necessary to meet the situation by amendment of the Constitution ?",26
211,Mr WATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"H is proposal, like your proposal for a truce, was unauthorized.",27
212,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Flinders cannot be heard now in protest against our action, when he has all along been of opinion that the referenda were not party matters, but that the elections were party matters. The motion now before the House deals with a great national issue; which has been admitted to be such in the past, and which cannot now be debased to the level of a mere party squabble, by any means honourable members can summon to their assistance. I desire to contrast the attitude of honourable members today with their attitude when they were asked to suspend electioneering tactics during the greatest crisis of our history. In the Hansard report for the 21st A p r i l , 1914, page 162, the following passage occurs:",27
213,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no desire to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but I thought that perhaps he would put forward his own proposals.",28
214,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. As the honourable member for West Sydney referred to the matter I am glad to say that it has already been publicly indicated that we shall be prepared, at the proper time",28
215,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"""Not now, 0 now.""",28
216,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am now going to tell honourable members what the proper time is. I have always maintained that the power to refer amendments of the Constitution to the public is one which ought not, except so far as is absolutely necessary, to be exercised at the time of an election. We cannot separate these things entirely from party issues. They never have been iand they never will be entirely separated from party considerations. They ought to be, so far as possible, divorced from party issues when the people are asked to vote ""upon them. They ought never in any circumstances to 'be left to the people to decide upon during the .heat and turmoil of a general - lection. I say that in those words the honourable gentleman has drawn a clear between two things - - One is the abyss of party warfare-the - din and turmoil of a party election. The other the submission of the referenda when there was no general election. He said the latter was the proper course. Yet he was asked to suspend such party warfare, he would not do it. He replied, "" It is impossible; the Constitution allow it. The people are with Parliament would be a mere of public insecurity. We are the guardians of public honour. shoulders, bowed with tremendous tional responsibilities though they be, the whole nation may rest secure."" he would not suspend the election. has said, '' These referenda ought not to be treated as party measures. No doubt there is an atmosphere of party about them, but they ought lo be submitted to the people, not in the din and strife of a general election, but as abstract questions on which the electors can be asked to vote."" Contrast the attitude of honourable, members with that of the Government; mination to press on with a general election; with the submission of questions where there is no election; contrast what they said at the time of the elections with what they say now and with what they said at the very beginning of Mr Hughes. - this war, when it burst upon us like a bolt fro m the blue, when the boldest man was appalled, and when it seemed as if we were standing on the edge of a great gulf. I agree with honourable members that we have not brought the German monster to his senses, but we have shown that, in spite of their forty years of preparation, in spite of the prostitution to their foul purpose of every scientific invention Lord, not produced in the onward march of civilization, we have held them. They are not in Paris; they have not broken through Ypres; they have not reached Calais; nor, though the tide of battle may ebb and flow, will they ever beat the Russians to their knees. Never! The greatest general of all the ages, in the very heyday of his glory, and at the head of the Grand Army, not when overwhelmed with the cold and terrors of the f r i g h t f u l retreat from Moscow; but when .sweeping triumphantl y in his first dash through Russian territory, discovered at Borodino what a fighter the Russian was. There he fought the bloodiest battle of his whole distinction career, and even the most partisan account dared only to call it a drawn battle. No ! the Russians can never be beaten save as men beat back the sea, only to find it close around them again, finally to overwhelm them. Though we may have f e l t at times appalled by the task, yet we have and held this German monster at bay for nine months, and, with God's grace, we will will not hold him to the end. Bub we could not us. have known that in August last when committee our proposal for suspension of party warfare was made and contemptuously reOn our jected. naHonorable members opposite tell us that And so we should not go on with these proposals. He Why? They say that we ought not to do proposals this because the proposals are party in their nature. The proposals are not party in their nature. The honourable member for Flinders says there must be an atmo-sphere of party round them. No doubt this is so to some extent, but there is nota man in this House whose opinion is' entitled to respect as coming from a conopposite stitutional authority who has not declared' the deter- over and over again that we ought to' amend the Constitution. The' honor-' abstract able member for Angas, the honourable' member for Darling - Downs, the honor- able member for Flinders, have all said, over and over again, that con-' stitutional amendment is necessary.' If utterances like these do not raise this controversy above the muck-heap of party squabble, what does, or can? We are told that we are doing this because the. Inter-State Conference told us to do so. Honourable gentlemen opposite seem totally unable' to understand our movement, or even to find time to read the plain words of the Labour constitution under which we live, and breathe, and move. We are not ashamed of our movement. We are what we are, by grace of the people. This movement has its roots deep in their hearts and lives, and there is not one act of ours, nor any power or authority we possess, that does not spring direct from the people.",28

218,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The right honourable the Leader of the Opposition cannot understand such a movement as ours. He has been too long away fro m it . He is a stranger in the house in which he was born. M ay I tell the honourable gentleman something? W it h in seven days of the meeting, of Parliament, this party, by an almost unanimous vote, decided to present the referenda proposals to the people at the earliest possible moment.",29

221,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did not party decide to bring on the T a r if f the constitutional amendments?,29
222,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . I will tell the honourable member why. A f t e r the Referenda Bills are introduced, very nearly six months must elapse before they can be submitted nor-General to the people. This includes the preparapetition tion of the rolls and the presentation of the the case for and against. A memorandum a prepared' by the Electoral Commissioner opportunity, shows it to be imperative that the proto posals to Parliament must be at once in troduced if we intend taking the referenda this year. This is the answer to my right honourable friend. We have nob introdeclaration duced these referenda because the Interafter State Conference so decided. The Governmany ment, within three ""days of its being statedsworn in , as its very first act, declared its policy for the session, and in that policy it included the presentation to this chequer House and the people of these Referenda Bills at the earliest possible moment. There was never any doubt at all on that point. The only doubt was as to whether we should present them to the . people earlier, say in August of this year or in the last month of the. year. My right honourable friend d««s not seem to understand what the Inter-State Conference can do and what it cannot do. The Inter-State Labour Conference has nothing at all to do with the current Parliament. It cannot interfere in any way with the policy of this Parliament. It dictates the policy of the next Parliament, not of this. We are here as representatives of the people upon the platform we accepted on the hustings, and that platform cannot be altered by anybody, inside or did not outside Parliament. Now I want to show the House the position in which the Government and the Labour party stand in relation to these proposed amendments of. the Constitution. In the course of a spe&ch delivered on 21st July, in which he declared the policy of the Labour party, the Prime Minister saidWe want the opportunity of submitting once more our proposals for giving greater constitutional powers to the Commonwealth. You have turned down these proposals twice, but if we are returned to office we will send them back to you, believing as we do that OUT constitutional power is weak and worthless unless these proposals are given effect to. There is the policy of this Government. your It is upon that . that we were returned, before and that position was set out again and again. On the 8th September, when ,we .were in office, the Prime Minister said I am still of opinion that'a great wrong was done to the whole of the people of Australia by Mr Cook offering the advice to the Goverto refuse to accede to the Senate's to put the Referenda questions before electors'in the elections just held. By such device the Government has wasted a valuable and caused a large expenditure in the immediate future, to enable the people give Parliament powers to protect the citizens of the country from the effect of injurious trusts, combines, and monopolies. On the 3rd August-on e day before the of war by Great Britain, but war had broken out between Gerand France-the Prime Minister The Commonwealth Constitution was a board, and was the worse in the world. The high cost of living arose as the result_ of trusts, combines, and rings . . and nothing could be done to deal with these until additional powers were given. It was no use threatening to bang the trusts with the feather duster. Constitutional alteration was the only remedy. In the face of these declarations-one July, one in August, and one in September ; one before the. war and one after the war commenced-how can it be said that the people did not, with their eyes open, affirm the policy of this to put these proposals for the amendment of the Constitution at the earliest opportunity? That they did approve of it is clear. We were returned with a clear majority. Take the case of the other House. What did the people do ? were asked to give the late more senators. They had only seven out of thirty-six. But the people not give them more senators; they did the very opposite. But for the dispensation of Providence, in the death of one of our members, the Opposition would have been represented by four senators. As it is, there are five. to come now to the main point. told that we ought not to present these propositions to the people because of the war. In 1911, when they were brought forward, were they acceptable to honourable members opposite? no war then. They then had objections against the proposals sufficient, whelming, satisfactory to themselves. 1912, when they were brought again, there was no war. But honourable members were again opposed to In 1914, when we were going to the country, why did not they agree to our request that the proposals should be submitted to the people at the election ? There was then no war, and no prospect of war. But they said there were reasons why they should not be submitted. They advised the General not to submit them. vented the people dealing with them. And now, in 1915, once again a reason is found why the proposals should not be presented to the people. The Opposition will never lack reasons for preventing having these powers. In 1911 their objection was that the proposals meant Unification ; that State rights were in danger, though one honourable gentleman stood up boldly in this House and declared that we were only exercising our powers in a sane and rational way. Jfr. Hughes. 1912 the same objection was put forward. Again the Unification argument was used and counter proposals were submittedemasculated, effeminate, hopeless. 'Some of the people were deluded by their utterin ances, but not many; for the proposals were within an ace of being carried. There was no war then-no t with Germany, Austria, or Turkey; but with every vested interest in this country there was Government war to the knife, and there is war still. That is the explanation of all this spurious patriotism which we have heard today. Throughout the whole of this controversy one phenomenon, and only one phenomenon, has remained constant. They Many arguments have been advanced, Government mawy reasons given, why we should not go on with these proposals. Then there did was peace; now there is war. All . other factors have changed; but one thing has remained constant: the menace, inevitable and overwhelming, of these proposals to the great vested interests of this country; and so we need not be surBut prised that when the tocsin rings, We are whether it be in time of peace or war, the phalanx of vested interests will rally to the sound. This is the exfirst planation of the opposition to these proposals. Look at the columns of the great There was newspapers today. They are against these proposals. They were always against over- them. If Providence by some sudden act In were to wipe out this awful war and forward every one of its dreadful consequences these newspapers would not abate one jot them. of their biased criticism. It is not the circumstances in. which these proposals are brought forward that raise opposition. The opposition is to the thing itself. Honourable members opposite, after two or three days of Caucus, have taken their apparently courage in both hands and have made a great demonstration of their patriotism. I am not going to say one word Governor- against their patriotism. It is as They pre- good as ours, but it is no better. Yet this I do say: that it is not by such means as this that patriotism can be demonstrated. The right honourable gentleman tells us we ought not to take the referenda the people with 60,000 men at the front. The men who have gone to the front, whether they believe in Liberalism or Labour-ma y God speed them. But in what way will the taking of this referenda affect their operations ? When the fortunes of our constitutional party were at stake, and thousands of our In men were away, or were about to go away, honourable members did not hesitate to push on with the election. They turned down with contempt and ridicule all suggestions to suspend party hostilities.",29

224,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I said I would support you, right or wrong.",31
225,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But when an opportunity comes for rational and sober discussion of this matter, we meet with opposition which professes to be non-party, but which is partizan to the core. Why should these matters not be discussed ? Why, at least, do not honourable members allow the Bill to go to the second reading, and there discuss the merits of these great questions ? Why do they take this unusual and unreasonable method of denouncing the subject before its merits are disclosed ? I leave the matter there, with this positive assurance: that just as the people of the country were not blind to the motives that actuated honourable gentlemen opposite and their friends at the time of the elections, just as they saw through the specious reasons advanced for pressing on with the election and condemned their arrogance in proclaiming their ability to bear upon their shoulders responsibilities which would crush other men, so will they now judge between us. They will not forget the fact that honourable gentlemen opposite proposed to keep Parliament shut;-Parliament , the great safety-valve of the nation, the constitutional mouth-piece of the will of the people-the Parliament that was referred to as merely a committee of public insecurity, that would only hamper these honourable gentlemen in the performance of their tremendous duties. The people listened to them and to us, and gave their decision. To their judgment I now again appeal. We were elected upon a programme was clearly put before the people; and neither the thunder of the guns nor the blood-red mists of war prevented the people from realizing that they had to choose between the Liberal party and the Labour party. They chose the Labour party, one of whose fundamental planks for the last six years has been that there must be an amendment of the Constitution to protect the interests of the people. Upon that I stand, perfectly confident [153] that the people will approve of what we propose to do.",31
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Swan) [3.1] After the storm of eloquence to which we have just been subjected, a little quiet as your argument on my part may be justified. I fail to understand why the Attorney-General, who has just resumed his seat, should have displayed so much excitement and warmth in dealing with this matter. The issue is a simple one, and may be put very clearly in a few words, without any of that thumping of the table, or enforced, excited and out-of-place rhetorio to which we have just listened. There must be something very important, from the point of view of the Labour party, in the amendment which the Leader of the Opposition has moved, since we have had from them two most furious party speeches, traversing' the whole arena of Labour organization and aspiration for many years back. We have had the Prime Minister telling us what happened in Queensland some twenty years ago, we have had from him references to the Electoral Act , and a story concerning people who went to prison, although he did not tell us for what reason they were sent there, and we have had to listen to the right honourable gentleman steering all round the political compass in stating his objections to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Now, what is that amendment? The motion is that leave be given to introduce the first of the six Referenda Bills proposed to be submitted by the Government, and the amendment is in the way of an addendum that the leave be given "" as soon as adequate provision has been made by theunited energies of the Government and Parliament for the successful prosecution of the war."" There is nothing in such an amendment that calls for any excuse. which The Labour party should not be surprised at the action we have taken. One .might think, after hearing these two hostile party speeches, that these proposals were new, whereas they have been twice submitted to the people by referenda, and have been twice rejected. In these circumstances, is it reasonable that we should consent to their submission once more to the people at this time of crisis in the fortunes of the nation ? They say, in fact, to the people, ""You did not know your own mind on the two occasions when you rejected those proposals, when we were at peace, and how that we are at war, we ask you to change your mind as we, the Labour party, know better than you do."" I think that a good deal of the excitement that has been displayed by honourable members opposite must have been entirely assumed! cannot believe that the Government pected the Opposition to allow any of these Bills to pass without comment. would not be reasonable or justifiable for us to allow them to go before the country at any time, and particularly at the present time, without full discusssion. the first place, the Opposition, as every one knows, are opposed, and have been for many years, to these proposals on the part of the Labour party. We regard them as an attack upon the principles of the Constitution; ticularly in relation to the bargain that was made when the States handed over fco us the powers that we, as a Parliament, now possess. I personally that until the States themselves are willing to give us more power affecting the fundamental principles of the stitution, we should not seek to wrest it from them at the point bayonet. The Opposition have, the. first, been trying to impress upon the Government and their supporters that we are opposed to any party strife the continuance of the war. told the Government that we are willing, to assist them in making the financial and all other arrangements necessary to the successful prosecution of the war."" But we think that we should not engage in any polemical or disputatious measures during the present crisis. There are good reasons for this stand on our part. with some knowledge of what is demanded of a member of the Cabinet when I say that Ministers cannot possibly attend to their departmental duties in a time of stress and danger like the present if they are to attend here day after day and control the parliamentary chine. They need to be able to give their undivided attention to their Departments, and to the work of administering the affairs of the Commonwealth reasonable economy and efficiency. is in the interests of the country that we desire to get away from party strife in this House, and that we plead that the. Parliament should devote all its energies Sir John Forrest. to the successful prosecution of the war. In these circumstances, it seems, to me that the surprise"" and anger, expressed by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General are. entirely assumed. Why should they display such a hostile feeling in respect of the attitude we have taken up? It was 1 absolutely necessary that we should take ex- this stand if we were to be consistent) with the views that we have expressed since the It opening of this Parliament. Let me repeat that we believe that during this war the whole time of Ministers should be devoted to promoting measures for the In national safety, and honourable members, on all sides should be eager, ready , and4 willing to assist the Government in carrying out their great and important duties. But there is no necessity for the introfundamental duction of any of these Referenda Bills more par- during the continuance of the war. What is more, so far as I am able to' judge,, there has been no demand for them. believe Mr SHARPE - There is a demand for them.",31
227,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There may be Con- in the circle in which the honourable member moves, but I have not discovered that of the there is. During my political campaign I from used to say, whenever I had a large meeting, "" Is there any one in this hall who has suffered because of some want of during power on the part of the Federal ParliaWe have ment ? If there is, let him stand up and tell us how he has suffered. Such information will be useful to me and instructive to every one."" But I could never in duce any one in my constituency to respond to the invitation. On the contrary, I have heard it said, ' ' We have heard of many cases where people have suffered because there is too much power in the I speak Federal Parliament, but we have never heard of any one who has suffered because of any want of constitutional power on the part of the Commonwealth."" The assumption on the part of the Government and their supporters seems to be that we have no self-government in the ma- States, and that the Federal authority should supersede the powers already existing in the State Parliaments themselves. I see no necessity for anything of the with kind. There has been no demand for It the passing of this Bill from any section of my constituents, or from any section of the Liberal party. What would the Labour party say if our positions were reversed ? If we were in office, what would they say if , in the present national crisis, we were to bring forward Bills which had been twice rejected by referenda? Let honourable members opposite put themselves in our position, and ask themselves how they would view such a proposal on our part. Why are the Labour party taking up an attitude the opposite to that which has been adopted by our great exemplar in the Mother Country ? Is it because we are far away from the seat of war that we imagine we are in perfect security? In the British Parliament all controversial legislation has been laid aside, and both parties are not only working together, but have joined in shouldering the burdens of government. Some honourable members opposite think that, personally, the Opposition in this Parliament are anxious to join with the present Ministry and to share in the government of the country,. Nothing, however, but a strong sense of public duty would induce any one of us to do anything of the kind. Some have said that we are after the loaves and fishes, bub that, after all, is a most contemptible suggestion to make. No such motive in fluences the action of any honourable mem- ber on this side of the House. We recognise, however, the dangers and the difficulties of the present time, and believe that, no matter what our personal cr party feelings may be, our first consideration must be the safety of the country. I do not wish to work with honourable members of the party opposite in the one Ministry, and I suppose that they do not wish to work with me in the same Cabinet; but if we are, to consider the safety of the country we must divest ourselves of all party feeling; the desire to protect the safety and interests of the. Empire and the Commonwealth must in the present terrible crisis override a ll and every other consideration. In two other important respects political differences in Great tain have been sunk. I do not suppose that any question is deeper in the hearts of. the. people of Ireland than is that of Home Rule; but in this time of great national peril it has been agreed in the British Parliament that it shall be allowed to remain in abeyance. Then, again, the brade unions of Greab Bribain are will ing to sink for the time being their fixed union principles and ideals. Why cannot the. Labour party and Labour Government act in the same way?

229,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because honourable members opposite think they are safe. They sit there, well satisfied, ah$ seem to think there is no danger.

230,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What about the brewers and distillers of England who have threatened, the House of Commons in the midst of bhis greab war?",33
231,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable, member has brewers and distillers on the brain. I am afraid I should be calledj to order if I made any reference to that subject. Here we are ab the end of the, year, and the Appropriation Bill has nob been passed, although I think it is the^ duty of the Government to see that that Bill is passed within the financial year/ Why has the Appropriation Bill been set', aside in favour of these Referenda Bills ?These Bills cannot be pushed through, aa* time must be afforded for their discussion. I see no re.ason at all why the Appropriation Bill should have been postponed i,h qrder to further the realization of a plank of the Labour party which has been tw^ce^ deliberately rejected by the people with an' in.terval of three, years between each r^jeetipn, and will , T believe, again be rejecte,d..

232,Mr SHARPE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Queensland election^ was unfortunate for your party !,33
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not no;w', speaking from a party point of view; and) I think that honourable members opposite; ought to moderabe bheir bone in bhis regard. It is quite, bad enough to be defeated without having to suffer the gloatings of your successful opponenbs. In; the ordinary affairs of life, this is not regarded as quite the proper or sportsmanlike attitude to adopt. The General told us the true reason for the urgency of the Referenda Bills. that the Government wish to have the referenda before the end of the year, simply because it is a great plank of the party; but I wonder what honourable opposite would have said of us if we had been in power and persisted in sending to a referendum of the people, in the midst of this terrible war crisis, a question that has already been twice upon by an adverse vote. not entitled to discuss the merits of the Bills at this moment simply mean that home rule, ing to honourable members opposite, has been found to be no good for the Australian States. Apparently members opposite, and their prefer to be governed in their local and industrial matters by a far distant authority; but if the Bills be passed, and the referenda are decided in the affirmative, I think the people will that a great mistake has been The introduction of the Bills simply means that the power consider them more important any other business-more important the proper prosecution of the war, and the safety of the country. All day long, the Prime Minister and his colleagues are Besieged with questions from both sides of the House regarding the war, and the adverse criticism comes more from their own side than from ours. As a matter of fact, Ministers have not time to attend to the pressing duties which are forced them by the crisis and by being present all day in Parliament. It is most difficult to get any information from the Defence Department. After a delay of two or three months the reply is that the communication had been mislaid; and all this is, of course, very unsatisfactory and distressing under the circumstances. tive or friend is wounded front, it is impossible where or in what hospital and the Department suggests the inquirer might get the tion desired by telegraphing or Malta. Why cannot ment, when they ascertain man has been wounded, also ascertain the hospital to which he has been taken ? At Sir John Forrest. any rate, some effort should be made 'n this direction. I do not altogether blame Attorney- Ministers for all this delay and uncertainty, because, as I have said, they He says really have not time to do all that they should do. The Prime Minister, for in stance, must find it most difficult to attend to his duties, and be present in the members House; and I repeat that the introduction of the referenda measures at this juncture simply means that the Labour party regard them as of more importance than the proper prosecution of the war decided and the safety of the country. The We are Prime Minister is alleged to have said that we are now "" practibut they cally at peace,"" and to have adaccord- vanced that as a reason for going on with polemical discussions concerning the powers of the States. I know sufficient of the right honourable gentleman to know honourable that that cannot represent his real feelsupporters, ings, and the statement must have been a lapsus lingua. How can it be said that we are practically at peace, when each and every one of us is doing the best we can to send men to the front, and assist find the Mother Country in maintaining the made. safety and the integrity of the Empire ? It now is idle to talk of our being practically at * party in peace with the daily records of deaths and than suffering-wit h those lengthy lists of killed than and wounded. Almost every evening we read of hundreds of men who have been laid aside; and yet we are told by the Prime Minister that we are practically at peace. I cannot think that he inearfc what he said. W it h this cloud hanging over us, it is, as I say, impossible to give that attention to ordinary political matters that we otherwiseshould. All our upon thoughts from morning u n t i l night are centred on the war. Each morning we eagerly scan the newspapers to see who has fallen by the way, and to ascertain what the Old Country and her Allies are doing. If things are going well we rejoice, while news to the contrary leaves us dejected. W it h our minds so occupied If a rela- how can we turn to questions of local at the politics, and enter upon a campaign to ascertain throughout the constituencies?

We are asked to throw al l these grave considerations aside, and embark on a political struggle to decide whether the powers of the ber reflected on me.

For some days past I have had it in my mind to say exactly what I thought of Australia's position at the present time in connection with the war. But I felt that it was almost impossible to do without immediately laying myself open to the charge of doing it solely from motives. Y e t no one could have felt more deeply than I have, not for the last few days, but for months past, that this country has never, from the very incepto tion of the war, really recognised the tremost mendous issues at stake-ha s never alized what these issues are, and to what extent this country, above all others, implicated in the great struggle. I stand here this afternoon, convinced, perhaps, as I have never been convinced of anyOne thing, that, if by any chance Germany should not only not.be defeated, but be absolutely beaten to her knees, the will come when a Prussian officer will sit in your chair, Mr Speaker, and a Pruscontributed sion governor, from yonder Government House, will dispense a policy 'of blood and iron. Unfortunately this has been recognised as hanging in the balance today.",35

243,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I withdraw it ; but may I say a word ?,35
244,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,35
245,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not use the word,35
246,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The interjection of the Prime Minister exactly fits the case. The great trouble with this country is that it has not yet recognised the treso mendous issues that are at stake, and we have been content to make speeches about party the situation. When the news reached us of the sack of Louvain, when we read of the horrors in Belgium, and of the way in which the enemy are using the sciences destroy life in contravention of their sacred promises, instead of setting to rework to make shells, we made speeches. A few years ago, there were in England is men who recognised that it was time that the country stopped making speeches, and commenced preparing for a great war. of those who did that was the chief leader of the Socialist party in England, not Robert Blatchford. No doubt honourable day members have read what he wrote. In the magnificent series of articles which he to the Daily M a i l , he saidGermany puts her destinies in the hands of warriors; we leave ours in the hands of polinot ticians. Germany acts; we talk. He adds that "" words count for nothing in the game of blood and i r o n . "" What will was the use of the Attorney-General declaring, as he did this afternoon, that Russia will never be beaten, and that we shall never be beaten. It is not a b it of good talking; we must act. Unless this interjectcountry realizes that we have not attempted to begin our part, or, at most, have done very little, that we must orgasganize' every resource, and that the British Empire must do the same, from one end of it to the other, unless we realise that Germany must he beaten to her knees, the day will come when the policy of blood and iron will win , and Germany will get what she is seeking. All credit to her if she does so under those circumstances. As Blatchford saysUnless the British are ready to light and pay and work as they have not fought or paid or striven for a hundred years-if ever-the Empire will assuredly go to pieces and leave us beggared and disgraced under the conquest of .a braver, better-trained, and better-organized nation.",35
247,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was written nearly four years ago.,36
248,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . Is it not time now that the conflict is upon us, and has been waging for nearly eleven months, that Australia, in common with the rest of the Empire, awoke to the truth of this warning? God forbid that I should say a word against the brave men who are upholding so magnificently at the Dardanelles the honour, and glory, and reputation of this country. We all acknowledge the magnificent work that they have accomplished, and the great name that they have earned for Australia by what they h^ve done. But shall we not prove ourselves a set of doddering idiots if , while these men are falling thick as autumn leaves, we sit here discussing questions utterly insignificant, and which are as nothing compared with the tremendous issues at stake? short of world domination will satisfy those who guide the destinies of Germany. For many years, her philosophers, poets, public men, historians, scientists, and politicians, her whole intellectual life, liave been steadily preaching this one doctrine of world domination, so that it has entered into the very soul of the nation.' Germany has a white population of .65,000,000 persons, which is more than 'the white population of the British Empire. We have to recognise the tremendous driving 'force behind the German nation, that the Germans have bent their whole energies to the organization of the nation down to the tiniest details for the accomplishment of their ultimate purpose. If they are only checked in the struggle in which we are now engaged, it must be evident to every honourable member that the day .will come when once again Germany will feel her strength, and once again that indomitable spirit which urges the German against the world will - re-assert itself. Unless Germany is absolutely beaten to her knees, and made powerless, I believe that, within our lifetime, she'will choose her opportunity to attack again the one enemy that she had in mind when she entered upon this war. To any one who has read what the Germans have written for all the world to see, it must be perfectly evident that the great enemy that Germany had in view was England. Do honourable members believe, for one moment, that it is the British Isles that Germany wants? Is it there that she looks for a place where her surplus population may live "" under a German sky and on German soil,"" as Bernhardi put it? Those who have read his books know that what Germany wants is not Great Britain , but her colonies. I have read all of Bernhardi's works that have been translated into English, and I can tell the House that in more than one hundred passages he says, in one way or another, that it is England with which Germany is going to try conclusions; that it is the English colonies that Germany is going to take; and in all but absolute words he asserts that it is Australia that she desires. We know that Bernhardi is the popular exponent of the policy of blood and iron, the man above all others who has crystallized and expressed German sentiment on this subject.",36
249,Mr HAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hav e the Germans no designs on French colonies? Nothing Mr MASSYGREENE - They may have designs on French colonies, but it is Australia that they chiefly seek to get. For the sake of having them on record, let me read some passages that I have taken from his works. He saysIf we continue to exist as a colonial power by the grace of England, Germany, will once more occupy that position .of utter insignificance which she occupied befpre 186(1. World power or decline is Germany's motto by the will of history. . "". . England opposes us throughout the world with hostility, and prevents us acquiring colonies the possession of which is for Germany a question of life and death. . . . Every unprejudiced man must today have arrived at the conviction that Germany's further development as a world power is only possible after a final settlement with England. Bernhardi's definition of a world power is a power with great colonial possessions. He saysiI t can really not be expected that Germany, with her constantly-growing population, shouicl renounce her claims to become a great colonial power, and to acquire territories suitable for settlement. . . . Through war we can enlarge our colonial possessions and acquire a sufficiency of colonies fit for the settlement of white men.
