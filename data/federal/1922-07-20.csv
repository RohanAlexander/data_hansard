25,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that returned soldiers, successful examinees for appointments to the Public Service (Postmaster-General's Department), between the ages of 40 and 48 years, are being called upon to insure their lives, up to 60 years of age, on a loaded policy? 2. Is it a fact that the Department has granted the men the right to extend the policy to 65 years of age in order to reduce the cost of premiums? 3. Is it a fact that on reaching 60 years of age an officer's services may be dispensed with on the certificate of the head of the branch, and that there is a possibility of these men being put off on reaching 60 years, and probably having to surrender their policy owing to unemployment? 4. In view of the fact that the Department has notified ineii concerned that if they find the premiums to be paid are more than 6 per cent, of their salary they will be permitted to come under Public Service Regulation 184, will the Minister suspend action pending the decision of Parliament in regard to the Public Service Superannuation Bill which it is understood the Government intend to introduce this session, and, if it becomes law, will be compulsory upon all officers?  Service Commissioner has furnished the following advice:1. The Public Service Regulations require insurance to be effected if the loading does not exceed five years, but it has been decided that where the annual premium exceeds 6 per cent, of a returned soldier's remuneration, insurance may be dispensed with, and deductions made from salary under regulation 184. 2. Yes. 3. An officer who has attained the age of 60 years may be called upon by the Governor General, upon the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner, to retire, but the instances in which officers are retired before 65 years of age are very few. 4. This is not considered desirable.",15
26,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether, in view of the oft-expressed policy of the Government to give preference to returned soldiers, it is a fact that an edict has. gone forth that certain men who have heen in the employ of the Postal Department for years as temporary hands, and have given, and aro still giving, every satisfaction, are to bo disni issed ? 2. As some of theso men have received war injuries which render them permanently incapacitated, and, therefore, unable to follow pro-war occupations, will he have the notices of dismissal withdrawn, and an effort made to absorb these men i u one of the branches of his extensive Department?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1. I am not aware of any such edict. 2. So far as my Department is concerned, where the services of a temporarily employed returned soldier have ceased to be required in one position, every effort is made to provide for him elsewhere, and special consideration is given to those men who have received war injuries.",16
27,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"the Postmasterthe General, upon notice I. Whether, with a view to more equitably and e/Iicicntly providing with telephone services Hindmarsh and west suburban districts, the Government have made a decision for the installathroughout tion of a local telephone exchange? 2. If not, will the Government consider urgency of such matter, and include the in the new programme of services required?  honourable member's questions are as folfurther, low:1. The Department proposes, with a view relieving the Central Adelaide Telephone change, and of efficiently and economically viding for telephone service in the areas mentioned, to establish on a suitable site phone exchange in the West Adelaide district. This proposal is at present receiving consideracentre, tion, and the necessary data are being sembled with a view to its submission as early as possible for consideration by the Parliawhat mentary Public Works Committee. 2.

REJECTED VOLUNTEERS.",16
30,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. What were the numbers from 1914 to 1918 of persons rejected from enlistment in (a) The Australian Imperial Forces. (6) The Royal Australian Navy? 2. What constituted the chief reasons for such rejections ?",16
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It is regretted that military records are not available for the period 1914-1918. The matter is very difficult ancl complicated. The examining officers and staffs were scattered the States, and these officers and their staffs were frequently changed' the owing to their enlistment in the Aussame tralian Imperial Force, with the result that only records essential at the time were forwarded to State Head-quarters; the standards were altered considerably during the war, with the conseof quence that individuals who had been reExjected were subsequently accepted, also, prounder voluntary enlistment there was no a telebarrier to an individual being rejected more than once at the same or another and it isknown that there is a asnumber of such cases. I am ascertaining particulars are available in the Navy Office. NA DEPARTMENT. REPORTS OF RIVER HEIGHTS.",16
32,Mr GABB,METEOROLOGICAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice I. Is it a fact that telegraphic reports between country stations as to river heights are to be discontinued? 2. If so, in view of the fact that tliese reports are necessary at all times for navigation purposes,, particularly on the. River Murray and its tributaries, and also to agriculturists along the middle and lower Murray, will he reconsider the matter with a view to preventing suoli discontinuance?",16
33,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The Anglo-Persian answers to the honourable member's quesfineries Ltd.? tions are as follow:1. The Commonwealth Meteorologist advises that these reports have been discontinued for the present. The arrangements made by him in this connection should be regarded as provisional only, pending consideration of the whole of his proposals for the rearrangement of his services to bring the expenditure thereon within the limits of the amount voted there for by Parliament. 2: Consideration is now being Riven to the proposals of the Commonwealth Meteorologist, and the points mentioned by the honourable member will receive serious attention.

What amount has been paid done in connection with exploration for oil in Papua prior to the above agreement? 3. Is the Britisli Government still a member of the Agreement? If not, 4. What reasons were given for withdrawing from same?",17
35,Mr HUGHES,METEOROLOGICAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions low:1. £50,000. 2.

Debate resumed from 19th July (vide Goj>age 605), on motion by Mr JACKSONThat the following Address-in-Reply to the or oil Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to by this House :for work MAY IT PLEASE VOUK EXCELLEXCTWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. Upon which Mr BRENNAN had moved, are as folby way of amendment That the following words be added to the proposed Address-in-Reply:"" but we desire to advise His Excellency that the agreement mentioned in clause 12 of the contract made between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth should, before acceptance by the Commonwealth's representatives on the Board of Directors, be agreed to by this House."" The Anglo",17
38,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"Darling ) [ 2 . 4 8 ] - I Have listened, with a certain amount of interest, if not amazement, to the speeches delivered by anti-Labour representatives upon the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan), and the most amazing feature of their utterances is the fact that every honourable member with legal training has absolutely failed to approveof the agreement with the Amalgamated Wireless Limited . These ingenious gentlemen- I am speaking of those on the other side.of the Chamber-put forward various suggestions for undoing,, in a legal manner, something which they have already done and made as hard and fast as possible. The honourable memoer for Kooyong (Sir Bobert Best), with mental agility not characteristic of him, has gone to great lengths in pointing out the defects of agreement. He concluded that portion of his speech by saying that the agree-' ment made was a legally binding document, and therefore nothing could be done. Later on, however, hy another mental somersault, he recommended that the Government take certain action in order to nullify the blundering which has gone on in connection with the matter. The responsibility for this blundering lies on agreement. the sheuldcrs of the Government, and partly on the shoulders of the Country party; we, on this side, accept no responsibility whatever. This is only one of the many illustrations of the incapacity and incompetence of the one-man Government with which Australia is burdened at the present time. Apparently, without consultation with the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, brought down this scheme, and it is a ""scheme,"" applying an ordinary meaning' to the word. "" Scheme "" has become accepted as expressing something, to say the least, highly suspicious; and this is a "" scheme "" in all its meaning- a scheme which only such a Government as thiswould have the' audacity to bring into being. The Government and their supporters must take every responsibility the perpetration of this very questionable agreement. The. honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) knows perfectly well, as I venture to say most of the members on the Government side know, that the agreement is ""too hot"" - to o flagrantly unfair; and the honourable member, like many others, is now endeavouring to find some way out of the - impasse into which they have heen led hy the 'Government. .There are certain people outside interested in this particular activity, and interested cause it means dividends; and it is well that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), who has investigated the matter thoroughly, should have launched his amendment, which has - caused the Government and their supporters more worry and anxiety than any .proposal during the last four or five years. The agreement was so obviously wrong and questionable as to call for this amendment, and now we have the Government and their supporters endeavouring to wriggle out of a position in which the they have been placed by certain-persons outside this chamber. Those persons, of. course, may he linked up with persons inside this chamber who are financially interested, and the latter, of course, will vote for the agreement. With them if is not a question of Australiau interests, but a question of business and profits, and as business men they will do all things, questionable or otherwise, to further the The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) made a speecli to the executive of the Women's National Federation, in which he condemned the agreement. By a certain method that honourable member has come to the conclusion that the agreement is a had one) and that the Goveniment or this Houso will have to get out of it the best wav they can.",17
39,Mr STEWART,METEOROLOGICAL,What way is thatT,18
40,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"Practicall y repudiation. I did not hear the honourable member for Balaclava say that what we on this side have suggested is not a way out. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), with his legal mind and great experience-wit h his keen appreciation of all legal documents-is of opinionfor that this is a bad agreement in certain respects, hut that it is binding, or. the Government. The honourable member helplessly throws but his - hands, and says, "" It is bad, hut we have to accept it . """,18
41,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I did not say_,that. Mr BLAKELEY, - The honourable member most certainly said that the House would have to accept the agreement.",18
42,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,I did; I said it'was a good agreement.,18
43,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member said it was a good agreement, but only be- made several qualifications.",18
44,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"""No.",18
45,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,The honourable member pointed out several ways in which the agreement could have been bettered.,18
46,Mr MAXWELX,METEOROLOGICAL,Where ? Give me one instance.,18
47,Mr BLAKELET,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member in passing referred briefly to the selection of an "" independent"" chairman. The question of an independent chairman was, apparently, by some means or other, intentionally or otherwise, overlooked. It was generally accepted by the Committee, so far as I can learn, that there was to be an independent chairman, hut because of something of which I have no knowledge, the matter was dropped, and we have an agreement in which we find no mention of an independent chairman. M ay I say in passing that to get an independent chairman from the officers of the different Nationalist Leagues outside is an i m possibility. The only way to get an independent chairman is from the Labour party. I do not care where we go in the Nationalist party, whether it be to the National Club or the different council* and executives of the parjy, we find all linked up in the ramifications of finance andcommerce throughout the country. How, in the name »f heaven, can it be expected that a man from the Australian BSnk of Commerce, the Sun, the Daily Telegraph, the Sydney Morning Herald, or the Colonial Sugar Befining Company - a man linked up as tightly as it is possible for one to be with those who permeate the financial and commercial fabric of ' this country-ca n be independent in such a matter ? There is no such thing as an independent chairman when he is selected by our friends opposite, who represent the financial and commercial w o r l d ; to expect an independent chairman under such circumstances is so much rot and foolishness. A f t e r the lawyers opposite have finished with the agreement, we can only come to the conclusion that it is one which, at all costs, should not be consummated,* and I say that after listening to men who have endeavoured to show that it is a good agreement. But there is a way out. I would not for a moment p it my legal knowledge against that of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) or the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Bobert Best) on this particular matter, though there are points on which I m i g h t ; but I point out that we are now seeking to restrain the rapacity and crookedness of certain people who represent Marconi and the Amalgamated Wireless, and prevent them from bleeding the Commonwealth more than is absolutely necessary. The amendment readsThat we desire to advise His Excellency that the agreement mentioned in clause 12 of the contract made between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth should, before acceptance by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors, be agreed to by this' House. Clause 12 of the agreement is-The company shall, within six months after the date of this agreement, or within such extended time as the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board may determineBefore the period canbe extended, the representatives of .the Commonwealth on the Board must approveenter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of the stations mentioned in paragraphs (/) and [g) of clause 5 of this agreement. The agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature and to Buch an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia, and the stations in the United Kingdom and Canada. Whilst the Government have been lax and stupid, w i l f u l ly stupid, I believe, in . allowing the Marconi Company and other companies to dip their hands into the Commonwealth Treasury, there is nothing to prevent the Government instructing their representatives as to what procedure shall be followed in regard to an extension of the period mentioned in that olause. I hope that the Government will instruot their representatives that no agreement shall be entered into without adequate guarantee against lose. Because of atmospherics and acts of Providence"" and other people, including the Prime Minister, the guarantee should be great. I do not anticipate, ' however, that .the Government will ask for any guarantees which will he likely to harass their friends. God forbid that this Government, who were placed in office by the financial and commercial interests, should do anything derogatory to their nominators, or anything that would decrease in the slightest degree the profits of those people. The amendment provides a way out for the Government, but because that way is clear. I do not anticipate that the Government will accepti t . It may be said that because party feeling has been introduced into this discussion, honourable members who are opposed to the agreement cannot vote for the amendment, lest by so doing they might jeopardize the Go-, vernment Th|jy must accept the responsibility for their own mental gymnastics, but to my mind if a thing is bad it is bad. As for this amendment being a party issue, there is no doubt as to where members of the Labour party have stood right from the inception of the project. We knew that it was just another of those boodling schemes which the Government have been perpetrating ever since 1916. Despite what may be said by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Bobert Best) and the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), the amendment affords a means of escape from the present unsatisfactory position. I am not at all satisfied with the Commonwealth representatives on the directorate-Si r Willia m Vicars, Mr J. Stinson, and Mr M . Allard. It is an extraordinary fact that in some instances Mr G. M . Allar d is mentioned and in other instances Mr M . All a r d ; obviously both names apply to the same man. Sir William Vicars is, firstly, a business man,.and, secondly, a strong adherent of the National party. He is one of the first directors of the National Club in Sydney, the meeting place for the Nationalists and anti-Labourites in that city, and I suppose that ib is because of the money ' he put the club and into the party funds that he is chosen as a Commonwealth representative on the Wireless directorate. He has very great financial interests, not only in woollens, but also in banking, insurance, and many other large concerns, aud when we remember that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is linked up with the Sydney Ferries, and the Sydney Ferries are linked up with the ABO Bank, and so on right down the list, we see that these three directors have identical financial interests. In one directorate we may see the names of Sir Will i a m . Vicars and Mr . Mason Allard. On some other company Sir William Vicars and Mr Stinson are the directors, and right through the list these three men are linked up with almost every financial or commercial interest of this country. How can we expect such men to represent the Commonwealth ? They are representing the commercial and financial world, not Australia.",19
48,Sir ROBERT BEST,METEOROLOGICAL,Is their commercial experience of no value?,20
49,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"M o s t decidedly it is, provided it is given for the country's good. But if it is given for the benefit of certain private financiers it is of no value to the' Commonwealth and should not be tolerated. Why have the Government made this extraordinary departure of putting private commercial men on the Wireless directorate, when, on * all other concerns of a like character the Commonwealth is represented by public servants only? What control has the'Commonwealth, over Sir William Vicars? What penalty can it impose on him orr Mr . Stinson or Mr Allard?",20
50,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,They can be removed from the Board.,20
51,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"But what would he the benefit of removing them if the Government are to continue the policy of appointing directors of the National Federation to these positions? In connection with the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited , a company in which the Commonwealth is partnered with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Government have selected representatives upon whom they can visit punishment for any misbehaviour. They are men whose honour and jobs are at stake, and they would not lend themselves to manipulainto tion by any outside financial interests. One of those representatives is Sir Robert Garran, a servant of the Commonwealth, whose reputation and position are at stake. Another representative is Sir Robert Gibson, who has been connected with the Commonwealth Service for quite a long time, although he has now retired. Mr Lockyer is another' Commonwealth servant. All three are men who have a record of long public service and good reputations, and they have - something tangible to lose if they do anything that is not honest and upright. Representing the Commonwealth on the Wireless directorate, however, are some of the leading lights of the commercial - and financial world, with all its trickery, and' all its ramifications.",20
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,I think the honourable member will find that Mr Stinson was a publio servant.,20
53,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,Is he at present an employee of the Commonwealth?,20

57,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"This is not the first time in which the people of Australia, have been robbed by the wireless people. This is not the first occasion on which lies have been told and Governments misled. Honourable members probably retain painf u l recollections of the manner in which the Commonwealth was bled in 1914 by this same gang, namely, the Marconi people and Amalgamated Wireless. Honourable members wil l recall that the Labour party investigated certain patents of Father Shaw. These were adopted, following examination and inquiries by Mr Balsillie. Then Amalgamated Wireless and Marconi, acting much on a par with the methods of American finance, lodged an injunction against the Commonwealth. So far as one can 'learn, the Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless i nterests had not the slightest tittle of evidence to prove that they were entitled to an injunction. The wheel of political fortune turned. Tho Labour party went out, and the Liberal party came in . While Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless could not "" p ut any jokes over "" the Labour Government, they certainly could and did "" put the joke over ' i the incom.ing Liberal Government. Simultaneously with the. coming into power of the latter Administration, Amalgamated Wireless and the Marconi people stepped forward to secure some spoils. So far a; one can ascertain from all known sources, they had no case; but that di d mot prevent them from entering into an agreement. I think it was Sir, Joseph Cook who conducted the negotiations on behalf of the Commonwealth, with the understanding that each, of the parties should beartheir own costs. But the point is that the Commonwealth paid £5,000 for' certain patents. A f t e r the injunction had been lodged the Government instructed a Mr . Swinburne to investigate the patents. I refer now .to the Father Shaw patents; and he reported that there was absolutely no infringement whatever.. Probably at that time no greater expert in wireless matters could have been consulted than Mr Swinburne; and he reported that the Shaw patents were actually 33 per cent, more effective than the others which Were in dispute. On 26th May, 1914, Mr Fisk-the same' Mr Fisk who has now "" so l d a pup "" to this .country, much, to the edification ' of the Marconi interests, and of the shareholders in Amalgamated Wireless, and of men like Mr H . R. Denison, who is another of .those gentlemen whose name honourable members wil l find in the shareholders' lists of ail the banks and insurance companies, ferries, and wharfs",21
58,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,"Woo l tops, &c.",21
59,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"J u s t so; a member, in fact, of the inner financial gang. This same Mr Fisk, I repeat, . approached the Government in reference to bringing about a settlement. For the sum of £5,000 the Commonwealth Government were to be given certain patent rights. Two months r>rior to that settlement having heen offered and accepted, Amalgamated Wireless held certain rights so far as the Goldsmith patents were concerned, and when the agreement was entered into between the 'Government and the Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless peoplo it was understood, without its being set down on paper, that the Goldsmith patents were to be transferred, too. That just shows that the cunning of the Amalgamated Wireless and Marconi in terests was the same in those dayseight years ago-as today. The Government knew; the Solicitoir-.General's office knew; every one interested knew, that the company held the Goldsmith patents in, March, 1914. But , on 26th May of that year, when the agreement was entered into, no Goldsmith patents were held by the company. It had transferred them to a German firm; namely, the Telefunken. It was actually not until after war hod broken out thab the peopleof Australia knew that those patents had been sold by the Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless concerns to the Telefunken Company. And , so f ar as one can leam, no transfer took place; which makes one think that ths roguery of 1914 and the cunning trickery of 1922 have been carried out in exactly the same way by exactly the same people. If there is one thing that should have prevented the Goveniment in these latter days from entering into an agreement with the Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless crowd, it was that demonstration of their trickery in 1914. The company carried out whatwas quite a spieler's trick-althoug h one might meet with much cleverer spielers on a racecourse. That was to transfer all the patent rights they possessed. Then, knowing that they had transferred the Goldsmith patent rights, these people were '' on velvet."" The Commonwealth Government paid £5,000 for patents which, were useless, and the people of Australia, became £5,O0Q the poorer because of that successful example of cunning. The whole of the patents which were in any way useful were to expire, anyhow, three months after the agreement had been entered into.",21
60,Mr BRENNAN,METEOROLOGICAL,What did the Commonwealth Government get out of the fact that these people had entered an action against them for which there was no basis?,22
61,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"The Government were justas nice in those days as they at present. They did everything that was desired of them by Amalgamated Wireless, just as they have been doing during the past few months. The oniy difference in the whole of the two sets of circumstances is in respect of the time, the one incident having to do with the year 1 9 U , and the other, with 1922. Tho influences whioh were at work in 1914 are those which have been at work in this present year; and they have operated in each instance upon the same Goveniment. Later, the Amalgamated Wireless people again controlled those patents which tihey had sold in 1914. They bought them during the war. Sir Joseph Cook had been recommended to buy the patents, which were on the open market. The Commonwealth was then spending huge sums on wireless. However, the Government of the day refused to buy, so Amalgamated Wireless came into their own, and again controlled those patents which the Government in 1914 had thought they were purchasing. The company misled the Government in 1914; they "" sold them a p up . "" They bave misled us today, and have sold us a bigger "" pup."" In 1914 the "" pup "" cost us £5,000. To-day it will cost us haJf-a-millioa sterling, or more. muoh for that!",22
62,Mr RILEY,METEOROLOGICAL,Was Sir Thomas' Hughes chairman of the company in those days?,22
63,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not know. The share list of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, with which Mr . Fisk in a momentary lapse kindly supplied us, is something to conjure with. We find in that list of shareholders the names of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company Limited, the Australian Steam-ships Proprietary Limited, the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company Limited, and Mr Bartholomew and his friends and relations.",22
64,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,A r e not most of the shareholders-Australian citizens?,22
65,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"The capital of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company is not wholly Australian, nor is that of the Marconi English Company, which is on the list of shareholders. We have also in the share list the names of the Marconi International Marine Communication Company, which holds 16,000 shares, and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company Limited , which is the holder of 33,000 shares. These companies have differare ent names, but their address is the some"" Strand, London, W . C . "" I find also in this share list Burns, Philp, and Company Limited set down as the holders of 1,142 shares. The capital of that company cannot be said to be wholly Australian. Members of the Fairfax family, owners of the Sydney Morning Serald, are shareholders, while Anthony Hordern is the holder of 3,826 shares, Lebbeus Hordern holds 1,481 shares, and Samuel Hordern 3,456 shares. Huddart Parker, Limited is another shareholder of the company, and last, but by no means least, we have the name of Sir Thomas Hughes given as the holder of 571 snares. The Parliamentary Committee examined certain experts in Australia, and obtained sufficient evidence to show that it was highly improbable that effective communication could be established, by wireless over a distance of more than 2,500 or 3,000 miles. I am given to understand that the Committee, not content with this information, sent cable messages to America and _ England, asking for fur ther information which might assist its members to arrive at certain conclusions. The High Commissioner was communicated with, and asked to supply certain So particulars which, according to the notes of evidence, were of a technical character. The inquiry made through the High Commissioner's Office by the Parliamentary Committee would go through the hands of Mr Shepherd, Secretary to the High Commissioner, who is also a shareholder in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited.",22
66,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,Is his name on' the share list?,22
67,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,It is.,22
68,Mr LAIKD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,Has the honourable member a complete list of' shareholders ?,23
69,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"J [ may be doing the company an injustice, but I am doubtful whether it is a complete list of shareholders with which we have been - supplied. I have no desire to reflect in any way on Mr Shepherd, .but I consider it is highly dangerous to permit public servants, who may be called upon at any' time to make inquiries of this character, to have nnancial interests in a company of this kind. A public servant so situated might be called upon to obtain information which might make or break a company in which he had a personal interest. In this instance, Mr. Shepherd, a shareholder in the company, was asked by the Parliamentary Committee to procure certain information, and practically the only source in London from which he could obtain it was the Marconi companies, which hold a very large number of shares in the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. Everything, of course, may be perfectly fair and above board so far as those companies are concerned.' Mr Shepherd, I believe, does his work honestly ancl well, but public servants are expected to protect the interests of the Commonwealth even at the sacrifice of their own, and should not have any financial association with a company of this kind. Any information that came from England would be of a character calculated to lead the Committee to believe that the agreement was a desirable one from the point of view of the Commonwealth. I am not satisfied with the agreement, nor is my party satisfied with it. venture to say that a majority of the supporters of the Government do not approve of it. Judging iby their interjections and general demeanoxir, it seems to me that' this agreement is altogether too hot for the supporters of the Government to ' carry. Apparently it is not too hot for the Prime Minister. Nothing is too hot or too heavy for him. When he addressed himself to this question yesterday he spoke as he might have done at an Empire dinner in London. He referred in glowing terms to what might be achieved as the result of this enterprise. I am satisfied that even if a distance of 24,000 instead of 12,000 miles separated us from the. Old Country, the tight honourable gentleman would he prepared to tell the House that neither atmospheric nor any other conditions would prevent us from having, hy means of wireless, direct communication with England for twenty hours out of every twenty-four hours. The Prime Minister came here, I have no doubt, primed with information supplied  behind this scheme. I am convinced that. he did not consult his colleagues in regard to it . We have had evidence of a complete lack of communication between the Prime Minister and his colleagues with respect to this question. On Priday last the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) made a certain .statement with regard to the chairman of the company, whereas yesterday the Prime Minister made an absolutely different statement on the subject. He told us that he had already informed the company that, the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes as seventh director was not acceptable to the Government. The Treasurer, however, knew nothing of this on Priday last, and I do not believe that any other member of the Government was aware of it. If that he so, a most extraordinary state of affairs is revealed - It is remarkable that one man-the Leader of the Government-shoul d be able to do these things 'and "" get away "" with them. During the last five 'years the Prime Minister has ""got away"" with a good many things in this country, but not one of them is a3 questionable as the matter at present under review. It will probably be found that those who contributed to the honorarium which the right honourable gentleman received not long since-from a number of grateful residents of I Australia and other parts of the Britisli' Empire, are connected with such enterprises as the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited,' the Marconi Companies, the Colonial Sugar Befining Company, the Sydney Ferries Limited, variousgas and electric lighting companies, and' other financial and commercial institutions. Exception was taken last night by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Pratten) to a statement made by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstoy), to the effect that Mr G. Mason miles Allard was chairman of directors of Messrs. Beard, Watson and Company Limited,' Sydney. In support of his--statement the honourable member for Bourke quoted from the Australian In vestment Digest, of October, 1921. The honourable member for Parramatta said his statement was wrong, and quoted from the Australian Joint Stock Company's Tear-Book, for 1913-14, which set out that at that time Mr H . B. Allard was chairman of directors of Messrs. Beard, Watson and Company Limited. Australian Investment Digest which superseded the Australian, Joint Stock Company's Tear-Boole, shows that in October, 1921-seve n years later- Mr G. Mason Allard was chairman of directors of the firm. It is set out in the Digest that the firm .of Messrs, Beard, Watson and Company Limited was registered in New South Wales, on the 3rd August, 1901to acquire businesses carried on at Sydney by W. H. Beard, J. H. Watson, and Jas. Kebblewhite under the style of Beard, Watson and Co. The company was reconstructed in September, 1920, under the above name. That probably explains the change of chairman. It is set out further in this publication that the directors areQ. Mason Allard (chairman), James Kebblewhite (managing director), C. P. Bartholomew, E. H. Buchanan. I think that is sufficient evidence of the accuracy of the statement made by the honourable member for. Bourke that Mr. G. M . Allard, who has been appointed as a representative of the Commonwealth on the Board is associated in business with Mr C. P. Bartholomew, who is also a member of the Board, and that any vote given by Mr Allard as a director of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited would probably be in the interests not of the Commonwealth but of Messrs. Beard, Watson and Company. I venture to say that the 10,860 shares held by Mr Bartholomew are owned, not by him, but by Messrs. Beard, Watson and Company. Mr. Allard would in that 'case be part owner of those shares, and would not he likely as director of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited to give a vote calculated to decrease his own personal dividends.",23
70,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,But the honourable member has no foundation for these statements.,24
71,Mr BLAKELEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"I have given the names of the directors of Messrs. Beard, Watson and Company, and have shown that Mr C. P. Bartholomew, a member of - that firm, is set down as the holder of 10,860 shares. I have no evidence that these shares are held by Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company.",24
72,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"The probability is that their articles of association would not permit them to hold the in. The Mr BLAKELEY - I am, however, of  Bartholomew are Beard, Watson, and Company's, and therefore they are jointly owned by Mr George Mason Allard, who with Mr John Stinson, a good National supporter, and Sir William Vicars, one of the heads of the National party in New South Wales, has been placed on the directorate of the new Amalgamated Wireless Company, not in order to protect the interests of the Commonwealth, but so that he and his two co-directors may protect the financial interests of their own friends. I trust that the amendment will be carried.",24
73,Mr GIBSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"Corangamite) [3.36] - I was a member of the Wireless Committee which sat for some time, and took a good deal of trouble to draw up the agreement between the Government and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. We had to deal with highly technical subjects, and in this connection we were very much indebted to Senator John D. Millen, who acted as secretary to the Committee, and to Mr Malone, a Government officer. In fact, we could not very well have done without the services of those gentlemen, and we were extremely fortunate in having them to advise us in regard to the technical side of the question. The agreement, as submitted to the Committee, did not find acceptance from any member of the Committee. We turned it into one that could almost be termed a new agreement. I was very much surprised at the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) when he said that the agreement meant that the Commonwealth was to undertake a huge experiment. The Commonwealth was certainly to undertake a huge experiment under the terms of the old agreement, and, furthermore, was committed to the Marconi people to the extent that a contract was to be actually let to them for the erection of a high-power station in Australia at a cost of about £600-000.",24
74,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"Contingen t entering into this agreement. Mr GIBSOJS "" - That is so. did not know what the Commonwealth was .to get. The Committee had one special object in view, and that was to see that the Commonwealth would not be called upon to carry out what we regarded as an experiment by entering into an agreement with the company for the maintenance of commercial wireless communication over 12,000 miles, whereas the longest stage operating was about 4,500. ""We said to Amalgamated Wireless Limited, "" Y o u claim that you have the goods; we say that you must deliver them."" Thereupon we drew up clause 12 in the following terms:The company shall, within six months after the date of this agreement or within such extended time' as the representatives of the Conunonwealth on the Board may approve, enter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of the stations mentioned in paragraphs / and g of clause 5 of this agreement. Tlic agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature and to such an amount as ore approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the TJnited Kingdom and Canada. The agreement referred to is the very eSsenco of the whole business. The success or fail u re of the new' company depends on the contract to be approved of by the directors appointed by the Commonwealth Government, in whom are vested even greater powers than those possessed by the other four directors. They have full power to say whether the agreement referred to in clause 12 is acceptable to the Commonwealth Government or not. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Wise) says that many honourable members have swallowed the statements made hy Mr Fisk.'but I can assure the House that the Committee looked upon that gentleman's statements with a good deal of suspicion. That was one of their reasons for .stipulating in clause 12 that these people must put up a monetary consideration to prove that they could .do what they claimed to be able to do. We stipulated that they must provide commercial communication which we described in a sub-clause in the following terms: For the purposes of this agreement, the Commercial Wireless Service means a service on their capable, as regards plant, apparatus and personnel, of maintaining communication throughout 800 days of every year on the But we minimum basis of twenty words per minute each way for twelve IIOUTS per day. The point is that if they cannot give this service they are not to get £500,000 fro m the Commonwealth Government. Possibly they may be able to provide a service worth £100,000. If that is so the Commonwealth Government wil l pay them £100,000 .",25
75,Mr SCULLIN,METEOROLOGICAL,But how much will they be paid before it is ascertained that we are getting a satisfactory service.,25
76,Mr GIBSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"Provisio n is made for an absolute test, and for a monetary consideration acceptable to the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board of Directors.",25
77,Sir ROBERT BEST,METEOROLOGICAL,And the guarantee has to be given within six months or an extended tune.,25
78,Mr GIBSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"It is for the Commonwealth directors to say what the monetary consideration shall be and what the time shall be. Members of the Committee were not experts, and therefore, they placed upon the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board of Directors the responsibility of saying what a satisfactory commercial wireless service should be. However, the Committee were competent to draw up the agreement which the Government accepted, and which has been signed by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and the least the Government could have done was to have asked the members of t h at Committee who should be the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board of Directors. It is extremely unfortunate that Sir Thomas Hughes 'should be chairman of the company. In the first place the Committee set out to secure effective guarantees. It s next object was to secure the appointment of an independent chairman. It took us a long time to come to a conclusion, but we all understood that we were to secure the appointment of an in dependent chairman. Four of the members of the Committee were lawyers and the Solicitor-General (Sir Robert Garran) looked over the agreement afterwards and finalized: it . We all thought that the chairman would be an independent person. But now the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) and the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) point out that we could not have an independent chairman appointed, hecause it was open for auy individual to make himself ""independent.""",25
79,Sir ROBERT BEST,METEOROLOGICAL,I did not make that statement.,26
80,Mr GIBSON,METEOROLOGICAL,The honourable member said that if the word '' independent'' had been inserted in the agreement it would not have made one iota of difference.,26
81,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,In the case of Thomas Hughes.,26
82,Mr GIBSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"Yes , because he resigned from the position he previously held and submitted himself as an independent man. I hope that the Government will not stand by the selection. It is true that the three representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board of Directors will have greater powers than those possessed by the other four directors in connection with the agreement referred to in clause 12.",26
83,Mr FENTON,METEOROLOGICAL,But who are the three representatives of the Commonwealth?,26
84,Mr GIBSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"I know nothing of them, but I have not the slighest doubt that they are men of high standing. If what the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) says be true, that two of the directors are partners, one of them having been appointed to represent the Commonwealth Government and the other having been chosen to represent the Amalgamated Wireless Limited, it seems to me that the position is positively bad. I hope that the Governmeut will have learned a lesson, and that they will see that the agreement specified in clause 12 will safeguard the Commonwealth, which the Committee appointed by this Parliament, tried its best to do. The Government are not to be called .upon to undertake an experiment, because the Committee has provided that the other party is to put up monetary guarantees. The original agreement specified that the Marconi Company were to erect a high-power station at a cost of £600,000. Under the present agreement, as drawn up by the Committee, open tenders are to be called for the erection of this station. They are not to be submitted by one firm only. It will be the fault of the Government and of its representatives on the board of directors if that provision in the agreement is not carried out.  I wish to say a few words with reference to the controversy concerning the relative positions of Mr Horace Bateley Allard aud Mr George Mason Allard as 'chairman of Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company Limited. I have made a close investigation and find that the only connection Mr Horace Bateley Allard has with the company now is that the firm of Messrs. H . B. Allard, Way and Hardy are auditors to the firm of Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company Limited. A l Sir though Mr Horace Bateley Allard was chairman of the firm of Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company Limited for many years, a reconstruction has taken place, and within the last year or two Mr. George Mason Allard has taken his place. Therefore, at the present time, Mr George Mason Allard is chairman of the firm of Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company Limited, and the statement t'o that effect made last night by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) was accurate. I regret that I challenged its accuracy, and I take the earliest opportunity to let the House know the exact position. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",26
85,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"Nepean) [3.47] When I think of the history of the wireless agreement, I am perplexed at the attitude of honourable members opposite. 0 In the first place, the agreement was on the table of this House for about two months, and when the House finally considered it it was decided to refer it to a Committee, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was authorized to act upon the advice of that Committee. As we have heard, the Committee examined the original agreement, made very material alterations in it , and sent it back to the Prime Minister in an amended form. The matters raised by the Committee and in dispute between them and the Amalgamated Wireless Limited were all settled, as the Committee thought, in favour of the Commonwealth. The question of taking over the Commonwealth's existing radio plant and personnel was agreed to. The suggestion that guarantees should be put up by any company undertaking any contraot in connection with the plant or other requisities to Garry out the agreement was also agreed to. The question of the election of the board of directors, and, consequently, the control in the board of directors of the company was compromised. We must always remember that so far as the company is concerned the control in shareholders' meeting always with the Government. Control the board of directors was asked for by Amalgamated Wireless, and, after thorough consideration, the clause which has been so often referred to was agreed namely, that there should be nominated three directors by and to represent Commonwealth, and three to be elected and to represent Amalgamated Wireless; the seventh director was to be elected the six, or, in the event of a disagreement, an arbitrator was to be appointed. If the agreement, as drawn up now, had brought down to this House for sanction, I believe that not only honourable members on this side, but honourable members opthing, posite, would have agreed to it.",26
86,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,Knowin g all we know wealth. about the thing?,27
87,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"The suggestion is that before execution the .agreement should have been brought here, but if i none of these things would have cropped up. We could not have known what has happened in the interim, because it would not have happened; we should have had this agreement before us as it left the Committee.",27
88,Mr JH CATTS,METEOROLOGICAL,Thes e administrative shortcomingshave nothing the agreement?,27
89,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"Nothin g at all; we should have had this agreement as the Committee finalized it. They sent it Prime Minister, saying it was all right. If this agreement had been referred us here, and members of the Committee but in the other States. from all sides had got up and said they had given careful attention to it and lieved it was all right, we should have taken their word, as the Prime Minister did when he executed it. The objections that are now being made arise from what occurred subsequently to the agreement having been entered into.",27
90,Mr SCULLIN,METEOROLOGICAL,Would not the objecpress tion to Mr Allard have arisen?,27
91,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"No ; because Mr Alnothing lard would not have been appointed. I the agreement had come to us direct from the Committee no appointment would less have been made under it, and the names of Mr Allard and other gentlemen would not have been before us.",27
92,Mr SCULLIN,METEOROLOGICAL,You suggest that the - Government would not have put these pany appointments before the House?,27
93,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"That is another is question; the amendment we are dealing on with is to the effect that the agreement ought to have been put before the House. If the agreement had come here direct all these things would not have hapto, pened, and we should not be in our present position. We might have had the another motion disapproving of the apby pointments, but that is another question. This is why I think the honourable memby ber for Darling (Mr Blakeley) is not accurate when he says that the amendment provides a way out of the difficulty. been To my mind, the amendment certainly does not do that, because the agreement is signed; if the amendment means anyi t means repudiation of an agreement already executed by the Common",27
94,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"If we wished to repudiate, we would throw the whole thing t had been, out and have done with it.",27
95,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"That is quite another matter. I do not think that under ordinary circumstances this House, if it had had the agreement before it would have repudiated it ; it is only in the light of events which followed the execution of - the agreement that the amendment has to do with been brought forward. The honourable member for Darling criticised the share list of Amalgamated Wireless, pointing out that there were on to the it large shipping companies, newspaper proprietors, and great financial to people, not only in New South Wales, But I ask, ' who is more likely to take up beshares for the encouragement of wireless than men who are dependent on it-me n who; are looking to it to help them in their own business and in the advance of their own particular interests? If this wireless agreement,, as it proposes to do, is going to reduce cable rates and the cost of messages, is it not to the interests of newspapers to encourage it? I see wrong or subtle in such support. f As to the shipping, all the great companies desire an effective system of wirein connection with their own vessels, for this is very vital in the interests of passengers, crews and the ships themselves. These are the very people whom I should expect to see encouraging a comof this sort, which proposes to establish high-power stations.",27
96,Mr JH CATTS,METEOROLOGICAL,They require some kind of guarantees when they are putting in their money.,28
97,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"They are taking a risk, because they expect to get service, and it is a service which goes direct to the shipping aud to newspapers.. The personnel of the appointments has been criticised, and it has been suggested that men in the employ of the Commonwealth ought to have been selected. But I remind honourable members that the whole cry has been that we should get the assistance of business men; and if we get business men of importance who can successfully conduct business affairs, we get men who are interested not only in one industrial concern but in many. The very fact that they are interested in other enterprises shows that they have experience and ought to be able to conduct the affairs of the Comimoaiwealth in a satisfactory way. I do not know anything about Mr Mason All a r d except as an accountant; but I do know Mr Stinson and Sir William Vicars. So far as these two are concerned, I believe that they will give the Commonwealth good service, for they are as good men as could have been selected. When Sir Robert Gibson, of Melbourne, is mentioned as against them, I see no difference, so far as a selection is concerned, betvjeen that gentleman's position in this city, and the position that Sir Will i am Vicars holds in Sydney. I cannot see why these men who have proved their worth should be objected to. Like other honourable members, I have been astonished at one or two things in connection with this business. been astonished at the action of Sir Thomas Hughes, who has a reputation, and a high reputation, as one of the most honest, straightforward men in the business life of Sydney. ' It has come as a tremendous shock to rae to see him lend himself to such a thing as this.",28
98,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,What is the meaning of all these astonishing things?,28
99,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"I can only say that it has caused perturbation in my own minds; and it casts such a suspicion over the business that in my opinion we shall have to watch very carefully and closely the whole of the transactions. There is no doubt that, so far as Sydney is concerned, Sir Thomas Hughes is one of the most prominent ""men interested in wireless, aud it was because of that he was elected as director of Amalgamated Wireless. But if the Amalgamated Wireless were going to "" play the g a m e"" in an ordinary straightforward business manner, one of the first men they would have nominated as one of the three directors to be selected by them would have been Sir Thomas Hughes. There is no doubt he would have been the first chosen, but, knowing his strength in the community, and knowing his in t i mate knowledge of wireless, those interested apparently held him back to be put forward ultimately as the seventh director. I consider this is a breach of the clause of the agreement. How a man of the standing of Mr Consett Stephen could construe that clause of the agreement as giving him an absolutely free hand I do not know. He apparently took the view that his only duty as arbitrator was to select the best available man for the position irrespective of the question as to whether or not such a man had any connection with either the Commonwealth or the Amalgamated Wireless. It is a narrow interpretation such as I should not expect from, a man of Mr Stephen's ability and reputation. The very wording of the clause ought to have put h im on his guard. We know that representatives of the Commonwealth, particularly Mr Stinson, put the case most strongly that the seventh man ought to be an in dependent man; but, in spite of that, the , arbitrator made what I consider an extraordinary appointment. As I have already said, it has caused great perturbation, not only in my own mind, but, as I can see, I have in the minds of other bono' able members.

106,Mr BOWDEN,METEOROLOGICAL,"Does the honourable member not think that it does?

Mr MCGRATH ^(Ballarat) [4.7] - 1I have listened carefully and attentively to does the speeches on this amendment, and the more I have heard the more satisfied 1I have been that honourable members on this up side were right last session when they refused to trust the Prime Minister. It can is well known that, having returned from the Imperial Conference towards the end get of the year, he attempted, in the dying the hours of the session, to rush a wireless agreement through the House. Honourable members on this side of the House",29
116,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,Not only honourable members on that side of the House.,29
117,Mr MCGRATH,METEOROLOGICAL,"Thre e members of the Country party supported us, and we succeeded in delaying the adoption of the agreement until it was further investiI am satisfied there is a great deal more underlying this proposal than many honourable members realise. It is a "" wireless "" proposition, but there be has been a lot of wire-pulling taking place-for some time, and it did not commence at the Imperial Conference. The upon honourable member for Nepean (Mr. Bowden) said that we should have reThere minded the House of what occurred in Nobody knew moro about the of 1914 than did the present 1914. Prime Minister. He knew that when the late Charles Frazer was Postmastermany General in the Labour Administration, the Government, at the instigation of the wireless expert, decided to establish a Commonwealth wireless system. They immediately found themselves opposed by the Telefunken and Marconi companies, who sought an order of the Court to restrain the Commonwealth from proceeding with its scheme. As the Court ivould be influenced only by expertevidence, the Government imported the best wireless expert obtainable in the world, Mr Swinburne, at a cost of, approximately, £3,500. Mr Swinburne reported to the Government that the system which they were proposing to adopt was the best in the world at that time, and that it did not infringe any of the patent rights of the Marconi and Telefunken companies. Then the so called Amalgamated Wireless Companyreally Marconi and Telefunken-becam e scared, and on 26th May, 1914, just prior to the outbreak of war, wrote a letter to the Government offering to withdraw the legal proceedings if the - Commonwealth would pay them £5,000, each side to pay its own legal costs: The company also offered to sell certain patent rights the Government, including the Goldsmith rights, which at that time were considered the most efficient in the world for long distances). The Postmaster-General at that time was the Honourable Agar Wynne, and the Government accepted the company's offer. A sum of £5,000 was paid to the company, and the Commonwealth was to receive certain patent rights; but, upon investigation, it wa° discovered that these German Jews, who were behind the company then as they are behind the Marconi Company today, had sold the Government a right that would expire within two months of the sale, and could then be used by anybody for nothing. Two months before the outbreak of war these so-called patriots transferred to the Germans the only patent rights they possessed which were of any value. Those are the people whom we are asked to trust today; they are the same old gang of German Jews. That, briefly, is the history of their early connection with wireless in this country, and the efforts made by certain Australians to establish an independent system controlled by the Commonwealth. If , knowing the past history of the wireless negotiations, honourable members are still prepared to allow the Government to escape censure for their action in connection with the present agreement, they must answer to their constituents. Personally, I believe this to be a most "" fishy "" 'transaction. From the honor ten) we heard not one word of criticism of the Government, but he calmly admitted to us, the custodians of the rights of the people, that George Mason Allard, who has been appointed to represent the Commonwealth on the wireless directorate, is a partner with Charles Bartholomew, one of the representatives of the company. I have never heard of anything more scandalous. What is the use of making a fuss about the independence of the chairman? Already the company has a majority on the directorate. If Charles Bartholomew, who is a partner with George Mason Allard in the firm of Beard, Watson, and Company, is appointed to represent the company, and Allard sits on the same board as the nominee of the Government,' the Wireless Company will have in those men two representatives, for we may be sure that Allard will not vote against the interests to of his own partner. Of the original 200,000 shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited the Marconi Company held 60,000. In order to increase the private capital. to £500,000, as required by this agreement, an additional 300,000 shares have been issued. Were any applications invited in Australia for those shares? Was the issue advertised in the press, and was the Australian investing public asked to contribute capital to the company? No. Mr F'OWLEK - Mr Shepherd, Secretary to the High Commissioner's Office, has fifty shares.",29
118,Mr MCGRATH,METEOROLOGICAL,"No doubt that was a sort of bonus to Mr Shepherd, although he might have held those shares for a long time. The Marconi Company have 60,000 of the original 200,000 shares, and according to the share list just issued the company has, - so far as we can discover, another 100,000 shares of the new issue. We were told that this was to be an Australian enterprise of which we might all be proud, and why is it that Australian investors were never invited to take shares? Instead of that, a little game has been played, by the German Jews-Godfre y Isaacs and Mossey Myers, who, after all, are the Marconi Company. Tbis little gang of German Jew financiers controlling the Marconi Company have managed to secure the good services of the Prime Minister of the - Commonwealth. This is a matter to which the House should give more consideration than is being given in connection with this amendment. ,",30
119,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,But the Government have the numbers.,31
120,Mr MCGRATH,METEOROLOGICAL,"They may have, but when the people understand that upon the wireless directorate there are two partners representing opposite interests, they will insist upon knowing from honourable members opposite why they voted to cover up this transaction by the Government. Practically every transaction with which the Government have been connected since the £25,000 bribe was given to the Prime Minister has been "" fishy."" We heard the,honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) supporting the Government in the disposal of the Woollen Mills at Geelong, although they were making a profit for the Commonwealth. It is all right to allow private enterprise to take charge of a paying concern, but in connection with wireless, because there may be a shadow of a chance of losing money, private enterprise is not to be trusted. Private enterprise asks the Goverument in this matter to find £500,000 of the people's money, so that it may be utilized for the benefit of a few speculators. The whole transaction is shady, and investigation should not stop with the discussion of the amendment. The criticism should not be confined to the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes as seventh director, but should extend over the whole history ,of the company since 1914. The Government might, at any rate, plead that Sir Thomas Hughes was appointed by an arbitrator, but no arbitrator appointed George Mason Allard. Knowing the business relationships of Allard with Bartholomew, the Government deliberately nominated the former to be their representative, allowing him to sit upon the board with his partner representing the opposite interests. It was only by accident that we heard that Sir Thomas Hughes had been appointed to the directorate. There was no protest from the Government against his appointment until the information regarding it was elicited in another place. A most serious charge has been established against the Government, and I cannot conceive of any honourable member voting with them on this amendment.",31
121,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,"Robertson) [4.20] Much has been said concerning the fact that honourable members have not had the matter of the wireless agreement properly placed before them. But when it came under the attention of the House at the fag-end of last session, some honourable members, at any rate, entered an earnest and, indeed, a violent protest. I shall show, by reading excerpts from the Hansard records of December last, that there were some honourable members who warned the House of the true position. One said I oppose this agreement because I believe it is unfair to ask the people of Australia to become shareholders in a company under conditions that a man would never think of advising a member of the ordinary public to accept. The honourable member proceededHonorable members seem to be anxious to come to a vote on this question but we are being compelled by the procedure adopted to do what we do not want to do. It is not fair for the Government at the last moment of the session to attempt to force such an important matter through the House simply because honourable members want to get away from their labours as quickly as possible. ' What are we here for? We are here to protect the interests of the public, and why should the Government be allowed to make this proposition which is not a proper business proposition-n o one would so describe it-and , because it is the fag end of the session, tell honourable members that they are expected to say nothing ? Then the proposition to appoint a Committee was mooted, and the following objection was made to the appointment of such a body:It may be that the Committee will not fairly represent the opinion of Parliament, even if it is composed of members of several parties; and unless we are given full and fair opportunity for discussion of its decision, we have no right to go into recess. Yet honourable members have been in formed, during the course of the present debate, that the House accepted the position, not knowing what it was doing. I say honourable members were warned. I admit that the House had not reasonable time in which to deal with so important a project; but the scheme was placed before the House, and the House was undoubtedly blind to its'duty.",31
122,Mr LAIKDSMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,Who m has the honourable member been quoting?,31
123,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member for Robertson. The House, I repeat, was blind to its duty in this as in other matters. But the present crisis has at Governor General's Speech: least thrown into high relief the condition into which we are drifting. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) advanced the wireless proposition; and, in some way or other, he persuaded the House to swallow it. Surely it is time that we, as the representatives of the people, not only awakened to the' dangers of such a state of affairs, but took drastic action to remedy it ! The Prime Minister yesterday quoted the words of the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and inter-, preted them to mean that he had spoken in favour of the agreement. But, in reading the Hansard report, the right honourable gentleman forgot, or omitted, to tell the House what were the last few words employed. The honourable member said, in conclusionI should be sorry to be the cause of delay in the settlement of this matter, but, in my opinion, it requires more investigation.",31
124,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,But the honourable member for Cowper only wanted to investigate the bona fides of the company. I invite the honourable member to read his leader's remarks prior to those words he has just quoted.,32
125,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member for Cowper said, "" but, in my opinion, it requires more investigation."" ",32
126,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Yes , investigation of the company's bona fides. The honourable member for Cowper made that clear. He did.not go as far as the honourable member for Robertson, nor did he take the same stand.",32
127,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,"That is so. I , and one or two other members of the Country party, said definitely that we were bitterly opposed to the agreement. But the leader of our party had perceived the danger, to a certain extent, at any rate, when he made those remarks",32
128,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,It is of no use for the honourable member to try to save his leader. The honourable member for Cowper swallowed the proposition holus bolus. The honourable member for Robertson did not.,32
129,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,"I can scarcely see justification for the honourable member's criticism of my Leader, seeing that the y honourable member said the matter required further investigation. The trouble is that the House did not insist upon [20 JULY, 1922.] Address-in-Reply. 671 further investigation; and now we are told we are bound hand and foot, because a majority of honourable members servilely followed the Prime Minister, and had not the courage to' insist upon an inquiry",32
130,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,The honourable member should not forget that the Leader of his party voted against the suggested inquiry. He was obviously not leading the honourable member for Robertson on that occasion.,32
131,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,"I wish to deal now. with the work of the Committee. Honourable members are informed that its task was carried out excellently. The Committee certainly improved what was originally an extremely bad agreement. But, here, honourable members see merely another evidence of the manner, in which this House has perany long mitted matters to drift. Could any one have conceived that, prior to the appointment of the Parliamentary Wireless Committee, this Parliament would have reached such a stage in its affairs that a Minister of the Crown would be permitted to continue to act as the chairman of an investigating Committee, after he had been promoted to the Ministry? I can only say that the whole of the facts constitute a highly improper situation. I was extremely sorry to see the honourable member ;for Flinders (Mr Bruce) continue to occupy such an invidious post. The Treasurer, with his traditions and training should have seen at a glance in what an anomalous position he had been placed. Had he not been associated* with such men as have been around him he would have perceived immediately that it was time for him to get out and have no further association with the inquiry. It has been said that honourable members in this corner have been spending their time in traducing Australia, and that we must flow take our courage in both hands and make an effort to vindicate ourselves. I ought not to have to say that we ardently believe in our country. Our trouble is that the country is not getting a fair run. We have no faith in the man who is at present at the head of affairs. Here is the justification of our lack of faith: We do not want to decry Australia. I defy honourable members to find any group of men possessed of a firmer faith or a higher belief in this country than that of the Country party. We know our country well. We have traversed it up and down, and back and forward, and we know the hearts of its people. But we know that those hearts are being broken because of such things as this agreement, things which are brought down here and forced upon a servile House, things for which - the people must eventually pay.",32
132,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"Wilmot) [4.28] The debate has disclosed a number of features which no honourable member had previously dreamed of. If the Government will take advice, I would urge them to get out"" of the arrangement on the best possible terms. In the best interests of the country they should approach the Amalgamated Wireless Company and see if they cannot come to some business like arrangement for the termination of the contract entered into. One thing has struck me forcibly during the debate. I cannot think that Mr Consett Stephen, when asked to act as arbitrator, did not have all the facts before him. But, if he did possess all the facts, I cannot conceive how he- a lawyer-coul d have appointed an individual who was - interested in Amalgamated Wireless to be the seventh director. I may be doing Mr Stephen an injustice; I hope that I am not. But I feel satisfied in my own mind that, when asked to act as arbitrator, his attention was 'drawn to the alterations made in the agreement. In the original draft before this House, which was not accepted, provision was made that foursevenths of the directors should be representatives of Amalgamated Wireless, and that three should be the nominees of the Commonwealth. Nearly the whole of the old agreement is to be found in the present agreement; but, in the altered personnel of the directorate, there may be seen one of the main changes. Special provision was made that there should be six directors, three appointed Ifrom each side, and the seventh to be selected by those six. But, in the event of disagreement, the six directors were to appoint an independent arbitrator, who was to select the seventh man. Mr Stephen must have known those facts. And if he did, then in appointing Sir Thomas Hughes he must have known also that he was simply putting the whole situation back into its original unsatisfactory state. The Government are now in duty bound to try to get out of the arrangement on the best possible terms.",33
133,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Where are the honourable member's suspicions directed? To the arbitrator, or to the Government?",33
134,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"I say that the arbitrator must have known the facts. If he had them before him, I cannot conceive how he could have selected a gentleman who had been directly interested in the affairs of the company. - Mr BRENNAN - Can the honourable member tell mo whether Sir Thomas Hughes was put forward by the representatives of the company or of the Commonwealth as a suitable person to be chosen as seventh director? Or can he tell me who wag the other person whom the arbitrator had to consider together with Sir Thomas Hughes?",33
135,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"I cannot say of my own knowledge that that gentleman was put forward by any one, or by either party. But it is clear that the Commonwealth could have had no voice in suggesting him to Mr Stephen ; otherwise 0 the Government would not now say that they cannot accept him.",33
136,Mr BRENNAN,METEOROLOGICAL,I do not think that is conclusive. That is just the point that I was wondering about.,33
137,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not think that the Government put Sir Thomas Hughes forward, whoever may have suggested him to Mr Consett Stephen. Anyhow, if I can see an opportunity to bring about the cancellation of his appointment, I shall certainly make use of it. As for the agreement itself, there is one point on which the Committee is to be commended. It has safeguarded the interests of the Commonwealth as fully as was possible. I refer to the fact that the agreement provides that the company shall, within six months, proceed to do certain things and give certain guarantees regarding the despatch of messages, and the like. If the eompany does not satisfy the Government upon those points within the period specified it will be open for the Commonwealth authorities to cancel the agreement. The Committee is to be commended for having included that safeguard. But if the company can carry out its specified undertakings it must, of course, be allowed to go ahead. At any rate, as matters stand, we are bound in a contraot. If , as many honourable members bave advised, the Government were to cancel the agreement and repudiate the whole business, the Commonwealth would not be in as good a position as if the Government were first to try to employ fair and business-like methods. It will be time enough to repudiate the agreement when the company has refused to ""let us out"" on proper terms. However, I am quite satisfied with the assurance of the Government that they will not go on with the agreement while Sir Thomas Hughes remains in the position of seventh director. We are safeguarded in that respect, and I therefore know no reason why I should vote for the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Batman. ' I think that 'the Government, if possible, should withdraw from the agreement, but I have not yet come to a decision as to whether, in the event of fresh steps being taken i u connection with long distance wireless telegraphy, operations should bo conducted by the Government or left to private enterprise under Government supervision. Apparently very little is known, in Australia about long distance wireless - I was under the impression that certain people whom I consulted on this subject in December last knew more about it than they seem to know today, otherwise I should not have taken their advice and have voted as I did when the agreement was before us at that time. I sincerely hope that in the event of the Government being able to withdraw from this agreement, no further step will be taken by them in connection with an enterprise of this kind without first obtaining the advice of the best able experts. Money so spent would mean in the long run a material saving to the Commonwealth. When this matter was before the House in December last I was assured, not only by certain persons outside, from whom I made inquiries, but iby an honourable.member of this House, that long-distance wireless was reliable and effectire. I voted for the reference of the agreement to a Parliamentary Committee, subject to the condition that, if the Committee approved of it, the Prime Minister should be empowered to execute it, because of the plea of the right honourable gentleman himself that it was a matter of great urgency, and that he did not want it to be held up until the next session of the Parliament. It was because of the plea of urgency, and the fact that I was assured that long-distance wireless was effective, that I voted as I did. The Committee was by no means satisfied, as the result of its investigations, that long-distance wireless was uot reliable, and we have no positive assurance to the contrary. If the company cannot, within six months, do what is required of it by the agree-. ment, then the 'agi'eement will go by the board.",33
138,Mr BILEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"What about the £50,000 that the Commonwealth has already paid"" into it?",34
139,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,I cannot say whether there will be any means of recovering the money so paid. I am not going to blame any one for the position I took up and the vote that I gave when the agreement was before us in December last. The vote that I shall cast today will be consistent with that then given by me. The object of the honourable member for Batman's amendment is to turn the Government out of ofiice.,34
140,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,Not at all.,34
141,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,Does it not amount to a motion of censure?,34
142,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,It simply asks the honourable member to turn to the job he was sent here to do.,34
143,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"The carrying of the amendment would not get us anywhere unless it be to the country. It would not affect the position of the Commonwealth Government under the agreement which has been entered into. It has no application to the position with availwhich we are confronted. I do not think that, in submitting his amendment, the honourable member had any knowledge of many facts which have been disclosed in the course of the debate upon it. He did not know that Sir Thomas Hughes had been appointed as a seventhdirector, nor do I think he knew anything as to two members of the one firm having been appointed as directors, one to represent the Commonwealth and the other to represent the interests of private shareholders. Had he been cognisant of such matters he would have introduced them into his very entertaining and interesting, if not convincing, speech. Having regard to the disclosures that have been made during this debate I have come to the conclusion that it would be wise for the Government to get rid of the agreement. The amendment, however, has no bearing on that point. It would lead us nowhere, and in view of the position that I took up when the original agreement was before us, it would be inconsistent for me to support it . 1",34
144,Mr MATHEWS,METEOROLOGICAL,"Melbourne Ports) [4.42] - I fail to appreciate the reason for all the fuss that has been made about the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes as seventh - director of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. We aTe told that his appointment means, in effect, that there will be on the Board four representatives of private shareholders, and only three representatives of the Commonwealth. To my mind the appointment means only that there will be seven instead of 'six directors. Even the most ardent supporters of the Government will admit that the three directors appointed to represent the Commonwealth are just as suitable, from the point of view of the Marconi crowd, as are the men who have been selected by those people. The complaints that have been made in regard to the selection of Sir Thomas Hughes are quite beside the mark, because he will be no more able to beat the remaining six directors than "" Sir "" Thomas Walsh would be. Strong man though he, is, Thomas Walsh could not beat the six any more than Sir Thomas Hughes could do. I marvel at the impudence of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in committing the Commonwealth to an agreement of this sort. If , while he was Leader of the Labour Government, he had made such an agreement, and had endeavoured to put into good positions men sharing his political beliefs, there would have - been a howl from Dan to Beersheba. It would have been said by honourable members opposite that he was handing over the country to a band of agitators. Yet, as the Leader of a Conservative Government, he has the impertinenceto enter into an agreement providing for the appointment of seven directors from the Conservative section of the community, and to empower them to spend £500,000 of public money. I am by no means exaggerating the position when I make this statement. When a Queensland Labour Administration had the courage to appoint a Labour man as Chief Justice of that State the whole of the legal fraternity rose in pious horror; yet we are expected to accept without protest the appointment of Conservatives to all sorts of positions. When Dr Jensen was appointed by a Labour Government as Government Geologist for the Northern Territory, there was a howl of indignation from the Conservative party. His qualifications were not disputed; they were of the highest order. The sole ground of, complaint was that he was a Labour man. In this case we have £500,000 of public money handed over to a private company presided over by seven Conservatives. The time will come when even the . Prime Minister's supporters will tire of such impudence. I hope that honourable members will cease to complain further about the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, because, while his appointment to the Board «of Directors of. this company will strengthen "" F at "" and the exi ploiters of Australia generally, we kuow that there are six other directors of the same class. The real gravamen o,f the charge made against the Government is not that Sir Thomas Hughes has been wrongly appointed, but that we have been sold something that is worthless. Not one honourable member who has spoken during this debate has said that wireless telegraphy is effective over a distance of 12,000 miles. The Government have put £500,000 into such a project at a time when we are told on all sides that we should economize. The Government are not prepared to increase invalid and old-age pensions. They tell us that the country cannot afford to increase them; but at the same time they are ready to spend £500,000 in bolstering up a big financial concern that can well afford to pay its own way. The Government are going to sell the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong- a socialistic concern that has proved a success-and are putting £500,000 into something which looks like a failure. They cannot afford to increase the invalid and old-age pensions, but they have agreed to give £500,000 to "" Uncle Three-Balls.'' I can only say of those who are prepared to continue tn support a Government which does such a thing that they have more pluck than I have. When the Prime Minister returned from the Old Country last year he told us that by means of wireless we were going to be kept in direct touch with B r it a in every hour and every minute of the day, so that in time of trouble we would have a quick and effective means of communication with the centre of the Empire. There is no proof, however, that wireless is effective over a greater distance than 4,000 miles, and this company will not be penalized if it fails to carry out its part of the contract. We are told that we are bound hand and foot by the agreement. No one will ' charge me with having joined in the howl for (iconomy. What some people speak of as economy would, to my mind, lead only to iuefficiency, and such men as Ashworth, Knight, and Twigg-Patterson would do well to focus their attention on expenditure of this kind, and to call upon the country to deal with those who are responsible for it . Then they might justify their existence by pointing to an economy which is essential. We know now from the expert evidence submitted to the Wireless Committee that wireless communication has not a greater range than 4,500 miles, except under very favourable circumstances, or, perhaps, by accident.",35
145,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,"Hav e tried wireless beyond 4,500 miles?",36
146,Mr MATHEWS,METEOROLOGICAL,"The other night a message from Berlin was picked up at Perth; but the honourable member knows that it was a freak. On two occasions a friend of mine has picked up messages from America with a primitive wireless receiving plant. We were told that the system was so perfect that Australia was in communication with Great Britain every hour of the day. In my innocence I thought that if any one knew anything about wireless the Marconi crowd should. I thought that if they made a statement that they could communicate over 12,000 miles it could be done.",36
147,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,METEOROLOGICAL,If they do not they are paid proportionately.,36
148,Mr MATHEWS,METEOROLOGICAL,But our system will be valueless if it does not have a range of 12.000 miles.,36
149,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,"No authority can say today that a range of 12,000 miles is not possible; because there is no high power station at this end to receive messages from that distance.",36
150,Mr MATHEWS,METEOROLOGICAL,"If the. honourable member went into a grocer's .shop in ol der to buy at in of fish would he buy if the grocer said, "" I do not say that it is good, but no one can say that it is bad."" The only course the honourable member could pursue would be to believe that the fish was bad until it was proved to be good. We have no proof that we can have direct wireless communication over a distance of 12,000 miles. The incidents referred to in the debates this session are the strongest proof of the failure of the present social system. Here we have a body of men with all the money of the world at their command, men associated with a nnancial circle in Europe which could find £500,000,009 if necessary, coming out here to the people of Australia and "" taking us down."" I I do not say that the Government are ' ' in the show"" in "" taking us down,"" but through this bargain of theirs they have clearly shown their unfitness to occupy the position they hold today. We are bolstering up a huge financial concern, and yet Ave cannot afford to keep paying woollen mills running. If this is ""good business "" I do not know what "" bad business "" is . ' The case in which the Marconi Company sued the Federal Government must still be fresh in the minds of honourable members. In 1911, a young man named Balsillie came like a flash on they ever the scene; he was a genius, although something subsequently went wrong with him ; he had brains in plenty, but evidently he lacked balance. At any rate, the highest expert of the day decided that his ideas were . sufficiently unique to warrant patenting on their own. They were no infringement on the Telefunken or Mar-1 coni systems. At that time the Telefunken and Marconi crowds were quarrelling with one another; they were sueing one another; like Kilkenny cats they were cutting one another's throats, each claiming that the other was trespassing on its own particular field of profiteering. The moment, however, they found that there was another Richmond in the field in the shape of an official of the Commonwealth Government, who had' perfected a system likely to compete against theirs, they ceased rowing among themselves, and jointly sued the Commonwealth , Government. If we have purchased today at a cost of £500,000 something that is useless to us, it is only another reason for watching the Government closely. The Nauru agreement was a foolish one. 0 It has made superphosphates £ 1 dearer than they should have been. The Anglo Persian Oil agreement is another serious matter. Where are we to finish? It is time the Country party listened to what honourable members of the Opposition place before the House, and ceased shaking their heads, and thinking that nothing good can come out of Nazareth. If they had been doing their duty, none of these agreements would have eventuated. Therefore, they must be prepared to accept their share of whatever blame falls upon the Government in connection with this wireless agreement.",36
151,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,"Perth) [4.57] - I had not intended saying anything in this debate, but after listening to a speech last night, I felt that I must make a few observations. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Wise) left no doubt in the minds of those who were listening to him last night as to his opinion of the wireless agreement. was thoroughly bad, according to his view. Indeed, ihe suggested that we were giving away £500,000. He went on to regret that, in the earlier stages- I presume when the matter was under discussion by Cabinet-h e was not a free man, so that he might' have denounced the agreement on the floor of the House. May I suggest to the honourable member that there was no compulsion on him to remain in the Cabinet under those conditions; that hj9 duty to the country was that he should at once have taken the opportunity of speaking as a. free man on the floor of the House about this agreement into which Parliament was about to be dragged? The honourable member, however, preferred to stick to his portfolio, and let Parliament take the chance of finding out subsequently that the proposal was a thoroughly bad one.",37
152,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,"That is right. Kick every one but yourself, who deserves it most.  are any members in the Cabinet, even . now, who occupy the same position as the honourable member for Gippsland occupied until he was kicked out. I am inclinedto think that there are other members in the Cabinet who believe that this less agreement is thoroughly vicious, and yet they keep perfectly quiet about it , preferring to continue drawing their Ministerial salaries. It is a very bad commentary on parliamentary government, and on our political institutions that such a state of affairs should exist, and the sooner we can get away from it the better for the country.",37
153,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,The green monster of jealousy again! The man who was always left out by all his parties!,37
154,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,The honourable member for Gippsland. is retailing what is known by my friends to be an absolute lie.,37
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,Order !,37
156,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,"It is known to them to be an absolute untruth. I could have been in a Cabinet long before the honourable member, or any of my maligners.",37
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,"I ask the honourable member to cease these personal references. Mi"". WISE - The honourable member could not speak without them.",37
158,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,I have hurt the honourable member for Gippsland badly; It my observations are justified in view of the speech he made last night.,37
159,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,It is not the first time the honourable member has done it .,37
160,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,I am sorry that the honourable member is annoyed.,37
161,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I am not annoyed. I expected this from the honourable member.  ber shows pretty plainly that he is annoyed, and I suggest to him that his annoyance is of no - consequence to me. I intend to have my say in this House on these matters whether the honourable member or any other person is annoyed or not.",37
162,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I expected this. It is a change to hear the honourable member's views on me, instead of on his own colleagues.  ber for Gippsland, after having condemned the agreement, suggested that the Prime Minister was not to be blamed. If the Prime Minister is not to be blamed, I do not know who is. The honourable member for Gippsland evidently regards the Prime Minister as sacrosanct. I do not. I think it is my duty as a member of this Parliament to speak quite plainly wire- and openly when I find the Prime Minister making mistakes. The honourable member for Gippsland evidently does not adopt that course, but it puts him in a rather humiliating position when we find that' after he has been kicked out of the Cabinet be should turn round and indicate to his Leader that he is still his f a it h f u l henchman. Probably, the honourable member for Gippsland, having been elevated by him to the only distinction he has achieved in Parliament, hopes, on some future occasion, by his adulation of the Prime Minister, to get back again to a similar position.",37
163,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"That remark is not worthy of the honourable member for Perth.  ter stands up in this House and says that lie does not believe in a particular agreement, and that he kept silent in order to remain in his Ministerial position, it is something very serious indeed, showing that we have fallen very far in our representative institutions below the ideal of parliamentary government. gards the suggestion that the Prime M in ister is not responsible for the position in which we find ourselves today, let me just read what he said in this House on 5th October, 1921, when he was discussing this particular matter. D u r in g the course of his speech, he saidWe shall have to discuss these matters as definite proposals, but honorablo members must have time to consider the in. A little further on he saidThere are one hundred reasons why we should not do anything hurriedly in the matter of wireless communication. A hundred reasons' I want to know from the honourable member for Gippsland, or from any one else, where the Prime Minister carried out his promises to give Parliament an opportunity of considering the proposals. Is it not true that these proposals were brought down in the last hours of last session, and only by a mere chance were delayed?",38
164,Mr GREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,The actual proposals were tabled here in October.,38
165,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,But no opportunity was given at that time to discuss them.,38
166,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,Honourable members had all the opportunity they wanted to look into them.,38
167,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Hear , hear!' Mr FOWLER , - But no opportunity was given u n t i l the last hours of last session to discuss them, and it was only by mere chance that they were delayed through the appointment of a Committee to consider the agreement. Does the Minister at the table who interrupts me. suggest that the bringing down of these proposals in the last hours of last session was a mere accident, and that it was not done intentionally and deliberately in order to prevent Parliament from discussing the proposals?",38
168,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I say that the honourable member has no justification for making such a statement.  portance of the proposal, and of the pledges of the Prime Minister, there was something radically wrong when we did not get an opportunity to discuss it .",38
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,It was because the House talked too much I,38
170,Mr FOWLER,METEOROLOGICAL,"I wish to find out, if I can, whether it was the Cabinet that arranged the terms of this agreement. I should like to know whether or not the agreement was practically made by As re- the Prime Minister himself and the other parties before the Cabinet was even brought into the matter at all. I am in clined to think from the silence of honourable members. who are members of the Cabinet that that is the position.",38
171,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member is quite wrong.  position as indicated by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Wise), and when I know also that there are other members of the Cabinet opposed to the agreement, it is strange that, in spite of the opposition of the Cabinet, events have reached their present development.",38
172,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,METEOROLOGICAL,When did the honourable member vote on the question ?,38
173,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,"He never voted; he was not here, but was neglecting his d u t y !  the position I take up before I sit down.",38
174,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,"What position did you take up then-no t now?  some information regarding another phase of the matter; I wish to know whether the Prime Minister, in making this agreement, consulted any of his experts before he came to a decision. I say again that the Prime Minister did not consult even a single expert in regard to the proposals. In view of the circumstances the House ought to hesitate before it commits itself to a scheme which has been condemned by practically every honourable member who has spoken since the debate commenced. It is somewhat significant that one man, who-is specially qualified to give an opinion in regard to this matter, declares that the best thing we can do with the agreement is to tear it up. Senator John D. Millen, in the Senate last night, is reported to have so spoken. Although we have had much criticism from the Opposition, and some of it very able and effective, still to my mind the most damning part of the indictment is to be found in the hesitating and qualified attempts to defend it by members sitting directly behind the Government. I have not yet heard a single attempt to defend this agreement without making very substantial qualifications! regarding it. I only saying what is in the minds of nine-tenths of the honourable members when I declare that the whole business from beginning to end reeks with suggestions of the worse possible kind. I shall have nothing whatever to do with the matter. I am not going to vote for the amendment, because, in my opinion, it does not improve our position in the very least.",38
175,Mr RILEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"We do not want your vote!  chance of doing what Senator John D. Millen has suggested, and tearing up the agreement, I would do it ; but as I cannot do that, I shall have nothing whatever to do with the business. I shall not vote at all.",39
176,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Barrier) [5.10] Like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews), I am wondering what all the trouble is about. I am especially surprised at the complaints of honourable members opposite, who do not seem to like "" big business "" running the country.",39
177,Mr BRENNAN,METEOROLOGICAL,They do not like being found out!,39
178,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"When something does leak out, and. when it is too "" raw,"" of a majority or somebody upsets a little scheme through being too inexperienced",39
179,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,"There is a difference it is all right? between "" b i g business"" and roguery.",39
180,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member, as an expert, is certainly able "" all right."" to give the House the benefit of his experience regarding that. Honourable members opposite, who are still innocent enough to believe there is a Democracy Australia, and that a democratic Governand ment is in existence-wh o do not believe in a dictatorship; but support the dictabate. torship of capital in Australia by their votes and their solid support of the representatives of capital-ar e very much concerned. Of course, it is rather awkward for those honourable members, seeing that we are in the last session of this Parliament. The public have swallowed a lot of things quite as bad as this without making very much fuss, but there is always a danger that unexpectedly the crowd may wake up over some more or less unimportant matter, and those honourable members may be made the scapegoats. Therefore, I suppose there is am some justification for at least giving the public the impression that they are dissatisfied with the actions of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, though not sufficiently dissatisfied to hold the Government responsible for its stupidity, or worse. The remarkable part of the disclosures, so far as the debate has gone, is that on the last occasion when this question was mentioned in the House, the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) was f u ll of determination to see the business through. He told us that Sir Thomas Hughes had been appointed, though he (Mr Bruce) could not understand how, and so forth, but in any case, he said, there were insuperable obstacles-to use his own language-in the road of remedying the position. The Treasurer conveyed the impression that the Government were going to stand by the agreement, that there was to be no surrender ; if any mistakes had been made by the Government the Government would stand by them, and there was an end of the matter. The Minister for Defence (Mr Massy Greene) came along to the rescue, and adopted a somewhat more moderate attitude, and now we find that the Prime Minister, having counted heads, and knowing that he is perfectly assured",39
181,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,METEOROLOGICAL,Are you sure,39
182,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,Whenever the Prime Minister takes things easy it is,39
183,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,METEOROLOGICAL,"The weather is very bad oustide, you know!",39
184,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"That is indicated in by honourable members who have spoken, also by honourable members who have refrained from taking any part in the deThose who have spoken have tried to camouflage the issue, in order to distract the attention of members ancl of the public from the sins of the Government, ancl have attempted to place the responsibility On the shoulders either of the Committee, which investigated the proposed agreement, or on the arbitrator appointed. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey), in his very eloquent speech last evening, gave the House much food for thought, and caused considerable unrest on the Government benches by the disclosures that he made. I wish the honourable member had had sufficient time to follow up the line he was pursuing, for the public might then have been able to understand the apologies made by honourable members opposite for the position in which the Government have placed the country ; we should have understood why these attacks are made on the Committee appointed by the Government, and the frantic attempts to direct suspicion towards Mr Consett Stephen instead of to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.",39
185,Mr FLEMING,METEOROLOGICAL,No one had any picion of Mr Stephen.,40
186,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Atkinson) when speaking, said distinctly that he was decidedly suspicious, that he full y believed all the facts were placed before the arbitrator, and that he had complete f a it h in the Government. If the honourable member is suspicious, of whom is he suspicious?",40
187,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,I said it was a suspicious circumstance that Mr Stephen should appoint an interested man if he had all the facts and circumstances before him.,40
188,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member had complete f a it h that all the facts were placed before the arbitrator, and yet he is suspicious. The interested attempts made by honourable members opposite to throw suspicion on the arbitrator and the Committee are evidence to my mind that they are particularly anxious to direct attention away from the Government. The Committee took evidence, and the report presented shows that the Amalgamated Wireless Company, to say the least, gave them very little assistance. It is stated in the notes of evidenceNone of the witnesses was able to indicate a system operating commercial wireless telegraphy in any part of the world over a distance equnl to that proposed to be covered by the direct service suggested by either of the proponents. FurtherThe longest wireless circuit today, regularly handling commercial tratlic, is between Honolulu and Cavitc, in the Philippine Islands, a distance of about 4,600 miles, and the evidence of the Post Office radio officers, supported by the logs of signals intercepted by them, denoted that this circuit was operating on a traffic efficiency basis far below that designated by the Imperial Commission as a commercial standard. The' notes also state that Mr Fisk was unable to adequately reply to the opinions expressed by certain noted physicists and wireless' technicians "" that some really effective anti-atmospheric eliminating in vention was still urgently required to remove the most serious limitations to long distance telegraphy. There was no guarantee that a. service would be given after the Commonwealth had handed over £500,000 to the company to experiment and play with. Mr Fisk: could give no details of his estimate of £600,000 as the sus- cost of the station. According to the statement issued by the CommitteeHe could not produce any specifications or plans of the proposed Australian station, because he did not have any in his possession. He was unable to inform the Committee how the sum of £600,000 was made up. Why? Because when the Committee asked for guarantees, and he asked for time to apply to hi9 directors, he had to cable to the Marconi Company in London. Y e the said that Amalgamated Wireless Limited is essentially an Australian company, and that the ownership of Australian patent rights of all the world's leading wireless systems by. an Australian national company is the only successful method of securing uninterrupted development of wireless telegraphy 'in Australia. The company is so much Australian that when Mr Fisk was asked to get information he had to cable to the London directors, who fixed the terms and conditions upon which the contract was to be completed. In pursuance of the endeavours of honourable members opposite to throw dust in the eyes of the public and confuse the issue, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) tried to convey the impression that the only member of the Committee who f u r nished a minority report had done something improper. The House and the 1 people were asked to believe that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) was one of a sub-Committee of three who went exhaustively into the agreement, and that he was equally responsible with the other two members for whatever was done by the sub-Committee. On reading the report of the Committee, I find that the honourable member for Batman was not on the subCommittee which redrafted the agreement. The report statesA sub-Committee, consisting of Senators Millen and Drake-Brockman, was appointed to redraft the agreement for subsequent consideration by the Committee. The honourable member for Batman was not appointed to the sub-Committee u n t i l about the middle of March, because the report statesThe Committee again met on the loth March, 1922. The Amalgamated Company's reply to the Committee's modifications of its draft agreement was received. The honourable member for Batman was on the sub-Committee for only one day, and this is what he and his colleagues were appointed to doA sub-Committee (Senators Millen and Drake-Brockman and Mr Brennan) wns appointed to consider in detail the alterations proposed by the Amalgamated Wireless Company Limited, and also to consider in detail a uew"" agreement submitted by Mr Snoaden. The honourable member for Eawkner tried to lead the country to believe that the honourable member for Batman was responsible for the alterations in the new agreement, which a. sub-Committee consisting of Senators John D . Millen and Drake-Brockman drew up.",40
189,Mr MARR,METEOROLOGICAL,He has to take his share of responsibility.,41
190,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Onl y for the work which was given to the sub-Committee of which he was a member, namely, to consider thealterations jDroposed by the Amalgamated Wireless Company and the scheme submitted by Mr Snoaden, of the Radio Company. The Committee, as a whole, did what the House authorized it to do.",41
191,Mr MARR,METEOROLOGICAL,Then why is the honourable member growling ?,41
192,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The fault of which I complain is that of the Government. The Committee did not appoint the Commonwealth's representatives.on the Board of Directors. The Committee had nothing to do with the selection of the arbitrator who appointed Sir Thomas Hughes as the seventh director. The Committee made several vital alterations for the better safeguarding of the Commonwealth's interests, as honourable members will see if they contrast the original agreement submitted by the Prime Minister with that which was subsequently signed. The latter is about three times as large as the original one, and contains many additional precautions and safeguards. The responsibility of the Committee ceased when they reported to the Government by order of the House; then the responsibility of the Government commenced.",41
193,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,The Government had instructions from the House to carry out the proposals of the Committee.,41
194,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,The Government had no instructions to do what they did. They had an instruction from the House to accept or reject the report of the Committee.,41
195,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,The resolution of the House meant that if the report of the Committee was favourable the Prinie M i nister could proceed with t h a agreement.,41
196,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,The honourable member admitted that he did not know what he was voting upon when the matter was before us last session.,41
197,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,I gave reasons why I voted as I did.,41
198,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member explained that some honourable member opposite told him something, and he voted accordingly without knowing how he was voting.",41
199,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,I did not say that.,41
200,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I realise that the position in which the honourable member finds himself is not nice. In a couple of months the honourable member will have to go before the electors of Tasmania and justify his attitude, and he realizes what a ridiculous figure he will cut when he tells them that he registered a vote without knowing what it was for, that he condemned the Government for their action, and theu voted for them, and that if elected he will do the same thing again.",41
201,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,"If the honourable member's statement were true, perhaps I would be in a difficulty, but he is misrepresenting what I said.",41
202,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,I may be wrong as to the date of the election.,41
203,Mr ATKINSON,METEOROLOGICAL,I had a better opinion of the honourable member's fairness. I did think he had some sense of decency.,41
204,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"No doubt the honourable member feels annoyed at the attitude he finds himself obliged to take up, and he is venting his spleen upon ine.",41
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL, I ask honourable members to cease these personal reflections.,42
206,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I have no desire to reflect on the honourable member personally, but I thought it was permissible under the Standing Orders to point out an honourable member's inconsistency in not making his votes coincide with his words. However, I know that honourable members are seeking by interjections to protect the Government from any criticism. Throughout this debate they have kicked up a considerable amount of dust in regard to the arbitrator and the Committee, but it will be our duty to point, out to the people that the actions of the Committee and the arbitrator are not involved, and that the real issue is the responsibility of the Government to the people. If the Commonwealth is involved in a loss of £500,000 or more it will be due to the incapacity and stupidity, or connivance, of the Government. facts pointed out by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) last night showed clearly that it was immaterial whether or not Sir Thomas Hughes was left on the Board. Why was any question raised as to his appointment ? It was an open secret that the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes was known a month before it was made public.",42
207,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,The arbitrator's report was not then to hand.,42
208,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Nevertheless , the appointment was known. The Prime Minister had unofficial knowledge before he was notified officially. His own statement shows that he made representations to the effect that Sir Thomas Hughes would not be acceptable before he had been officially made aware of the fact of that gentleman's selection by the arbitrator. Will the Minister for - Defence (Mr Greene) say that the fact of Sir Thomas Hughes' selection was not known weeks before Senator John D. Millen sought certain information in another place?",42
209,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Yes , I will say so.",42
210,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,The Minister must he driven to considerable lengtBs to talk in that strain.,42
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,I merely happen to know the facts.,42
212,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,Will the Minister tell me what was the date of the appointment? [27],42
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I cannot give the actual date of the arbitrator's decision, but I can say that it was long after Parliament met.",42
214,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I have not said that the appointment was made before Parliament met. I said that, before the appointment was made public, the Governmeut knew of the arbitrator's choice.",42
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Oh , no! Mr f AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Before this matter came before Parliament, was any protest made by the Government against 1 the selection of Sir Thomas Hughes?",42
216,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,The Prime Minister said so.,42
217,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"As I said on Friday, there were three stages. There was the stage before the directors had met; then there was the stage after they had met, when the arbitration of Mr Stephen waa proceeding; aud then there was the stage The when the official notification was given to the Government.",42
218,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Anyhow , there is not any difference between the Government and the company, so far as their nominees were concerned.",42
219,Mr SCULLIN,METEOROLOGICAL,"B y whom was Sir Thomas Hughes nominated, by the representatives of the Commonwealth or by those of the company?",42
220,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,The honourable member ought to be able to answer that for himself.,42
221,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Honourable members may ask-no t that it will matter, however-wh o was the other nominee. I do not know that there was any other; but it is unfortunate for the company that, owing to their lack of perspicacity, they insisted upon Sir Thomas Hughes being selected to occupy the position of seventh director when it is now obvious that Amalgamated Wireless would have been quite safe in any case. Their interests would have heen conserved even had not Sir Thomas Hughes been chosen by the arbitrator. The Government are now endeavouring, under cover of the fuss aroused by the appointment, to divert attention from the fact that Amalgamated Wireless would have been in complete control no matter whether Sir Thomas Hughes or some other nominee had been selected.",42
222,Mr BRENNAN,METEOROLOGICAL,Perhaps the honourable member would ask the Minister for Defence whether any other person was put forward ?,43
223,Mr MOWIXLIAMS,METEOROLOGICAL,"Perhaps if honourable members knew who the other candidate was, they might be glad that Sir Thomas Hughes received the favour of Mr Consett Stephen.",43
224,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not care who was the other man-if there was another. Whoever he was, Amalgamated Wireless would have seen to it that he suited Amalgamated Wireless. The Government, and those who support the Government, are looking after the interests of "" big business."" As the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) pointed out last night, this company is only an offshoot of one of the biggest international plunder gangs' in existence. The old International Munitions Combine was a plaything compared with it. ThisMarconi combination, with its international ramifications, is an altogether sinister thing by comparison. It is not to be wondered at that it has such power in Australia, seeing that it has been able to control events even at the heart of the Empire, and actually at the international gathering recently held at Genoa. The Marconi interests have constituted the power behind that great Italian financial house, the lianca Italians di Sconto.",43
225,Mr MARR,METEOROLOGICAL,"It sounds like "" steakada-oyst.""",43
226,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Yes ; the Marconi people swallowed the oyster in other parts of the world, and the same gang's deputies are now bolting both oyster and shell here, in far-away Australia. This Bavicas Italiama di Sconto-know n as the Marconi Bank for the reason that Senator Marconi himself was at its head-recently failed because it had invested enormous funds in the greatest metallurgical and shipbuilding concern in Italy, namely, Gio Ansaldo and Company, of Genoa. And it was because of the failure of that firm that its Marconi interests, bringing to bear the power and weight of their British affiliations, secured the holding of the International Conference at Genoa. The honourable member for Bourke referred to the Marconi influence in the Lloyd George Cabinet. It was Mr Lloyd George, friend of Godfrey Isaacs, managing director of the Marconi Wireless Company, who proposed the holding of the Conference at Genoa. The same identities control the Australian wireless business as those who controlled the calling together of the International gathering in Italy. They are those same individuals who raided 'and robbed the British public during the war. They are the same as those who formed the British Cellulose Company-betterr known as the ""Dope Corporation."" This is how they saved the Empire: They secured a Government contract for cellulose, which is used in the treatment of aeroplane wings. They floated a company, and put down 6d. per share.. Under the stimulation of Government patronage they boomed those 6d. shares to £14 10s. each, and cleared up £2,300,000.  tion to honourable members to be given that information now.",43
227,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"It is said that experience teaches, and that fools will not learn in any other school.  "" put wise "" when the shares were still going for 6d. each.",43
228,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The fact is that it does not matter how much the Marconi people may get out of wireless in Australia, or through any of their kindred shows. So long as the Prime Minister says "" It is right,"" his colleague in the Ministry, the honourable member for Grey  it is right."" This discussion, if it does not do anything else, should impress on the country the fact that it does not matter what political crimes may be committed, what smellful contracts may be entered into, or how the name of democracy and the term "" constitutional government"" may be uttered to tickle the ears of the multitude; the Government will continue to do the business of the big interests. In the course of a few months an election campaign will be launched, and the Government will be telling the people about the horrors of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They will be painting woeful pictures of conditions* existing in those countries where the working class have established a real working-class government. And all the while they will be slavishly following the d ctates of organized business in this ; country. The Government always have the' numbers when big business talks. When the whips are cracked, those behind the Government fall in solidly and stick closely together. They are warned that if they do not, their campaign funds will dry up. Mr DEPUTY .SPEAKER (Hon. J. Iff. Chanter) - Order !",43
229,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"They realise that they must support the Government because "" big business "" has demanded right of way. May I be permitted to cite as an example the case of the late representative of Flinders-lane, the present Treasurer (Mr Bruce). One cannot help feeling amused at the Treasurer's violent indignation that Amalgamated Wireless should have attempted to foist upon the Commonwealth a gentleman who was so recently connected with the company itself. I wonder how that argument would apply personally to the Treasurer. His dissociation from certain big business interests occurred only a little while ago. If the argument is to hold in respect of the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes in connection with a Commonwealth interest in which a matter of only £500,000 is involved, it should be applicable also, but with vastly added force, to the appointment of the Treasurer.",44
230,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,Did the honourable member resign from his union when he entered this House?,44
231,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"No, I am still paying-no t receiving. I do not ask that the Treasurer should sever his connection with the Employers' Union. That, of course, would be unreasonable.",44
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,Order ! The honourable member is going outside the scope of the amendment.,44
233,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"No, sir; I am pointing outreasonswhy the amendment should be agreed to. I am commenting on the Treasurer's criticism of Sir Thomas Hughes for having accepted this appointment, in view of his recent connection with the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. If that was a good argument to employ against the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, it should apply with equal force to the appointment of the honourable member for Flinders to the office of Treasurer in the Government which made this agreement.",44
234,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,METEOROLOGICAL,That is a very far-fetched argument.,44
235,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,I anticipated that the honourable member would have much difficulty in following it.,44
236,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,METEOROLOGICAL,Jus t as great a difficulty as I have in regarding the honourable member for Barrier as a wage slave.,44
237,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I may be a wage slave, but I have a free mentality. Unlike the honourable gentleman, I am not a wage slave with a "" bosses'"" mentality. The position is that the Ministry have the numbers; they know that they will have the support of a sufficient number of members of the Country party to insure"" them a majority. That being so, the Prime Minister can afford to treat the House and the country with the greatest disdain. He does not worry; he has no reason to do so. He knows that all the big business interests, the press, and also, with very few exceptions, the politicians on his side of the House, will stand behind him when an appeal to the country comes. He knows, too, that the people who have put up with all the outrages on public decency that have been committed by his Ministry will continue to vote for him, irrespective of any criticism that' may be levelled from this side of the House. The Government rely on the power of the purse and the press, together with their own scandalous misrepresentation, of facts,'to return them once more.",44
238,Mr FRANCIS,METEOROLOGICAL,"Henty) [5.53] - I have to confess to a feeling of considerable disappointment with the agreement that has been entered into. I voted last December for a reference of the draft agreement to a Parliamentary Committee, with the f u ll knowledge that all parties in this House would be represented on that Committee; that it would have full power to make a thorough investigation of the facts, and that if it reported that the agreement was unsatisfactory, from the point of view of the Commonwealth, the Government, in accordance with the direction of the House, would have to abide by that decision. I am not going to say that the agreement, as referred to the Committee, was a bad one. As amended by the Committee it is certainly more in the interests of the people; but, while that is so, and notwithstanding that the Committee, with the exception of the honourable member for Batman, approved of the scheme as amended, it seems to me that facts which have since been brought to light make it a very "" fishy "" one. I accept the statement of the Prime Minister in regard to the appointment of . Sir Thomas Hughes as the seventh director, hut I think it is fortunate that, as the result of the action taken by the honourable member for Batman, the whole matter has been f cussed in this House. An y proposal to expend public money, whether the sum involved is £500,000, as in this instance, or far less, should be carefully considered by the Parliament. layman, I see nothing in the agreement to prevent the Government taking the action demanded of them in regard to the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes. The statement made by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) as to the appointment of Mr Allard as a director was not only sensational, but revealed a most unsatisfactory position of affairs. I cannot believe that the Government, had it been seized of the facts, would have consented to Mr Allard's appointment to the Board. We are going to give the Government the benefit of the doubt so far as Mr Allard's appointment is concerned; but the information which has been afforded the House as a result of this debate goes to show how necessary it is that the fullest inquiries should be made by the Government before, making any such appointment. I am inclined to think that the Government did not know that Mr . Allard had been associated with the Wireless Company, and was not aware that he was in partnership with a gentleman who had been selected to represent private shareholders on the Board. I believe that they were guided"" by Mr Fisk in the appointments they made. No doubt they sought expert advice, and asked Mr . Fisk and others associated with wireless telegraphy for information for their guidance. In all probability Mr Fisk told them that Mr Allar d knew a good deal about wireless, but was in no way associated with the company. If such a statement were made to them they would feel justified in appointing Mr Allard a director. Later on, however, the Government discovered that he was in partnership with another gentleman, holding, in his own name, some 10,000 or 11,000 shares, who was also a member of the Board. Mr Francis. 1 Address-in-Reply.",44
239,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,He is not in partnership with the gentleman referred to.,45
240,Mr FRANCIS,METEOROLOGICAL,I am simply taking the statement made by the honourable member for Bourke.,45
241,Mr GABB,METEOROLOGICAL,The honourable member must have an opinion of his own. He ought not to do everything that the Gou l l y disvernment tell him to do.,45
242,Mr FRANCIS,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not. The honourable member has to do what he is told by his party to d o ; but I do not belong to any party machine, and, as a matter As a of fact, have voted more frequently against the Government than he has voted against the party which secured his return to this House. Unlike the honourable member. I represent not a section, but the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. Paragraph i i i . of clause 3 of the agreement provides thatso long as the Commonwealth or its nominees continue to hold a majority in number and value of the shares there shall be seven directors of the company, of whom three shall be nominated by arid represent the Commonwealth and three shall be elected by and represent the holders of shares other than those allotted to the Commonwealth under this agreementEach party to the agreement is to be represented by three directors. That is the all-important pointnnd the seventh director shall be selected by a majority vote of the other six directors, and if the voting is equal shall be selected by arbitration in the manner provided by clause 20 of this agreement in respect of matters in dispute between the Commonwealth and the company, and shall hold office for a period of three years, subject to removal at any time during the period by the unanimous vote of the other directors. ' The Board of Directors so constituted shall appoint its own chairman. There the intention of both parties that each should have three representatives on the Board, and that the seventh member should be an independent man, is clearly shown. In clause 20 we have the further provision thatIn the' event of any disagreement between the Commonwealth and the company as to the meaning of any clause hereof or toushing any matter arising out of the same or connected as therewith, the matter in dispute shall be referred to one arbitrator mutually selected, or failing mutual selection, shall be determined by arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1915 of the State of Victoria or any amendment thereof for the time being in force. An y matter arising out of this agreement has, in tihe circumstances named, to be referred to the arbitrator. I hold the view that the arbitrator, in selecting Sir Thomas Hughes, did not act in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The agreement clearly implies that the seventh director shall be an independent man. In the Earl of Halsbury's LOADS of England, one' of the greatest authorities on questions of this kind, it is set out very distinctly thatWhere there exists a real common intention between the parties to a transaction, but mistake occurs in the expression of that intention, the Court may correct the mistake in order to give effect to the real intention. To justify the Court in so doing, it must appear that there has been a mistake common to both the contracting parties, and that the agreement purports to have been expressed in a deed or instrument in a manner contrary to the intention of both. In this case we have a mistake common to both parties. The Government and Amalgamated Wireless have both signed the agreement that there shall be three directors from each side, and any Court would hold that the appointment of a seventh director was to be arrived at by mutual consent. The arbitrator has not carried out the desire which is so expressed in the agreement. I venture to say that I am not far wrong in this view. Where two lawyers are fighting on behalf of clients they each tell their clients that they have every chance of winning, but one must lose, and it is the Judge who decides the winner. I claim that the Government has a very clear line of action to pursue. Lord Halsbury's opinion continues The relie'f given may be either by way of rectification or rescission as the case may require, for in such cases the difference is only one of degree, A deed poll may also be rectified on proof that it is not in accordance with the intention of the person who executed it. Equity will also interfere where by mutual mistake a document has been signed which operates in law contrary to the express intention and agreement of both parties. There is no distinction in principle between a mistake aB to the legal effect of the words used, and a mistake in the words themselves, and, therefore, if a solicitor in drawing a dead, through error, either inserts or omits terms contrary to the intention of the parties, or uses words capable of a meaning different from that which the parties intended, relief will bo granted. So it appears that equity would also relieve if a solicitor innocently misled parties as to the legal effect of a document, and they were induced to sign it under a misapprehension of its meaning. The principle upon which the Court acts in correcting deeds or instruments is that the parties are to be placed in the same position as that in which they would have stood if the error to be corrected had not been committed. Thus in a proper case the Court will rectify a deed of settlement, an appointment, a lease, a bond, a bill of exchange, a schedule of quantities annexed to a contract to execute works for a gross sum purporting to show how the gross sum is made up, a policy of insurance, and a declaration of shipment under a policy of marine insurance, even after a loss had become known. Thus the Court will rectify any appointment made contrary to the spirit of an agreement. There are hundreds of cases in support of this decision, dating as far back as 1838. Lord Halsbury's opinion, which would be accepted in any Court of law, indicates the road this Government can take. I believe that Ministers are in favour of settling the matter in a fair and equitable way. A great deal has been said about the capabilities of Sir Thomas Hughes. If that gentleman stands on the pinnacle of fame he is said by some to occupy, if he is a publicspirited man who has the interests of the Commonwealth at heart, I cannot understand why he has not resigned before this. The agreement in question is about as loose a document as any one could d r a f t . I should think that in a matter involving the expenditure of £500,000 it would have been made, if not exactly watertight, at least something which would not leave loop-holes for a company whose earlier litigation against the Commonwealth, according to some honourable members, has been surrounded by incidents not altogether palatable. Senator John D . Millen, who was a member of the Wireless Committee, is a man who thoroughly understands wireless, and his advice was accepted by other members of the Committee. He signed the agreement thinking that it was a good one, so far as such documents went, but yesterday, in another place, he said that the agreement should be torn up. He said that the correspondence that passed between the Government and Amalgamated Wireless Limited prior to the drawing up of the agreement amounted to an almost distinct understanding that the chairman of the proposed Board of Directprs should be an independent man. He also said that the appointment of Mr Allard and other matters had utterly destroyed the value of the agreement from the Commonwealth point of view. I have read through this agreement, and I can see nothing in it as to what happens should one of the Commonwealth directors die or be laid aside by illness. Has the Conunonwealth power to appoint a deputy director?",45
243,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,I presume that in the case of a director dying under the ordiImmigrants nary company law the remaining directors would appoint some one in his place.,47
244,Mr FRANCIS,METEOROLOGICAL,"Wit h all due deferment ence to the Minister for Defence we have been presuming too much. I should like to have an assurance that no money will spent in connection with this agreement until the House has the opportunity of considering, irrespective of party lines, the subsequent agreement and seeing that it is in conformity with the spirit of the document referred by this Parlianumbers ment to the Wireless Committee. think it can be shown that no provision has been made to meet the emergency of the death or absence through illness of a director. If one of the representaproblem tives of the Commonwealth on the Board should be absent from any cause, can the Commonwealth appoint a deputy so that its two other representatives may not be out-voted? I am afraid thare is law to cover the case of a director, who, through ill-health, is absent from meeting at which the Board of Directors may decide by a majority vote to spend another £500,000. I shall not accept this agreement as it stands, or the pointment of the chairman, unless the agreement is so amended that it will the interests of the whole community.",47
245,Mr GABB,METEOROLOGICAL,Then the honourable memof ber should give his vote to bring the agreement back to the House.,47
246,Mr FRANCIS,METEOROLOGICAL,"I shall vote to make the agreement an effective one. There is no doubt we are becoming too extravagant in our expenditure, and we should take violated. every possible opportunity to reduce it in order to lighten the burden on munity. It may be said by certain honourable members that this cry for economy is purely Victorian, but a similar cry is heard in every part of the world today, and I am doubtful whether the Commonwealth Parliament has done its duty in this regard. We find deputations to a Minister from one section of people for a post-office, or some other public utility, and the application opposed by some other section, though probably the latter the following week may prefer a request for further expenditure in own interests. Australia compares favourably with other countries; but we are a mere handful of people, and in order to insure progress and prosperity we must somehow or other increase production. mean life or death to a community like our own, and the subject deserves all the consideration that Parliacan give to it. We may, however, have immigration run mad, and it first behoves us to see that all our own people be who desire to go on the land are accommodated. It has been stated by responsible Ministers that every block of available land could be occupied by the people of this country, aud, that being so, it would be worse than futile to bring large of people from overseas to hang I around our cities. On this point, I can only say that in my own constituency there is too much unemployment, and this ought certainly to be solved before we ,add to the number of idle hands. I must again protest against this wireless agreement, but I am prepared at this juncture to accept the assurance of the no Government that the appointment of the seventh director will not be sanctioned. JI Before any more money is spent under the agreement, the whole matter ought to be discussed and decided by Parliament. Wireless is essential in peace as much apas in war; but we cannot hand over to a private firm millions of money unless meet we have some control over the expenditure. It is true that there is the power veto, but it is also true that'there was a thorough understanding between the parties that there should be only three representatives for each side on the directorate, and that understanding has been The legal opinion I have already quoted leaves a clear line of the comaction open to the Government.",47
247,Unknown,METEOROLOGICAL,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m.,47
248,Mr FRANCIS,METEOROLOGICAL,"There is one point in connection with the directorate which I should like to emphasize, and that is that the agreement makes no provision for the course to be followed if a director is unable to attend a meeting owing to illthe ness. The Company Law does allow an absent shareholder to vote at a meeting by proxy, but no such provision is made for an absent director. It seems to me that it is necessary to insert in the articles its of the company some such provision, otherwise, owing to the illness of a director, the Commonwealth representatives might he out-voted on a matter involving a large sum of money. I notice also that there is no provision in the agreement for a quorum, and that is another omission which helps me to the conclusion that the agreement is as loosely drawn as it could be. I suggest that those who prepare the articles of the company should make them more complete than this agreement has been made, and that no matter what number is fixed as a quorum, it must include the three representatives of the Commonwealth. An .honourable member suggests by interjection that I want the earth; I certainly want all I can get for the people, and I shall not vote for any further agreement that does not provide' that the quorum shall include ful l representation of the Commonwealth. I have given the House the benefit of my legal knowledge. One honourable member suggests that a little knowledge is dangerous, but lawyers inside and outside the House endejivour to convince rival parties that they can win if they go to law. Obviously both cannot win, and some of our most eminent lawyer's find their opinions declared wrong by the Court. This wire-' less project, involving such a large sum of public money, is of vital importance to the community, and I think the time has arrived when the Government should get out of all trading concerns and throw the responsibility of trading on the shoulders of private people.",47
249,Mr WIENHOLT,METEOROLOGICAL,"Moreton) [S.6] The debate on this amendment has been most extraordinary; like the Biblical cloud, at first no bigger than a man's hand, it has overcast the whole political situation. One of the most useless as well as the most . aggravating things that can be said to any one is "" I told you so."" It is not a very sporting attitude to take up, but I am bound to say, in order to make my position plain, that what I said when the original agreement was before us I say now- I am uncompromisingly against the whole project. The debate has been peculiarly interesting and extraordinary for two reasons: Firstly, we heard the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley), a little earlier in the session, make a very interesting speech on the subject of arbitration. Personally, I think the case he made out for the non-acceptance or breach of an arbitration award was wrong, but the extraordinary feature of this debate is that from the Prime Minister downward, honourable members, on both sides, have as a matter of course accepted and advocated a distinct breach of arbitration. The Attorney-General (Mr Groom) yesterday announced to the House the very successful result of arbitration in regard to the claim made by a shipbuilding firm against the Commonwealth. I congratulate the Minister on that result. But are we, after accepting with delight yesterday the fruits of one arbitration, to deliberately advocate a breach of arbitration in regard to another matter? The second extraordinary feature has been the marked readiness for repudiation shown by honourable members on both sides. From the Prime Minister - downward, thei'e has been the 1 most simple and straightforward advocacy of repudiation in its lhost direct form unless the Commonwealth can get its own way. Most honourable members, in excusing their vote of last session for the reference of the agreement to the Committee, wish to treat the agreement, signed on behalf of the Commonwealth by "" W. M. Hughes,"" as nothing more or less than a scrap of paper. That is a most inconsistent attitude. I do not believe in repudiation in regard to leaseholds nor in anything else. When the Prime Minister submitted to the House the original agreement, which is admitted by everybody to be most unsuitable and, in fact, impossible, he concluded his speech with these words: : ' I ask honourable members to take their courage in both hands and to' have a little faith in the future of this country."" There is a saying that persons of a certain class will rush in where angels fear to tread. Far be it from me to apply-that saying to the Prime Minister; I have too high an opinion of his talents and ability. But I think I am entitled to say, and I hope the Leader of the House will take note of this, that because one is not willing to agree hurriedly to the expenditure of large sums of money for this or any other project, because one is not willing to risk the public funds recklessly, either in a spirit of enthusiasm or in any other circumstances, it does not follow that one is less a believer in his country. I hope that when the Minister for Defence (Mr. Greene) next accuses members of the Country party of not having that confidence in the country which, he thinks we should have because we do not accept rashly unwise propositions, some little mental or wireless thought will come to remind him of the attitude which some of us took up when this project came before us last session. I have no wish to make party capitalout of the subject. The Government have got into a deep hole, and I wish them to get out of it as quickly as possible. I , personally, was opposed to the scheme at first, as I am now, and I would do anything to get the Commonwealth out of it in an honourable way, but as that does not seem practicable it seems to me that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman offers the best alternative. It proposes that the Goveniment shall instruct the Commonwealth representatives on the directorate not to make any fresh agreement that may be proposed in the course of the transactions of the company without submitting it to the House.. ",48
250,Mr WIENHOLT,METEOROLOGICAL,I see no repudiation in that.  agreement.,49
251,Mr WIENHOLT,METEOROLOGICAL,"I can discern no breach of agreement. The amendment says in effect that we, representing half the shareholders in the company, instruct our representatives that they shall not approve of any agreement u n t il we have held a general meeting to consider it . Such a procedure is provided for in the agreement. The agreement does not enable us to do as I desire to do, cancel the whole agreement, but as far as we can modify it honourably, I believe the course suggested by the honourable member for Batman is right, and I shall certainly support it .",49
252,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,Is not that amendment moved with the object of rendering the agreement null and void ?,49
253,Mr WIENHOLT,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not think it would necesarily do so; and I personally am not supporting it in that spirit. It has been said that the amendment is tantamount to a. motion of want of confidence, or that it will be so treated by the Government. The honourable member for Batman, when he moved the amendment, distinctly said that he was not moving it as a motion of want of confidence. The amendment saysbut we desire to advise His Excellency that the agreement mentioned in clause 12 of the contract made between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth should, before acceptance by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors, be agreed to by this House. I can see no words there which may be interpreted to represent a motion of want of confidence. The Government may treat it as such, if they like, but, if they do, that is their own. funeral.",49
254,Mr LAMBERT,METEOROLOGICAL,"West Sydney) [8.16]. - The subject under debate has been almost talked to a frazzle; and, in offering a little further criticism, I feel that I may only be reiterating what has been already said. At the same time, I desire to make a few observations. This wireless business. represents one of the greatest mistakes, and will stand on record eventually as one of the gravest scandals in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. In the first place, the Commonwealth Government have made a present of £500,000 to a company of a very doubtful character. The whole of the associations of this dubious company are wrapped in mystery. We are in formed that it is well known as "" Amalgamated Wireless."" A f t e r being told that it. is purely an Australian concern, aud that its personnel and its shareholders generally are honest and reliable persons in whom the Government can place f a it h , we find that it is merely an off-shoot of a big international concern. We learn that it is nothing like what it was represented to be when the Government were inveigled into accepting a lopsided agreement. The Government have the larger portion of the capital vested in the company, and there was to have been provision for Government control on the directorate, but the Government nominees on the Board are persons associated with the promoters of the old' company, which was dissolved, but which really re-formed itself. These Government nominees are not in a position to give an impartial deal in behalf of the people of Australia. It is astonishing that Sir Thomas Hughes, above all others, should have received the appointment to the position of seventh director, which, I understand, carries with it the chairmanship of directors. I wish to know when the board of directors met, and whom the Government representatives and the company's representatives nominated for the consideration of the arbitrator. That information should have been supplied to the House in an open way immediately upon the announcement, of the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes. The Government should cancel the agreement. Even if I were not against the principle of the private and the semi-private control of means cf public communication, I would still say that the agreement is so rotten that it blioulcl be cancelled without hesitation. I am all the more emphatically of opinion that it should be cancelled, seeing that I am altogether opposed to the principle of allowing private interests to even participate in the control of means of communication either in Australia or between Australia and other countries. Government made a present of £500,000 to what is practically a foreign company, principally financed, as it is from overseas, and, to a large extent, from countries which were recently considered to be enemy countries. One thing of which I am proud is that no member of the Labour party can be held blameworthy for the present position. No responsibility rests ivpon the shoulders of the Opposition. When this matter was first raised in the House it was not, and was not treated as, a party one. I regard honourable members in the Corner as the most conservative end of the Nationalist party. There are, in fact, only two parties in this House. One is the Labour party, and the other is the anti-Labour party. So much for my opinion of the stand taken by the so-called Country party. One hears various legal luminaries, strewn so profusely about the benches of the House, asking what are the Government going to do about the agreement. Bad as the Government are, I do not believe that they expected to find themselves absolutely helpless upon the directorate. But the company was ""too many"" for them. The company comprises a shrewd gang of speculators, operating throughout the world. When these people can get hold of a Government so remiss as to furnish a good opportunity for the "" raking off "" of easy profits, they naturally go "" all they know"" for their objective. There is only one way out of the business; that is for the Government to revoke the agreement. Before I would allow £500,000 of the people's money to get into the hands of the company, and before I would, concede the loss of control upon the directorate, I would revoke the whole business and take all responsibility. That is my advice to the Government. And then I would suggest that they should take up the matter of wireless communication afresh. If they can find £500,000, they ought to be able to find £1,000,000 with which to make a Government monopoly of wireless communication. As the methods of radio-telegraphy become perfected, the system should prove to be one of the greatest paying propositions in the world. I believe that what induced the Government to enter into negotiations was their belief in the encouragement of private enterprise. At all costs, they The must have, private enterprise dabbling in Government services. It is hard to find words severe enough to condemn them. Wireless is in the experimental stage. From what I can gather from world publications on this subject there is no record of messages having been transmitted direct over a. distance of 12,000 miies. There must be intermediate stations from 2,000 to 3,000 miles apart. In the circumstances, therefore, this must be a risky experiment. If the agreement is proceeded with the result from a . party point of view will be excellent, so far as the Labour party is concerned. That is one reason why I think it probable that some members of the Country party will vote against it . I should not like to be a member of the party or the Government responsible for giving effect to such an agreement. With the exception of the Labour party and the party in the far left hand corner, known now as the "" Pussy party ""-which , by the way, is not present to-night-ever y one in the House is responsible for what I would describe as this outrage on the rights of the people and the public funds of the Commonweal th.",49
255,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,"Dension) [8.32]. - As a member of the Cabinet when the draft agreement was laid on the table of the House, and as one who later on, as a member of the House, voted for its submission to a Parliamentary Committee, I am prepared to take my full share of responsibility for it. I voted for the reference of the draft agreement to the Parliamentary Committee knowing that uuder the terms of the resolution that Committee would have power to alter it andi to make recommendations, and that if it approved of the scheme the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) would be able to give effect to it. The Committee held a number of sittings, and from the limited notes that have been put before us of the evidence it took I am satisfied that it did excellent work. I regret that a verbatim report of the evidence given before the Committee was not taken and published. We should then have been able to refer to a printed report of the evidence just as we may refer today to the reports of the debates which took place in the House of Commons, and the controversy between experts in connection with the laying down of the Atlantic cable. The objections taken to that scheme were precisely the same as those which are levelled today at this agreement. It was said that the Atlantic cable would not work effectively, and that it was farcical to attempt such an experiment. If a full statement of the evidence given before the Parliamentary Committee were available to us we should probably find that the views of the experts, who were examined, were different altogether from those which some of the lay members of the House are inclined to attribute to them. Notes of the evidence have been prepared for us by Senator John D. Millen, a very able member of the Committee, but I should have preferred a detailed report. I take my full share of the responsibility for the agreement as first submitted to the House, and as amended by the Committee, for the reason that we were given every opportunity to peruse the proposed agreement and to protest against it. If we were opposed to it we had every opportunity last December to voice our objections to it. I gave very careful consideration to the scheme, not only because of the occupation that I followed before I entered this House, but also because of my experience in the Old Country in 1911, which clearly demonstrated to me the absolute necessity for improving our means of communication with the old world in order that the people there might know more about Australia. my opinion the adoption of the wireless system will mean an enormous improvement in the dissemination of news of Australia in the Old Country. A careful examination of the agreement satisfied me that under it the Commonwealth would not give away anything. Commonwealth Government agreed to put into the undertaking one pound more than did the private shareholders, and it did so for the same reason that influenced Mr Laird Smith Disraeli to secure for the United Kingdom a majority interest in the Suez Canal. The object of the Government was to secure a controlling interest in the company. The ordinary shareholders, on the other hand, were prepared to take the risk of putting their money into the project.  holders, ' perhaps, were induced to put their money into the enterprise because the Government were foolish enough to do so.",50
256,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not regard every man, whether he has money or not, as being dishonourable. I have found the majority of the men inall walks of life with whom I have had dealings to be straight and above board. I fail to see why honourable members on this side of the House should be subjected to such bitter criticism by honourable members of the Opposition, while they remain members of their respective unions and still occupy a seat in this House advocating certain privileges to unionists. I do not say honourable members opposite should withdraw from their unions when they enter Parliament, but I do say they should be logical and fair in their criticism. The finding of the Committee and the criticism to. which the Government have been subjected demonstrate how unpleasant it would be for any member of the House who took part in any shady transaction, or joined with others in an enterprise that was not clear and above board. I am pleased to observe that the share-list in this company does not contain the name of a member of this Parliament.",51

Who will say that this long-distance wireless scheme is not likely to be a success ? I do not think any honourable member will say that if the necessary high power stations are erected here the scheme The will not prove effective. I propose to state briefly to the House what has been my experience. I am sure honourable members will pardon me for appearing somewhat personal. I have sat in a telegraph office when twenty sounders have been working, and have had no difficulty in reading the messages coming in. on a particular instrument. the layman the sounders appear to produce a mere jumble of sounds, but to the expert operator every one of them makes a distinctly different sound. The operators are able not only to read the messages as they are received by these twenty sounders, but to type them, notwithstanding the noise made by the typewriters. My experience convinces me that the atmospheric electricity of which we hear so much will not prove an insurmoimtable difficulty in the way of direct wireless communication, with the Old Country. Tho atmospherics to which reference is so often made consist of lightning storms of high potential current which give out a different wave, and hence produce a different sound on the receiver from that of the current sent out by wireless. have many million volts of pressure in excess of those of the machine that produces the current used in wireless. have listened to messages being received in a little station which we had in the Navy Office as well as at the station in the Domain. It is open to any honourable member to go tomorrow to the Wireless Station in the Domain and there to hear a station in France calling New York. One can hear long-distance messages, and simultaneously the sounds caused by atmospherics. The noise occasioned by atmospherics may be described as a scratching one, while the sound sent out by a machine consists of * the uniform dot and dash. An expert operator is able to disregard altogether the sounds made by atmospherics. The reason why no expert in this country will give sworn evidence before a Committee that direct wireless telegraphy over a distance of 12,000 miles is possible is that there are no facilities' here for working over such a distance. All the high-power stations are on the other side of the world, but our small stations in 1 Australia are constantly picking up messages sent out from them. They take them without difficulty because a very high potential or high-pressure wave is sent out, and goes on expanding and expanding u n t i l it eventually reaches this country. If we had a very high-power station here-on e tuned in unison with a high-power station in the Old CountryI have no doubt that we should be able to send messages direct just as we pick To up such messages from the other side of the world today. In the early stages of wirelefb, I worked under an engineer who was experimenting with the system. In those days, we had the old coherer, which was thought to represent the last thing in wireless. It was composed of a fewsteel filings so placed in a glass tube that when a current was sent out the steel filings were caused to take up a certain position. The tapper separated the filings, and the operator thus got the dot and dash sound. All that has been changed, and, as> the result of the invention of the valve system, our receiving stations will receive messages sent over very long distances such as those to which I have referred. Honourable members no doubt read recently of the wreck of the sailing shipFrance. The message of distress They that she sent out was picked up ab Pennant Hill station, notwithstanding tha\ the vessel must have had on board a very I low-pressure current machine. He would be a bold man. who would say that this, schema will not be effective.",51
259,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,All the witnesses before the Parliamentary Committee said that it would not be effective.,52
260,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,That opinion is based on the limited experience we have of the working of the system here. We have not in Australia a high-power station tuned in unison with high-power stations in other parts of the world.,52
261,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,"The Committee was told by Mr Fisk that the possibility of sending a message direct over a distance of 12,000 miles had not been demonstrated-that it was all a matter of experiment.",52
262,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,No ; he said it could be done.,52
263,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,"The ex-Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) has referred to this' question, and I have the same expert knowledge that he has. Messages sent out from high-power Telefunken stations in Germany during the war were repeatedly picked up by our station in Western Australia for the reason that we had installed there the Telefunken system, the only station we have in Australia which is in unison with the high-power stations on the other side of the world, but still not powerful enough to permit messages to be despatched. Now let us see the high minimum the Committee have fixed, twenty words per minute. Is there a siibmarine cable doing twenty words per minute? I venture to say that no long submarine cable is doing more than fourteen words per minute. submarine cable apparatus was first installed, the operator worked in a dark room, and a shadow passed over a board backwards and forwards, a long shadow for the dash and a short shadow for the dot. That system was followed for a considerable time, and even now messages have to be transmitted slowly because a high voltage cannot be sent through the cable. Otherwise the cable would act as a condenser and set up au opposition current. An even worse feature would be the leakage caused by a high voltage. In these circumstances the pressure employed on the Atlantic cable is exceedingly low. One would imagine from the remarks of honourable members that cables never get out of order, and work smoothly twenty-four hours each day. I have known of cables to be out of working order for hours. Take the line between Melbourne and Hobart, which is partly cable - across Bass Straits. There may be fine weather between Melbourne and Flinders, but the weather in Tasmania may be moist, with a big leakage causing the greatest difficulty to the operators in the adjustment of the instruments. The cable is by no means a perfect system. When the telephone was first invented it was simply a machine that would enable a person to communicate between one end and the other of a building. That was because a sufficiently high pressure of current could not be secured to give the high-power waves which convey the vibrations that impinge on the receiver. That difficulty was overcome by the invention of the induction coil, a purely mechanical device by means of which a low-pressure current is passed through coils of thick wire, which induces a. current in many turns of thin wire. This thin wire is connected with the telephone line. person who speaks on the transmitter of a telephone causes little carbons inside the transmitter to vibrate, making the make and break. These waves pass along the line and impinge on the receiver at the other end, which works in unison with Mr Laird Smith. the transmitter. I give this illustration to show that an improved wireless receiver may be invented when the long-distance stations are erected. Is it claimed that with wireless messages being sent around the ""When globe nightly, from the sea and elsewhere, wireless telegraphy is still in its experimental stage ? Is there any man courageous enough to say that, as the long-distance system is still in its experimental stage, the Government should not take the risk? We want to establish this means of communication. It will be most valuable to us, particularly if the estimated cost of messages be correct. Even if the Commonwealth is called upon to put up a big sum of money, the return to the people of this Commonwealth through speedy communication with the other side of the world, and the speedy means of learning the variation in market prices, will be worth millions of pounds. I have gone carefully into the agreement as a layman, and I am prepared to accept the statements of the honourable members for Fawkner (Mr Max-well) and Corangamite (Mr Gibson), who were members of the Committee, that the company will not get £500,000 until the scheme is practically a going concern. To hear honourable members opposite, one would imagine that the Government would hand money over to the company straight away. It is not proposed to do so. The company's money will be in the concern just as much as the Commonwealth's will be. Members of the Committee have told us that the .Commonwealth Government are safeguarded. I am of opinion that they are. The ready manner in which the Government were prepared to right the complaint in regard to the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes is sufficient for me. As soon as they heard that the appointment had been made a Minister rose in his place and said he did not agree with it.",52
264,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,"After the matter had been brought up in the House. Mr LAI RD SMITH - If the Leader A of the Opposition has Ministerial responsibility some day, he will find that he will not have time to read every sentence of every agreement. Only those who have been behind the scenes know the work that Ministers are called upon to perform, and one can hardly hold a Minister personally responsible, particularly in a case such as this, when we hear one say that the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes came to him as a shock, that Cabinet had no knowledge of it, and immediately it learned of it set about rectifying the trouble. Who brought the knowledge of it under the notice of Cabinet? It was a member of the National party, a gentleman sitting in another place. His action showed that the party has nothing to hide. We, as a party, have nothing to fear. I do not mind standing before my electors and telling them the facts of this case. I will tell them that the wireless system established by the party behind which I sat for so long was a huge failure, and that I do not feel inclined to allow the Government to take it on again. We put np stations all round Australia which are useless because they are established in places where there is no need for them. The system was certainly valuable for short distances, hut is not equal to the demand today. Even honourable members opposite have admitted that the companies concerned in this agreement possess all the patent rights. They will also, admit that we cannot put up a plant which is patented by the companies. I would not he a party to any proposal to utilize other people's patent rights. Inventors are ofttimes the humblest of men, and should be protected. By the agreement before us the Commonwealth Government secure all the patent rights of a concern which is working world-wide. All vessels are equipped with this patented apparatus which the Australian Government has no right to use. We would haye no possible chance of setting up in opposition to the company. Under the agreement, however, we get a controlling influence by paying our fair share, which we should do. I have nothing to fear from the electors. I find that they do not try to twist matters on to one. They do not "" pitch "" little stories in sundry places about men's characters. They know well that honourable members would not be influenced in the way some people have indicated as being possible. In mv opinion, there is not a man in this House the Wireless Company or any other company would dare approach. Mr Eisk never approached me. I do not think I have had more than two words with him at any time. Honourable members are level-headed; they are not at all likely to be influenced by button-holers. What chance would a button-holer have with the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), or any other honourable member? Any one who wanted to get a certain thing carried out would not attempt to button-hole an honourable member with that object in view. Erom what I know of honourable members of this House, they are clean and above-board; and I would like to see any oue dare approach them offering them ""boodle"" for anything they do here. There is not an honourable member who would accept a gift. If he did, every other honourable member would rise to denounce him and would refuse to sit with him here. I helieve that this agreement was entered into with one object in view, namely, to give Australia that direct wireless communication which will be of such great benefit to the country. Direct communication will prove to he much superior to the relay system. Where were the relay stations to be? In India, Egypt, and so on. Under that system, however, if one station should break down, the whole of the service, would be upset. That was its weakness. With a high-power station here, we shall have communication far and near when we get it to work, which I have no doubt we shall do. Scientists can do much if they are given the time. The other day I heard of an industry which proposed to expend an enormous sum of money in Australia, but something cropped up which might have caused a failure and heavy loss. However, the people concerned said to a scientific man, "" Here is £20,000, overcome that difficulty."" That man went to work, and for a few pounds' expenditure succeeded in overcoming the difficulty, with the result that the industry has been a great success. It will be the same with wireless. Scientists are careful men. They will not commit themselves in giving evidence. They know that their reputations are at stake, and that they must live up to what they say. Had the evidence they could have given been taken, we should, I think, have heard from - these scientists statements that would (have led us to believe that, when this scheme is established, it will be an assured success.",53
265,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"Echuca) [8.5S] - I did not intend to speak on this amendment. have heen waiting in the chamber two days to speak on a different subject, and I do not now propose to address my remarks to the amendment more than to say that, having endeavoured to fairly weigh the evidence brought forward on both sides, I am of opinion that the whole transaction is ""fishy"" in the extreme, and therefore I shall vote for the amendment. The subject to which I propose to address my remarks is very different from that covered by the amendment, but I have been led to helieve that possibly I may be excluded from making the remarks I wish to make if I do not take this opportunity of doing so. Consequently, I propose to avail myself of it. Possibly, after the heat and stress of debate in the House during the last twenty-four hours, the subject may seem somewhat dry. but I make no apology for introducing it, seeing that it concerns so many thousands of farmers in this State, and, to a large extent, consumers as well. I propose, in the first instance, to address myself to paragraph 19 in the Governor General's messageMy Ministers, recognising the great value of the primary industries to Australia and the rapidity of their expansion, have taken definite action to open up new markets and further exploit old ones - To this end they have in every way in their power assisted the producers to place their goods upon the world's market by co-operative effort. My Government proposes to continue its support of voluntary movements for the collective marketing of primary products upon the same broad principles upon which was based the assistance given by the Government last year to the wheat, fruit, and dairy farmers. 1 take it that that is an open declaration on behalf of the Government, and, if so, it is one with which I am quite in agreement. I am pleased to note that the Government not only propose to do something for the wheat-farmers, but also to help the soft fruit-growers and dairymen. There is no doubt that both these latter industries are deserving of every help m the handling and marketing of the produce that the Government is able to give.  are voting against the Government?",55
266,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I should be a traitor to my constituents if I did not vote as my jonscience directs. Even if the Government offered to do anything in return for ny vote for the wireless agreement I would not give it. I am not going to reI flect on the Government, our friends opposite, or any individual. I shall not indulge in any way in recriminations such as we have heard during the lastfew days, but will confine myself to my immediate subject. I ask the indulgence of the House, because, as I say, it is a very dry subject, on which, possibly, some honourable members are fully informed, but on the other hand, I may be able to give them some interesting facts. During the present year we have had three separate Pools in the various States. W« have had a voluntary Pool in Victoria with a State guarantee, a voluntary Pool in South Australia and New South Wales undur a Federal Government guarantee, and a compulsory Pool in Western Australia under a State guarantee. We are asking that the pooling system shall be continued, in every State.  clean up the old Pools?",55
267,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"My desire, just now, is to give the House and the country some information, and I shall deal with the old Pools, the South African contract, and other subjects presently. The wheat-growers in each State, through their representatives and organizations, have made a definite pronouncement in favour of a continuance of the voluntary Pool, going right away from the old compulsory system. We made an effort fairly"" early last year to get Pools established, but it was some considerable time before they were got going. In Victoria, the Pool was in operation before that in New South Wales or South Australia, with the result that these latter States were severely handicapped. We desire an early pronouncement from the Government as to what they propose to do. Certain statements have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who, I regret to see, is not present, for which reason, I desire to get my remarks into Hansard for his perusal.  ber was not present yesterday when the Prime Minister made an announcement.",55
268,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I was here yesterday, but in the usual babble when questions are being asked, I did not catch what was . said.  when the Prinie Minister made the announcement. You asked me to get him to make an announcement, and this is the way you treat him!",55
269,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I rather resent what the honourable member says, and I submit that he is quite out of order. I am not attacking the Government, but simply desire to put forward a proposition. The farmers of this country are represented by the Federal Farmers Organization, which consists of the organized farmers of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. We recently met in conference at Adelaide, and adopted certain resolutions which I desire to place on record as follow :1. This conference affirms the desirability of continuing the pooling of wheat under the voluntary system. 2. Is in favour of a committee who shall act as trustees to control the Pool in each State being elected by the growers interested. The number constituting such committee and method of their appointment to be a matter for each individual State. 3. That whilst the trustees shall have the right to appoint their own receiving and handling agents, we strongly recommend that as far as possible all genuine co-operative companies be employed to do the work. 4. We allirm the desirability of effecting sell- time. ing and chartering arrangements in London which will eliminate competition between the various State Pools. 5. That such selling and chartering board at the London end consist of four, and not more than live, one of whom shall be the representative of the Australian Producers Co-operative Federation, the other members of such board to be the nominees of the Pool Committees within each State. 6. Local sales to be controlled by and on account of each State Committee. 7. A i l sales overseas or otherwise to be on account of each individual State. Time is pressing, and the weeks go by. I think I am right in saying there is a staff of experts in each State; we have all the machinery necessary for Pool continuance, but it will be a very hard matter to keep these staffs together unless we have a pronouncement at a very early date that the Pool is to be continued.  made yesterday.",56
270,Mr RICHAHD FOSTEE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The Prime Minister said the Pool would be conducted just as it was in South Australia and New South Wales, and available for every State.",56
271,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"My desire is that the Prime Minister shall make an announcement. I cannot say whether he will be satisfied with the scheme I put forward to-night, but I am speaking for the organized farmers of five States.",56
272,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,METEOROLOGICAL,"'The Prime Minister said the scheme would have to be satisfactory to the Commonwealth Bank, and that it .would not be political. Several honourable members interjecting.",56
273,Mr SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL," I desire to inform honourable members that my throat is not in good condition, and I do not propose to unnecessarily inflame it further by repeatedly calling for order. Honourable members know the rules, which I ask them to observe. One interjection is immediately followed by a chorus of others from different parts of the chamber, and I ask honourable members to cease making them. I cannot permit such gross breaches of order to be indulged in, and if they are continued the standing order will have to be enforced by other means.",56
274,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"Negotiation s have been going on between the Federal Farmers Organization, the co-operative companies, and the Commonwealth Bank for some What the Prime Minister has stated here is that he proposes to finance, or, at least, to guarantee the financing of the Pool by the Commonwealth Government, and we desire to know what the first advance is likely to be. We have been to the Bank, and we know what it is prepared to do for us, but if the Prime Minister is ready to get behind the Bank, the first advance will probably be a little higher than that the Bank would give on. its own initiative.  the same as last year.",56
275,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"To-da y the following telegram was received from Western Australia by the honourable member for Swan  To-day's press report, Prime Minister's statement merely indicates Government agree assist voluntary Pools lines similar last year. Does this mean we may take it for granted three shillings net first advance will be made available? Wish commence canvassing next Monday. Please reply today. MURRAY. It is necessary that we should know what the amount of the first advance is to be, because if it is a very small one it will prove the best possible way to kill the Pool. We do not wish to put the Government in a position where it will take auy risk, but if the first advance  is not worth anything!",56
276,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"If it is not worth 3s., plus Sd. for handling charges, we shall see every wheat-grower off the land. I propose to show some of the benefits which have accrued to y i c to r i a during the six years of the pooling period, including the war years. While the returns have been what I may call satisfactory, they possibly might have been even more so. We all understand that during the earlier years of pooling we were handling enormous quantities under war conditions, and we then had not the experience we have today in that work; and I wish to show, for the benefit of the House and of the farmers of Australia, more particularly those of Victoria, just exactly what happened in those years. the figures I am about to quote shall be placed on permanent record, because I think that in years to come they will be read and much appreciated by those who have access to them. The following figures deal with the intake and out-turn of the seasons 1915-16 to 1920-21 of Victorian Pools. In the year 1919-20 there was a drought and the crop was very small. Over the five pools we gained 1,343,832 bushels. On account of the mouse and weevil plagues there was a loss of 1,245,836 bushels on the 1916-17 Pool, which I tbink could hardly have been prevented in the circumstances, but there was a net gain over the whole six years of 97,996. bushels. The approximate financial statement of these operations is as follows: THE VICTORIAN WHEAT COMMISSION-STATEMEN OF INTAKE AND OUTTURN. Season 1915-16 to 1920-21. - Intake. Outturn. Bushels.

277,Sir ROBERT BEST,METEOROLOGICAL,"In speaking of I desire that "" advances"" does the honourable member mean advances by the Government?",57
278,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"A certain amount was advanced by the Government in the first instance, and subsequently dividends were paid from time to time. My figures in clude both. There was an annual distribution to the wheat-growers of Victoria, and those who handled the wheat, of a little over £10,000,000. Honourable members will realise that this is an industry which must be considered and conserved at all costs. The average advance actually paid over the whole six years was 5s. per bushel net after deducting rai l freights and handling charges, and the average expenses, including rail freight, were 8^d. per bushel. Having regard to the fact that the average rail freight in Victoria is approximately 4 | d . , and the fact that during the war period wheat had to be T held over lengthy periods, and high in terest charges accumulated, I think we can say with great satisfaction that, the Gain. Loss. total handling charge of 8-Jd. including Bualicls. Bushels. rail freights was very reasonable indeed. In addition to the receipts I have men1,245,836 tioned there is still a small amount to be distributed in the form of further dividends. 18,664 The present Pool in Victoria has received 32,000,000 bushels equal to 80 per cent, of a total crop available for home Bushels. consumption and export of 40,000,000 220,145,711 bushels. U p to date the sales have 220,243,707 realized approximately 5s. 4d. per bushel 97,996 net f.o.b. I believe that but for the Pool in Victoria during the last year,. and I think this statement would apply to other States also, it is highly probable that' the price received by the farmers would have been at least Is. per bushel below that which they will receive through the Pool. I mention this fact in proof of the benefits of the collective handling and marketing of wheat. Consider the immense advantage this must be to the man on the l and ; it enables him to pay his debts, and to keep other industries going.",57
279,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,Is Government assistance necessary?,58
280,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I shall come to that. The benefit of the Pool in this State during the last year has been equal at least to Is. a bushel over 40,000,000 bushels. So far as I am aware the Commonwealth Government has never lost the price of even a penny stamp in .connection with these Pools; neither has the Victorian Government, which also has given considerable help to the various pooling schemes.",58
281,Mr FENTON,METEOROLOGICAL,How did the price of the grain sold outside the Pool compare with the price of that sold through the Pool.,58
282,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"We have 'always to remember that the Pool made the price; it kept the speculator up to the mark, and if he would not pay something like the market price, he received no wheat. The private speculator bought a very small proportion of the wheat, and he had to pay approximately the market price on the day of purchase.",58
283,Mr RILEY,METEOROLOGICAL,Does the honourable member know the names of the speculators who bought the inferior wheat that was sent to South Africa?,58
284,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I shall deal with that transaction later, but not with the speculators. The Prime Minister may make a statement about them at a later date, but I assure the honourable member that most of the men who bought the wheat and flour that went to South A f r i c a "" have not a feather to fly with . "" through the medium of the Pool the Victorian growers will probably have returned to them about £2,000,000 more than they would have received if their wheat had been sold in the open market without the. aid of the Pool, the consumer has not been asked to pay more than he probably would have had to pay had there been no Pool. O'f the total wheat harvest of Victoria, 75 per cent, went overseas, so that of the gain of £5,000,000, about £1,500,000 oame from overseas. Honourable members may think that the local consumer had to pay too much for his wheat. But whilst in the early part of the year the price of wheat would have been low, as soon as the grain passed into the possession of the speculators, and the market advanced, the local consumer would not have received his wheat any chearjer than he did receive it through the Pool, if , indeed, he would have received it as cheaply. On this subject there has been a good deal of press controversy, and honourable members will realise how very difficult it is for a man occupying, as I do, the position of trustee for the time of the growers whom I represent, to give balance-sheets and statements from time to time. The Victorian Wheat-growers Corporation has been told that it was charging the local consumer a higher price than was justified. I have never tried publicly to exonerate the Corporation, but the members of it have always felt that we could establish a good case for the price we fixed. Until recently we kept the price for local consumption as near as possible to London parity, but the time arrived when, for certain reasons, we had to raise the local price above London parity. I shall state those reasons directly, and ask honourable members to pass judgment as to whether or not we were justified in the course we followed. Local consumption in Victoria requires approximately 9,000,000 bushels per annum. Purchases from the corporation to the 30th June of this year 1 amounted to 5,695,700 bushels. Millers are holding in stock on account of the corporation, under contract to purchase, up to the 15th December, 1922, a further quantity amounting to 3,334,000 bushels. The total already purchased and to be puTchased under the above contracts by 1 the millers from the corporation is 9,029,700 bushels. Our estimate of home Although consumption requirements for Victoria is 9,000,000 bushels, while the amount of wheat actually used has amounted to 9,029,700 bushels. The position of the corporation stocks ie as follows:-In country mills under contract to purchase, 3,334,000 bushels; other stocks held by the corporation, 1,300,000 bushels; making a total of 4,634,000 bushels. Exports of flour from the 1st January to 30th June, 1922, according to Customs returns, amounted to the equivalent of 3,700,000 bushels, as against 2,250,753 bushels for the same period of last year. Under the voluntary pooling system millers and others were free to purchase all the wheat they could get in open competition with the voluntary Pool in every State where such a Pool exists. Millers have been absolutely free to purchase any quantities on the open market. The quantities so purchased are not known to the corporation; but, if the Statist's estimate of the harvest was correct, the maximum quantity that the millers could have received on the open market was 4,475,000 bushels. Accordexisted ing to the figures emanating from the Millowners' Association, which appeared in the press recently, the millers must have purchased not less than 6,000,000 bushels. If that estimate is correct, they must be holding a considerable portion at present. The f u ll quantities nominated by country millers at the commencement of the season, and, in some cases, increased later, have been retained by the corporation and purchased from time to time as approved by the contract. When stocks held by the corporation were* approaching a low level, metropolitan millers were informed, and given an opportunity to consider the position, aud of purchasing, at the current price, whatever further stocks they required. During this period of consideration, amounting to four weeks, the corporation refrained from chartering and of making any further f.o.b. sales, so that the stocks available should not be depleted.",58
285,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,What does the honourable member mean by the nominations of the millers?,59
286,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"We entered into an agreement with the country millers. The contraot provided that they could purchase on the open market as much as they required. And, if they decided to take a certain quantity from the Pool, they could do so on the understanding that whatever quantity a miller took would have to be paid for at the end of three four-monthly periods starting on the 15th April, the second payment on the 15th August, and the last payment on the 15th December. Por instance, a miller would negotiate for the corporation to supply him with 90,000 bags. He is supposed to use, during the first of the three four-monthly periods, 30,0^0 bags. During that term, whatever he uses has to be paid for from week to week as he uses it. But, in the event of his not using up the whole by the end of that four-monthly period, he must pay for the quota remaining on the basis of the market price ruling at that date. Another important factor to be considered by the corporation was that the ci""op prospects covering large areas in many parts of Victoria and New South Wales were anything but promising. In sufficient rains had fallen in Victoria, and what was practically a drought in the western part of New South Wales and the wheat areas of Queensland. It has been only during the last three weeks that the fear of drought conditions has been removed. I want to explain now why the local price was slightly above parity, and I wish to offer a justification for that condition. While these negotiations were in progress, it was not known what stocks were held by millers or merchants, and it was thought that there might not even be sufficient for local requirements. Profitable business was lost to the corporation during this period. The purchase by metropolitan millers meant, of course, that they had to take the risk of market fluctuations. And, naturally, they desired the corporation to hold stocks available for them to buy as they required them. But this meant that the risk of the market would fall entirely on the farmers, together with delay in realization, interest charges, and storage and carrying costs. Various conferences took place between the millers and the corporation. The necessity of conserving stocks for local consumption was fully placed before them, especially in view of the expressed intention of certain mills to continue export business whenever obtainable. The millers were informed that as soon as the Government were satisfied that local supplies would be safeguarded the corporation would review the position. That has now been done. The corporation was afraid when it found that its stocks had got low, that if the market price was reduced to enable millers to do profitable export business at a certain time, those millers would continue their export business, with the result that our local consumers would be left high and dry. I suppose that in that event wo would have been taxed with leaving the country without the necessary supplies of flour. We protected the consumers by holding up several million bushels in the first instance; and now, since the millers have bought portions of those supplies, we are down, to an amount, which can be exported in the shape of flour or wheat, totalling 1,300,000 bushels. But we have not been satisfied that the stocks which the millers said they held were really held. We have been strongly of opinion that the amount of wheat which they said they held was not in the countiy, and we informed the Premier of Victoria of our views upon that matter. We told Mr Lawson that we were willing to reduce the price for local consumption to about parity at the earliest possible moment at which he could get a guarantee from the millers that they would not over-export, and leave us short for home consumption. The Premier set about taking a census, and he subsequently informed the corporation that he was satisfied that sufficient wheat would be retained for local consumption, and that, in fact, the millers had guaranteed accordingly. We received that notification on Monday afternoon last, and at 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning the price of wheat was reduced 3d. per bushel. That is our justification for keeping the market for a short period above what could have been said to have been reasonable world parity. While our price is 5s. Sd., the price in New South Wales is 5s. 9d., .and in South Australia also 5s. 9d. a bushel. I would point out, further, that, if there had not been any Pool, and if other interests had been holding the stocks of wheat which we hold to-da,y, the local price, in all probability, would have been well up to 6s. per bushel. With respect to South African complaints, when the Prime Minister (Mr desirable.. Mr HILL Hughes) was in London in July, 1921, serious statements were made to him General Smuts regarding the quality certain wheat and flour exported from Australia during the preceding year. that time Australia was short of wheat, and, owing to the fact that the succeeding to time. season was not promising well, export flour made from f.a.q. wheat had to very much curtailed. The Board was then made offers for considerable quantifrom ties of lower grade wheat of the 1916-17 season, and, in a business-like way, it realized the wheat to the best advantage. It appears, however, that the description given of the product of the wheat to South African merchants was such that they did not realise the nature of the goods they. were procuring. It seems to be unknown, even to South African merchants, that "" B "" grade was a third quality wheat, being lower grade than "" A "" grade, which was lower than f.a.q. The South African merchants would appear to have assumed that "" B "" grade wheat was second quality wheat. In addition, it is practically certain that the flour made from "" B "" grade wheat underwent a marked deterioration from the time of shipment in Australia to the time of discharge in South Africa. I have seen flour made from "" B "" grade wheat, and, while it was slightly dark in colour, it appeared to be wholesome and edible. I have seen and tasted bread made entirely from flour manufactured from "" B "" grade wheat. Had I not been told that its origin was "" B "" grade, I would not have been able to discover any difference except in respect of colour.",59
287,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,Whose statement is the honourable member giving ?,60
288,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,My own.,60
289,Mr FOLEY,METEOROLOGICAL,"Is the honourable member , reading the case for the Australian Wheat Board ?",60
290,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,I take full responsibility for thestatement I am making.,60
291,Mr FOLEY,METEOROLOGICAL,I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member in order in reading his speech?,60
292,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL," I am not aware that the honourable member has been reading his speech. It would not be in order for the honourable member to do so, but he may make such quotations as he considers - I am quoting, sir, from notes which I have carefully prepared, by and by which I stand. It is difficult to of carry one's memory back over a period of several years without falling into error, At and I have therefore prepared a statement to which I am referring from time of , When, as the result of an interview bebe tween the Prime Minister and General Smuts, members of the delegation arrived South Africa, they were very critically received by the administrative staff of the Board, who considered that if South Africans had any claims they should enforce tihem by a legal remedy. It soon became evident, however, that the South Africans had a claim which it might be hard to enforce in a Court, although on the moral side it was un< doubtedly strong. The delegation had several interviews with members of the Board, and the Board realized that, by reason of the fact that much misconception existed in South A f r i c a as to the nature of the goods merchants there were to receive, the Australian Wheat Board had been most materially assisted in the marketing of goods, in disposing of which they would otherwise have had difficulty. Aa a matter of fair dealing, the Board felt that it had no option but to make some allowance to the South A f r i c an merchants, which, while only to a small extent recouping them for their losses, would still leave the Board an excellent return on the wheat it had disposed of.  direct.",60
293,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"- No . T h strength of the moral claim made by the South Africans is best indicated by the fact that the Western Australian members of the Board, from which State none of the flour complained of had been shipped, feeling that the Board had benefited ""by the misconception of South African merchants, agreed that a recompense from funds, which would have to be partially met from Western Australia, was the only equitable way of dealing with the matter. The total claims made amounted . to £518,000, and the amount agreed to be paid was £115,000, of which the Commonwealth Government ihas accepted the responsibility for £32,500. The Australian Wheat Board will also finance this claim to the extent of £30,000, the Victorian Commission to the - extent of £26,250, and the South Australian Wheat Harvest Board to the same extent, making a total of £115,000. I wish to make it clear that the amount paid by the Australian Wheat Board, the Commonwealth Government, and the two States concerned was in respect of flour only, and in no way concerned wheat, although lit will be found by honourable rmembers that, in the final settlement, we get a clearance from any claims that might eventually be made in regard to second or third grade wheat exported to South Africa. An honourable member, when dealing last week with the quantity of second-grade wheat exported to South A f r i c a , said we were not justified in sending such wheat out of the country. At the time we were sending it to Japan and South A f r i c a the people of those countries were very glad to get it at almost any price. Having regard to the fact that we had several million bushels of second grade quality for which we could find no market at home, surely we did the right thing in disposing of it in the best market. We sold it to Japan and South A f r i c a, but there was no misrepresentation whatever on the part of the Board. We took up the moral ground, however, that the Board might have gained .by a misconception on the part of South A f r i c a n buyers on the one hand, and that to some extent we might have gained by misrepresentation on this side, although we do not admit that any misrepresentation took place. If misrepresentation was indulged in by merchants in this country, I can only say that they have suffered bitterly for it , because I think there are very few of them e who toi-day are not ruined men. If they were guilty of misrepresentation, the chances are they are suffering for it today.",61
294,Mr CONSIDINE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Does the honourable member say that the wheat sent to South t Africa was sold direct by the Board, and not by speculators 1",61
295,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,The wheat was not sold by the Board direct.,61
296,Mr SCULLIN,METEOROLOGICAL,"Then how did the Board benefit by the misrepresentation of merchants here, or misconception on the * part of South A f r i c a n buyers?",61
297,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,The Board did not sell any of this second or t h i r d grade wheat or flour direct to South Africa.,61
298,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,"The,honorabl e member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), speaking in the House recently, gave us the impression that this inferior wheat was sold by the Board to speculators in Australia, and that they in turn sold it to South A f r i c a n merchants, with the result that they were ""taken down."" Will the .honourable member give us the names of the persons who purchased the wheat here, and the names of their agents in South Africa ? Why should this matter be covered up?",61
299,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not wish to with hold such information, but I am not in a position to give it to-night.",61
300,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,Then I think it is time that the House took a hand in this matter. The Pool cannot be run in this way.,62
301,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,The explanation I have given to-night is correct.,62
302,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,-But the honourable member has not gone far enough.,62
303,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"F r o m my point of view, the moral responsibility incurred by the Board is due to the fact that this flour was sold, not on sample, but on description. The sales, I repeat, were not made by the Board, although the Board benefited by such sales from time to time.",62
304,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,"I quite understand that, but the honourable member said that the Board had made this payment in respect of flour which had been exported. I am not asking about the wheat that was sold and exported.",62
305,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"We have not paid, nor do we propose to pay, anything in regard to the wheat sent out.",62
306,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,"But did certain men purchase wheat in Australia, and in turn sell to speculators?",62
307,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,That is so.,62
308,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,"I want to know who they are. Parliament agreed to give the Board a guarantee, and we are entitled to the fullest information.",62
309,Mr HILL,METEOROLOGICAL,"The information for which the honourable member asks will not be withheld. I have no hesitation in saying that it would take a man practically six months to make a careful study of all the papers relating to this matter. I have been asked a question in regard to the cleaning up of the various Pools- a matter that has agitated the ininds of the farmers of not only Victoria, but all the States. One of the metropolitan newspapers in this State has been ungenerous enough to assert that the officers of the Board, or the Board itself, have been holding up the finalization of the Pool so as to maintain their present positions. In reply, I would point out that at the present time the staff of the Australian Wheat Board consists of only three accountants and one lady typist. Our manageT has practically returned to the Treasury, and we have vacated some of our rooms. We axe doing everything possible to expedite the fihalization of the Pools. Accounts covering a large number of shipments have only recently been received from England, and these are now being closely analyzed. Before final distributions can be made, the accounts must be audited, as the States will be responsible for any overpayments. There have been large overpayments in New South Wales. That is the only State, I believe, in which such a thing has occurred. Another reason why we have been unable to finalize all the Pools is that the Board is defendant in a Court case that is being brought by a Japanese buyer of 1916-17 wheat. The enormity of the business transacted can be seen from the fact that the total realizations for all Pools amounted to over £1SO,000,000, of which 98£ per cent, has been paid away to growers or to meet expenses.  [10.0] - Althoug h nearly all the time taken up by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) has been well spent, much of what he has said could have been dealt with at a later stage, when I hope to have the opportunity of speaking upon the question. He barely touched upon the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), except, to describe this wireless contract as one of the fishiest matters with which he has ever come in contact. For that reason he proposes to vote for the amendment, as naturally he would be expected to do, after his very m i l d description of the transaction. The honourable member's opinion was in contradistinction to the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Denison (Mr . Lair d S m it h ) , who could see nothing wrong with what the honourable member has described as one of the fishiest matters ever brought before this House. The honourable member for Denison does not believe that any honourable member would have anything to do with one of these "" fishy "" transactions. He declared that he did not think that any honourable member would accept a bribe.",62
310,Mr LAIR DSMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,"He a r , hear!  honourable member's memory must be very short, because there has never been greater feeling created in this country than was created by the Prime Minister's acceptance of £25,000 a little while ago.",62
311,Mr LAIRD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,"Subscribe d by whom?  has occurred, and so much has been agreed to by the Prime Minister since accepted that £25,000, that a very ferent complexion is cast on the statesaw ment of the honourable member for Deniter son that there is not an honourable memable ber in this House capable of accepting monetary consideration for services renonly dered in return.",62
312,Mr LAIKD SMITH,METEOROLOGICAL,"T h c honourable member would be surprised to know how many poor people subscribed to that g if t .  times we have asked for the publication of the names of the subscribers, and venture to say that if there is no reason why they should be kept back from public gaze the Prime Ministeiwould long ago have made them known.",63
313,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,"The hongoing orable member is not in order in referDid ring to that matter.  led away by the honourable member f o Denison, who has displayed such innoto cence in speaking on this question that thought it would be well to remind h i ' of the little incident which I have tioned. There are one or two phases this debate that are highly interesting. The speech of the honourable member Denison was quite characteristic of of other honourable members on his side of the chamber. The honourable member, longer a member. except for saying what I have just ferred to, treated us to a very entertainment ing address upon the technicalities wireless, but gave us no light upon the situation, and suggested no way i the Government could extricate itself from the bog in which it finds itself day. He concluded, as every other honthis orable member on his side has done, after condemning the agreement, and smiting it hip and thigh, by stating he was prepared to accept the assurances of the Prime Minister. We heard f r o the honourable member for Perth (Mr Powler), what the ex-Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr . Wise), said about the matter before was taken into the bath room, as the to the amendment. honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey) put it last night, and had throat cut. The honourable member f Gippsland told the House that he been strongly opposed to having anything to do with the Wireless Company, that he had no faith in the company, that be felt it was putting forward a speculative difscheme, that he had been amazed when he ""honourable members allowing the matto go last December, that he was not to give it the attention he desired with a his individual mind, and that he could deal with it with his composite mind, as he was then a member of the Cabinet. I have nothing to add to what the honourable member for Perth has said about the honourable member for Gippsland being a member of. the Ministry. The attitude l admitted to have been adonted by the honourable member for Gippsland when he I was a member of the Ministry points to the existence of a. very low order of things the among those who, like himself, accepted a place in the Cabinet, and who, while knowing that this kind of transaction was on, raised no finger to expose it . the honourable member for Gippsland ever mention his attitude in Cabinet? Did he bring the matter before Cabinet ? has'not enlightened us on that point. r He has simply said that he was not able deal with it except with his composite I mind. His attitude today is that now he m is outside Cabinet he is more strongly opmenposed to the agreement than he was wben of he was dealing with it with a composite mind. But yet he concludes by saying for that he is prepared to accept the those assurances of the Prime Minister and those i u the Cabinet of which he is no Other honourable regentlemen who are backing the Governto-day are compelled to deal with of the matter with a composite mind just as if they were in the Cabinet itself. The h which honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) and the honourable member tofor Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) went outside House a little while ago to castigate the Government, but they were immediately taken up-stairs asd severely caned. that They were told that they were no longer permitted to deal with matters with an m individual mind, but must keep their in . dividual opinions for up-stairs; otherwise the "" well would run d r y . """,63
314,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honhe orable member must confine his remarks  his no getting away from the statement made or by the honourable member for Perth conhad cerning the honourable member for Gippsland. It may have appeared to be a personal matter, but the condemnation he uttered by the honourable member for Perth was the only logical interpretation that could be placed on the utterances of the ex-Postmaster-General last night. Le t me take the remarks of other honourable members supporting the Government. The honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr . Atkinson) says, "" The thing is wrong from start to finish. We should let the whole thing go."" He is just like a Tasmanian senator, who says that even now the whole agreement should be torn up. I wonder what he would do if he were here. He is free to talk as he likes in the Senate, where he is not responsible for keeping the Government in office. Other honourable gentlemen in this Chamber who aro behind the Government have spoken just as strongly as Senator John D . Millen has in another place, but they have resumed their seats with the expression on their lips that they are prepared to accept the assurances of the Government. I have spoken about what the honourable member for Perth said concerning the honourable member for Gippsland, but what is the attitude of the honourable member for Perth himself ? He took the ex-Postmaster-General to task for doing a certain thing, and every one naturally had the right to expect that before he sat down he would declare that he would not follow the road taken by the honourable member for Gippsland, and would show his independence in this Chamber. What did he say? He said, "" I believe that this is one of the shadiest pieces of business ever heard of in this House, but I am not going to vote for the amendment. I do not propose to vote at all . "" I prefer the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Gippsland, bad as it is. He said, "" I am much more opposed to this agreement now that I am able to deal with it with an individual mind than I was when I could only deal with it with a composite m in d ; but, nevertheless, I propose to vote against the amendment."" The honourable member for Perth chastised the ex-Postmaster-General for adopting his attitude, and then said, in effect, "" My attitude is that I propose to run away from the. thing altogether."" Of the two attitudes, both of which are contemptible, I prefer that of the man who stands up and votes.",63
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honvery little, about the agreement. orable member must not apply the word "" contemptible "" to any member of this House.  applying the term to an attitude. It well that the statements of honourable members on the Government side should be exposed for what they are. I conclude by referring to the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) . That honourable member for a little while left honourable members in some doubt as to how he would vote, but I think I know how the honourable member would like to vote. Honourable members opposite have no misgivings about the result, and it was, I think, the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Richard Poster) who boasted that the Government had the numbers, so we may take it that he knew the honourable member for Balaclava was "" in the bag."" That honourable member, however, said that if he were in the Ministry he would have no hesitation in saying that the contract should not be accepted. If there is one man more than another in this House who claims to be independent, it is the honourable member for Balaclava, and he declares that if he were in the Ministry, when, of course, he could only use his composite mind, he would have no hesitation in declaring that the contract should be torn up. He added, however, that he* was prepared to accept the assurance given by the Prime Minister, though if there is one man who should not be prepared to do so it is the honourable member himself. In this, the honourable member for Balaclava has absolutely passed the limit . I should like to refer to one* statement that was made by the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden), who said that if this trouble in regard to Sir Thomas Hughes had not arisen, the agreement would have been at once accepted by the House. The honourable member expressed that opinion with assurance; but he must know that honourable members on this side of the ifouse, at all events, never at any stage approved of the agreement. It is remarkable how that, honourable member could "" strain at a gnat and swallow a camel."" He made a mouthful about the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, but said not a word, or The Government owed the duty to the House and the country, not only to tell us all about the agreement, but also who were representatives of the Government. is Those representatives of the Government include Mr George Mason Allard, who is chairman of directors of Beard, Watson, and Company, and he is associated with Mr Bartholomew in a private company. What have the Government got to say about that appointment? Bad as the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes is, the appointment of Mr Allard is infinitely worse, yet we hear not a word about the latter from either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence. Will honourable members opposite, who are prepared to accept the assurance of the Prime Minister and the Government, meekly vote against the amendment without raising their voices in protest against the appointment of this gentleman as the representative of the Government while he is a partner in a private business which holds a great number of shares",64
316,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"He is not a partner.  Allard is chairman of directors of the private eompany I have mentioned, and is the bounden he is co-director in this company with another gentleman named Bartholomew, .who is also the representative of the Amalgamated Wireless Company.",65
317,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,He is not a partner.  is a co-shareholder.,65
318,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"That is a very thing.  the good of quibbling in that way, for both are interested in the same company? Mr. Allard is a representative of the Governorable ment, and his partner is a representative that of the wireless company. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) described the circumstances as "" fishy,"" and opinion that is a very mild adjective use. It was, as I say, the duty of the Government to tell us who were the sentatives of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Lambert) put a very fair question when he asked the Leader of the House (Mr. Greene) who nominated Sir Thomas Hughes. If he was not nominated by the Government, whom did the Government nominate? There must have been nominees from both sides, otherwise arbitrator would not have been called",65
319,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,That is obvious.  honourable gentleman tell us who were the nominees of the Government? Am I right in saying that the company nominated Sir Thomas Hughes and the Government nominated nobody ?,65
320,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"No , you would not be right.  this mystery and secrecy? I have heard it said that the Government nominated Sir Thomas Hughes, and we may assume that if there was nothing to conceal the Minister for Defence would be candid with the House and with the country. Does the Government suggest that the 'House has no right to the information? Why this policy of ""keep it dark"" and ""cover it up "" ? Is there anything to hide. I have heard on good authority that the Government nominated nobody, which was equivalent to giving Sir Thomas Hughes a walk-over, and with an obvious purpose.",65
321,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,That is not correct. Mr. PARKER MOLONEY - Then it duty of the Government to give the House the correct information.,65
322,Mr WISE,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member's assertion denies itself because there was arbitration.  trator could deal with the matter, although the other side might not have different nominated anybody.",65
323,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"That is so manifestly that it does not require an answer.  gentleman, on reflection, will see it is he who is taking the silly view as the company might have nominated more than one, in which case an arbitrator would have had to he called in although in my there was no Government nominee at to all. The honourable gentleman said that he received a shock when he heard of Sir repreThomas Hughes' appointment, but the Prime Minister subsequently came in and said that before Parliament met for this session he had heard about the appointment and had objected to it. How much truth there is in that statement may be gauged from the declaration by the Minister for Defence that he was shocked when he heard of the appointment. I an suppose that the honourable gentleman in. was as much in the dark about the other nominees as he was about that of Sir Thomas Hughes; but if the Prime Ministreats hia colleagues in this cavalier way it is marvellous that so mauy are prepared to accept his assurances and obey his beck and call.",65
324,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I have told you half-adozen times that your assumption is wrong.  onus rests on the Minister to say where it is wrong. This business has created more public comment, and greater feeling in the publio mind, than any I have known of for a considerable time, and for that reason alone the Prime Minister ought to be candid with the country. The honourable member for Nepean can see nothing wrong with the agreement, except the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, but, right from the beginning, what does the agreement purport to do't The agreement provides that the Commonwealth should forthwith, after the expiration of one month from the date of the agreement, apply for, and the company shall allot to the Commonwealth 500,001 shares, for which the Commonwealth shall pay on allotment the suni of 2s. per share. That means a payment of £50,000, and then on the 1st J u ly this year the Commonwealth had to pay 6s. per share. This means that at a time when the company is returning nothing and all the expenses are being met, the Commonwealth has to put up its money while the other parties are not called upon to pay a brass farthing. .",66
325,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,"That is not correct,  according to the agreement. Thus the Commonwealth will be providing money to give a great return to individuals who are asked to contribute very little on their part. Right along the line the Commonwealth gets the worse of the deal; yet we are told that there is nothing wrong about the agreement, except the appointment of one gentleman. One aspect of the case was overlooked until the honourable member for Moreton (Mi"". Wienholt) called attention to it . Several honourable members, including the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) said that if we accepted the amendment it would not lead us anywhere, because the agreement had been signed, and the result would involve litigation. I am inclined to. think that that honourable member did not closely examine the amendment.",66
326,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I did, very carefully.  point out that the amendment applies to clause 12.",66
327,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I know.  clause provides: - The company shall within six months after the date of this agreement or within such extended time as the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board may approve enter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of the stations mentioned in paragraphs / and g of clause 5 of this agreement. The agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature nnd to such an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the TJnited Kingdom and Canada. That refers to the agreement to be entered into in order to give an effective service. If this amendment is carried it will , according to my reading, give Parliament a voice in - approving or rejecting the agreement yet to be entered into between the representatives of the Government and the company.",66
328,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"No ; the clause refers to the agreement to be entered into between the company and some constructional company that is to erect the high power station.  well. The honourable member said that the amendment would lead us nowhere, because it could not upset what has been done already, but I say that it will help to make the agreement better and will provide a way out of the existing difficulty for which honourable members opposite must take responsibility.",66
329,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"It will throw upon the House the responsibility of fixing the guarantees instead of allowing the Commonwealth's nominees on the Board to do it.  honourable member suggest that that would not be a desirable thing? Mr MAXWELL ^ - It would be very undesirable.  the honourable member says that this agreement, whether good, bad, or indifferent, cannot be remedied, and that we should not do anything to try to make it better.",66
330,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"We cannot alter an agreement after it has been made.  amendment refers to clause 12, and I say emphatically that if we agree to it it will give Parliament the right of approving or rejecting the agreement yet to be entered into by the representatives of the company and the representatives of the Common weal th.",67
331,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"No , no. I implore the honourable member to read the clause carefully.  read it.",67
332,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"Then the honourable member has completely misunderstood it. Ask the honourable member for Batman.  honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) agrees with me that the further agreement to be entered into between the representatives of the parties under clause .12 will come before this House for approval or rejection if the amendment be agreed to. That is the plain meaning of the clause and the amendment. honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Wienholt) expressed the same opinion this evening, and the honourable member for Fawkner did hot contradict him.",67
333,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I did.  honourable member who desires to make the agreement better than it is has an opportunity to do so by voting for the amendment. It is remarkable every honourable member on the opposite side who has spoken, with one exception, has condemned the agreement, but each one has said that he will accept the Prime Minister's assurance, notwithstanding that the transaction has been described by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) as ""fishy."" It is to the .credit of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) that he is a whole-hearted supporter of the agreement, right or wrong.",67
334,Mr MAXWELL,METEOROLOGICAL,"I did not say I supported the agreement, right or wrong. Mir. PARKER MOLONEY - The honourable member said that as the agreement has been signed we shall only - involve the Commonwealth in litigation if we try to upset it ; therefore, it is better to accept it as it is. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) described the agreement as criminal, and I suppose that it is fitting that the honourable member for Eawkner, who has a professional reputation as a defender of criminals, should declare himself a staunch defender of it. I think the descriptions given by the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Fowler) and the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) are appropriate. I could not describe the agreement better, and if honourable members opposite believe what they say-that the agreement is ""fishy,"" and one of the worse transactions that has ever come before the House - I hope that they will stand up to their opinions and vote for the amendment.",67
335,Mr HUNTER,METEOROLOGICAL,"Maranoa) [10.38] This is the fourth week that the House has been in session, and nothing has been done. After reading the Governor General's Speech I was very anxious that the Government should proceed as soon as possible with business in order that some of the legislation mentioned therein might be put into operation before the next election. Most honourable members have said The or inferred that the final session of a Parliament ' simply degenerates into electioneering, and I thought it would be just as well to place the proposals mentioned in the Speech on the statute-book so that they could not be used as election cries. And I would not have spoken in this debate but for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman. As a member of the Committee appointed that to inquire into the agi'eement, I do not desire to give a silent vote. Honourable members are well aware of the circumstances under which the Committee was appointed, and it must not be forgotten that no matter how this matter is debated now, nothing can alter what was done by the House on 9th December last. On> that day an express' motion was passed delegating the powers of this House in connection with the agreement to the Wireless Committee. Many members contend that the motion was passed not by the House but by a majority of honourable members. Honourable members opposite know quite well that the voice of the majority is the voice of the whole. That is one of the main planks of their platform. The voice of the majority in this House is the voice of the House, and the voice of the majority stated expressly by resolution that the approval or otherwise of the agreement should be left i u the hands of the Wireless Committee. Any honourable member perusing Hansard will see that I voted for the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). I believed that the matter of a wireless agreement should be referred to a Committee, and that the Committee should report it back to the House. I , therefore, supported the honourable gentleman's amendment. next motion submitted was that proposed by the Prime Minister, and upon that motion the Wireless Committee was appointed. I voted against that motion. That was the position I took up. I was absolutely against anything in the shape of a hybrid company. I even went so far as to say that I was against having anything to do with any private company in the way proposed. In my view it does not matter what protection is sought by having two or three representatives of the Government on the Board of Directors of such a company. We might have five or six representatives of the Government, and there would still be no safeguard. Any one who knows anything about company law must be aware that directors are expected to have a monetary interest in the company of which they are given control. In addition to a director's fee they get a return from the company, if its operations are prosperous, in the shape of dividends. But representatives appointed by the Government upon the directorate of a company like this have no monetary interest or are supposed to have no monetary interest in the company. They have only their director's fee to recompense them for the time they spend on the Board, and in the circumstances they cannot be expected to neglect their own businesses for the purpose of considering the business of the company to which they are aj>pointed as directors. That is one reason why I am totally against having anything to do with these hybrid companies. The fact still remains that this House has approved of the agreement, and we cannot get away from that. All the debate which has taken place during the last three days should have taken place last year. We know that the House rose on the 10th December last, but most of us thought that it would not rise u n t i l the 16th. There was no very 'urgent hurry to get away, and another week's sittings would have made l it t l e difference to. honourable members. I live furthe r from the Seat of Government than do most members of this House, and I was naturally anxious to get back to my home. But what was a week .extra when, by continuing to sit for that time, we might have given this matter proper consideration last year. I have learned two things from my experience as a member of the Wireless The Committee. It has confirmed me in my view as to the necessity of submitting matters of this kind to a Committee. The responsibility should not be placed upon this House to come to a decision upon such matters without ample time for consideration. It is absolutely necessary that Committees should be appointed to go thoroughly into proposals of this character, and bring back to this House the conclusions to which they have come, and the evidence upon which those conclusions are based. If that course is adopted, the House can properly consider the subject in question and will be in a position, to cast an intelligent vote upon it . I am sure that a majorit y of honourable members will admit that when this proposal was first brought uuder the notice of the House most of them were absolutely ignorant of everythingconnected with wireless telegraphy. I certainly knew nothing of the subject. We know, too, that every agreement requires very caref u l consideration. A Committee is required, i u dealing with matters of this kind, to obtain information which honourable members, busy as they are, are unable to obtain for themselves. I might say, in language which may be used outside, but which probably would not be allowed here, that much of the talk we have heard during the last three days, has been so much "" tripe.""",67
336,Mr SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,Order !,68
337,Mr HUNTEE,METEOROLOGICAL,"I beg your pardon, sir. I will say that it has been irrelevant. It has not been to the point. Many honourable members have spoken as if the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) was submitted for the purpose of rejecting the agreement. They have spoken as if the agreement was being weighed in the balance in this House now. But under the powers given to the Wireless Committee, if they had recommended the approval of the rottenest agreement that could he submitted the House would still have no power in the matter, because it delegated its power to the Committee. Although I was against anything of the sort, - I still say that the agreement is a good agreement. One amateur legal member of this House has said that it is loosely drawn up, but the only looseness in connection with the matter was the looseness, carelessness, and abandon with which the honourable member exercised his vote on the 9 th December last. honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt) criticised the manner in which the Wireless Committee conducted its proceedings. He said that there were no minutes and that the evidence was not brought before the House in proper form. Let me tell honourable members that the Wireless Committee was not bound even to keep the notes which have been presented to the House. The reference to it was so broad that it could do exactly as it liked. That again shows the carelessness with which the motion was voted upon last year. It is useless to try and throw blame on the Wireless Committee. The only persons responsible in this matter, if there is anything wrong, are those who voted for the motion to which I have referred on the 9th December last. I do not intend to go into the details of the agreement, because to do so would be to repeat what other honourable members have said; but I will say that, in my opinion, the Commonwealth is absolutely protected. It is protected under the clause of the agreement which has been mentioned so many times, and which is particularly referred to in the amendment now under consideration. It is protected also because of ordinary business considerations. Any one who has money at stake in a business concern will do all that is possible to insure that the business shall be carried on at a profit. The men engaged in this business can be trusted to do their best to make it a paying concern, and the Commonwealth being concerned in the business, much as I regret it, will share in its profits. Many things might be said in support of the agreement from the point of view of the company. I am not an apologist for the company. One thing that might Mr Hunter. be said from the point of view of outside investors is that they would be fools to permit the Commonwealth to be.represen ted by a majority of the board of directors when its representatives might be appointed by any Government, and might be men without business or technical experience. Private investors would be fools to risk their money in a business concern controlled by men without business experience. Though the debate which has taken place may be regarded The as futile, it should have for us a lesson which we ought not to forget. The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Batman reads. . . . the agreement mentioned in, clause 12 of the contract . . . . should before acceptance by the Commonwealth representatives on the board of directors be agreed to by this House. Many opinions have been expressed, but my opinion, which I think would be supported by any lawyer who went into the matter, is that that amendment represents a direct interference with the contract. The clause which it is proposed to amend readsThe agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature and to such an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the board of directors for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service The amendment would have the effect of altering the clause to read, "" As approved by the Commonwealth Parliament,"" instead of, ""As approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the board of directors.""",68
338,Mr MAHONY,METEOROLOGICAL,There is nothing wrong in putting that in.,69
339,Mr HUNTER,METEOROLOGICAL,"Excep t that it would involve an alteration of the contract. Any contract signed and sealed should be held in the eyes of all men of honour as a sacred thing, like the word of a gentleman. It should not be subjected to any attempt to change it . It is well, of course, that all honourable members are not possessed of the same opinions; but I assert that any member who votes for the amendment will vote for the alteration of the contract and for having the Commonwealth posted before all the world as a defaulter. I am glad the discussion has arisen, fox it shows how necessary it is that all such matters should be thoroughly probed before being resolved in the form of a. contract, aud how essential it is that all jected agreements, after having' been considered by any Committee-eve n though composed of representatives from this Chamber-shoul d be ratified by Parliament itself. I am sorry that the honourable member for Batman has moved his amendment, for, if it were carried, it would have the effect of causing Australia to be pilloried as a defaulter, as a country which pays no respect to the sacred terms of a signed and sealed contract.",69
340,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"Gwydir) [10.52]. - I had hoped that the Government would see their way clear to extend the ordinary courtesy of providing a reply when the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Lambert) sought certain information in the public interest, namely, who were the persons whose names were submitted along with that of Sir Thomas Hughes for the consideration of the arbitrator, Mr Consett Stephen. can be no valid reason why this information* should be withheld; yet it has been refused. In adopting such a course of action, the Government are not merely flouting the honourable member for West Sydney; they are ignoring the publio. The Government are merely the custodians of the people's rights. The people are entitled to know all that goes on. There is no war now. There is no reason why, when information is sought, it should not be furnished, particularly as practically every honourable member behind the Government has described the Wireless Agreement as fishy, corrupt, rotten, criminal, and altogether unscrupulous. I have read many of the volumes of Hansard produced during the history of the Federal Parliament, but I have failed to find anything approaching the weight of denunciation which has issued from, the supporters of the Government on the present occasion. So long as th* Government refuse to divulge the particulars sought for, members will be lacking in their duty if they allow Ministers to cross a "" t "" or dot an ""i."" Every means must be exhausted for eliciting the necessary particulars. What excuse can there be for withholding the names of the nominees put forward for the consideration of the arbitrator by the Government's representatives on the directorate 1 Is it because the persons nominated were such that the Government have reason to be ashamed proof them? Are they such that the arbitrator had no alternative but to select Sir Thomas Hughes?",70
341,Mr BRENNAN,METEOROLOGICAL,I suggest that the Government's representatives did not put forward any name.,70
342,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"What was done ? Who was nominated ? Were they suitable persons ? The Government should, answer. I direct attention to the persistent rumour that four nominees were mentioned for the consideration of the arbitrator, and that three of them were men who were so unsuitable, whoi knew so little about wireless, that the only . nominee left for the arbitrator to deal with was Sir Thomas Hughes, the former chairman of Amalgamated Wireless. This debate has proceeded for several days, and has been afforded wide publicity. During that .period the Govern-, There ment should have invited a report from the arbitrator, so that honourable members and the pubilc might not form erroneous ideas of Mr Consett Stephen, and of the part he has played in this altogether doubtful business. However, it is only to be expected that the Government would do what they have done; for this is the culmination of a long series of blunders perpetrated by blunderers and incompetents. The Government have done things, and survived, which would have brought about the sudden death of any other Government. Only the fact of their possession of a servile majority has saved them. Many individual members behind the Government are bombastically independent outside, but are disgustingly servile in Parliament.",70
343,Mr SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL," Order ! I remind the honourable member that he is using language which is distinctly offensive to other honourable members, and which is certainly not parliamentary.",70
344,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"I can relate many blunders made by the Government. As long ago as 1920, the Auditor-General's report for that year dealt with the matter of a loss of £326,000 ou the sale of eight wooden ships built in America. That was one costly blunder of the Government. Another occurred when they paid the WaUace Power Boat Company £51,839 compensation for practically nothing. The Government were criticised severely upon that matter, as upon others also, hy the Auditor-General. There was, for further example, the cancellation of another contract with Hughes, Martin, and Washington Ltd., costing £72,500. I need only draw attention, lastly, to that awful blunder of the Prime Minister respecting the contract entered into with the Imperial Government for the sale of Australian wool. Owing to that muddle, our wool-growers lost millions of pounds, and the accounts have not yet heen finalized.",70
345,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,METEOROLOGICAL,"Rubbish ! am one of the wool-growers of Australia, and I am delighted with that contract.",71
346,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"At any rate, selves the Assistant Minister is complaining day, with everybody else, of the burden of taxation that he has to carry.",71
347,Mr SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,Order ! The honselves orable member must confine his remarks drafted the agreement. to the amendment.,71
348,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"I am referlast Decemberring to one of the blunders perpetrated by the Government, and am connecting it with this culminating blunder of the sponsibility wireless agreement. All are due to the fact that the Prime Minister has estabHowever, lished a dictatorship. One would imagine, listening to honourable members behind will the Government and in the Country bility in the matter. party corner, that this was the only mittees Government and the only Prime Minister Australia could have. The whole trend of the debate from the time of the introducnoring tion of. the original agreement by the Prime Minister proves that this Governthemselves ment are in the habit of bringing matters forward without adequately considering them in Cabinet. The Prime Minister relies on the fact that he has only to crack the party whip over his supporters they will follow him.",71
349,Mr SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,"The honourable member is not speaking to the amendstrictest ment; he is criticising the actions of Prime Minister in relation to matters embraced in the amendment, and he is out of order in doing so.",71
350,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,The Prime been Minister often criticises us; may I not criticise him?,71
351,Mr SPEAKER,METEOROLOGICAL,"There seems to be --some misapprehension in the minds cf honourable members regarding the limits of speech in this debate. If a member has not previously spoken on the Address-inReply, I shall allow him more latitude than an honourable member who has already spoken. But, as the honourable member had the fullest opportunity in his speech on the Address-in-Reply to criticise the Prime Minister, so long as he kept within the rules of debate, and of which [ think, he did not neglect to take advantage, he is not in order now in criticising the Prime Minister in regard to matters irrelevant to the amendment beI fore the Chair. He must now confine himself strictly to that amendmen t.",71
352,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"We find ouria the present position because of to the haste with which the agreement was brought forward. I wish to show how this Government set out to shield thembehind the Committee which The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) stated The Prinie Minister (Mr Hughes) says that the Government are prepared to take the reof entering into this particular contract, and,.of course, the Government must accept responsibility for whatever they do. the Committee the right honourable gentleman has asked the House to a.pprove of, also be obliged to accept some responsi",71
353,Mr HUGUES,METEOROLOGICAL,Certainly. : all such Comaccept responsibility.,71
354,Mr CHARLTON,METEOROLOGICAL,"I could understand the Government accepting the responsibility of igtho recommendations of the proposed Committee, but when they propose to shelter behind this Committee it is not the proper procedure to follow. That is exactly what is happening. The Government have departed from proper parliamentary procedure in sheltering beand hind the Committee. They should have been prepared to draft the agreement .themselves and accept the responsibility. There are many things that call for the investigation, and will leave a the very bad impression on the minds of the not public unless they are cleared up by an investigation into the ramifications of the company, and the influences that have at work to bring about the consummation of the agreement. It is persistently rumoured, and the statement has appeared in the press, that the old company entered into an agreement with another company to install the necessary plant for £2S4,000. By having a majority on the Board of Directors, the old company will turn the agreement over to the new company at the price of £600,000, and thus rake off over £300,000 for itself. No doubt in these circumstances, as the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) said, the company will consent to an amendment of the agreement. When Tumours are circulated about honourable members on this side the Government take action straight away, even going so far as to expel honourable members ou the uncorroborated newspaper statements, but where individuals outside are concerned, as in this case, the matter is treated in quite a different light. What a magnificent idea the honourable member .for Maranoa (Mr Hunter) has of his duty in this Parliament as the custodian of the people's purse! He says that the agreement is right. He is willing that the Government should find half-amillion sterling, and hand the control of the company over to private enterprise. Why not let private enterprise undertake all the functions of Government, and even come into this Parliament? Under the agreement, we are asked to hand over the control of wireless telegraphy in Australia to these people, and give them a Government monopoly. Is that right not worth anything in the future? The honourable member for Maranoa, who now says it is right to hand over the control to private enterprise, has somersaulted on the vote that he gave on the 9th December, when he favoured referring the matter to a Parliamentary Committee. There has also been a somersault by the Government themselves, because in one week they want to get rid of all socialistic enterprises, and in the next week they sidize a company pound for pound, and give it a monopoly of a big publio utility. Honourable members on the other side of the chamber say that we cannot get out of the agreement. If we cannot, then let us get rid of the Government who axe responsible for the agreement. Are we to continue to keep in office this Government, and to bo treated to more of these things ? I would ask the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), whether, if he were putting £5^0,000 of his own money into this concern, he would agree to what has happened? His well-knownScotch caution would lead him to say that, if he were paying an equal share, and giving away a monopoly of his business, he would expect a controlling voice. And I say unhesitatingly that one should be more careful with the people's money than with his own. Parliament has been delegated the duty of looking after the interests of the people, and honourable members should faithfully discharge that trust, because the people cannot do anything to protect themselves in cases such as this. Honourable members on this side have taken exception not only to Sir Thomas Hughes, whose appointment is only the effect of other happenings, but exception is also taken to Mr Allard. The Government can remove Mr Allard, if they so desire. The senses of honourable member's opposite seem to have been dulled since last night. They were shocked when the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) stated that Mr. Allard was chairman of directors of Beard, Watson, and Company, and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Pratten) indignantly denied the allegation. He has since admitted that the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) was correct in his statement. If it is right for a man to hold shares in a company that is a shareholder in the new company, and accept a position as director, on the Board, why does the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) make it plain that he has resigned from his position in the firm of Paterson, Laing, and Bruce, with which he was connected? Was it not in order to maintain the purity of public life? There is a well established principle, as old as Parliament itself, that a man shall not vote as a custodian of the public funds on a sub- question in which he is financially interested. And yet we find that some members of the board are to deal with half-a-million of public money in respect, of matte'rs in which either they ""themselves or their partners are interested. They are asked to serve two masters. They are to serve the Government or themselves and their partners. That they cannot do, and give justice to the people of Australia whose interests they are supposed to represent, and, unfortunately, the people of Australia are to suffer. The Opposition wish to know whether the Government intend to remove Mr Allard from the board, or whether they propose to allow this scandal to continue. Under paragraph v. of clause 3 of the agreement the Government have ample power to remove Mr Allard from the board of directors, and we want to know why they do not propose to do so."" It is provided in th© paragraph in question thatThe directors nominated by and representing the Commonwealth shall need no other qualification, and shall not be subject to any disqualification or to removal by the company, and shall not be subject to periodical retirement, but shall hold office subject to the pleasure of the Commonwealth, which may from time to time retire them and make new appointments. It will thus be seen that the Commonwealth Government have power to remove Mr Allard, or any of their representatives on the Board at any time they please. They have not power, however, to remove Sir Thomas Hughes. may go to law in the effort to do so, - but their attitude in connection with the Kidman-Mayoh shipping contract suggests that they are not very brave where litigation is concerned. The same conclusion may he drawn from their action in connection with the payment of compensation for inferior flour sent to South Africa. There again we have another scandal with which this House must deal if the interests of the taxpayers are to be protected. . We shall give these matters the fullest publicity. We shall see that the publio are made aware of all the facts, so that they may be in a position to determine whether the Government should continue to have their confidence.",71
355,Mr FENTON,METEOROLOGICAL,Is it suggested that Sir Thomas Hughes is likely to retire as a result of this debate?,73
356,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not think he will. There are supporters of the Government who have urged that we should repudiate the agreement. That, in my opinion, would be neither wise nor honourable. There should be no talk of repudiation. If some one has to suffer, let it be the Government. They are the responsible parties, and should carry the opprobrium, attaching to the execution the agreement. Are the Government afraid to accept responsibility for it ? Is it for them to seek to throw the responsibility on the Crown Law officers or the Courts of this country? If the Government attempt to repudiate the agreement, I venture to say that they will find themselves involved in costly litigation, and will be beaten. In refusing to agree to the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, they have not a leg to stand on.",73
357,Mr LISTER,METEOROLOGICAL,Her e we have the opinion of another lawyer!,73
358,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"I do not claim to he a lawyer, but even lawyers differ, and often with costly results to their clients. There is no excuse for attemptiug to repudiate the agreement. If it was badly drawn, then t i e blame should be placed upon the Government. It is upon them alone that the responsibility must rest. If this scheme were proceeded with, and proved a gigantic success, does any one think that the Prime Minister would say that the credit for it belonged to Parliament? Not at all. In such cirThey stances, he would say, "" The credit is wholly mine. Alone I did it . "" But when transactions of a fishy character are brought to light, he tries to shelter himself behind either a Parliamentary Committee or the House. He cracks the party whip over the backs of his supporters, and they fall - in behind him like a team of working bullocks. I would remind those honourable members who talk one way and vote another that it is by their votes the people will judge them. They may denounce the agreement, but it is by their votes that their attitude with respect to it will be determined. It is with that object in view that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has submitted' the amendment. We desire to line up honourable members opposite and to show the people of Australia whether or not they stand for this corruption-for these suspicious transactions, and for what have been described by some of them as "" these criminal acts."" No word has been too severe for some of them to use in condemnation of the agreement, yet wben we proceed to a division on the amendment we shall find them voting again with the Government.  of the caning which the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has had!",73
359,Mr CUNNINGHAM,METEOROLOGICAL,"We can only assume that the caning which has been administered to the honourable member Kooyong has been promised every other supporter of the Government who dares vote against the agreement, and that fear and trembling they will come to They know that unless they do so the wellwere springs from which their campaign funds are drawn will dry up. How independent honourable members opposite are! They condemn the agreement and everything connected with it, and yet when they asked to follow up their denunciations voting for this amendment they refuse do so. Surely, in view of their condemnapersuaded tion of the agreement, they should be pared to vote against the Government sponsible for it, so that we may have new Administration. What a lot of competents they must be if they have go on standing by the Prime Minister, who in connection with great matters of public concern in which millions of pounds are involved has shown, again again, that he has not mastered even first principles of business practice! appear to be afraid to attempt to form new Administration from amongst themceptance. selves. As the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) has pointed out, the Government were defeated the Labour party could not carry on, so that it would remain for honourable members opposite either to form a new Administration to face the people of Australia and give an account of their stewardship. They appear to be afraid to do either of things. Some of them have condemned this agreement in the strongest terms, yet they will vote against the amendthere ment and to uphold this scheme of corruption, and the suspicious practices connected with what some supporters the Government have referred to as "" this scheme of criminality."" They are ment. voting against the best interests people of Australia. If this state of fairs continues Parliament will fall into the agreement. disrepute, and people lose faith in it an institution for the safeguarding their interests. They can come to no other conclusion, so I warn honourable members opposite that their vote on this issue is of supreme significance, because it may help to destroy utterly all faith in the parliamentary machine in Auswe tralia. [28]  have sat here for about three days listenfor ing to honourable members speaking on this subject, and I want them to listen te to me for about three minutes. In the first in place I want to hark back to December heel. last when, amongst other measures that hurried through, there was this wireless agreement. I was persuaded that the life and death of the Commonwealth depended upon the acceptance or rejection of this agreement. Hitherto I have had are a great deal of confidence in the astuteby ness of the right honourable gentleman to leading the Government, and I was almost to accept the agreement, owing preto the urgency of the matter, and seeing rethat the company concerned was a British a company, in no way associated with any inforeign concern. Nevertheless, I voted, to that the agreement should be submitted to a Committee for consideration and acceptance. Up to a certain point that Committee, which wa9 a representative body, and did good work. They have reported, in the effect, that they have discarded alThey most in to to the agreement which had a been so hurriedly recommended for acI t appears that they handed over their finding as a Committee to a if sub-Committee for final drafting, and I understand they did not thoroughly examine the final draft before signing it , and comparing it with their own notes. or Quite a number of members of the Committee have intimated that they really thought that provision had been made these for an independent chairman. The Government, disappointed apparently that there is no such provision, find that is no possibility of getting Sir Thomas Hughes out of the position. This is a serious matter, Sir Thomas Hughes of having got into his position against the .spirit and intention of the agreeThe amendment submitted by of the the honourable member for Batman af- (Mr Brennan) is not. a violation of I note that the three as directors to represent the Commonwealth of are removable at any time at the will of the Government. This is where I see some virtue in the amendment, particularly in view of the fact that the chairman, who is not an independent man, cannot be shifted. If we feel that are not safe with only those members on the board representing the company, there is in clause 12, which provides that the Government representatives must approve in' certain contracts, a certain protection. This amendment by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) would enable the House to direct its representatives on such matters. If they do not act on such direction we may take the first opportunity to remove them from office. This is a safeguard which I would not emphasize if Sir Thomas Hughes were not associated with the former company, or if he would relinquish his position and make room for an independent chairman. But he is sitting tight. am going to sit tight also, and vote for the amendment, so that we may have an opportunity in this House to control those directors appointed on our behalf. Mr MAHONY: (Dalley) .[11,28] - I should like the Minister to agree to an adjournment of the debate.",74
360,Mr MASSYGREENE,METEOROLOGICAL,No .,75
361,Mr MAHONY,METEOROLOGICAL,"This is a very i m portant matter, involving £500,000 of publio money, and to say the least, it is indecent to rush it through. The trouble we have been landed in is the result of the attitude adopted by the supporters of the Government in their desire to accept every ill-digested scheme that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) chooses to put before the House. The agreement, in the first place, was ill-considered, but honourable members sitting behind the Government were almost falling over themselves in their haste to accept it , with a result that there is every probability of half-amillion of public money being absolutely squandered. The case for delay is very strong. We have only to consider the opinions of the agreement expressed by honourable members who usually support the Government. One honourable member described the agreement as fishy, another described it as being criminal, another said that it was rotten, another said that it was questionable, another alluded to it as a serious matter, another stigmatized itas being corrupt, still another referred to it as smellful. These are the terms used by honourable members in describing an agreement in which £500,000 of public money is at stake.
