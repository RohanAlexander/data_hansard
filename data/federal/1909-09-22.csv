1,Mr JOHNSON,WANSTEAD AND SOUTH BELMORE,"the Postmaster. General, upon notice(1) Whether it should not be the settled policy of the Postal Department to afford all reasonable facilities to the public tax the delivery of their letters within a radius of i o miles from the General Post Office, Sydney? (a) Is he aware that great inconvenience - is caused to residents of Wanstead and South Belmore (suburbs within i o miles of Sydney, and connected by railway) through non-letter-delivery by carrier j and that complaints regarding the same made to the Department have not elicited satisfactory replies? (3) If it is not practicable to extend the existing boundaries of beats covered by the letter carriers, without unduly increasing the work of those carriers or delaying delivery, as at present arranged, will he make provision on the Estimates (main or supplementary) for the appointment of additional carriers? (4) Will he have special inquiry made into the causes of complaint embodied in the letters of Mr Holford, honorary secretary, Wanstead Progress Association, dated 20th August, 1909, and Mr Â£ . Faulkner, of Bonds-road, South Belmore, dated 14th .September, 1009, and now in his possession? (5) With reference to the representations of the postmaster at Peakhurst, New South Wales, and also Mr Burchcr, regarding the inconvenience arising from inability to get telephonic communication after 8 p.m.,' and on Sundays, in case of illness or other emergency, will he issue instructions to the Department to have the telephone at Peakhurst made available at all times, and give similar instructions regarding other telephones in the Illawarra suburban districts?",14
2,Sir JOHN QUICK,WANSTEAD AND SOUTH BELMORE,"-The answers to the honourable member's questions arex. The policy and practice of the Department is to afford all reasonable facilities to the public in delivering their mail matter within a radius of 10 miles from the General Post Office, Sydney. However, in localities which are very thinly populated, and where the amount of correspondence does not justify it , letter-carriers are not employed. a. I am not aware, and the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, reported as follows in the matter :It is not known that great inconvenience is caused residents of Wanstead through non-delivery by letter-carrier, as dents already enjoy the convenience of two deliveries daily from the Marrickville Post-office; ono completed about 10.30 in the' forenoon, and the ether at 5 vn the afternoon. Complaints were made of late delivery, and the matter was investigated and improvements were effected in the mail arrangements, with .the result that residents of Marrickville and Wanstead .now receive their correspondence much earlier. Provision has been made in the Estimates for the appointment of an additional letter-carrier, which will enable an additional beat to be created and still DEPARTMENT. earlier delivery effected. With regard LETTER to South Belmore, portions of this locality are now served once daily,. viz., . ih the forenoon by letter-carrier attached to the Canterbury office. A petition was presented by certain residents of Canary-road, 'South Belmore, on the i8th February last, requesting postal .delivery by letter-carrier. An inspector visited the locality and made inquiries and found that to grant the request, and also serve other portions (of the locality, it would be necessary to appoint an additional letter-carrier, provisions for which - has been made on the 1909-10 Estimates. When this is done, the present delivery will be extended, and Mr E. Faulkner and other residents within half a mile of the pre. sent boundary will be served by letter carrier every forenoon. 3. See answer to No. a. 4. Such inquiry is now in progress. 5. The Deputy-Postmaster-General, Sydney, reports as follows: The proposal re Peakhurst cannot be car. ried out under present conditions, and it will be necessary, in order to grant' the facility asked for, tn erect about 2^ miles of metallic circuit line on existing |>oles between Kogarah and Hurstville, and before incurring this expenditure, it wil l be necessary to ascertain whether the special circumstances of the case justify it, and whether arrangements can be made for a person to attend to the instrument at night and ou Sunday. This matter, and also the granting of similar concessions to other telephones in the Illawarra suburban districts, is now being inquired into. Full consideration will be given to the matter on completion of - the inquiries referred to. STATE DEBTS.",14
3,Mr CROUCH,WANSTEAD AND SOUTH BELMORE,"the Treasurer, upon notice(1) Whether in his proposal to take over the State debts he intends to include municipal debts? (2) Are there not many debts, such as water supply and sewerage debts, which are included in the State debts of New South Wales, but which. in Victoria and other States have been charged to local .bodies? (3) 'Where it is possible to distinguish these ' resi- local debts, will he see that such debts in each State are similarly treated, and given the advantages which will probably arise from Commonwealth management?",14
4,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANSTEAD AND SOUTH BELMORE,"In reply to the honourable member, I beg to state1. Not unless the municipal debts are State public debts. 2. Yes; there are some. 3. The Constitution provides for State public debts only. OLD-AGE PENSIONS. PAYMENT AT POST OFFICES. Mr JOHN THOMSON Treasurer, upon notice Whether, in view of the inability of pensioners resident in scattered parts of country districts to reach post-offices where pensions are now payable, will he extend the number ot such offices and make it possible for pensions to be remitted to persons not within reach of same?",15
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANSTEAD AND SOUTH BELMORE,"If any specific cases are brought under notice, the Commissioner will be glad to do his best to so arrange.",15
6,Mr THOMAS BROWN,WANSTEAD AND SOUTH BELMORE,"the Treasurer, upon notice(1) Has his attention been called to the fact that in country districts old-age pensioners are put to great inconvenience and expense by reason of pensions being made payable at post offices only which are also money order offices? (2) Will he consider and consult the conveni""euce of such aged and infirm people by arranging for payments at post-offices for their purposes, irrespective of whether they are money order offices or not?",15
7,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANSTEAD AND SOUTH BELMORE,"The to the honourable member's questions are1. My attention has not been called to such cases. 2. Payments are not restricted to money order offices. If there are any. specific cases in which a more convenient post-office could be selected for payment, it could, I think, be easily arranged. Such changes to meet the convenience of pensioners are frequently made. NA - Mr HUTCHISON (for Mr ROBERTS). asked the Minister of Defence, upon notice- .1. Who, in. addition to Major-General - are members of the Commonwealth section of Imperial General Military Staff? 2. What are the duties of each member, other than Major-General Hoad?",15

9,Mr MCDOUGALL,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"the Prime most convenient Minister, upon notice I. Whether his attention has been drawn to the following statement, which appeared in Tuesanswers day's issue of the Age:"" Although the advantages of Victoria as a place for settlers have been published throughout the world, the Victorian Lands Department is considerably embarassed when immigrants who have taken us at our word arrive and ask for some of the land that is awaiting settlers. The Department had such an experience yesterday, when seven Russians were led to the Lands Office. They had been farmers in Siberia. At Tomsk they had read about Australia-that settlers were wanted, and that the Government STAFF. would find land for good agriculturists. So they sold their farms in Siberia, travelled across China with their wives and' children, and took ship to Melbourne.""?' 2. If he has noticed the statement referred to ,' Hoad, does he propose to take action to compel the the States to provide land for immigrants allured, to Australia by Commonwealth advertisements? 3. If he cannot compel the States to find land for such immigrants, does he intend to continuethe policy of inviting them to the Commonwealth by advertisement?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The answer to the D.S.O. : honourable member's question is:1, 2, and 3.'Yes, and also to the further state of ments appearing today to the effect that land Genehas been found for the Russian farmers referred to; part of an area the remainder of which is still open for other settlers. The Commonwealth advertisements contain no statements regarding land except on the authority of information supplied by the State Government. BOER WAR: GRAVES OF AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS.",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"-On 3rd August, the might honourable member for Moreton, speaking upon the motion for the adjournment of not be justified. the House, drew attention to a paragraph reprinted in the Brisbane Daily Mail from a Sydney newspaper, in which it was stated that a traveller in South Africa had seen a number of small crosses, with the inscription, "" Here lies a British Soldier,"" piled up against the side of a smithy, near - I ' move the burial-ground, and was informed, on inquiry, that they were sent to South Mr. Africa by the Australian Government, to be placed at the heads of the The editor of the Daily Mail was asked for further particulars, but did not reply. 4. letter has now been received from R. Campbell MCEwan, the honorary graves secretary of the Guild of the Loyal Women of South Africa, with extracts from the Rand Daily Mail in explanation, which briefly, as follows:'-After the conclusion of hostilities, the Guild of Loyal Women called for tenders for the erection of iron crosses over the graves of those who fell on the British side during the war. The tender of Mr J. Mallet, of Krugersdorp, was accepted. The Government of New South Wales sent ^150 to the Guild for erecting monuments on the graves of thirty men from New South Wales buried in the Transvaal. These were made, with the' inscription-, "" Erected by the vernment of New South Wales,"" and sent to the different parts for erection-si x Middleburg, where there was some delay in carrying out the work. commanding the Royal Engineers of that district, seeing that some of the graves the cemetery had no crosses-thoug h these were all ready in the stores-determine d that every grave should have a cross before the military left the place, and had them made, and put up. This resulted in crosses being returned to the contractor, Mr Mallet, for storing. It has been decided that the six crosses provided . by' the Government of New South Wales shall be erected on the graves for which they were intended, in addition cross erected by the military. It is stated by Lt - Colonel Bottomley, of Krugerssessional dorp, that he did not believe there was a suspended order single Australian's grave in South Africa over which some memorial had not been placed. He said that the Guild had done excellent work in keeping the graves iii order-wor k for which they deserved credit and encouragement. He also added that the duplications which had occurred have arisen, owing to clerical errors, but that any suggestion of neglect could DISSENT FROM RULING. SUSPENSION - OF STANDING ORDERS.",16
12,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"West Sydney) [2.38]. That this House dissents from the ruling of Speaker, that the motion of the Prime Minister for the suspension of the Standing Orders was a motion within the meaning of graves. Standing Orders 407 and 409. I regard your decision of yesterday, sir, as most important, and, if you will perMrs mit me to say so, as quite wrong. I do not know whether you realized to what extent the existence of the House as a deliberative body is dependent upon the is, Standing Orders. Without them, orderly procedure and the proper conduct of debate are impossible. Standing orders are essential to the representation of minorities ; and all Legislatures have recognised this - In the end, of course, the majority must rule. I take no exception to that. A minority has its rights, but these must have their limits; public business must be the proceeded with, and a minority must in the end give way to the majority. But the suspension of the Standing Orders is Goonly to be justified by special circumstances, just as the suspension of the civil to law and the substitution of military rule is justified only in times of emergency. The officer We know that when a disturbed state of public affairs has existed in Ireland and in elsewhere it has sometimes been found necessary to suspend the habeas corpus, to substitute a military for the civil tribunal, and practically to deprive citizens of the charter of their liberties. But that course 83 has never been adopted-excep t when the state of public affairs was so disturbed as now to make its adoption imperative-withou t the reasons for so grave a step being clearly put forward, or, at any rate, a colourable attempt made to justify the proposed action. to the Standing order 407 readsIn cases of urgent necessity, any standing or or orders of the House may be for the day's sitting, on motion, duly moved and seconded, without notice; provided that such motion is carried by an absolute majority of the whole number of the members of the House. I maintain that that standing order bears the same relation to our Parliamentary procedure as section 128 of the Constitution bears to the Constitution itself. all laws other than those specified in that section of the Constitution, may be passed by an ordinary majority, the laws in question require the assent of an absolute majority of this House. Similarly, a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders without notice must, in accordance with standing order 407, be carried by an absolute majority of the whole of the members of the House. What do we gather from the exposition of that condition? suspension of the Standing Orders without notice should be resorted to only under the rarest circumstances, and when the necessity for so doing has been clearly established. What was the position yesterday? I cannot recall a set of circumstances which displayed fewer of the conditions necessary-^ ",16
13,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"There is a good deal of conversation going on in the Chamber, so that it is almost impossible for me to hear what is being said, and, of course, the matter under consideration is one in which the Chair is vitally interested. also to direct the attention of the honourable member for West Sydney to the fact that he must confine his remarks to the ruling which I gave yesterday and to reasons why that ruling should be dissented from. The circumstances \yhich led up to it have nothing whatever to do with the ruling itself. My decision was based upon the standing order, and the honourable member is therefore entitled to deal with that standing order and with any other standing order which affects my ruling, but he is not entitled to deal with matters which have no bearing at all upon that ruling.",17
14,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I shall endeavour to confine my remarks to the limits you have jection, suggested. It is quite impossible, howdebate ever, to avoid making incidental the circumstances connected with the suspension of the Standing Orders yesterday. The circumstances for which it was sought to suspend those orders had none of elements of urgency about them. A promotion. posal to suspend the Standing Orders was submitted by the Prime Minister, into permit of the second reading of fence Bill being moved. It cannot be argued that that was an urgent matter, because the second reading of the Bill could have been moved today in the ordinary course of events.",17
15,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,It was urgent that it Whereas should be dealt with then.,17
16,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The second reading of the measure might have been moved at any time during the past six weeks. There is absolutely nothing in the Bill-as you, sir, know very well-whic h was in any way contingent upon the Imperial Defence Conference, or upon anything exterior to this Government itself.",17
17,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Order . I take it that the honourable member is perfectly That the aware of the point of order which he raised yesterday, and I would point out to him that it has nothing whatever to do with the question of urgency.",17
18,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If the point is whether you, sir, were right in ruling that you were not called upon to ask the Prime Minister-wh o moved the suspension of the Standing Orders-to show that it was urgent that that course should be adopted, surely I am permitted 7",17
19,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable member is now proceeding to debate a matter which was settled yesterday afternoon, and I wish which cannot be discussed at this juncture ---that is the question of urgency.",17
20,Mr BATCHELOK,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,It must be debated at some time or other.,17
21,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If you, sir, will look at my motion, you will see that the question has not been settled.. I must respectfully decline to allow you to.say what my motion means, by references to sources other than the motion itself. The Votes and Proceedings of this House for yesterday readA point of order having been raised, and Mr. Speaker having ruled that the motion of the Prime Minister for the suspension of the Standing Orders was a motion within the meaning of standing orders 407-409, Mr Hughes took obin writing, to the ruling, and motion being moved to dissent from the ruling, the thereon was forthwith adjourned to the reference to next sitting day. I must respectfully decline to allow you, sir, to interpret my motion in a way that the does not accord with the words of that",17
22,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I think that there ought order to be an independent man in the chair the Dewhen this motion is being debated.,17
23,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Unde r the words of my motion, I am perfectly entitled to show that, understanding orders 407 and 409, your decision, sir, was wrong in every particular.",18
24,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable member is aware-as every other honourable member must be who has had Parliamentary experience-that questions which have once been debated and determined cannot be re-opened on a future date. question is settled in a way that an honourable member regards as being unfair, that honourable member may dissent from the ruling of the Chair at that time, but he is not justified in dissenting from it at a subsequent period. The point of order which the honourable member raised yesterday is adequately reported in the official record of the House, and has nothing whatever to do with the question of urgency. I do not know whether the honourable member has reviewed the speech he.made when raising his point of order, but, if he has done so, I think he will agree with me that no portion of if refers to the question of urgent necessity, which ""had already been settled by the Chair, whose decision had been accepted by the House.",18
25,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,It was only accepted under protest.,18
26,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"There was no prorest made. I would ask the honourable member for Adelaide to do what I think every other honourable member should do upon an occasion of this k nd, namely, to assist the Chair and the House in arriving at a correct conclusion. I cannot allow the honourable member to say that any decision of the Chair was accepted under protest if that protest merely took the form of a mental reservation on the part of honourable members. The only protest of which the Chair can take cognisance is that which is made by way of a formal motion.",18
27,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"You now take it upon yourself, sir, to decide that I had in my mind, in submitting my motion, something different from the meaning that can be drawn from the words of the motion. With all respect, I say that, in the discussion of this most important question, you are attempting to tie me down in a way that we should have been very glad to see you follow when the motion moved by the Prime Minister was before you, but which you then declined to do. We asked you then to interpret the Standing Orders strictly. Instead of doing so, you replied, in effect, "" It is not for me to ask the Prime Minister for reasons. It is sufficient for me that the honourable gentleman says that, in his opinion, the question is one of urgency."" When I question your ruling on that point, you meet me by saying that the matter does not fall within the terms of my motion. I decline to admit that that is so. I hold that it does fall within the If a terms of my motion, and I claim the right to discuss it. It will be for you, sir, to decide afterwards whether or not my reasoning is right, and whether you propose to follow what is suggested; but I most certainly claim the right to discuss the point. I shall be most reluctant tobelieve that, .having allowed the Prime Minister a latitude which, within my knowledge, has never been permitted in similar circumstances to any honourable member in this House, you are now prepared to say, when I question your ruling, "" What the honourable member for West Sydney's motion means is so-and-so. His motion does not mean what he says it does.""' That, I submit, is an entirely wrong attitude to take up.",18
28,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I am loth to enter into a discussion with an' honourable member, but am very anxious that no honourable member should feel that his rights are unduly restricted by the Chair.",18
29,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,That was the feeling yesterday.,18
30,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If that was done yes: terday, exception should have been taken to it then, and not today. Let me state the position to the honourable member for West Sydney. A ruling was sought on a certain point, and was given. Subsequently, the honourable member rose to another point of order, and made to the Chair a statement upon which he desired a ruling. A ruling was given,' and the honourable member then formally dissented from it. The honourable member now desires to discuss a question which was brought before the Chair previously by another honourable member, and was settled without any notice of dissent being given. I trust that the honourable member will recognise that if I allowed him at this juncture to discuss a ruling given prior to that as to which he gave notice of dissent, almost any ruling might be debated on this motion, on the ground that it happened to come within the scope of the standing order in question. The honourable member based his point of order on the one contention that no proper motion had been. stated by the Prime Minister when proposing the suspension of the Standing Orders; and that is the question which I expected him to deal with today. I hope that the honourable member will see that if I were to permit him to discuss matters other than the specific question which he raised, I should open the door to what might be an almost endless discussion upon the effect of - the Standing Orders generally.",18
31,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Do you rule, Mr. Speaker, that if an honourable member rises to a point of order which you deal with, and, later on, another honourable member raises a wider point of order, containing potentially, not only that which has been dealt with by you, but something more, he is precluded from referring to the ground covered, but not exhausted, by the smaller point of order ? I do not think that you will. I said that the motion moved by the Prime Minister had not been properly stated, and I now contend that my point of order was as shown in the Votes and Proceedings. The point that I raised was that the motion in question was not a motion within the meaning of standing orders 407 and 409, and I submit that I am entitled to discuss every one of the limitations set down in those Standing Orders. Standing order 403' provides thatThe suspension of Standing Orders is limited in its operation to the particular purpose for which such suspension has been sought. Under standing order 407there are three essentials to a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders without notice. In the first place it must be a case of urgent necessity. Secondly, the motion must be"" duly made and seconded,"" and, thirdly, it must be carried by an absolute majority. The last point is a question for the House to determine. The second is for you to decide. The Clerk records the motion, and you note it. I hold that I can discuss any one of the circumstances dealt with in standing order 409 as well as those covered by standing order 407, and that the fact that the honourable member for Boothby raised a question as to the motion being in order does not preclude me from also raising it. Will you say, for instance, that I am not at liberty to discuss the question whether the motion was duly made and seconded? If my motion is so wide as to cover all these matters, and' is properly before the Chair, it is not for you to say to what extent it is limited other than by the limitations of the motion itself. I submit that the motion permits me to discuss the whole question.",19
32,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I rule that the honourable member will not be in order in discussing any matter except the specific point of order which he brought before the Chair. For the honourable member's information I will read the Hansard report of his own words when he brought the question before the Chair. He saidBut understanding order 409, the suspension must be limited in its operation to the particular purpose for which it has been sought, and I submitNow comes the honourable member's submission of his point of orderthat no particular purpose has been mentioned by the Prime Minister. Consequently no motion understanding order 407 is before the House, and no question can be put as a result of the carrying of the motion "" That the question be now put."" There is, therefore, nothing before the Chamber, and if the Prime Minister wishes to bring the question before the Chamber, he must limit the operation of the motion which he moves understanding order 407 to the specific purpose for which it is required as directed by standing order 409. That is the honourable member's own statement of his point of order, and I ask him to confine his remarks to it.",19
33,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Wit h all due deference to you, sir, I care not what were the mere words I used, I am concerned only with their meaning. I submit that I am bound by the motion now before the Chair. If you are to be the arbiter-if you are to decide what this motion is- - :",19
34,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,'Commo n sense is the arbiter of that.,19
35,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Commo n sense !,19
36,Mr JH CATTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I rise to a point of order. I submit that'the Prime Minister is not in order in cheering the Speaker when a ruling is being given.,19
37,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Cheering !,19
38,Mr JH CATTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I submit that the - practice of honourable members, in cheering and passing remarks in support of the Speaker when a ruling is being dissented from, is one that ought not to be followed. Mr SPEAKER.^-I agree with the honourable member; and I might be permitted to say that reflections which are made in an undertone on the Tuling of the Chair, should also not be made.",19
39,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,What a virtuous crowd we are !,19
40,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Order ! I ask honourable members generally to show that consideration to which the Chair is entitled, and without which, of course, the business of the House cannot foe proceeded with. The position has been made one of greater difficulty than, perhaps, it ought to have been, and it can only be brought to a successful conclusion by honourable members giving to it that attention which its importance demands.",19
41,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I am exceedingly sorry, Mr Speaker, that you will not permit the discussion of this question on its merits, but are seeking to insist on a narrow and rigid interpretation of the rules of debate, when the very question under discussion is your power to receive without the exercise of discretion a motion to suspend the whole of the Standing Orders. The Prime Minister just noAv said that common sense was to be the arbiter, but I venture to say that the arbiter is now a servile majority, carrying out the behests of a caucus, under circumstances absolutely destructive of every sound principle of responsible government- a majority dragooned by a caucus composed of members united on no principle Mr SPEAKER:-What has this to do with the question? I ask the honourable member to address himself to the matter before the Chair.",20
42,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Well , sir, I do not propose to allow the Prime Minister or anybody else to interject, and, under shelter of your ruling, to do a thing which is cowardly and contemptible",20
43,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Will the honourable member tike his seat? I have not heard anything which would justify the language which the honourable member is now using. If I had, I can assure the honourable member I should have taken steps to have the objectionable words withdrawn. I ask the honourable member not to use language which in itself is unbecoming of him and of this Chamber.",20
44,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"You are misunderstanding me, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister has been enabled to do a cowardly and contemptible thing, absolutely destructive of the fundamental principles of Parliamentary government ; and",20
45,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable member must not use expressions of that sort. I ask the honourable member to withdraw the words ""cowardly"" and ""contemptible,"" which should not be applied to an honourable member of this House.",20

48,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I do not mind !,20
49,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"It does not matter whether the Prime Minister minds or not; the question is one which, rests in the discretion of the Chair, and I ask the honourable member for West Sydney to withdraw words whicji ought not to be applied to a member of this House.",20
50,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I feel that the words I have used are perfectly justifiable undertlie circumstances.,20
51,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable member, as an old and experienced member of Parliament, and an ex-Minister of the Crown, knows perfectly well that such words cannot be allowed by the Chair, and I ask the honourable member to withdraw them.",20
52,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Well , I withdraw the word ""cowardly,"" but the word ""contemptible"" is, I think, perfectly justified, and I ought not to be asked to withdraw it",20
53,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order !,20
54,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I am net permitted to discuss a matter of first importance to the country and to this House.,20

56,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,No ; I cannot withdraw that.,20

58,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Will the honourable member take his seat ? I shall be placed in a position which I do not desire to occupy if the honourable member still persists in disregarding the instruction which has been issued from the Chair. The honourable member knows perfectly well that, although an instruction from the Chair may be, in his opinion, of a somewhat tyrannical nature, it has always been the custom to bow to the ruling of the Chair; and I ask the honourable member not to persist in refusing to do so on this occasion.",20
59,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"No , Mr Speaker. I should be very glad to do so if I had been permitted to discuss the matter fairly; but I feel that I have' been most unjustly treated, and that the House has been most unjustly treated.",20

I ask the honourable member to be good enough to withdraw the word to which I have taken objection.",21
64,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,On a point of order,21
65,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I cannot take a point of order now.,21
66,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Do I understand that Mr Speaker asks the honourable member to withdraw the word ""contemptible""?",21
67,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order !,21
68,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The word "" contemptible"" has often been used in the House before.",21
69,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Many times; good English word.,21
70,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I point out to honourable members that the course some of them are pursuing is not likely to help matters. I ask honourable members to recollect that they are virtually doing what I have asked the honourable member for West Sydney not to do; and I hope they will not persist. I again appeal to the honourable member for West Sydney to hold the Chair in that regard in which I feel sure he does hold it , and under the circumstances, to withdraw a word which the Chair considers is not fitting.",21
71,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I put my view as well as I could, but I am not permitted to explain or to set forth the circumstances. Although I have always been a hard fighter here, I think that you, Mr Speaker, will say that I have never used any language which, where it transgressed the limits to debate set by our Standing Orders, I have not been ready enough to withdraw. But when I see the Prime Minister practically suspending the Constitution of this assembly, and flouting us without a tittle tend that. Of excuse, I feel that his conduct is contemptible, and I cannot help saying so.",21
72,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I point out to the honourable member that it is not now question of the Prime Minister's conduct, but a question of the direction of the Chair. I agree with what the honourable member has said; during my occudo, pancy of this position I have always had the readiest and most loyal support from the honourable member. Perhaps have been tempted to go further on that account than I should otherwisfe have done. I ask the honourable member now to do what the Chair has requested him to do, because he knows that it must be most distasteful to the occupant of the chair to be placed in the position in which I shall be placed later on, if he refuses to comply with my request.",21
73,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Well , Mr Speaker, if you put the matter in that way, you put it unfairly.",21
74,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order !,21
75,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If you will allow me to do so,. when you state that my remark was a reflection upon the Chair, or upon the House, I must dissent from your statement. I do not regard it so. It was not intended to be so, nor was it . The House and the country know very well the reason why I made the statement. The circumstances it is a are perfectly clear. They do not permit of any misinterpretation. I say, with all deference to you, therefore, that while T am very anxious to show my respect for the Chair-and I hope that I have always done so while you have been there, as well as during the regime of your illustrious predecessor-still , I feel that a protest must be made. You will not allow me to discuss the matter in such a way as to permit of that protest being made effectually. The Prime Minister is able, by controlling the forms of this House, to get any decision from the Chair that he pleases, by reason .of the fact that he has at his back a subservient majority. We have no such opportunity. Under these circumstances, I feel that I should . be doing a wrong in the interests of the minority if I were to withdraw the word.",21
76,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I understood the honourable member to say just now that he did not intend his remark as a reflection upon the House.,21
77,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I certainly did not in,21
78,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I feel myself to be, as I have previously stated, the custodian of the personal honour of this House and of every member of it. Perhaps, as I a have already said, I place too high a value upon the dignity of this House and upon the dignity of our proceedings. But I feel that I have done all that I ' can and all that the occupant of this chair could be expected to do, in regard to the incident. I have asked the honorI able member to do something which he is not inclined to do. I therefore have no recourse now but to ask the Leader of the House to do whatever may be considered necessary. My first unpleasant duty is to name the honourable member. I ask him whether he desires to place me in the position of using the last resource that is open to me? I again ask the honourable member whether, in deference to the desire of the Chair, he desires to withdraw a word which the Chair considers should riot he applied to an honourable member of this House.",21
79,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"No , Mr Speaker; I . decline to do so.",22
80,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I name the honourable member for West Sydney, Mr Hughes, for consistent and persistent disregard of the direction of the Chair to withdraw a word that was considered disorderly.",22
81,Mr DEAKI N,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Ballarat-Prime ' Minister) [3.14]-- Mr Speaker, this is no occasion for honourable members opposite to endeavour to make political capital. The honourable member for West Sydney said in my hearing-thoug h not, I am afraid, in your hearing-that he did not intend to cast any personal reflection upon any member of this House. . Mr HUGHES - Certainly ; I say that I made no reflection upon the honourable gentleman personally. He knows that I would not do such a thing. His personal character outside politics is not in question. The remark which I made was intended to be a criticism upon his tactics as the head of the Ministry.'",22
82,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I was afraid, Mr. Speaker, that you did not hear the honourable member's statement that the word objected to was applied by him to the tactics of the Ministry, and was not applied to any honourable member of this House personally. Certainly his remark in no sense had relation to any action of the Chair. Under the circumstances, although perfectly, prepared to discharge my duty, and that without the slightest hesitation, it appears to me that there has been a misunderstanding, and a serious one. The word used as applied to tactics, has a different meaning and relation. If the honourable member's statement in that regard did not reach your ears, Mr Speaker, perhaps he will state on his feet what he has just repeated from his seat.",22
83,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I say, Mr Speaker, that what the Prime Minister has said is true enough. My language and criticism were directed, of course, against the tactics of the Government in general and the Prime Minister in particular, for all of which the Prime Minister himself must bear the blame.",22
84,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Hear , hear.",22
85,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"During the whole of the discussion-whic h might almost be called a debate-betwee n myself and the honourable member for West Sydney, I used the words "" personal reflection "" over and over again. I certainly was under the impression that the word which I ruled to be disorderly was applied personally to a member of this House. I think that I used an expression to that effect more than once. I now learn for the first time, both from the Prime Minister and from the honourable member, that the disorderly expression was not applied to a member of this House personally. Under these circumstances, I can only say that I regret that I have misunderstood the honourable member; and I desire to express my regret in the hearing of the whole House. Perhaps, before the incident closes, honourable members will pardon me for saying that they might assist the Chair very materially by allowing such matters as have now been brought before us to be discussed in that calm and dispassionate manner without which we cannot hope to conduct our deliberations to a satisfactory conclusion. I earnestly hope that, while all honourable members desire that the Standing Orders which govern cur procedure shall be observed, they will, at the same time, recognise that the rights and privileges of any individual member must not be infringed. The interrupted proceedings will now be resumed.",22
86,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I have every desire to comply with the direction of the Chair that this matter should be discussed in the way that you, sir, wish it to be discussed. But I also desired that the whole of the matters which I wished to discuss should be so treated under cover of my motion. However, you have ruled that that cannot be done, and unless I formally dissent from that ruling, I hardly know what I am to do. But I do say that you, Mr Speaker, have discretion in this matter, and you alone. There is not the slightest doubt that, in the case of a formal dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling, the grounds of objection must be put in writing forthwith. But, at the, same time, it is for you to say what latitude is to be allowed to an honourable member'in discussing the motion of dissent. opinion, the Standing Orders ought not to be suspended, unless the case be so exceptional as practically to commend itself at once almost to every member of the House. Everybody knows that the tactics pursued - by the Prime Minister were not adopted as an eleventh hour suggestion. What he did was a premeditated thing.",22
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,That is absolutely incorrect.,23
88,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Ge t out.,23
89,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order .,23
90,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Of course, Mr. Speaker, there are other Standing Orders, arid I shall have to ask that I may be protected, at any rate sufficiently to enable my throat to serve me until I have said what I desire to submit. I repeat that this step was premeditated, and I shall prove that in one minute. There were thirty-nine members here, including some who had not been here since an early period of this session. Members had to break public engagements in order to get here.",23
91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"On e of them broke a pair, too.",23
92,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The whole thing was cut and dried.,23
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,No .,23
94,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The whole thing, I repeat, was cut and dried.",23
95,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"On a point of order, sir, I ask whether the honourable member is within your ruling in discussing the way at which a late majority was arrived at over this matter.",23
96,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,He is speaking the truth any way ,23
97,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I am sure that he is not.,23
98,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I will prove that he is.,23
99,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order . ' Mr BATCHELOR - It needs no proof.,23
100,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable member for Parkes has raised a point of order as to whether the remarks of the honourable member are now within the scope of his motion. I ask the latter to confine his remarks to the question of dissent from my ruling and not to refer to matters which have no relevancy to that question.,23
101,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Mr Speaker. I shall do my very best to confine my remarks to . the question,23
102,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable perly stated. member is confining himself within the ing too.,23
103,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Order . In my Mr HUGHES - But a great issue is involved. Am I to be kept to the very words of standing order 409 and not to be permitted to wander outside it? I claim the ordinary latitude which is permitted to honourable members in this chamber. Mr. Speaker, you know very well that two minutes do not pass in this House without the Standing Orders being broken by interjections. I claim exactly the same privilege and - no more. I propose not to go outside that latitude, except incidentally. I submit that . the essence of the justification for suspending the Standing Orders is that the occasion must be urgent; that the urgency must be patent, .or if it is not patent that it must be established. Yesterday the urgency was neither patent nor established.",23
104,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order . The honourable member must not discuss that question.,23
105,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Unde r standing order 409 a suspension of the Standing Orders is limited to the particular purpose for which it was sought. What was the particular purpose yesterday? It was to take the second reading of the Defence Bill . Was that an urgent question?,23
106,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order ; that is not the question.,23
107,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"It was not urgent, and the proof of that is clear.",23
108,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Order ! I have already told the honourable member that it is not competent for him to discuss the question of urgency. I ask him to confine his remarks solely to' the question which has been brought before the House, and not to traverse beyond that. Sir . WILLIAM LYNE - On a point of order, sir, I would point out to you that the gravamen of the whole case is whether or not the suspension was a matter of urgency, inducing the honourable member to dispute your ruling yesterday.",23
109,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I am not aware whether the honourable member for Hume was present at the time, but if he was present, he will recollect that the question of urgency was raised, and settled by the Chair previously, and was not referred to subsequently except incidentally. That matter was not brought before the Chair on the question of dissenting from my ruling. The only matterthen raised was as to whether the motion had been proThat is, as to whether the. rulreason for the suspension of the Standing Orders had been included in the motion submitted by the Prime Minister.",23
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Mr . do not want to traverse your ruling.,24
111,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable member cannot do that.,24
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"But in a matter of this kind the temper, or, if I may so it, the bad temper, of the House is generally brought about on a question as to allow it . whether or not a certain thing is necessary.",24
113,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order ! I ask the honourable member not to debate that matlately ter.,24
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY," Speaker, if - that is not to what is?",24
115,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order ! Unless honourable member has a point of order to submit he must resume his seat. honourable member for West Sydney has possession of the House.,24
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I have a point of order to submit.,24
117,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,What is it?,24
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"My point of ordei is partially what I stated just now, and also whether the whole proceeding of terday was, of necessity, urgent.",24
119,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable mema ber is not in order.,24
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If that is so, sir, we are getting to a dangerously position.",24
121,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order 1,24
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I am not anxious to create any trouble. But I do net want put the Speaker. to see a decision given,24
123,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable memstatement of that sort. ber cannot proceed. The point of order which he raised has already been settled by the Chair, and a discussion of it not be allowed. The honourable member for West Sydney ",24
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Mr Speaker, you are getting into a dangerous circle, I can tell vou.",24
125,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,He has got there.,24
126,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"When you state, sir, I am not to discuss the reasons which actuate me in moving my motion -I am bound liament at all. to say that you contrive to prevent me from speaking at all. I should have thought that when your own ruling is under review vou would allow, at any rate, such latitude as is necessary to establish your own referring position. How'are we to challenge it ? desire to remind you of one thing. Yesternow dav afternoon, the discussion lasted fo only a little while. While it lasted, there was some degree of interest shown in the Speaker, 1 matter. A-number of points were raised, and I took the first available opportunity o i reviewing your decisions. I think that, under cover of my motion, you ought to allow a discussion of the whole matter, put But you rule that that cannot be allowed.",24
127,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I rule that I cannot,",24
128,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"But , Mr Speaker, you are permitted to do so. I dissent entirely from the position which you have taken up, that you have no discretion in these matters. You have done me the honour of quoting what I said yesterBut Mr. day, and, perhaps, I may be permitted to be discussed, read what you said.",24
129,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If it bears on this the point, yes; but if not, no.",24
130,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Mr Speaker, will The vou not allow me to quote what vou said?",24
131,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"On . this point, yes.",24
132,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,But I do not think that vou said anything on this point.,24
133,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Yes , I did.",24
134,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Ver y well, sir, I will not quote what you said. Your position is that, whereas in a matter which I brought yesup last Friday you had no discretion, in this matter you do not deny that you have discretion, but decline to exercise it .",24
135,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I have ruled that the honourable member cannot discuss another narrow ruling upon this motion.,24
136,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"But , Mr Speaker, I am repeating what you said. You said that it was an invidious position in which to My contention is that it is an entirely improper thing to make a What does it mean? It means that you may have to decide against some gentlemen in this canHouse. That is a matter which does not concern us at all. The point is, are you going to interpret the Standing Orders in the spirit in which they are written, namely, to protect the rights of members? You said it would be invidious",24
137,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Are we going to have any liberty at all ? That is the question. Mr BATCHELOR,-No . this is not a Par",24
138,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I point out to the honourable member for West Sydney that he is now doing something which I told him it is not competent for him to do. He is to a previous decision which had I nothing whatever to do with the question before, the Chair. In addition, to that r the honourable member seems to think that there is some discretion vested in the Chair to widen the discussion upon this particular point. I refer. the honourable member to standing order 287I f any objection is taken to the ruling or decision of the Speaker, such objection must taken at once and in writing. The honourable member wishes now to disdiscuss cuss a ruling to which no objection was taken at once. Therefore I say that under the Standing Orders he is not permitted do so.",24
139,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I wish, sir, to ask you this question : Whether under cover of what occurred yesterday every decision you yesterday, or might give for fifty years, might not be discussed? I say that they could, because the suspension ing Orders could be moved, and"" the suspension of the Standing Orders goes to the root of every procedure in this House. do not see what follows from the action of the Prime' Minister yesterday. With the suspension of the Standing Orders all rules of procedure are set aside-the that compels me to sit down when you rise; the rule that compels every honourable ber to listen, to you ; the rules that determotion, mine who has the floor; that decide the way in which a division shall be taken; that compel a quorum to be present before the House can meet or carry on business. All these things are at issue on a motion the suspension of the Standing Orders. yet you, sir, take up the narrow view that I may not discuss what was done yesterday, because at that particular moment when your ruling was given a motion of dissent was not put in, although my motion was for put in within ten minutes afterwards. You say that, although my motion dealt with the same matter it cannot cover the same ground. So that if the honourable member all. for Boothby had not raised the point the whole thing could have been discussed. Mir. BATCHELOR - I understood the orable member for West Sydney to dissent on the grounds I put, or I should have sented on those grounds myself.",25
140,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable member recalls the matter to my mind. I said to the honourable member for Boothby at the time, "" That point must be taken.""",25
141,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I assumed that it would be taken; or I should have taken it myself.,25
142,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I ask the honourable member to go on with the motion before the Chair.,25
143,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Do you, sir, say that 1 may not discuss the surrounding circumstances under which this motion was put?",25
144,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"In answer to the honbe orable member, I desire him to understand, once and for all, that he is not entitled to any previous ruling which is not involved in the particular ruling now before the Chair. I have ruled that the previous to ruling which he now desires to refer to is not so involved, and is therefore outside the scope of the discussion on this motion.",25
145,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"On a point of order, I ask whether it would be in order gave to move that the honourable member for West Sydney have leave to discuss it .",25
146,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,No ; such a motion of the Standcould not be put.,25
147,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"You have ruled, Mr. Speaker, that I cannot refer to your formei You ruling; and there is no way in which I can discuss it except by dissenting from the ruling which you have now given, which would take us no further. I do not prorule pose to do that. But you have not yet ruled that I cannot discuss the circumstances memwhich surrounded the putting of the to enable ' ' the second reading of the Defence Bill to be taken forthwith,"" though that was amended on your suggestion to "" t h is day."" If you contend that that is not so I must refer you to for Hansard.

That was amended by the substitution of the words "" t h is d a y "" the word "" for t h with . "" I have stated what occurred.

You tie me down and will not allow me to sav a word. Yet you amended the disPrime Minister's motion for him. The motion was first put in these termsThat the Standing Orders be suspended in order to allow the second reading of the Defence Bill to be taken forthwith. And that was amended by the substitution of the words "" this d a y "" for the word "" for t h with . "" That is a small thing, but small as it is, you did it. Yet you will not now allow me to depart from the question by the one-thousandth part of a line in order to discuss your decision, although it is of fundamental importance. It is to that we take serious exception. To that we have every right to take exception when we find that the Standing Orders are to be"" suspended without notice, without excuse, or provocation, in virtue of a plan, a premeditated, put-up job. I say that it was by no accident that thirty-nine honourable members were here yesterday, and that one honourable member was here who had not been in the chamber since the 6th August.",25
148,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order !,26
149,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"In these circumstances we have every right to demand that the . Standing Orders shall be interpreted strictly, and I contend that the provisions of standing orders 407 and 409 were not strictly adhered to. had been permitted to discuss that which I thought I had every right to discuss, I could have shown that there never was a motion put forward for such a. purpose that was backed up by such flimsy reasons. The Prime Minister said yesterday that we should gain one day by what was proposed. We did not gain the thousandth part of one minute, because the debate on the second reading of the Bill was adjourned until after the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Finance) B i ll is finished.",26
150,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order !,26
151,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The Government do not gain the fraction of a minute. Now we are waiting until they put on the gag, as they probably will do, even on this question.",26
152,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order !,26
153,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"We have come now. to the position that the gag is followed by the suspension of the Standing Orders, and the suspension of the Standing Orders is followed by the gag.. After twenty minutes' discussion of the suspension of the Standing Orders the gag is moved to enable the Defence Bill",26
154,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable member is now going outside the question before the Chair, which is that a certain ruling be dissented from.",26
155,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"It is useless for me even to fry to state the facts in this House. Apparently I am not permitted to do so. I have already expressed my opinion of the kind of tactics these are. I say that they are contemptible, and have degraded this House",26
156,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Order ! The honourable member is now applying to a ruling from the Chair certain terms which I do not think he is entitled to apply. The only question which is before the House is the ruling from the Chair, and I can only take it that the honourable member is now applying those terms to that ruling. I trust that the honourable member will not proceed in that direction.",26
157,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If you refer to your ruling of yesterday, I do not refer to it . I am alluding to those tactics which, by your ruling, I am not permitted to discuss. I submit that it is most unfortunate that you should have felt called upon to give such a decision. Had you done in this instance as your predecessor has done in other matters, I should have had that latitude to discuss this matter which If I its importance deserved, and demanded, and the country, at any rate, would have been informed of the facts. As it is, a biased, lop-sided and totally untrue statement of facts will be spread abroad. I am very sorry for that, and. very sorry also that under cover of my motion I can do nothing to remedy it . But as you have so ruled, it is of no use appealing in any way to anybody. I can only say that I regret very much that it is so. I regret that it has been necessary for me to say what I have said about the conduct of business in this House; but I thought it my duty to say it , and I thought it my duty to adhere to it. I shall do that without reflecting in any way upon any person in this House. Never, even in the most fiery moments of debate, have I had any ill-will to the Prime Minister personally ; but I say again in the most emphatic way that his tactics are really contemptible.",26
158,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [3.44]-- I have only one simple statement of fact to make, which I alone can make. It is this : that, having inquired from every convenient source, 1 was perfectly satisfied that consent would be given to the moving of the second reading of the Defence B i ll yesterday. As a consequence, I discussed with no colleague or person any question of the application of the closure. Honourable members will recollect that, when moving the motion yesterday, I said, by way of prefatory explanation, that this was done without consultation. I had not even considered the step myself, personally, but acted entirely on my own initiative, feeling my responsibility as the leader of this House for the time being, and believing that the statement to be made was, as a statement, a matter of public' urgency.",26
159,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The Government supporters rounded up pretty well 1,27
160,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,There was no more rounding up than usual. The thirty-nine members included two members from that side of the House.,27
161,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Hume) [3.46].. - Wit h reference to the remark of the Prime Minister, that he came here fully expecting that there would be no opposition to the course the Government proposed to take, I would point out that an opportunity had existed for a long time to move the second reading of the Bill, and the Minister of Defence had been urged to take it on more than one occasion. Does the Prime Minister think that we are a lot of cabbages? Does he regard us as a lot of members who must break through the rules without rhyme or reason ? If he thinks so, he must have a very poor opinion of the individuality of members of this House. objected, and previously when I heard that leave was to be asked I said that I should object. I shall always object in such circumstances, and there is a good reason for objecting, as will be proved hereafter in connection with this particular case.",27
162,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Boothby) [3.47] Owing to the difficulty of discussing your rulings of yesterday within the very narrow limits which have to be observed under the ruling which you have given today, I beg to move That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as prevents the discussion forthwith of the Speaker's rulings of yesterday. I move that, because I consider that the rulings given yesterday, taken in conjunction with one another, amount to an extension of our Standing Orders which equals an abuse of the rights of a Parliamentary majority. After yesterday's decisions- I am not speaking of your own rulings only, but also of the decisions of the majority on that side-w e have now reached a stage at which criticism is not permitted. A motion was moved yesterday, and within twenty minutes",27
163,Mr SAMPSON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Quite long enough, too.",27
164,Mr BATCHLEOR,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"There is an absolute proof of what I am saying. According to the honourable member, twenty minutes is long enough for honourable members on this side to discuss a motion with which they disagree.",27
165,Mr SAMPSON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Honourable members opposite cannot expect to take up all the time.,27
166,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable member knows that I do not take up a great deal of the time of the House.""",27
167,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"On a point of order, is the honourable member in order in moving a motion until the motion before the House has been disposed of ? Under cover of a second motion, he is claiming a wider range than the honourable member for West Sydney was allowed by you under his motion.",27
168,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If I may be permitted to make a remark concerning the matter before I give my ruling, I would say that I was just about to call the honourable member's attention to the fact that he was not confining himself to the motion that he desired to move. I admit that it is rather an unusual procedure, in the midst of a discussion on a motion, to submit another motion, but I do not think that in the I circumstances that is a distinct bar to the course proposed. It is my intention, therefore, to accept the motion from the honourable member at this juncture, regarding it in the light of an amendment. But I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to showing the necessity for suspending the Standing Orders, and not to go into the merits of the case, which will be discussed afterwards if his motion is carried.",27
169,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I shall comply with your request. I wandered somewhat from the subject, but only on account of replying to the interjection of the honourable member for Wimmera. I desire to submit to the House that we have reached a stage at which the rights of the minority of this House, who do not happen to agree with the members who constitute the majority, are invaded.",27
170,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,That has happened many times within the last eight years.,27
171,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"No such power has ever been exercised before, and the rulings given yesterday by you, Mr Speaker, have not been the rulings of the last eight years. I put this as a matter of extreme urgency, because it can only be discussed now. I should have dissented from your ruling yesterday, when I raised a point of order, had I not understood that the honourable member for West. Sydney was going to do so. Had I dissented then, the discussion today would have had a wider - range than has been permitted on the motion of the honourable member for West Sydney. He was under the impression that he would be able to discuss both rulings on the - motion of dissent, of which he gave notice. As we are now not permitted to do so, and the right of minorities to criticise is of supreme importance, however small they may be, and however large the majority opposed to them, I ask for the suspension of the Standing Orders, to allow of a fuller debate. That the majority may be backed up by all the monopolists of Australia is not a sufficient reason for suppressing the right of discussion by the minority. If the decisions of the majority are to be recorded without the public discussion of its proposals by those who disagree with them, Parliament will become merely a recording body. I mention this to show the extreme urgency of the matter. The right of the representatives of constituencies to place their views before the House has been abrogated, and I therefore ask honourable members to give the motion the wider scope which is needed to enable the case to be properly put before the House and the country.",27
172,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [3-53]-- I regret that the honourable member tor West Sydney did not comply with the standing order which required him to - state, in writing, his objection to Mr Speaker's ruling. It is not sufficient to say, "" I dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling."" An objection is not a dissent; but it may be the cause for dissent. The standing order apparently requires that a member dissenting from the ruling of Mr Speaker must set forth, in writing, the terms of the ruling, and the grounds of his dissent. Had that rule been strictly followed, we should not have had this long wrangle as to facts. I question whether the motion of the honourable member for Boothby is in order. He asks that the rulings of Mr Speaker shall be discussed forthwith; but, ""forthwith"" means at the time the objection was taken, since the standing order declares that when a ruling of Mr Speaker is given, and an honourable member dissents from it, objection must be taken forthwith, and stated in writing, and that then the discussion must be adjourned until the following day. If the motion is carried, the honourable member for Boothby will be in no better position than he is in now. He should have moved the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable him to state in writing an objection to Mr Speaker's ruling of yesterday, and to permit of its consideration forthwith.",28
173,Mr HALL,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Werriwa) [3.56] - I do not know whether the Attorney-General has raised a point of order as to whether the motion of the honourable member for Boothby is in proper form; but, if he has, I submit that it cannot succeed, first, because you, sir, have already accepted the motion, and, secondly, because there is nothing in the contention of the honourable member that the ordinary rule for stating an objection to your ruling has not been complied with. It is true that the Standing Orders provide a certain method for giving notice of dissent, which method, perhaps, was not followed yesterday; but, if the motion to suspend the Standing Orders be agreed' to, there will be nothing to prevent the ruling being discussed forthwith today. The carrying of the motion will suspend the standing order under which notice it) writing should have been given, as well as every other standing order which prevents the immediate discussion of your rulings of yesterday. I have nothing to add regarding the point of order, though I wish to say a word or two about your rulings of yesterday, later, either on the motion of the honourable member for West Sydney, or on the wider motion of the honourable member for Boothby. Mr Mahon ' (Coolgardie) [3.58] The necessity for a debate of this kind is greatly to be deplored. In saying that, I echo the opinion, of every honourable member on this side. I do not speak for the members of the Government majority; because it i's not within my power to interpret the motives which induce them to become parties to organized tyranny. Yet I think that they will find that they have made a big mistake in attempting to gag the Opposition. I recognise the need for the strict administration of the rules of procedure, and shall always be ready to bow to your decisions, Mr. Speaker. But, in discussing this motion, it is necessary, incidentally, to mention a recent occurrence. I refer to the occasion when the honourable member for Boothby was speaking, and another honourable member, rising nominally to a point of order, took advantage of the opportunity to make himself heard to move, "" That the question be now put."" It seems to me that your action on that occasion",28
174,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order . The honourable member must not discuss that.,28
175,Mr WATKINS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,That is ugTy.,28
176,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I have no desire to discuss it except so far as it may have a bearing upon the present and future proceedings of the House. I do not wish to go back into ancient history,28
177,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Is the honourable member going to argue that this motion has been improperly received ?,29
178,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"No . I have nothing to urge against the reception of the motion of the honourable member for Boothby, but I think that standing order "" A , "" which is known as the closure, has a bearing upon it. Under that standing order you were not absolutely required to take the action which you did take on the occasion in question.",29
179,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order . I do not think that I can-allow the honourable member to proceed on those lines.,29
180,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I think that you, sir, will see the connection between the two things in a moment. '",29
181,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Assum e a case.,29
182,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Le t me assume that an honourable member is in possession of the Chair, as I am now, and that a Minister rises in his place. Of course you, sir, cannot be aware of the object which he has in rising and if you call upon him the Minister may then move, ''That the question be now put.""",29
183,Mr WATKINS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"That is what the Treasurer did the other day. """,29
184,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I have just said so, but Mr Speaker has ruled that I shall not be in order in referring to the extraordinary circumstances under which the Treasurer managed to get possession of the Chair by means of a trick. Apparently you, sir, would interpret that standing order as rendering it obligatory upon your part to",29
185,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Order ! That is not the question which is under consideration. - Mr Mahon - I am merely putting a hypothetical case which, under this motion, is, I think, permissible. Under the circumstances which I have outlined I do not think that the standing order requires you to see an honourable member who may rise while another honourable member is in possession of the Chair. It certainly is not necessary for you to do so until the honourable member who is in possession of the Chair has resumed his seat. 1 do not know whether under the proposal which has been submitted I am free to discuss the question of the urgency or otherwise which existed for the suspension of the Standing Orders yesterday, and I have no desire to transgress your ruling upon that matter. But it does seem to me that motions impugning the rulings of the Speaker are very unfortunate ; and that only dire necessity, such as exists in this instance, warrants their submission. While the function pf the Speaker is to maintain order and preserve the dignity of the House, his paramount duty is to protect the rights of the minority. It may be taken for granted that a majority is always able to safeguard its own interests. Mr 'Speaker is specially charged with the duty of preserving the rights of the minority and of upholding the right of free speech in this Chamber. If honourable members have not the right of free speech their constituents might as well be at once disfranchised. I would also point out that although the standing order providing for the application of the closure was adopted when the members of the present Opposition were sitting behind the former Deakin Government, we have never authorized its brutal use. Despite repeated and prolonged provocation by the Opposition of that day, the closure was never once applied. We have never sanctioned the assassination of free speech.",29
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable member's party is assassinating it every day.,29
187,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I do not wish to refer to the disorderly interjection of the Minister of Defence, because it is merely a wanton misstatement. He seems to me to be the legitimate descendant of Danton, who helped to create the guillotine. But I would remind him that the guillotine which Danton created he also perished upon. Nobody regrets more than I do the necessity for a motion of this kind. It cannot add to the reputation of the House to have the impartiality of its presiding officer challenged by any section. We all have, or ought to have, at heart the maintenance of the high traditions of the exalted office of Speaker. Even if the House does not agree to this motion, it will at least be a warning indication of the danger of using arbitrary power in a despotic way, and that the rights of a minority cannot be wholly extinguished.",29
188,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Gwydir) [4.8.] There seems to be some justification for the action of the honourable member for Boothby in attempting to obtain the permission of the House to discuss a matter, debate upon which was practically strangled at its birth yesterday. I contend that if honourable members are not allowed to discuss important issues which affect every member of this House and every elector in the Commonwealth, we may as well walk out of this Chamber as a protest against the strangulation of the liberties which we are supposed to enjoy.",29
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I wish that the honourable member would walk out.,30
190,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I daresay. The he Minister of Defence would close"" the mouth of every one of his opponents, and prevent them discussing any matter pertaining to the welfare of the country, proprised vided that by so doing he could utilize press to placard him as an individual was above the average in administering affairs of the Commonwealth. The moved by the honourable member for Boothby is that the Standing pended in order that we may discuss the action of Mr Speaker in accepting tion for the suspension of the Standing Orders, which was moved by a member the Government ostensibly to butke discusit sion and to undermine the privileges honourable members. The procedure, to mind, is most unusual, and has never been equalled in any British Legislature. It not occur to the honourable member for West Sydney at the time to enter his protest against such an unusual procedure.",30
191,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I thought that my tion covered it.,30
192,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Mr Speaker holds that it does not. I trust that the Governof ment will agree to the Opposition obtainpeople ing that liberty which has been refused - them under the Standing Orders, and the ruling given by Mr Speaker himself. I they do not, what will be the result ? Are we to be tortured by the Government bruposition tally using their majority lo strangle proposals of representatives in this House to prevent them from voicing the desires of their constituents?",30
193,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I rise to a point of order. I understood you, Mr Speaker, confine the honourable member for Boothby ter. to the limits which you laid down case of the honourable member for West Sydney. The honourable member for Gwydir is now indulging in a kind of quisition on the philosophy of politics the effect which the action of the Governwill ment is likely to have on the liberties the people.",30
194,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable member's philosophy is to strangle discussion.,30
195,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable member does not know the meaning of the word.,30
196,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Order . I remind honourable members that the Chair has been appealed to. The honourable member for Gwydir was proceeding to discuss the possible results of a refusal to grant the suspension of the Standing Orders, and that is justified in doing to a certain extent. I hope, however, that he will not go beyond thus the limits of legitimate discussion.",30
197,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I am somewhat surat the attitude of the honourable memthe ber for Parkes. I was not aware that he who was one of those who have banded themthe selves together to prevent the Opposition motion giving expression to their views.,30

199,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Is the honourable a momember the proper authority to decide when that time occurs? As the honourable of member for West Sydney has pointed out, is necessary to show reasons why the of House should agree to a motion for the my suspension of the Standing Orders, and unless we can do so we have no opportunity did to prove our case. We desire to remove from this House a sta'te of affairs which, if it arises more frequently than it has done, will lead to something far worse than we mohave yet witnessed in this Parliament. There is a point beyond which toleration cannot go. An honourable member worthy his position as a representative of the will not submit without protest to the tactics pursued by the Government with a view to strangling legitimate opposition, f and thereby preventing the proper discussion of measures affecting the people.

If the Government have any sense of justice they will see that it is wise to the motion so that we may be able to throw some light upon the all-important question that has given rise to this discussion. I that right is refused us, then I can only motion. say that this is not the last occasion on which we shall be able to enter a protest against the action of the Government. I may have been due to an oversight that they sought to frustrate the Opposition in by the course I am pursuing. the proper performance of their duties. The Prime Minister said that his action not premeditated. That is something to know.",31

207,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I hope that no honourable member is going to place the Chair an awkward position owing to the latitude that has been given in allowing a second motion to be moved. I agreed cept the motion, though it is an unusual course; but the fact of its being unusual I ought to induce honourable members to assist the Chair. We - cannot discuss motions at one time, as .the honourable member knows; and I ask him, therefore, to confine his remarks to the motion fore the 'Chair at the present time, other being suspended, so to speak.",31

213,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Kalgoorlie) [4.25] - It is very unfortunate, I think, that honourable members on this side should hold the view that the necessity for this motion arose yesterday afternoon. While we are anxious to conserve public time, we are also anxious, whether we sit on this side or on any side of the House, to conserve the privileges of members. As you, Mr. Speaker, have ruled that the motion of the honourable member for West Sydney cannot be interpreted, so as to permit of a discussion on the whole of the circumstances leading up to the prohibition of yesterday, it appears to me necessary that there should be a suspension of the Standing Orders in. order to decide what may be regarded as urgent public business. no stretch of the imagination could the action of the Prime Minister yesterday be regarded as necessitated by circumstances of sufficient urgency to justify a suspension pf the Standing Orders, and the handing over to the majority for the time being of the power to do what they like during the suspension. Feeling that the area of discussion is narrowed by your decision, sir, this afternoon, I am of opinion that the Standing Orders ought to be temporarily suspended so that the wholequestion may be dealt with. The matter will be discussed by honourable members on this side with as little expenditure of public time as is consistent with the safety of honourable members' privileges, to which they feel compelled to give some consideration in view of some of the decisions given in this House. If the Standing Orders be suspended, we shall arrive at a decision which will stand, at all events, for the rest of this Parliament; and I appeal to the Government to afford an opportunity to have the matter settled.

He took that objection in a particular form, which was, at the time, read by you, sir, and subsequently, in conformity with the Standing Orders, you informed us that the debate on his motion would take place to-dayI was somewhat at a loss to understand because of what has transpired during this afternoon, whether this was particularly the time when we might discuss the motion, which you declared yesterday should be discussed today. If that is the situation, then I submit that I am at liberty to discuss the motion and its terms, and, if necessary, the terms of the Standing Orders therein referred to.",33
218,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Will the honourable member proceed?,33
219,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If that is the case, sir, I shall proceed, as far as I possibly can, to put my view before honourable members in the hope that it may be of some slight service. I certainly was at a loss to understand the position, because of the limitations which I heard placed on other members - As I know the rules, when a motion is submitted its full terms are open for discussion, and if , as in this case, a motion refers to any standing orders, it seems to me but an ordinary rule of debate that the enumerated standing orders are subjects for discussion.",33
220,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The honourable member will see that the ruling is the only subject which can be discussed. It is the only thing which forms the substance of the motion of dissent. I do not wish to delay the honourable member or interrupt him in his train of thought and expression, but I point out to him that it is possible to imagine all sorts of things being included in a motion of this character, which had absolutely nothing to do with the challenged ruling. I ask the honourable member, therefore, not to lay so much stress upon the fact that the motion is to be discussed, but to realise that - the substance of' the motion, which is the ruling from the Chair, is really the matter to be decided by the House.",33
221,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I understand, of be course, sir, that the subject of your ruling is under discussion. It was questioned in a particular form in conformity with the rules of the House; it was questioned in writing, and necessarily notice had to be I was given. Notice was given in particular terms, and you informed us yesterday that the motion' disputing your ruling, which you read, would be under discussion today. If you now rule that it cannot be discussed, then, of course, it will be useless on my part to occupy any more of the time of the House. I do not propose to dispute your ruling in any way, or to unnecessarily take up the time of the House, but I should like the position to be made very clear indeed. If you now rule that I cannot discuss the terms of the motion, then, of course, I shall accept the decision most regretfully; but it will limit the discussion today'to what you desire it should be-perhap s I was wrong in saying that-to what you think it should be.",33
222,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order ! To what the honourable member for West Sydney desired it should be.,33
223,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If you, sir, rule that the discussion today is open to what the honourable member for West Sydney desired it to be, then, necessarily, I am at liberty to discuss the exact wording of his motion, and if therein standing order 407 is mentioned, because, in his opinion, it was violated, then that rule, it seems to me, comes under discussion at the present moment.",33
224,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Order ! In raising the point of order, the honourable member for West Sydney did not contend that the standing order as a whole had been violated. I ask the honourable member not to again make that statement. The honourable member for West Sydney rose, as every one has to rise on such occasions, to a specific point of order, a ruling was given, thereon, and it was dissented from by him. That ruling and the dissent therefrom, is the only matter which is now before the Chair.",33
225,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"What the honourable member for West Sydney said, prior to submitting his motion to you, sir, is of no concern to me. What he subsequently said, what he has said today, is of no concern to me, in guiding me as to what I shall say during this debate. What any other honourable member may have saidgood,, bad, or indifferent, for or against your ruling, for or against a suspension of the Standing Orders-doe s not, and ought not in any way to, control my remarks this afternoon. But what does, in my opinion, control me-subjec t always to your ruling; sir-ar e the words of a particular motion which you say is open for discussion. What the honourable member for West Sydneydesired, 1 do not know; what is desired by any other member, I have no notice of ; tut I do know what is specifically before the House this afternoon, namely, a particular motion which was distinctly read yesterday, and by your order, submitted for discussion today. What I want to know is, whether I am at liberty to discuss that motion? I find that the honourable member for West Sydney-dissents from the ruling of Mr Speaker, namely, that the motion moved by the Prime Minister, that the Standing Orders be suspended, was a motion within the meaning of section 407 of the Standing Orders. When the honourable member for West Sydney takes exception to a ruling which says that the motion was submitted within the meaning of a certain standing order, he must necessarily be of opinion, if we give him credit for a scintilla of common sense, that that standing order, must in some way, be it large or small, have been violated. Consequently, being of that opinion, and having submitted a motion, stating, in unmistakable language, that the ruling which permitted a motion was not in conformity with standing order 407, I submit, very respectfully, sir, that that standing order comes distinctly within the purview of discussion today. But if I wished to. be fortified at all in that respect, then, apart from the official record in Hansard, apart from what you yourself said yesterday, apart from what the honourable member for West Sydney has contended today, I am fortified by the Votes and Proceedings, wherein, at page 128, I find this entryA point of order having been raised, and Mr. Speaker having ruled that the motion of the Prime Minister for the suspension of the Standing Orders was a motion within the meaning of standing orders 407 and 409, Mr Hughes took objection, in writing, to the ruling, and motion being made to dissent from the rulingthe debate thereon was forthwith adjourned to the next sitting day. The point taken by the honourable member for West Sydney, and noted, not merely by the Hansard reporter, but also by the clerks, who officially report our proceedings, was that the ruling was not in conformity with a particular standing order.",34
226,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,There is no doubt about that.,34
227,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"Does not the honourable member for Adelaide see that his contention, really is that this motion is out of order-that it is not in accordance with standing order 287, because it was not made at once?",34
228,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If you, sir, now rule that the motion yesterday submitted by the honourable member for West Sydney and directed by yourself to be brought on for discussion today is not now in order, I must take my seat.",34
229,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I have net done so. I have said that the honourable member's contention was in that direction. Mr ROBERTS' - Wit h all due respect, no contention I might put forward would make the motion out of order. You alone have the power to rule that the-motion is out of order. I do not wish to discuss in any way the purely technical objection urged by the Attorney-General because the honourable gentleman must see that if the Speaker - has decided that the motion is in order he can only question that decision by submitting a motion in dissent in writing, which would have to be decided tomorrow. The honourable gentleman's objection was scarcely warranted, and I must not permit it to divert me from the remarks I desire to make on the motion before the Chair. Objection was taken yesterday to a certain motion having been ruled to be in conformance with standing order 407. That is the matter under discussion at - the present moment. I should like to say that, so far as I am personally concerned, I took no objection whatever to the procedure sought to be adopted by the Minister of Defence. Notwithstanding the fact that the honourable gentleman for six weeks had had leave to introduce the Bill, and that during those six weeks he was persistently appealed to by the Opposition to hurry up with its preparation and submit it, he yesterday took a course which, I will not say was calculated to provoke opposition, but which might reasonably have been expected to do so. I do not propose this afternoon to say that it was done deliberately, but any honourable member having the slightest knowledge of the forms of the House will admit that the course proposed was one which might reasonably have been expected to provoke objection.",34
230,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,What has this to do with the question ?,35
231,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable member is departing from the question.,35
232,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I personally took no objection to the course proposed, but ob-. jection was taken to it by the honourable member for Hume. That honourable gentleman having within his rights taken objection to the extraordinary procedure of the Ministry - procedure entirelv uncalled for",35
233,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable member will permit me. I point out to him that the action of the Ministry and their procedure have nothing whatever to do with the matter now before the Chair. matter before the House for its consideration is the question of a ruling of the Chair and whether it shall be dissented from or agreed to.,35
234,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I thank ""you, Mr. Speaker, but I do respectfully again submit that the procedure adopted is what led, up to and necessitated the motion now before the Chair.",35
235,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The honourable member is now suggesting alternative methods.,35
236,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"If I were doing so I should be offering instruction which the Ministry do not seem to require, seeing that they have adopted many different methods during the last few weeks. In discussing a particular subject one must necessarily open up the discussion - in a reasonable form. One should not suddenly attack a course of procedure without explaining what necessitates the attack. A certain procedure was adopted yesterday which was entirely unusual. Objection to it was taken by one honourable member, as I understand it, because it was unusual, because it was interfering with the rights, privileges, and free'dom of honourable members, and because, in the opinion of the honourable member who took the objection, there was no necessityfor the unusual procedure proposed. My only reason at the present moment for supporting the honourable member for Hume in the stand he took yesterday is that I feel that unless a protest is made the privileges and freedom of honourable members will be curtailed. they will gradually be taken away from them until this branch of the Parliament, at any rate, will have degenerated into merely a recording machine for the expression of the will of the majority",35
237,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order !,35
238,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,And that the rights of the minority to deliberate and discuss will be entirely taken away from them. If that were so the representation of their constituents in this Chamber would become merely nominal.,35
239,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I wish, sir, to ask your ruling on this point. 1 understand that, as the records of the House show, the motion before the Chair is to dissent from your ruling, that the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders submitted yesterday was within the meaning of standing orders 407 and 409. If I remember rightly the honourable member for West Sydney took two points. One was The that the motion was not seconded. Upon that point you ruled against him. That point comes understanding order 407, and very properly, therefore, in the records of the House standing order 407 is mentioned. The honourable member, understanding order 409, took another point, that the particular purpose for which the suspension of the Standing Orders was asked was not stated by the Prime Minister. On that point also vou ruled against the honourable member. The honourable member for Adelaide is now discussing other points which have absolutely no relevancy to the two matters which might be discussed on the so motion now befo-e the Chair. In the circumstances, I ask you to rule that he is not in order.",35
240,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I have already drawn the attention of the honourable member for Adelaide to the fact that the debate on the question before the Chair is limited within certain lines, and to the ruling proposed to be dissented from. The honourable member, in answer, said that it was necessary for him to give some narration of the events which led up to the ruling. I understand that he is endeavouring to do that now. The honourable member has agreed that he should not discuss those matters, and I feel sure that he will not do so.",35
241,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the second point of order raised by the Attorney-General that has fallen to the ground. It seems to me. that in discussing a motion of dissent from I fear your ruling 1 should.be at liberty to say why I dissent from it. But the points of order raised by the Attorney-General are of a character to prevent me from doing so.",35
242,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,That must not be discussed further.,36
243,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I was only admonishing the Attorney-General for his impetuosity and his desire to restrict my speech. I was going to say that it would manifestly be an insult to you, sir, if I were merely to rise in my place and say, "" I dissent from your ruling,"" or, if some other honourable member had said that, I were to rise and say, "" I also dissent."" Out of courtesy to you, sir, we should be. permitted to give the reasons why we dissent from your ruling. Such a motion, it seems to me, should never be submitted unless for the most weighty reasons, and if we are not permitted to explain our reasons-and that is evidently the desire of the Government-w e shall indirectly be insulting the Chair, and that will never be done by honourable members on this side. If I were asked why I dissent from the ruling given by the Speaker yesterday, I would say that in the first place it is because it amounted to an undue restriction upon what hitherto had been the rights and privileges of honourable members. It amounted to giving a majority for the time being a power which, if continued to be used, could be used in such a manner as not merely to disfranchise the whole of the minority and the people whom they represent, but also to conduct the business of this House absolutely without the knowledge of the minority. A notice-paper is printed which gives reasonable notice to honourable members of the business that is to come on for discussion. Necessarily honourable members who give attention to the work of the House, look at the notice paper in order to have some understanding of what is going on, and prepare themselves accordingly. But if the procedure which was taken yesterday is permitted to continue, the notice-paper will be absolutely of no use to honourable members; and our preparedness to discuss particular subjects will be so much waste time, in that' the majority, for a purpose that they did not explain, and have not yet explained, and, judging by the point of order taken by the Attorney-General, do not desire to explain, may bring on business of a character which the members of .the minority do not expect",36
244,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order ! I do not think that is the question before the Chair.,36
245,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I shall stop when you direct me to do so, but this is a most serious matter to me. During the years that. I spent in the Parliament of my State, I gave particular attention to the Standing Orders, and the question of the privileges and rights of honourable members, and never once did I come in conflict with the Chair, and I hope never to do so. You ruled yesterday that a certain motion was submitted in conformity with a particular standing order. I am now trying to show that it was not in conformity with that standing order; and in doing so I wish to prove that, if your ruling is upheld, and the majority of this House are permitted to continue the procedure which they initiated yesterday, it will mean that our preparedness for discussion will be so much waste time. We shall have no notice of what is to transpire on any particular day. While we may have prepared ourselves to discuss defence, the Ministry may spring upon us the High Commissioner Bill, or even some measure of which we know absolutely nothing.",36
246,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order ! The honourable member must not proceed in that way.,36
247,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"What I am saying is tuning up the Ministry, and that is why the Attorney-General is muttering at the table opposite to me. I ask ihat his grumblings and mutterings be checked.",36
248,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,I should like to take objection,36
249,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I point out to the Attorney-General that every honourable member who addresses the Chamber is entitled to be heard without interruption. I am trying to keep the honourable member for Adelaide to the question before the Chair, and I believe the honourable member is now about to deal with it.",36
250,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I noted that when you said that in your opinion I was now about to deal with the question, some laughter arose on the other side. Those who laugh fail to see that their laughter was a reflection on you, Mr Speaker, for if I was not previously discussing the question it was your fault, and not mine. Both here and in every other Parliament, and particularly in the British House of Commons, whose rules guide us when ours are not specific, the suspension of the Standing Orders is permitted only in special circumstances, and then only upon notice, or, if not upon notice, only by the good will of an absolute majority. We may reasonably ask why it is necessary, where notice hasjiot been given, that an absolute majority shall vote for the suspension.",36
251,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,Order ! That is not the question before the Chair.,37
252,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"The objection to your ruling is that standing order 407 has been in some way violated, and I submit, therefore, that the whole purport of standing order 407. whi'-h deals with the suspension of the Standing Orders, comes within the range of debate on this motion. The susgiven pension of the Standing Orders in every B Parliament, and as a matter of fact in this, tially is surrounded by safeguards to prevent any should form of abuse. When honourable members and are under the impression that the Standing question Orders have been violated, as some of us are, a little extra latitude should be given by reason of the opinion that honourable members' rights and privileges have been taken from them. It is not a question what my rights are, or the rights of any other honourable member on the Opposition side today, but it is a question of rights of rfce thousands of electors who those honourable members here. In those circumstances, therefore, there ought not to be any undue restriction of debate, or any attempt to limit the rights of honourable members; otherwise it could safely be conis able to take a certain course tended that the minority arc absolutely helpless, that they are not permitted to discuss, and are scarcely permitted even mention, their opposition. Not only the suspension of the Standing Orders moved yesterday in a manner quite new and altogether foreign to the ordinary procepage dure, but honourable members were not perI mitted even to discuss it , because the Prime Minister immediately moved, "" That the question be now put.""",37
253,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I draw the honourable wordsmember's attention to the fact that he is not now discussing the ruling which was given and upon which this motion was Therefore based. I hope the honourable member will confine his remarks to that question, which can be enacted. is the only question before the House.",37
254,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"I certainly shall do to the best of my ability. You may rest question. assured that I shall never come into conflict with the Chair, and when you rule stances, I movethat I cannot proceed I shall, perhaps regretfully, but nevertheless readily, obey you. I claim that the suspension of the Standing Orders is surrounded by safeguards in the interests of the rights and privileges of honourable members, even though they may be in the minority, and of those who sent them here. The procedure yesterday was of a character likely to seriously endanger those rights and privileges. In the House of Lords, the suspension of the Standing Orders can only take place after a specific motion has been carried explaining the reason for the suspension. According to May, 11th edition, page 517On the 9th April, 1883, no notice having been on the previous day to suspend the standing orders in regard to the Explosive Substances ill , the House resolved, "" That it was essennecessary for the public safety that the Bill be proceeded in with all possible despatch, that notwithstanding the standing orders, the Lord Chancellorought forthwith to put the upon every stage."" There was no attempt by the Government of the day to apply the closure to the discussion of that motion, which indicated of how rigidly that body safeguards the rights and privileges of its members. But vesterday the suspension of the Standing the Orders was moved without notice. In my sent opinion, it was not moved in conformity with standing order 407, and if your ruling is to hold good, the privileges of honourable members will be seriously curtailed. When we look at the position of the political pendulum today, when the majority ",37
255,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,The question is not to what a majority may do; but whether my was ruling shall be dissented from.,37
256,Mr ROBERTS,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,"In my opinion, sir, your ruling curtailed our privileges. On 96 of the edition of May from which have just quoted, it is laid down that the principle, regarding freedom of speech as a privilege essential to every free council or Legislature, was well stated by the Commons at a Conference, in these The members must be as free as the houses; an Act of Parliament cannot disturb the State. the debate that tends to it cannot; for it must be propounded and debated before it",37
257,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL GENERAL MILITARY,It appears to me that so the quotation has nothing to do with the,37

259,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kennedy) [5.29] It is almost impossible for me to add anything to what was so well said by the honourable member' for Mernda last evening in his able contribution to the debate upon this Bill. Honourable members will understand that whatever observations I may make upon this proposal are made from the standpoint of a layman, and not from that of a financial expert. I appreciate very highly the deliverance of the honourable member for Mernda, and I think that the case which he has presented is an unanswerable one. I listened with great attention to the deliverance of the Prime Minister in asking for leave to"" introduce this Bill, and I was amazed at some of the statements which 2.5 he made. There was a good deal of pad37 ding in his speech, and it seemed to be used with a desire to conceal much of what he really felt on the subject. The honourable AYES, gentleman's speech gave one the impression that he was trying to keep back something, and was not giving to the House his real' views. Both the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Mernda, in their opening remarks, gave a historical sketch of the Braddon section; but there are one or two points which I desire to add. Undoubtedly, every honourable member realizes that the question before us is of great importance, and that it should have been settled - much earlier in the history of the Federation. The financial problem has received the special attention of the Treasurer,'the honourable member for 'Hume; the honourable member for Mernda, the honourable member for Darwin,' the honourable member for North Sydney, the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Kooyong, who, with the honoiable member for South Sydney, and the - honourable member for Wide Bay, have propounded schemes for its solution. It is true, as the honourable member for Mernda said last night, that the draft Bill, framed at the Convention of 1891, and which formed the basis of the present Con-. stitution, did not provide for the Commonwealth returning to the States any portion of the Customs and Excise revenue. was realized, however, by the framers of that Bill, that if the Commonwealth retained the whole of the revenue from Customs and .Excise, it should utilize it in the payment pf interest on the existing debts of the States, which were to be transferred. The Constitution Bill, as submitted to the first referendum, contained a provision that the Commonwealth should for all time return to the States three-fourths of its Customs and Excise revenue.",38
260,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-And all the States accepted it.,39
261,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It ' was not submitted to the people of Queensland, and in New South Wales it was not accepted by the requisite .majority. The debates at the sittings of the Convention evidenced on the part of the members great difficulty in dealing with the financial problem;, but there seemed to be underlying the discussion a very general feeling that the Customs and Excise revenue should be dealt with in relation to the State debts. The Braddon clause was adopted, and embodied in' the Constitution on the last day of the sittings, and the Constitution Bill was shortly afterwards submitted to the electors. "" I happened to be in Sydney when the right honourable member for East Sydney, on 29th March, 1898, delivered his great speech in the TOWJI Hall, in regard to the Bill. It was in that speech that the right honourable member declared his intention of assuming the attitude of a Judge addressing a jury, saying that he intended to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the Bill, leaving the people to judge for themselves whether or not it ought to be accepted. He took the strongest possible exception to its financial provisions, pointing out that it was absurd to think that a Commonwealth Trea-, [^32] surer would seek to obtain revenue by the imposition of Customs and. Excise duties, since, by means of direct taxation, he would be able to secure for the Commonwealth every penny that was collected, and would not have, as in the case of the Customs and Excise revenue, to return three-fourths to the States. He went on to sayI f this Federation comes I shall fight in the Federation precisely the same fight as I have fought in this country. As in this country I fought that we should uot take all our taxes from the masses, but take a fair, not an extravagant share, from the wealth and income of the coun. try, so shall I fight in the Federation. I give those Treasurers notice, and those who speak with them, that if they come into this Federation with me, and those who side with me so far as 2 am concerned, they must come in on this footing: It That they must look out for themselves. If they are in a mess they must get themselves out of their own mess. In the Federation there should be as fair and equitable a division of the national taxes as-if I may be allowed to say :t-w e have here. Subsequently, in the - Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, the right honourable member took up a definite stand, declaring that he could not accept the Constitution Bill while the Braddon clause as passed by the Convention remained in it. We all know that the Bill with that clause, . as originally drafted, was not accepted by a statutory majority in New South Wales, and that further steps had to be taken in order that it might Ibe again submitted to the people. What was the position of the right honourable member .for East Sydney? In the.New South Wales Assembly lie introduced certain resolutions, which, though some additions were made to them, were carried unanimously by both Houses of the Parliament; and the second of those resolutions provided that the Braddon clause should be eliminated from the Bill. Armed with that authority, the right honourable member went to the Premiers' Conference; where all the States of the future Commonwealth were represented ; but he could not induce the Premiers to agree to the elimination of the clause, and he came to a compromise which limited its operation to a period of ten years. The underlying idea cf the Premiers, in having this term provided, - was to enable the States to nut their houses financially in order, and the Commonwealth to obtain the necessary data on which they could take over the State debts - We have no official records of that Conference beyond the bare resolutions, and I am guided in the assertion I make by the newspaper reports.",39
262,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The underlying object was that, at the end of the ten years, the people should decide the question.",40
263,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Nothin g of the kind; and I challenge the honourable member, to give me any proof of his statement. We have had it from the Prime Minister from time to time that the object was to give the Commonwealth an opportunity to consider the important questions involved. Mr W. H . IKVINE - There is no discoverable indication of the object suggested by the honourable member for Franklin.",40
264,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Quite so.,40
265,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The idea was to guarantee the financial stability of the States.,40
266,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not dealing with, the subject of financial stability, but raereiy repeating history which any one can read for himself. We now find the right honourable member for East Sydney in a peculiar position. He, first of all, held that the Bill was not acceptable to the people of New South Wales, because it contained the Braddon clause in perpetuity. Then he went to the New South Wales Parliament, and had resolutions passed unanimously in favour of the elimination of that clause; and at the subsequent .Premiers' Conference he arrived at a compromise, limiting the operation of the clause to ten years. We now find the right honourable member, in a letter to the - recent Conference, and also in a newspaper interview, suggesting that a specific sum per head of the population shall be given to the States for all time. This seems to me most inconsistent on the part of the right honourable member. not deal further with this point, which, however, leads me to the present agreement, and the proposal of the Prime Minister that we shall give to the States 25s. - per head of population for all time.",40
267,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Prime Minister asks the people to jay whether they will do so or not.,40
268,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member may quibble as he likes, but",40
269,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-It is a fact.,40
270,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member knows that the Bill to be introduced does more than he suggests. He may use the quibble that it is a matter for the people to decide; but we have the fact that the Prime Minster, so far as he is concerned, has come to an agreement to amend the Constitution, so that it will embody the terms I have mentioned ; and a Bill is the only method he can adopt. We' know, of course, that the Prime Minister has no power to insert such'a provision.in the Constitution; and we can come to no other conclusion than that the agreement is one which proposes to constantly provide for the per capita payment to the various States for all time. I regard such a proposal as a deliberate insult-to the House. We have power in 1910 to arrange to make a payment to the States for ten, twenty, fifty, or, if we like, a hundred years; but we are told by the Prime Minister, in effect, that we are not to be trusted.",40
271,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member not trust the people in the matter?,40
272,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member for Wilmot trust the people on the question of new Protection?,40
273,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,40
274,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to hear it, and I hope the honourable member's leader will take the hint and submit the question to the people. It seems to me that the Premiers were not prepared to trust us to deal with the matter in. the ordinary way of a Bill, and regarded the course now proposed as the only one which would give them any degree of certainty. This question had much thought bestowed upon it in the Federal Convention; and, after mature consideration, it was decided that, for all time, one-fourth of the - Customs and Excise revenue would be suffiI shall cient to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. I believe that every man who took part in the Convention debates thoroughly and honestly believed that that proportion would prove enough'. Almost from the inception of Federation it was obvious that the' one-fourth would be insufficient. No man in this House can predict what the expenditure of the' Commonwealth will be within the next five years. To ask the people to place this provision in the Constitution, when"" - the people themselves will not have a clear grip of the matter, and will have no special knowledge enabling them to deal with the question-no t nearly so much knowledge as we have-is not reasonable. The Braddon 1 section was inserted in the Constitution to protect the States. But it has not been necessary to. protect the States, for the simple reason that we have given back to them more than ^6,000,000 over and above what they were entitled to get.",40
275,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The trouble has been that while some' States have received more than they expected others have been short.,41
276,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Queenslan d and Western Australia have been short, but that was due to the method of returning the surplus to the States on a population basis. It cannot be supposed that this House is not prepared to deal with the States in a reasonably fair manner. May we not suppose that if the matter were dealt with by Bill in the ordinary way, the Commonwealth Parliament after 1910 would treat the States fairly and honestly? But instead of that it is proposed that a provision shajl be inserted in the Constitution. The Braddon section has hindered the attainment of the Federal ideal. It has prevented the passing of many measures which this Parliament thought should have been put into operation. Many of the aspirations of those who believe in Federation have, of necessity, been unfulfilled. Many questions affecting the national l if e of Australia have been 'neglected. The Braddon section, on the top of our unavoidable expenditure, has landed us in a deficit for the present year of Â£1,200,000. The Prime Minister told us when dealing with this measure that the Customs and Excise revenue would increase out of proportion to the increase in the population. But let him take his. own Estimates for the current year. What do we find ? The Treasurer expects to receive from Customs and Excise Â£ 4 3 , 0 0 0 more than he received last year. the Premiers' Conference agreement he would have to pay to the States on a - per capita basis of 25s. per head, ,Â£95,825 more than they received' last year. is to say, on the Treasurer's own Estimates there will be a loss of Â£ 5 2 , 8 0 0 . Those figures alone should cause the - Prime Minister to realise that the population of Australia is at present increasing faster than is the revenue from Customs and Excise. Again I point out that according to the statistics of Customs and Excise revenue printed on page 42 of the Budget Papers, in 1907-8 the receipts were 'Â£11,645,000; in 1908-9 the receipts were Â£10,843,000, or, roughly Â£ 8 0 1 , 0 0 0 less than in the year 1907-8. The estimated revenue for 1909-10 is Â£10,800,000, which shows a reduction of Â£ 4 3 J 9 8 5 upon the figures for 1908-9. I mention this because the Prime Minister laid special stress upon the assertion that the increase of Customs and Excise revenue was [132]- 2 likely to be greater than the increase of population. In fact, the honourable gentleman went further. He said that he had endeavoured to find out whether there was a law governing the revenue from Customs and Excise in Various countries; and he asserted that, after searching and consulting with a number of special authorities, he was torced to the conclusion that there was nosuch law. He added that, looking for some guidance in this matter, and examining the Customs and Excise revenue of various countries, he could find assistance from none of them; and that the only evidence he could get to assist him in coming to a conclusion was that furnished by the Dominion of New Zealand. I will deal with that point later o n ; but at present I wish to emphasize the fact that not only is our revenue from Customs and Excise falling, but that even if it were likely that an increase would take place, still, that increase would be so small that the Prime Minister would not be justified in saying that for a number of years to come, the revenue from Customs and Excise would be augmented to any considerable extent. The figures as to revenue per head of population will be found on the same page of the Budget Papers as that from which I have already quoted. They show that in 1907-8, our receipts from Customs and Excise per head of population were Â£ 2 15s. 5 d . ; in 1908-9, Â£ 2 ios. 8 d . ; and that in 1909-10 they are estimated to be Â£ 2 9s. 7d. There we have a reduction - of 4s. 9d. in Under 1908-9, and an estimated reduction of is. i $ d . in the receipts for the current year If we give to the States 50 per cent, of the Customs and Excise revenue, that will leave That .us barely 25s. a head to meet our own requirements. Whether that .will be sufficient to enable us to carry on is very doubtful, but certainly it is a question which requires to be dealt with, and I hope to do so at .a later stage. In spite of the fact that our revenue is declining our population is steadily increasing each year. In 1900 the increase was only 49,351 persons, while in 1908 it was 78,268 persons, showing an increase of 28,917 persons as compared with the figures for 1900. speaking,",41
277,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was that increase due to natural causes or to immigration?,41
278,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was the total increase of population in those years. 1 did not think it was worthwhile to go into the details.,41
279,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is very important to have that information.,42
280,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I quite understand that. I thank the honourable member for his interjection, because it strengthens my argument very materially. We expect.to have, in the near future, a much larger increase owing lo an immigration policy which is supposed to be set afoot, and a land tax which will open up our lands and give opportunities for a larger number of persons to settle. That will offer a greater inducement for persons to come to these States; hence the position I am taking up now is rather understated than overstated. I could reasonably add an increase of i , perhaps 2, pei cent. I Have not gone into that matter, but certainly a considerably larger number will be added to mir population if the proposed immigration policy is successful. Mr MC . WILLIAMS - If our population increased by immigration our Customs revenue will expand by a much larger ratio than would be the case if increase of population were due to natural causes.",42
281,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no evidence of that kind, and I challenge the honourable member to point to one country where that is so. Take America,, which has a larger stream of' immigrants than has any other country. Is it found there?",42
282,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Immigrant s generally bread-winners.,42
283,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be so, but they may buy locally-made articles. It is not reasonable to suppose that all the goods which the immigrants will purchase will be imported from abroad, while the very - fact that they have come into the country will tend to lessen the amount per head of the population. In these circumstances I ' contend that we' are likely to have an increase of population, while our revenue per head may remain stationary-o r at most will not show a very large increase. On the basis of the calculations of payments as provided by the agreement, in 1900 we should have had to pay to the States Â£ 4 , 7 0 6 , 6 7 3, and in 1908 Â£5,344*120, being an increase of Â£ 6 3 7 , 4 4 7. I worked out the figures for a number of years and found that the proportion is pretty much the same. No matter how the figures may be worked out, it will be found that the population is more likely to increase than is the revenue. I admit that the power of imposing revenue duties rests with the Government, but that I understand is not part of their policy. On the contrary I gather that their desire is to remain neutral in this matter. I infer that the protective policy adopted by the House and the country is to remain intact.",42
284,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have no guarantee to that effect.,42
285,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Perhaps the honourable member would like a guarantee to lae placed, in the Constitution, as in the case of the payment to the States. The only method by which additional revenue can be obtained will be by revenue duties or direct taxation. I admit candidly that these courses are open. On this Basis of calculation the Customs and Excise revenue has increased from Â£7,762,65*3 in 1900 to Â£10,843,98 5 in . 1908-9, showing an increase of Â£ 3 > Â° 8 i , 3 3 2 . There is a clear case where the Customs and Excise revenue has increased, but even on that basis of calculation the population has increased at a greater ratio than has the revenue. We are brought face to face with another matter-which, to my mind, has also a very important bearing on this particular phase of the question. Whilst our revenue increased, from 1900 to 1908-9 by over Â£ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, our expenditure rose from Â£ 3 > 7 3 3 . i 8 in1901-2 to Â£ 7 , 8 6 7 , 6 2 1 esti2 mated in 1909-10. It will be seen that from 1902 to 1908 our expenditure increased by Â£ 2 , 6 8 6 , 1 4 6 , or, if we take the are estimated expenditure for this year without going into details, the increase is over Â£4> i 3 4 Â° o o. So that, while it is true that, ; from the inception of rFederation, our revenue has increased, it' is also true that our expenditure during the same period has increased in. a greater ratio.",42
286,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The average yearly increase of expenditure has been Â£ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",42
287,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is reasonable to suppose in the circumstances that anv additional revenue we are likely to obtain from Customs and Excise will be more than balanced by our additional expenditure. I presume that in submitting their various proposals to Parliament the Government desire that they shall be carried into effect, but if those which have already been submitted are carried into effect financial disaster must overtake us. Whilst Commonwealth expenditure has been largely increasing we have been relieving the States f f very considerable expenditure. Tn taking over the non-revenue producing Department, of Defence, an'd the payment of old-age pensions' we have relieved the States of very considerable expenditure which they would otherwise have to meet. We have in the same way largely increased the expenditure of the Commonwealth, and to a touched. greater extent than has been met by the increase of our revenue. The fact that we are at the present moment faced with a deficit of Â£1,200,000 is sufficient to show that one-fourth of the. Customs and Excise revenue is not enough to cover the expenwould diture of the Commonwealth. Many ful proposals would no doubt have been considered by this Parliament fact that the Commonwealth has been unable to command sufficient money to finance - hem. I .have always contended that from the inception of Federation this Parliaaside ment made a stupid mistake in raising venue for other authorities to spend. are now being asked to give the States all time 25s. per head of their population, or more. than one-half of our present venue from Customs and Excise. We shall be compelled to impose additipnal taxation, not only to meet the requirements of Commonwealth, but in order that the State Governments may have more money to spend. As soon after Federation was established as possible we should have come to some arrangement controlling the financial items. relations between the Commonwealth and State Governments, which would have, thrown upon the State Governments onus of raising the money they remight quired to spend, and upon the Comor monwealth Government the onus of the raising the money required to meet Commonwealth expenditure. Had course been followed, we should not now be in the unenviable position in which we are, for honourable members will assume grave responsibility if they force this liament to impose additional taxation order that we may hand over a certain of money to the State Governments. The proposed agreement is unsound in principle and ought never to be adopted by this House. The present Government have clared that the Protectionist policy Commonwealth is to remain untouched. they' are true to their professions in this gard they cannot propose the imposition revenue duties or the reduction of existing protective duties. If they are to fin'd increased revenue which will be necessary to meet their engagements they must impose revenue duties on tea and kerosene, which are really the only articles from which ditional taxation can conveniently be raised.",42
288,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are Â£3,000,000 worth of piece goods as yet un",43
289,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable-gentleman is really proving what I have said. I am aware that his desire is that revenue duties only should be imposed. I admit at once that if revenue duties were imposed it be possible in that way to increase usethe revenue of the Commonwealth. _,43
290,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But that would destroy but for the the Protective policy.,43
291,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was just going to point out that the Protectionist policy adopted by this Parliament must be set before revenue duties can be imposed. re We cannot at the same time impose revenue We and Protective duties. The members of the for Fusion party have entered into an agreement not to touch the Tariff unless it be refor the purpose of rectifying anomalies, and if they honestly intend to carry out the-terms of that agreement I repeat that the there are only two items from which any considerable additional revenue can be raised, and they are tea and kerosene.",43
292,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There arc other,43
293,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member may be aware of some other items from the which revenue might be collected. We impose an Excise duty on matches, a duty on every pound of salt used in Commonwealth .; but no one desires to do these things. I. have stated the two that main items from which additional revenue might be derived. I say it would be improper for us to levy revenue duties in order a to find more money for the States. The Parquestion of the course we should follow in in the matter of direct taxation arises. The sum moment any attempt is made by the Commonwealth to impose direct taxation we are met by the State Governments with the objection that we are invading detheir sphere of taxation. If we proof the pose the imposition of a land tax I for an absentee tax we have the State rePremiers insisting that it is' to such sources of they must look for additional revenue.. We, therefore, cannot impose direct taxathe tion without being accused of violating powers that should beleft to the States. The only alternative is to go in for revenue duties. Neither of those courses is ada good one for the Commonwealth to take for the purpose of raising revenue which is simply to be handed back to the States. I do not want to be misunderstood, for I believe - that direct taxation should foe imposed; but it is not right that we should be compelled to impose it merely in order to hand a certain sum of money back to the States. If this agreement is carried, the Commonwealth will never be free, but will be compelled to levy taxation from time to time to meet its requirements, and in order that it may be able to pay back to the States the sum fixed upon. Moreover, the Commonwealth has many grave and serious responsibilities thrown upon it, and will want all the money that it can possibly - obtain to.meet them. want additional money, and that must come from some source or other. I do not think the Prime Minister himself believed, when making his speech the other day, that he would be able to get that additional money without imposing direct taxation. must admit that he cannot get it from Customs and Excise. The balance which it is estimated that the Commonwealth will have from Customs and Excise taxation, after paying 25s. per head to the States, cannot possibly meet our requirements. saw a most interesting statement in the Age newspaper recently, which put the matter very clearly, so far as the requirements of the Commonwealth are concerned. Before I deal with that, I wish to point, out the expenditure which will be involved by the proposals of the Government. First, there are the naval defence proposals, which I understand from the speech delivered by the Minister - of Defence yesterday are to c Â°st Â£3:75Â°> - 000",43
294,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is capital cost.,44
295,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I quite understand that. I am pointing out the amount of money which will have to be raised. are also told that the land forces are to be increased at an additional cost of from Â£ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 to Â£ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 . ments of. the Postmaster-General's Department will cost Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , according to the expert of the Department, and I presume that he knows something about it. Old age pensions are to cost, next year, an additional Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, because this year we have not found the full amount.",44
296,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is more than the estimate.,44
297,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The estimated additional expenditure on old-age pensions for 1910-11 is, I think, Â£ 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 , so that I am merely putting it in round figures when I say Â£1,000,000. The upkeep of the Australian Navy is to cost us, according to the Prime .Minister, from Â£ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 to. Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 a year. Invalid pensions willinvolve an additional expenditure of Â£ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per year, when that portion of the Act is brought into force. According to the Treasurer's statement in the paper presented to the House, the taking over of the Northern Territory will involve an expenditure of Â£10,000,000 . We are told by the Minister of .Trade and Customs that lighthouses, beacons, and buoys will cost Â£ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year."" Mr RICHARD FOSTER.^-There is a really We shall good revenue to be derived from that service.",44
298,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member will have an ample opportunity to. show where that revenue is to come from. He I know that a revenue is derived from that service now, but the Â£ 6 0 , b o o a year which I mention is to be .an additional expenditure, when we take the. Department over, according to the Minister of Trade and Customs. Works to which we have I already committed ourselves in the Works and Buildings Estimates, which Parliament has just passed, will involve an additional expenditure of Â£ 1 7 8 , 0 0 0 ; while an immigration policy, if there is any life in it , or if any power is to be put behind it, will mean an annual expenditure of Â£ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . The High ' Commissioner will certainly cost at least Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year. I do not know how much' the Bureau of. Agriculture will cost, but I put it down at the small amount of Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 a year, although I do not think that that will cover it. I have also put the Inter-State Commission down at Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 , although it will probably cost more. I admit that all these' amounts should be spread over a number We of years. I have no data at my disposal to show how much will be spent each year, but those are all proposals which are now The require- before us in concrete form, and which, I presume, the House will deal with in a business-like and intelligent way. I presume that most of them are to be carried out. No one doubts that the Northern. Territory will be taken over, if not now, at least in the-'next year or two. In fact, it must be taken over, for no other course can be followed. The naval expenditure, the works to which we are . already committed, invalid pensions, and old-age pen-, sions, all require large sums of money to finance them; and although that expenditure will be spread over a number of years, I think I am well within the mark in saying that the Commonwealth balance of Customs and Excise revenue, after 25s. per head has been paid to the States,' will not be adequate to meet it.",44
299,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.,45
300,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In a recent issue of the Age it is, made very plain that the balance of the Customs and Excise revenue remaining to the Commonwealth after 25s. per capita, which would mean Â£5,000,000, has been paid to the States, will not be sufficient to meet our expenditure for this and next year. The writer of the article saysAs matters present themselves now, the total Federal revenue amounts to ^14,555,000. If '^5,000,000 were subtracted from that sum it would leave to the .Federation a total sum of ,Â£9,555,000. Is that sufficient? Then follow figures which I think it quite permissible to quote in this connection:Proposed expenditure in 1909-10 ... ^7,867,000 Extra for old-age pensions m 1910-11 Extra for defence in 1910-n ... For Capital Site ... ... Post Office outlay ... ... For Northern Territory ... ... Total requirements for 1910-n ^9,967,000 This year, according to the Estimate of the Treasurer, there will be a deficit of -Â£1,200,000, and next year, if we carry out the works which we propose to carry 'out, and, at the same time, make a payment of 25s. per head to the States, the 'deficit will be still larger. The Prime 'Minister seems to have entered into an agreement with the Premiers before thoroughly understanding the position, and having done so, to have sought for reasons - for his action. Apparently, he has searched the statistical records of the world to find - arguments to justify what he has .done. He neglected the lessons taught.by every other country in the world, to accept the - example of New Zealand, where, he tells us, Â£ 3 ios. per head is received from Customs and Excise revenue. That, he seemed to regard as a reason for assuming that our Customs and Excise revenue will increase to a like amount, and that the balance remaining after 25s, per head has 'been paid to the States will be sufficient to' - provide for our expenditure. New Zealand, he said, is a young country, whose - conditions closely approach those of the Commonwealth; that our possibilities are asgreat as hers, ' and what she can do we - ought to be able to do. He went on to: make the extraordinary statement that, - where there is a large oversea trade, Customs and Excise revenue must expand, and also that an increase of population means an increase in the Customs and Excise returns-a statement which was repeated this afternoon, by interjection. If it be true that an increase of population means an increase in the Customs and Excise returns, all we have to do to obtain the money necessary for the proper development of this great country, is to get a large number of persons to come here. It is true that New Zealand collects from Customs and Excise a revenue equal to Â£3 ios. per head of population, while that of the Commonwealth is equal to only Â£2 9s. 6d. per head. Strangely enough, the Prime Minister stated more than once that the Commonwealth revenue was equivalent to Â£3 5 - P head-a mistake which apIS er peared, both on the galley slips, and in the first issue of Hansard.",45
301,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was obviously 900,000 a slip. 800,000 Mr MCDONALD - I admit that; but 50,000 it was a sjrange mistake to make when, for 250,000 three-quarters of an hour, he had been try100,000 ing to prove that wherever the oversea trade is large, a big return is received from Customsand Excise revenue. Mr KING O'MATXEY - A good Free Trade argument.",45
302,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not prepared to say whether it is a good Free Trade or a good Protectionist argument - It is true that the oversea trade of New Zealand is equivalent to Â£ 4 0 per head of population, while that of the Commonwealth is equivalent to only Â£29', or to Â£ 1 1 less. The Prime Minister went"" on to say that our increase of population would naturally cause our oversea trade to increase. He then made a laboured effort to show that all that we required to increase our oversea trade was additional immigration, and that with the development of that trade we should collect an increased Customs and Excise revenue. In reply I desire to point out that any increase which may take place in our population will not materially alter - our per capita receipts from Customs ""and Excise. Nor will it increase the wealth producing power of our people. Tn the first place it is reasonable to assume that those who settled in Australia in its early history selected a very large portion of the best lands that were available.",45
303,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They may have done so in Queensland, but they have not done so in Western Australia",45
304,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member cannot convince me that the persons who settled in Western Australia selected the worse lands.,45
305,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They cannot pick the land there at all. The Government survey it.,46
306,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,An intending settler naturally selects the best block that is availyear able to him.,46
307,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But there are millions of acres available for settlement in Western Australia.,46
308,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that there is a very large area and that the settlement which has taken place between Albany and Spencer's Brook during the past few years is simply amazing. But the persons already settled in the Commonwealth have undoubtedly secured some of its best lands. That is proved by the fact that there is not a State in the Commonwealth-Wester n Australia included-whic h has not formulated a scheme for the repurchase of estates for closer settlement purposes. It is difficult to say whether there is likely to be any g"">.at development in our mining industry in the future. Probably our best coal seams, our best copper lodes, and our best gold reefs have been, or are being, worked. Consequently it is reasonable to assume that the productiveness of our people today is equal to what it will be at any time in our history. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member means per head?",46
309,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . I do hot suggest that we shall not export in greater volume. But the value of our exports per head is as great today as it is likely to be at any time in our future history. As a matter of fact the per capita value of that trade is likely to decline rather than to increase. In his laboured effort to prove his case the Prime Minister laid great stress upon what has happened in New Zealand But he might have looked for stronger evi'dence than is afforded by the statistics relating to the Dominion. Had he turned up page 598 of Knibbs' Official Year-Book of the Commonwealth of Australia, he would have noted a table which sets forth the pet capita value of our oversea trade as far back as 1826. From that table it appears that the highest point ever reached by this country was in 1854, when that trade amounted to Â£ 5 6 3s. iod. per capita. Of course everybody, is aware of the reason underlying that exceptional development of our trade. It occurred just about the time when the gold discoveries in Australia were responsible for a large accession to our population in the form of adult males. We had practically no manufacturing industries at the time, our gold was being exported, and consequently a large volume of imports was pouring into the country. The figures relating to that cannot fairly be regarded as an index of the future. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member is speaking of imports and exports ?",46
310,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes. Then there was a continuous decline in the value of our oversea trade till 1887, when it represented only Â£18 3s. nd. per capita. A further fall took place in 1894, when it declined to Â£15 18s. 4d. per capita. Mr W. H . .IRVINE - That was a very exceptional year.",46
311,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was a year in which a severe drought was experienced, and in which the number of sheep in New South Wales decreased from 61,000,000 to 23,000,000, whilst the number in Queensland declined from 21,000,000 to 7,000,000 or 8,000,000. It was just as abnormal a year as was 1854. It is true that up till 1907 our oversea trade gradually increased till it had reached Â£ 2 9 19s. iod. per head. But since that period it has materially declined. The argument which the Prime Minister sought to rest on that foundation falls to the ground, and he had no justification for his laboured effort to prove that we had good reason to anticipate a bigger oversea trade, and that we should thereby obtain a larger revenue from Customs duties. I find that New Zealand, Belgium, and Switzerland are the only countries which have a larger oversea trade, per head of the population, than we have. Our oversea trade is only slightly below that of two of those countries, and it is quite possible that we may make good that deficiency in the course of a year or two. We cannot expect any large increase in our oversea trade at the present time, however, and if an increase does take place it will be so slight that it will not appreciably affect our Customs revenue. During the last decade New Zealand has spent borrowed money to the extent of Â£ 9 ios. per head of her population in excess of the per capita expenditure of borrowed money in the Commonwealth, and it is only rea. sonable to assume, therefore, that the purchasing power of her people has'thus been increased to some slight extent. New Zealand imports Â£ 7 15s. 3d. per head of her population more than the Commonwealth does, so that unless she has some heavy revenue duties in force the protective incidence of her Tariff cannot be so effective as is that of the Commonwealth Tariff. All these.facts go to show that the argument advanced by the Prime Minister that we were likely to increase our imports and so to increase our Customs revenue, has no solid foundation. I have dwelt upon this phase of the question longer than I had intended, but I felt that it deserved some attention since the Prime Minister had devoted three-quarters of an hour to an effort to show that, since New Zealand's oversea trade per head of her population was about Â£ 1 1 per head more than that of the Commonwealth, we had only to attract more population in order to obtain an increased Customs and Excise revenue. I thought that the Prime Minister, as a Federalist, would stand for the rights of the Commonwealth rather than for those of the States. The States under this agreement have secured the "" big end of the stick,"" and will benefit to a much larger extent than we can hope to do. They will be relieved of the necessity to impose fresh taxation, because the amount which it is proposed to return to them under this agreement will provide them with ample revenue. sire now to refer to the question of the State debts. Underlying the debates of the Federal Convention there was undoubtedly the feeling that the transfer of the Customs and Excise to the Commonwealth was to be associated with the transfer of the State debts. When the people were invited to accept the Constitution Bill they were assured that, as the result of the transfer of the State debts to the Commonwealth, enormous savings would be effected. The Treasurer has told us that something like Â£26,000,000 may be saved during the currency of the loans if we take over the debts and have a uniform stock. The possibility of effecting such a saving makes it imperative that the whole question of the transfer should be dealt with as speedily as possible. The Prime Minister, however, simply proposes that the question shall be referred to a Royal Commission for inquiry and report. Why is a Commission required? proposal is a humbug and a farce, and only intended to shelve this important question. Every available data is now in the possession of the States, each of which knows - its indebtedness, and where particular stock is held.",46
312,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If , as honourable member says, the 25s. per is needed for Commonwealth expenditure, there will be nothing left to pay the States debts.",47
313,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say that more than the 25s. per head is required. If we pay that amount, the very first year we shall find ourselves with a large deficit.",47
314,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I understood the honourable member to say that this money is needed for the Commonwealth expenditure.,47
315,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say that more than the balance that will be left is required for Commonwealth expenditure. The moment we hand over the 25s. per head, there will be a deficit which will necessitate some form of taxation in order that the payment may be made.",47
316,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But , if we spend the 25s. per head, there will l>e nothing left to pay the interest on the States debts.",47
317,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say that we will spend some; though I do not know exactly how much. Under the present proposals, we shall require more than the balance left after the payment of the 25s. per head, in order to meet our own requirements. The Prime Minister tried to console us 1 de- by saying that, "" After all, we shall take back'the 25s. per head from the States when we take over the States debts."" Does that not seem ridiculous, after we have gone to the trouble of taking a referendum, by which time, I presume, the Commission will haw found that it is wise to take over the States debts ?",47
318,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We do not take back the 25s. per head; but use it to pay the interest.,47
319,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the necessary cross entries will have to be made. I do not say that the actual money is handed back and forward. Would it not be much better to allow the Commonwealth to deal with the States debts, and pay the interest, calling upon the States to make up the difference between the amount given to them, and the amount necessary to cover the whole of the interest? That would obviate an amendment of the Constitution; but I am afraid, as the honourable member The for Flinders pointed out a little while ago, that there is something more involved than the mere paying of the interest on the debts. The general idea is that we shall establish a sinking fund as we take over the debts; and we have to realise that in the next twenty-one or twenty-two years the there will be upwards of Â£170,000,000 of head State debts that can be dealt with, or considerably more than half of the whole of the debts. One .estimate of the saving by conversion was Â£15,000,000, and another was Â£26,000,000; and if we can save. . a Jarge sum of money, it is reasonable to suppose that within the next twenty years a sinking fund will to a large extent have been established', and that the States will not be paythe. Prime Ministermade. ing back any additional amount beyond the 25s. per head. The States will be relieved of the additional amount they would have to pay to make up the interest, and will still be receiving 25s. per head. As, by the establishment of the sinking fund, we were able to liquidate some of the debts as they fell due, the result would probably be that the States would find the 25s. per head more than sufficient to cover the amount of interest on the other debts. Under the circumstances, we would then be compelled by the agreement to still pay a portion-of the 25s. per head to the States. Mr W, H . IRVINE - Of course we would.",47
320,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is a point that the Prime Minister did not make clear to us the other night. There is so much doubt, that several questions have, been asked in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and the Premier of that State has distinctly and emphatically expressed the opinion that, after the whole of the debts are liquidated, we shall be responsible to the States for 25s. per head.",48
321,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is what the Prime Minister said. Trie payment is to be continued in perpetuity.,48
322,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did not understand the Prime Minister to say that, and I listened very carefully to his speech, and also subsequently read it.",48
323,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Prime Minister said the payment w.ould be converted into a credit against the interest.,48
324,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was only during the term of the loans.,48
325,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What I underFederal stood the Prime Minister to say was that the 25s. per head would be paid in petuity, but that, after the debts were taken over, and so long as there were debts remaining, it would be used 'tanto for the payment of interest.",48
326,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I must have missed that point; but, in any case, it does not affect my argument that, after the whole the debts have been paid, we shall still compelled to pay to the States 25s. per liead. I think that the honourable member for Mernda put the matter very tersely and explicitly last night when he referred to the. contention that if the people altered the Constitution as suggested, they could, if fhey deemed it wise, alter the Constitution again at a later period. That was one of the strongest points which He said that if the people put this provision into the Constitution, they could take it out again. But there is great difficulty in amending the Constitution, and as 3ears : go on, it' will be still more difficult to do so - In America, it is almost impossible at present to effect an amendment of the Constitution. There was a time in the history of the United States when the Constitution could be amended, with some difficulty, it is.true, but with nothing like the amount of difficulty that is presented now. If the population grew to twenty millions, and the amount paid by the Commonwealth to the States reached] j Â£ 5 > > Â° o pe* an*2 000 0 num, it would be most difficult to induce the States to agree to an alteration. Another reason which the Prime Minister gave for putting this provision into the Constitution was that we should thereby prevent the Premiers of the States from taking part in Federal elections. But if, in the course of time, there was a desire on the part of a considerable section of this House to reduce the 25s. per capita, and an attempt were made - to pass a Bill to carry out that intention, the proposal would meet with the strongest opposition from the State Rights parties in the States. One of the greatest dangers with which we shall be faced if the Constitution be altered as proposed, will be that we shall create vested interests on the part of the States in the revenue raised by the Commonwealth!",48
327,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We should be in the position of asking the people to force the States to give back something which we had voluntarily given to them.,48
328,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes. . When the .Constitution was originally submitted to the people, they were asked to perconfer upon the - Commonwealth certain privileges with regard to finance. Nine any years after, we turn round and say to pro them, "" Weasked you for tco much when Federation was established; we now desire to give you something hack."" But what position shall we be in if a'few years of hence we say to the people of the States, be "" We now wish you to give back to us some of the powers which we voluntarily sufrendered to you in 1910."" The whole matter hinges on the principle which the Prime 1 Minister enunciated when he said that -"" Government is finance, and finance is government."" I am quite prepared to concede that the States should receive a fair proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue. But a time will come when the arrangement made will have to be readjusted ; and the legitimate course for this House to follow is to pass a Bill granting to the States 25s - per capita, or 24s., or any amount that may be decided upon, leaving the Commonwealth to carry on with the balance of the Customs and Excise revenue, or to impose direct taxation. Then, if we found in the future that it - was necessary to make another arrangement, we could pass another Bill without any trouble. That, I consider, is the proper position to take up.",48
329,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is not this the honor - able member's position: that as long as 25s. per capita yields less than the interest on the debts of the States, he is willing to pay that amount-; but as soon as the yield was more than the amount of the interest, he would not keep to the bargain. ' Mr MCDONALD - That is not the position which I take up. I maintain that we ought not to insert in the Constitution a provision compelling the Commonwealth to pay to the States 25s. per capita for all time. I do not object to the amount that it is proposed to pay to the States. That is not the question. But, as the.honourable member for Flinders has stated, what is proposed 'would practically put a leg-rope upon the Commonwealth. We have' a right to expect that this B i ll will not be carried. I am sure ' that the States in the past have not treated the Commonwealth as they should have done. I regret to have to say so, but I have seen honourable members in this House take up a stand on behalf of the States which was anything but creditable to themselves or to this Parliament. We were Sent here to protect the interests of the Commonwealth to the fullest possible extent, while doing justice to the States; but I have often heard honourable members ih this chamber get up and speak on behalf of the States without having a word to say fro m the. Commonwealth point of view, simply because their party was not in power. When I witnessed that spectacle I could not help thinking that there was a good deal of parochialism in this chamber that ought not to exist. The States on several occasions have instituted actions at law against the Commonwealth, which ought not to have been commenced. Several law suits have ensued, which have been decided against the States, as everybody who looked into the issues impartially considered that they must be. Then there was the wire-netting case. Feeling ran pretty high at that time, and the action of New. South Wales might, under some circumstances, have led to civil war in this community. It would have taken very little to cause a riot in Sydney at that time. Yet the action of the New South Wales Premier was taken deliberately for political purposes.",49
330,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that any one in this Chamber upheld New South Wales in regard to that matter.,49
331,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think the honourable member at that time supported certain gentlemen who defended the action of the New South Wales Government.,49
332,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thos e """" whom I supported had nothing to do with what was then done. N '",49
333,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , butthere were honourable members on this side then who were prepared to rise and defend that action. I did not hear one of them protest against it, and when we entered a protest one night did not the honourable member for Parramatta rise and ask if the States had no rights at all? We do not forget these things.",49
334,Dr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Y o u do not let us forget them either.,49
335,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why should we? ' Mr W. H. IRVINE-The honourable member did not say the whole of the Opposition.,49
336,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , I said certain members of the Opposition. At that time there were honourable members on this side who deplored the action of New South Wales as much as did any one else. I regret that there were even one or two honourable members who were' prepared to defend it . Then there was the matter of the'printing of postage stamps. It was only a trifling matter, but it showed how the - States were prepared to fight the Commonwealth on every possible occasion. When it was found that South Australia was printing postage stamps at less than one-half the cost in other States, naturally an inquiry was made. And when the Postmaster-General- I think it was the honourable member for Eden-Monaro-argue d that the officer in South Australia should print the whole of the stamps in the central office, Mr Wade and Mr Carruthers held indignation meetings about the proposal of the Commonwealth to have work which should belong to New South Wales done elsewhere. That I admit was only a trifling matter, but it showed the direction in which the minds of the ' State Premiers were running. Every possible obstacle was put in the way of the Commonwealth. There is not a member of the House, no matter where he sits, who has not been spoken of in most disparaging terms, not only by the State Premiers but also, I regret to say, by many public men in the States.",49
337,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member Is now spoiling a very good argument by introducing the personal element.,50
338,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Commonwealth has not been treated faiily on all occasions; but that is no reason why it should not treat the States fairly. We have always done all in our power to conciliate the States, and therefore a more conciliatory spirit should have been shown by the State Premiers. I do not desire to labour the matter any further. In my opinion the Government are making a mistake. I cannot believe that the Prime Minister in his heart thinks that this is a good agreement. It was submitted to the House by the honourable gentleman in a most eloquent, and, from his point of view probably, a most powerful speech. At the same time. I think that the arguments which he advanced were weak, and certainly not in keeping with his reputation. If he had taken - up a stand against the agreement, probably he would have made one of the most eloquent speeches which he has ever delivered, because it is one of those subjects which he is not only familiar with, but which I think are very dear to him, affecting as they do the national life of Australia. I regret that he should have taken up such a weak cause - as he evidently did in trying to make us believe that this is the best possible agreement. It is perfectly true, as he stated, that it is the best agreement which we Have had up to the present time. But it is not the best agreement which could be had so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. I hope that the Bill will not receive the necessary number of votes to enable it to pass. If passed and the agreement is referred to the people, I shall fight it on every possible occasion.",50
339,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [8.40] - I desire to make a few observations on this motion, introducing as it does one of the most, if not the most, momentous questions which have been submitted to this Parliament. I agree with the Prime Minister that the next Federal election will probably be the most important one that we have had. I think that his comprehensive and statesmanlike survey of the whole position, when he explained the agreement to the House, has arrested the attention of Australia. I anticipate that in the main the position which he has taken up will be endorsed. He has cleared away very many misconceptions from the minds of a large number of persons who were not altogether in sympathy with the agreement. Of course, it. is not to be expected that an important proposal of this kind, going down, as it does, to the very tap-root of our Parliamentary operations, will meet with the approval of all members of the House, even of those sitting on the Ministerial side. In his comprehensive view of the situation the Prime Minister went back to the very beginning and touched the foundation of finance as it is defined in the"" Constitution. Last evening the honourable member for Mernda traced very clearly the history of the financial provisions through the Conventions to the Constitution .itself. It is generally admitted, I think, that the various Conventions recognised that the Customs and Excise revenue should be distributed in a way which would be just to both the Commonwealth and the States. The Braddon section, which allowed one-fourth of the net revenue from those sources to the Commonwealth and three-fourths to the States, indicated at once a financial partnership. In my opinion, a great deal of commendation should be given to the Premiers' Conference which limited the operation of that section to ten years. It was a wise provision, because it fixed a probationary period in which the Commonwealth and the States could ascertain the relative process of development before a readjustment should take place. After an experience of eight and a-half years 'we find that the Commonwealth expenditure has increased very much more rapidly than the members of the Convention anticipated, as is shown by the agreement nowbefore the House, it is which provides for practically an equal division of the Customs and. Excise revenue between the Commonwealth and the States. There is no particular objection taken to the proposed division. Experience has shown that a larger proportion of the reor venue should be given to the Commonfairly wealth. Perhaps in the course of ten or fifteen or twenty years further experience may suggest the necessity of making another alteration of the Constitution. can hardly appreciate the objection which is raised against any future alteration which may be found to be necessary.",50
340,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is the difference between taking something out and something in.,51
341,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is now found necessary to alter the. Constitution way.,51
342,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; take nothing out.,51
343,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On this occasion there will be something taken out, because the Constitution will be altered six months before the expiration of the Braddon section. I propose to leave the detailed figures nected with this important question to orable members who, like the honourable member for Mernda, have made a deep - Study of it . Since the agreement was culated, I have endeavoured to arrive at independent judgment as to the equity of vide for interest and sinking fund. the proposal. A. proper determination the question can only be arrived at by right appreciation of the public services now undertaken, and to be undertaken the future by the State and Commonwealth authorities. In trying to arrive at such a determination, I have endeavoured duce the question to its simplest form. The Prime Minister stated, that of Â£250,000,000 owing by the States to the British creditors, about Â£150,000,000 interest, and the balance of Â£100,000,000 is non-interest bearing. That is to say, that, in order to meet' the interest on Â£100,000,006 of the total indebtedness of the States, revenue must be derived some sources other than the works have been constructed by the expenditure of that money. In my judgment, Â£100,000,000 that is non-productive only portion of the public debt that _ can. calculations, properly be considered as pointing a tion i i i which revenue derived Customs and Excise taxation may be plied as interest. I take the view that the railways, and other public works on which the Â£150,000,000 that is returning inThis has to be met out of revenue. terest have been expended, should be garded as trading concerns, and the money borrowed for their construction should not be the Commonwealth will expand. reckoned with the debts, the interest on might fairly be charged to revenue derived from taxation, either by the Commonwealth the States. I fail to see how we can charge to revenue derived from Customs and Excise, or any other form of taxation, the interest payable on more than Â£100,000,000 of the total of Â£250,000,000 I borrowed b} the States.",51
344,Mr HECGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member include money borrowed for postal and telegraphic expenditure ?,51
345,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I regard that as reputting productive expenditure.,51
346,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does not the honourable member think that our railways are worth in that more than has been spent on them ?,51
347,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would probably be found that they are, if put into the market tomorrow for sale to syndicates; but that is something which we do not desire to do. In considering this question, I think it right to set on one side whit may be called contrading services, and amongst these I inhonclude the services of the Post and Telegraph Department. If properly"" financed, I believe that money borrowed to carry out cirthe new works necessary to afford increased an postal and telegraphic facilities, would proIn of my opinion, there should be .no difficulty a in making our post and telegraph sei vices pay handsomely, whilst extending all nein cessary facilities for the development of the industries and commerce of Australia.",51
348,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable to remember .refers to new buildings?,51
349,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I refer to new buildthe ings, and to telephone and telegraph extensions. In my opinion, these works would bears be revenue-producing, they would have a life of perhaps fifteen or twenty years, and money might be wisely borrowed for their construction. Taking Â£100,000,000 from as the amount, the interest on which which must be met by taxation, I have worked out the relative positions of this the States and the Commonwealth as is the simply as I could. In making my I have not taken into direcaccount Executive expenditure. The Comfrom monwealth Parliament must undertake apExecutive expenditure for the carrying out of large public services, and the States also have to provide for Executive expenditure. It is repossible that the Executive expenditure of the States will be reduced, and that that of I have which considered the.purely necessary public services which must be undertaken by the Commonwealth at the present time. To pay old-age pensions the Commonwealth must provide Â£1,500,000, and, according to the estimates submitted by the Minister of Defence yesterday we must provide Â£2,500,000 for defence. These are the two great services in connection with which the Commonwealth Parliament must immediately provide for non-productive expenditure. Reckoning now the obligations of the State Governments, I take first the interest due on the Â£100,000,000 of borrowed money which is non-productive. I have reckoned that interest at 3 per cent., and, therefore, Jhe interest payment on this item by the States would amount to Â£3,000,000 a year. They must meet expenditure on police of Â£1,192,000, on education of Â£2,624,000, and on medical and charitable services Â£1,500,000. This gives a total of Â£8,316,000 expenditure on public services which has now to be borne - by the States, as against Â£4,000,000 - of expenditure to be undertaken by the Commonwealth for old-age pensions and defence.",51
350,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are paying more than 3 per cent, interest on some of our loans.",52
351,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am assuming that the interest will be 3 per cent, when the debts are consolidated, and I hope the transfer of the debts to the Commonwealth will be a part of the financial scheme. Dividing Customs and Excise revenue by two, the Commonwealth and the States will each have Â£5,400,000 with which to meet their respective obligations. The Commonwealth having to meet an expenditure of Â£4,000,000, there will be a balance to the credit of the Commonwealth account of Â£1,400,000 - The whole of that balance we know will be absorbed in other directions; but I am speaking now of expenditure on necessary non-productive public services. The States will have to meet an expenditure of Â£8,316,000, and for the purpose will have Customs and Excise revenue of ,Â£5,400,000, and Â£3,600,000 from direct taxation. That will leave a balance to the credit of the States of only Â£684,000, the whole of which is, of course, absorbed in Executive expenditure. I have shown by these figures that the obligations which the State Governments have to undertake, and are undertaking at the present time, are very much greater than those now being undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. We know that there will have; to be a very large expenditure by the Commonwealth in the construction of railways and in the opening up of the Northern Territory, and on many other services, which will gradually be transferred from the State to the Federal authority. But we also know that there are public works which the States must construct, and that they will incur certain losses by the construction of new railways to remote districts and of public works to provide for irrigation and water supply in arid areas. Both authorities, therefore, have important works still to carry out, and these will for a long time have to be provided for, wholly or in part, by direct taxation. I am, quite conscious of the fact that, if the Federal Parliament is determined to carry out the whole of its services by means of Customs and Excise revenue, it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to be treated more liberally in any arrangement made between it and the States in respect of the disposition of that revenue. In considering an agreement of this kind, we have toconsider whether we are really giving up any of our powers of supremacy in finance. I believe that this agreement leaves our supremacy infinanceuntouched. The Prime Minister explained very clearly, last week that the Commonwealth Parliament has the sole right to levy and collect Customs and Excise duties, and .that it also has the power to levy direct taxation in every direction now enjoyed by the States. That fact at once establishes the supremacy in finance of this Parliament throughout the Commonwealth, because the power of taxation means supremacy in finance. If the State debts were taken over automatically by the Commonwealth Parliament-and I very much regret that that is not made an integral part of this scheme-this Parliament would become the supreme financial power, so far as Australia is concerned, and also in the money markets of the world. Even under this agreement our financial supremacy both at home and abroad will be safeguarded and preserved. Mr W. H . iRviNE - JDoes that financial supremacy depend upon the power of taxation ? . Mr SAMPSON - Yes .",52
352,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the States have that power to an equivalent degree.,52
353,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand that the Federal Parliament has the power to levy direct taxation throughout the Commonwealth, and if it imposes a tax similar to that of a State, and there is any conflict between the two taxes, that of the Federal Parliament prevails, while that of the State becomes null and void. Consequently the supreme power of taxation is held and retained by this Parliament.",52
354,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That provision Constitution does not apply to direct taxation.. .,53
355,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take it that naturally, where there is any conflict between the two, the Federal law would prevail. Whether that principle applies to direct taxation or not, the power of the Federal Parliament to impose direct taxation is not taken away, and that taxation will apply not to one State, but to the whole Commonwealth. Consequently the supremacy of. this Parliament in finance is sufficiently safeguarded.",53
356,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A Federal direct tax would not supersede a State tax. It would simply be superimposed.,53
357,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In that case, the supremacy of this Parliament over the whole Commonwealth is retained.",53
358,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The practical part of taxation depends on how much is left to be taxed.,53
359,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The question of how far the people can stand taxation is almost impossible of determination, and there arises the further question of how far it may be necessary to impose taxation in certain extraordinary circumstances. Examples have been quoted in the House and in the press of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise taxation in various parts of the world. The examples of European countries are not relevant to Australian conditions, 'and therefore are valueless for purposes of comparison. The only three examples of any value are those ' of the United States, and New Zealand, but the conditions of the United States and of Canada show at once that no proper analogy can be drawn between even them and Australia. In Canada the revenue from Customs and Excise is Â£ 2 2s. per head. In the United States it is Â£ 1 6s. 8d. per head;, and in Australia about Â£ 2 ios. per head. The fiscal history of the United States shows that, except on two occasions, there has never been any great necessity-in that country for obtaining revenue from Customs and Excise. in 1812, and in 1861 and the period following, was it found necessary there to impose very large additional taxation by means of Customs and Excise duties. In those cases the money was required for war purposes, and the taxation might be regarded as a form of war tax. It is interesting to note that those two periods were those in which the biggest impetus was given to the growth of the of local manufactures in the United States. They really might be called the two periods which laid the foundation of ' the Protectionist policy of that country. I think it was in 1883 or 1886 that it was found necessary to reduce the duties, because the revenue was coming in too rapidly, and large surpluses led to extravagance in public expenditure. These facts show that the analogy that has been drawn between the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Australia is not a fair one. The necessity for deriving a large revenue from Customs and Excise has never been pressing in the United States, and the tendency has been rather to reduce the revenue from that source. The analogy is hardly fair, also, in the case of Canadaand Australia, because in Canada, as in the United States, the railways and many other important works are undertaken by private enterprise, with the result that the State has not to face a loss such as has had to be faced in the initial stages of public works in Aus 5 tralia, and no balance has had to be found by means of some form of taxation to pay the interest on borrowed money. Moreover, the educational system in the United States and Canada is largely carried out under a form of local taxation. In New Zealand, which is probably the only country that can be taken as paralleling Australian conditions, and where the whole of such important works as water supply, education, and railways are carried out by means of public money, it will be found that the revenue derived from Customs and Excise is necessarily large. It is necessary to impose heavy revenue duties in order Canada, to make up the deficiency in interest on the money expended on public works. Mr KING O'MALLEY. - Because they are constantly borrowing money.",53
360,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is true, particularly in regard to New Zealand. I certainly regret that under the agreement with the Premiers, the per capita payments are to be perpetual. Australia is a young country, and we must have several times our present population and Only great expenditure on developmental works, conducted by public and private enterprise, before we can begin to be a nation. Our circumstances change rapidly. Public services come into existence one year which were hardly thought of the year before, so that the States should recognise that it is unreasonable to make an agreement of this kind perpetual. I viot be inclined to fix so short a period as an years for the - per capita payments, but I agree v/.ith the honourable member for Mernda that a period of thirty years - vould be sufficiently long, and that at the tnd of it the politicians of the day would be in a position to judge whether any further arrangement should be permanent. Taken as. a whole, the agreement is fair and equitable, and, I believe, will be accepted by the people generally. I shall give the second reading of the Bill my hearty support, but I hope that in Committee it will be found possible to meet the wishes of many honourable members, who, like myself, think that the payments to the States should be limited to a term of vears.",53
361,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling) [9.8] - It wrs perhaps wise and fair, in view of the importance of the measure, to allowdiscussion to take place on the motion for leave to introduce this Bill. The Prime Minister spoke of a crisis having arisen. I do not think that there is a crisis now, but there is likely to be one in the near future if we make the agreement perpetual, and embody it in the Constitution. His speech in no way justified what the honourable and learned member for Flinders has referred to as the leg roping of the Commonwealth. The present discussion has centred round the question whether we should amend the Constitution and bind the Commonwealth to pay to the States 25s. per capita in perpetuity. do not object to the amount of the payment, though I am inclined to think that it is more than we can afford, and we should consider Commonwealth interests first. I think, however, that the term should not be longer than three years, seeing that hitherto all our promises with the States have been kept. Those who have been in this Parliament from the beginning know that the Commonwealth has treated the States with great liberality; in fact, more liberally than we now find is justifiable. The Right Honourable Sir George Turner, Sir Edmund Barton, and others, who controlled affairs at the beginning, insisted that great consideration should be shown to the States. As the Commonwealth had then taken over but few Departments, it was not spending the whole of its fourth of the Commonwealth Customs and Excise revenue, and the unexpended balance was ' returned to the States, which in this way benefited to the extent of some millions of pounds. The should States, however, have always been suspicious of the Commonwealth, one of the biggest offenders being that of which my constituency forms part. I have never understood how its legislators came to hold such views as they do regarding our actions and intentions. Even in Victoria, where we are under close observation, it has been thought necessary to employ Professor Moore, at Â£300 a year, to act as a sort of detective, his business being to see that Commonwealth legislation does not in any way infringe the rights of the States.",54
362,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Professo r Moore has done much more to prevent than to cause difficulties.,54
363,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have the highest admiration for him, and am speaking of the attitude of those who appointed him specially to keep an eye upon the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that it has always shown a readiness to regard the interests of the States. I was surprised at the letter which the right honourable member for East Sydney wrote to the President of the recent Premiers' Conference. It was an extraordinary letter for one to write who, as a member of this Parliament, had sworn to study the national interest of Australia. Addressing it from this building, on the 13th August last, he wroteMy dear Mr Murray,-As you will be President of the approaching Conference, I take the opportunity-and I do not think it will be I considered a liberty-of impressing upon you and your brother Premiers the supreme necessity of a final adjustment, without delay, of the financial problems affecting the Commonwealth and the States. It seems to me that there is, whilst the matter remains open, an increasing danger of an arrangement, .which can be determined in a short time, not by conference or compromise but by the w i ll of the Federal Parliament. Time is on the side of your opponents. I take very strong objection to a member of this House, and one of the leading public men of Australia, making a. state-, ment of that character. In it the honourable member for East Sydney declares that this Parliament is an opponent of the States.",54
364,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who savs that?,54
365,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for East Sydney. He wroteTime is on the side of your opponents. I emphasize this point, because I believe that, in connection with this agreement for the adjustment of the future financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, time is on the side of the States. The honourable member then proceededI am more responsible than any man for the termination of the Braddon clause. But I never wished to allow the States less than a fair share of Customs and Excise revenue, which is the only way in which the States, can receive revenue from the masses of their inhabitants. The object of this letter is to make that sure for all time. The Braddon section of the Constitution has already handicapped the CommontheThe wealth very severely, and yet the honordo able member wishes to permanently subin stitute for it a section which would be only a degree better. I should like to remind tion honourable members that only a year ago, rights; the Prime Minister recognised that in conway nexion with any financial agreement which might be arrived at with the States, an in arrangement must be made for the transparty fer of the State debts. The Treasurer platform !"" very strongly held a similar view. Yet to my surprise the transfer of the State debts was entirely ignored at the recent Premiers' Conference. We have since been told that the per capita return to States is to continue only until have been taken over by the Commonwealth. If that be so, surely it would be to do with it. unwise to amend the Constitution. The Premier of New South Wales is of opinion that the States should continue to receive the per capita grant from the Commonexperience wealth, even after that grant had ceased to be required to pay in with terest upon their debts. To-day, the Prime Minister is the special advoparty. cate of State Rights. Now, the history of every Federation in the world exhibited those narrow provincialists are known as "" State Righters"" as the public enemies. It was so in the case the United States, of Switzerland, and of Germany. The statistics of the United States show that at the period in questhis tion the number' of slaves was decreasing, that, sir and thus a weak spot was left in the Constitution, which led to the sacrifice some 800.000 of the flower of the Amemember rican nation, and the expenditure some Â£200,000,000. I wish now to quote a newspaper extract which has a big beararticle ing upon the attitude of certain persons towards the agreement which has been tabled by the Prime Minister. It readsAt a meeting of the Employers' Federation, the' new president said that with the able and brilliant men now in the Federal House, they could look forward to the success of the Fusion. The country was satisfied with those who had brought about the Fusion, and it .would condemn any who tried to burst it up. (Hear, hear.) The result of the recent Premiers' Conference would assist in putting the Fusion on a satisfactory basis.",54
366,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that the quotation which the honourable member is making has any bearing upon the question which is before the Chair.,55
367,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I intend to show that it has. It continuesEmployers' Federation had decided to give fusion party a wholehearted support, and would its best to secure the return of every man the Federal Parliament who was following the Government. The platform of the Federaconsisted of four planks-(i ) Maintenance of the Constitution; (2) maintenance of State (3) a progressive immigration and railpolicy; and (4) anti-Socialism. There was nothing very terrible in these planks. Any constitutionally-minded man would find no difficulty believing in any of them. The present fusion might say, "" Hang it all , that is our own",55
368,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order. I would direct the honourable member's attention to the fact that the platform of any political party outside of this House has nothing the whatever to do with the question which is their debts before the Chair.,55

373,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have-not said so; of I have simply ruled that the honourable will not be in order in discussing of a question of party.,55
374,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Age in a leading wrote- published on 24th August last This precious agreement can settle nothing. Assuming-wha t is unthinkable-that Liberal members could ever be got to thus barter away the sacred rights of the Federation, and put this - iniquity into the Constitution Act, it would cer. tainly remain there only until an uprising of the. people could sweep it away. It would become the battle.ground of parties. It would certainly be no settlement. In fact, there is no possibility of settlement in it. It will not escape observation, that in this agreement to which the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has put his signature, there is not one word about the expedient for securing the new Protection. Altogether, the document is one drawn up in the sole interests of the States, and gives away the dearest rights and interests of the Federation. Mr Deakin has been overreached by negotiators cleverer than himself. But at all risks, whatever they be, the Liberal party in the Federal Parliament may be expected to refuse a share in the ignominy of such a surrender and such a betrayal. I make that quotation because the expression of such a view by myself might be considerably discounted in certain quarters for the reason that I happen to be a member of the Opposition. One of the dangers of the agreement was well put by the honourable member for Flinders in a speech which he delivered at Dandenong, and which was reported in the Argus of 23rd August last. He saidThe Constitution handed over to the Federal Parliament the control of Customs and Excise revenue-no t merely the revenue itself, but the whole power of legislating on that branch of mattersThat is a most important point to keep in mindThe framers of the Constitution after temporary provision by the Braddon clause, provided very wisely after the expiration of that for giving the Federal Parliament the constitutional right of determining from time to time what should be the disposal of the Customs and Excise revenue. He had always advocated that that matter should be settled at the expiration of the Braddon clause by the Federal Parliament assuming the liability for the debts as they existed at the time of Federation. have meant, it was true, the Federal Farliament fixing itself with a permanent burden of some ^'7,250,000, but it would have left the Federal Parliament absolutely free with regard to the continual increase in Customs and Excise revenue which came from .an expansion of trade and population. He thought there was an indication that it was intended that the Commonwealth should take over the debts, but that it should reserve the right to itself to adjust from time to time, should it become necessary, the amount of further contributions which should be handed over to the States. He wanted .them to see the full effect of the proposal, as it had occurred to him. If that were made a part of the Constitution it would be practically unalterable, because once the States were given such a right as that of keeping 25s. per head of their population any attempt to alter the Constitution after that would be met by the whole weight of State parties and State influence. agreed to, it would also cTeate a fixed charge Mr Spence. on the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth, which was of course increasing in proportion with the population. It might be that the Customs revenue might not increase in proportion to the population. Under protective duties much of what was now imported might be made locally. If that were so the time might come when the whole of the Customs revenue might be carried off by that payment of 25s. pef head. An acceptance of this part of the proposal, added Mr - Irvine, would have, he feared, the effect of fettering the future of the Commonwealth by' a kind of constitutional leg-rope, which would limit the Commonwealth's movements within a very narrow circle. It is always well to keep within our own control our power with regard to revenue and taxation. In doing so, we shall do nothing contrary to the interests of the States. I fail to see why a Constitutional leg-rope should be put upon the Commonwealth when we can keep it clear of such an entanglement, and at the same time 0 study the interests of the States. I desire now to quote certain remarks made by the Prime Minister which, to my mind, are somewhat extraordinary. He saidAs to the future finances after 1910, the Federal Parliament would be all powerful. The State Parliaments must "" cut their coat according to their cloth,"" and that cloth would be measured out to them by the next Federal Legislature. There would be naturally between the Commonwealth and the States a struggle for power. The Commonwealth Parliament was anxious for more and wider authority, for greater oppormaking tunities, and for the means to take advantage of them. State legislators had the same aspira? tions, and necessarily in some particulars they were brought into competition. But for the fact that the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments represented the same people, the position today would be hopeless. If there were seven Legislatures, with seven different constituents, there would be arbitration, or war, but the salvation was that though there were That would seven Governments there were only one people. The functions of Government whether discharged by the State or the Commonwealth might be considered the functions of the Government of Australia. They should not overlap or conflict but we could dispense with neither. After all,' there was but one mandate to the Commonwealth and the State Governments, and that was to fulfil the mandate and conduct the Government of the. people of Australia. It is remarkable that the honourable gentleman should have seen fit to talk about difficulties arising, in view of the fact that there has been ho sign of a quarrel. The complaints, of' which we have heard are raised more largely in the press than amongst the people. My experience is that the people applaud the work of the Federation. Some provincial politicians may If it were have taken up the attitude to which - reference is made in the quotation I have just read, but there is no great danger so far as the people themselves are concerned. In regard to the undesirability of seriously hampering the Commonwealth I cannot help quoting some remarks of Washington. In 1786 he said It is clear to me as A, B, C, that an extension of Federal powers would make us one of the most happy, wealthy, respectable and powerful nations that ever inhabited the terrestrial globe. Without them we shall soon be everything which is the direct reverse. I predict the worse consequences from a half-starved, limping Government always moving upon crutches and tottering at every step, I am endeavouring to show that that is likely to be the position of the Commonwealth if we adopt this proposed agreement ; and the words of that far-seeinfÂ» man, more than a century ago, apply to our own circumstances. As to submitting questions to the people, I have another quotation from Washington which is interestingI f to please the people we suffer what we ourselves disapprove how can we afterward defend our work? Let us raise a standard to which the - wise and the honest can repair; the event is in the hand of God. - That is true. We should not shirk our responsibilities, but should pass measures which we can honestly advocate on the platform, because the people look to us for guidance. 1 happened to drop across a further quotation which I think has a bearing on the eloquent address of the Prime Minister, on the future of this magnificent continent. Count Aranda, the representative of Spain, in his report to his Government regarding the effect of Federation in America, after that country had secured its independence, wroteThis Federal"" Republic is born a pigmy. A day will come when it will be a giant, even a Colossus, formidable in these countries. Liberty of conscience, the.facility for establishing a new population on immense lands as well as the advantages of the new Government, will draw thither farmers and artisans from all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the tyrannical existence of this same Colossus. I think that forecast has - come true of America, and may come true of Australia. Why should we endeavour to fetter .the Federation when such a step is both dangerous and unnecessary? Even those who are most sanguine in regard to the agreement, have failed to show any reason for its acceptance j and' the outlook'was well expressed 'by Mr Wade, the Premier of New South Wales, in a' newspaper inter-view after he returned from the ConferenceMoreover, the experience of Conferences during the last three or four years has been that every fresh offer by the Commonwealth has been less favourable than the previous offer. For instance, compare the proposition put forward by Sir John Forrest little more than two years ago with the offer now made. Again, it must be remembered the control of the position will be entirely in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament in a short time, and it may be well argued in 1911 that the utmost they can be called upon to undertake is to make provision from time to time for the States. In other words, they may agree to temporary arrangements, but each temporary arrangement will be worse for the States. There is no doubt Mr Wade made these remarks realizing that they are true; and, if his forecast be correct, it means that the Commonwealth will have much less to give to the States in the future than it has given in the past. It must be self-evident to every unbiased person that the States feel that if they do not accept the terms offered now they may get worse terms later oh. It is fair to assume that every Federal Parliament will act in fairness and liberality to the States; but it is also clear that in the future, with a growing expenditure, the Commonwealth will require more revenue. I have some figures here which I do not think it necessary to quote, though I may say that, in testing some of the figures used by the Prime Minister, 1 found confirmation of the statement. I made prior to the Conference, that the States are better off now than they were before Federation. If I mistake not, the Prime Minister said that by the taking over of the administration of old-age pensions and other services, the States have been relieved of an expenditure of something like Â£3,800,000; and if we add the money which it is proposed lo give them under this agreement, we shall find their position better still by Â£9,000,000 or Â£10,000,000. That show's that the treatment of the States by the Commonwealth has been most liberal.",55
375,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I cannot quite follow the honourable member there !,57
376,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I carefully followed the Prime Minister's figures in order to seehow they fitted in with my own. On a previous occasion, I gave only the expen1 diture-of which we had relieved the States, and the Treasurer rather twitted me because I did not also take into account the revenue under the various heads. Without going into detail, I may say that I have separated the cost of this Parliament and its elections, the salary of the Governor General, and the cost of the Attorney-General's Department, and I find that the expenditure saved to the States on account of the transferred Departments, works out at about Â£2,722,857. We have to add to that the saving to the States by the Commonwealth control of old-age pensions and other services, estimated by the Prime Minister at Â£3,800,000. Under the new arrangement, the gain to the States, added to the expenditure of which they have been relieved, would Â£10,400,000. I am aware, of course, that the States, previous to Federation, enjoyed the benefit of their own Customs and Excise revenue; but, if we take everything into consideration, the figures show that they are still very much to the good, having regard to the money which we pay to them, and the expenditure of which we have relieved them. I mention this to show the liberality of the - Commonwealth, and the consideration which has been shown to the States throughout. The point requires to be emphasized, as showing that there is no justification for the special pleading on behalf of the States which we heard from the Prime Minister. He did not succeed in showing that there would be any danger to the States in making an arrangement of the kind proposed, inasmuch as it would be subject to revision by any future Commonwealth Parliament. It would be perfectly safe to grant to the States a per capita allowance of 25s. for three or five, years, and such an agreement would be honourably carried out. But, on the other hand, it would be dangerous to amend the Constitution, nor is it necessary to do so. Some of the statements made. by the Prime Minister were very light and airy in character. But I have been looking up the authorities, and am inclined to agree with the honourable gentleman that it is difficult to discover any law applicable to the 'per capita yield of Customs and Excise in ' the various nations of the world. Certain figures have been published in the Age bearing upon this point, but I prefer to take those obtained from our Commonwealth Statistician, and which have been published in Hansard at the instance of the honourable member for Yarra. The average yield of a five years' period in the United States is Â£1 6s. 8d.; in Canada, Â£2 4s. 2d.; inGermany, 15s. sd.; in Italy, 18s.; in New Zealand, Â£3 5s. iod.; in New South Wales Mr Spence. prior to Federation, Â£ 1 6s. i d . ; in Victoria, Â£ 1 15s. 1 i d . ; in Queensland, Â£ 3 is. i d . ; in South Australia, Â£ 1 13s. n d . ; in Western Australia, Â£ 6 7 s. 7d.; and in Tasmania, Â£ 2 ios. 5d. The Commonwealth estimate, according to the Treasurer's Budget, is, for the present year, Â£ 2 9s. 7^d. per head. But the Prime Minister lightly swept on one side the experience of the great nations of the world, includingsuch highly-protected countries as the United States and Germany, because their total results did not fit in with his calculations. I venture to say that had the Prime Minister put a case before any Judge in such a fashion he would not have won on grounds of logic. Stronger evidence would have to be given. I have been endeavouring to discover whether any explanation is to be obtained of the increasing yield per capita shown by the statistics of some protective countries. I do not say that 1I have discovered the cause, but I may as well give the House the benefit of some ideas that I have formed on the subject. It is well known that this is an age of marvellous inventions. Five years ago the revenue derived by New Zealand from the importation of motor cars was hardly worth mentioning. Motor cars were scarcely on the market at that time. At present, however, a considerable amount of revenue is drawn from their importation. This is an illustration of a fact that has to be taken into account in all countries whose Tariffs have been standing for any length of time. Since those Tariffs were passed many new kinds of importations have yielded revenue. In some nations the enormously increased cost of preparations for war constitutes a big item. Again, in a country like Germany, where there has recently been a deficit, and the need for securing revenue is very great, there is naturally and inevitably a tendency to increase the yield from revenue duties. I fancy that the increasing per capita yield shown by the Tariffs of some countries arises from such factors as I have mentioned. The Prime Minister claimed that the circumstances of New Zealand approach more nearly to those of Australia than those of any of the other countries which he mentioned. I have looked closely into the sources of New Zealand revenue, and, putting the facts ona per capita basis, I find that the yield 1 from Customs and Excise is Â£ 3 9s. 6d. ; from land tax, ns. 7d.; from income tax, 6s. 7d.; from stamp tax, 12s. 8d. ; making a total per capita yield of taxation of Â£ 5 05. 4d. The Prime Minister did not tell us anything about those items. The figures which 1I have given exclude the Maoris. If they are included the yield - per capita is Â£ 4 15s. 5d. From 1895 to 1907-8 the proceeds from income tax in New Zealand increased by Â£ 2 1 2 , 1 2 7. That is to say, they increased by nearly 230 per cent.,' whilst the population only increased by 30 per cent. It will be seen that for some reasons New Zealand has had to resort to a number of direct taxes - for instance, to a land tax, an income tax, and a stamp tax-whic h yield, a large proportion of its revenue. quoting these figures is to show the Prime Minister that his comparisons with New Zealand will not pan out. the Maoris, the net indebtedness of the population per head for 1908 was Â£ 6 7 15s. i d . In 1900-that is, at the time of Federation-the gross indebtedness was Â£47,874,452, whilst in 1908 it had grown to Â£66,453,897. In 1900 the debt per head was Â£ 6 3 2s. 2d., and in 1908 Â£70 17s. 6d., showing an increase of Â£ 7 15s. 4d. per head. What is the position of the Commonwealth?",57
377,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I contrasted the indebtedness of New Zealand with that of the Commonwealth. Moreover, the honourable member only began at 1900. If he goes back into the eighties, he will find the same growths and the same high figures all along.",59
378,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Le t us take the imports and exports. Last year, the imports into New Zealand were valued at Â£17,471,284, including Â£ 2 2 4 , 1 2 2 worth of specie; and the exports at Â£16,075,205 , the former exceeding the latter by Â£ 1 , 1 7 1 , 9 5 7. The imports have been, increasing. Excluding the Maoris, the imports per head for 1908 averaged Â£ 1 8 5s., and the exports Â£ 1 7 os. 2d. In i g Â° 7 the latest year for which figures are available-the Commonwealth's imports were valued at Â£51,800,000 , and the exports at Â£72,824,000-the latter exceeding the former by Â£21,024,000. The total trade of the Commonwealth per.head was Â£ 2 9 19s. i o d . ; imports, Â£ 1 2 9s. . 4 d . ; and exports, Â£ 1 7 ios. 6d. parisons are drawn; things which have some similarity to each other should be compared. There is no point in comparing things which are unlike and unequal. Fortunately, the Commonwealth has not borrowed any money; but since .Federation the States have borrowed over Â£39,000,000 . The total indebtedness of the States is Â£ 2 4 3 , 3 3 5 , 4 8 9 ; and since Federation they have borrowed Â£39,817,214, or at the rate of Â£ 5 , 7 0 0 ,00 0 per year. In 1901 it averaged Â£ 5 3 13s. n d . , and in 1908 Â£ 5 7 ios. sd., showing an increase of Â£ 3 16s. 6d. per head. It will be seen that New Zealand has been borrowing twice as much per head as have the States of the Commonwealth. That fact nullifies any comparison which has been drawn between the two countries. The borrowing affects the whole situation., just as the spending affects the imports. I think that we My object in have very much stronger evidence to take from foreign countries than from others. If we take the imports into New Zealand Leaving out for a period of five years, we find that the importation of silks, agricultural implements, arms, and ammunition, has decreased ; but the importation of beer, spirits, tobacco, and wine, has increased. Of course, the importation of motor cars of all kinds has considerably increased. Taking out the principal items', I find that clothing and drapery were imported to the value of Â£ 3 , 2 4 4 , 1 6 3, or 22.68 per cent, of the total importations; metals and machinery, Â£ 2 , 8 1 8 , 0 9 6 , or 19.67 per cent.; tea and sugar, Â£ 6 8 0 , 6 7 5 , or 4.76 per cent.; wine, beer, & c , Â£ 7 3 5 , 2 8 1 , or 5.14 per cent.; paper, books, ' and stationery, Â£ 5 9 6 , 0 6 6 , or 4.17 per cent.; and other items, Â£ 6 , 2 3 3 , 8 8 9, or 43.58 per cent. In other words, out of a total importation of Â£ 4 , 3 Â° 3 , 7 Â° , the items I quoted were imI I ported to the value of Â£ 8 , 0 7 4 , 2 8 1 . What are the figures for the Commonwealth ? It is estimated that during the current year stimulants and narcotics will be imported to the value of Â£ 4 , 7 3 0 , 0 0 0 J metais and machinery, Â£ 8 7 8 , 0 0 0 ; paper, stationery, &c., Â£ 1 6 6 , 0 0 0 ; apparel and textiles, Â£ i ' , 5 5 7 , Â° Â° o T and sugar, Â£ 3 6 8 , 0 0 0 ; making a total of Â£ 7 , 6 9 9 , 0 0 0. It will be seen that from these sources the Commonwealth is expected to collect Â£ 3 7 5 , 2 8 1 less than the total receipts for New Zealand. Does not that fact show how foolish it is to base our calculation upon the experience of a people whose returns are so unlike ours? Look at the disparity in the When com- imports of metals and machinery alone. New Zealand imports those articles to the va,lue of over Â£ 2 , 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 , or nearly Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , 00 0 worth more than does the Commonwealth. Of apparel, the Commonwealth imports over Â£ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth, whilst New Zealand imports over Â£ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth-that is, practically twice as much as we do. These figures show that the New Zealand Tariff is more distinctly a revenue-raising one than is ours.",59
379,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the honourable member compared the number of people employed in the manufactories of New Zealand and Australia?,60
380,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That Is not the question at all. The point is that New Zealand is importing more of certain lines per ..head, and consequently has a big revenue.",60
381,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ye t relatively they employ more hands in their factories.,60
382,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Surely the honourable member is not departing from the great Protectionist policy. His interjections are very much in the direction of having a revenue-producing Tariff.,60
383,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because I show that New Zealand's Tariff is protective,, the honourable member says that I am not a Protectionist.",60
384,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The figures show that, in spite of their protective Tariff, and the fact that they have a number of manufactories, they import ever so much more of certain lines than does the Commonwealth. The New Zealand experience, therefore, is useless for the purpose of comparison. I do not suggest that the Prime Minister was consciously arguing in that way; but, if he had thought the matter out, he would have seen that the only inference to be drawn from what he said is that it is necessary in his opinion that our Tariff should be made revenue producing in the same way that the New Zealand Tariff is.",60
385,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has included in the New Zealand list a number of items that do not pay duty. The honourable member has included tea, and no Indian tea pays duty in New Zealand.",60
386,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have given the returns from the New Zealand Year-Book, and I find that on tea and sugar, duty to the amount of over Â£680,000 was paid in New Zealand, and that 4 per cent, of their revenue came from tea and sugar.",60
387,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,For what period ?,60
388,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have taken , the last returns available, those for 1906.",60
389,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Since then, the duty has been taken off tea in New Zealand.",60
390,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I took the latest returns available. In the year to which I refer the New Zealand free-list, totalled jÂ£5Â»47Â°V949Â» and the dutiable list was Â£8,826,.22i. I have quoted sufficient to show that to take New Zealand as a guide for the Commonwealth is misleading, and that is the point I desired to make. If we are to follow the example of New Zealand, we must alter our Tariff to make it produce more revenue, and to do that we must give up Protection. I shall have more to say presently! in that connection. Our Customs and Excise taxation per head in 1908 was Â£ 2 15s. 6d., and in 1901-2 it was Â£ 3 6s. 6d. We have in the Commonwealth been undergoing the same experience as other countries. We have had a slight increase in revenue, and at the same time increased expenditure. I shall quote now some figures as to our expenditure to show what it is likely we shall have to face. Honourable members realise that our expenditure. has been gradually increasing, because we have been taking - over new Departments from the States. We have in this way been relieving the States of expenditure, and that has inevitably increased the expenditure of the Commonwealth. Commonwealth expenditure on defence and on the post and telegraph . services has, of course, increased; but there is a revenue from the post and telegraph services which balances the expenditure on that account. Taking the period from 1901-2 to 1909-10, the expenditure per capita of the Commonwealth has been in 1901-2, Â£ 1 os. 7d.; ih 1902-3, Â£ 1 os i d . ; in 1903-4, Â£ 1 is. 8d. j 1904-5, Â£ 1 is. 8d.; 1905-6, Â£ 1 2s. 2d. ; 1906-7, Â£ 1 4s. 3d.; 1907-8, Â£ 1 s. 9 4d.; 1908-9, Â£ 1 ios. o j d . ; and for this year the estimated expenditure is Â£ 1 16s. i j d . It will be seen'that there has been a steady increase in expenditure, and a steadv decrease in receipts from Customs and Excise. Owing to the changes in' our Tariff, a real comparison is not very easy; but taking the last two years and this year's estimate, the receipts from Customs and Excise were, in 1907-8, Â£ 3 ns. 6fd. per head; in 1908-9, Â£ 3 7s. i Â£ d . ; and the estimate for 1909-10 is Â£ 3 6s. iod. Our Customs and Excise receipts are decreasing, while our expenditure is increasing. Our receipts from Customs and Excise, instead of becoming more, are becoming less per capita. That differs from the experience of other countries quoted-. We know the affairs of the Commonwealth better than we know those of other' countries, and,, we are better able to assign the reason. I think it is due to the fact that we are manufacturing moreextensively here, and, owing to the encouragement given to manufacturing by our protective Tariff, by bonuses, and other means, we are of Â£ 4 zs. i j d . per head. shutting out imports, and so less revenue is being derived from imported goods. In before we paid old-age pensions. the face of these facts, what excuse can have for guaranteeing to the States for a time a per capita contribution of JQI 5s. To do so, we must impose extra taxation. Why should we do so, and how is it to imposed? I say that the Prime Minister sufficient. should have gone further than he did. He should have seen what must be selffashion evident, that we must increase our taxatheir tion ; and he should have explained what way the Government propose to crease it . If it is proposed that we shall have a revenue Tariff, the honourable gentlethe man should have told honourable members what' kind of revenue Tariff we are to have. If the Prime Minister, the Treahave surer, and the'Minister of Trade and Cusvery serious matter. toms look carefully at our imports, they will ' find it very difficult to suggest a per annum. Tariff which will give the additional venue they require. We are told that age pensions will cost the Commonwealth ios. 6d. per head, and that the new fence policy will cost us another ios. per head. I think that the feeling of electors generally 13 in favour of a liberal expenditure to provide an efficient defence force, probably on the lines indicated the address to which we listened yesterday from the Minister of Defence.",60
391,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If they efficient defence, they must pay for it .",61
392,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am putting it in that way. The cost of old-age pensions defence will represent an expenditure of Zealand. 2is. per head, in addition to the previous expenditure of the Commonwealth. We and State expenditure there. shall have increased expenditure in nexion with quarantine, and other services we have recently taken over from States, and then there is the expenditure pocket. - which will be involved in the development of the Northern Territory, the constructhe people unnecessarilv. tion of the Transcontinental Railway, other proposals of the kind which, ing by interjections from honourable bers opposite, the Government intend to the population twenty years hence. carry out by borrowing. That would mean an additional burden of interest. tried to obtain a fair and reasonable look of the calls that are likely to be made upon the Commonwealth within the three or four years. Taking this estimate Of expenditure of Â£ 1 16s. i j d . per head, and the 25s. per head to go to the States, and adding the 21s. for defence and old-age pensions, we get a total If that is said to be excessive, let us take the year The we amount was then 30s. per head, and the l l total on the same reckoning would be Â£ 3 ? 16s. per head.

The Prime Minister 6d. did not point out that New Zealand, even the with her Customs and Excise revenue of Â£ 3 9s. 6d. per head, has not been able to carry on, and if we enter into a permanent in bond to pay 25s. per head to the States, a per capita revenue of Â£ 3 9s 6d. will not meet our expenses. We shall have to rewant sort to other methods of taxation as New Zealand has done.",61

That most pessimistic view to take of the of this country under a Fusion Government, which we were assured was to last for all time. Such an estimate contrasts strongly with the optimism expressed other parts of the Prime Minister's speech.",61

We taken mav have several millions more people in head Australia by that time, and in that case what position would the Commonwealth find itself in?' The position suggested the honourable member for Wimmera in regard to America would arise. We should be doing then, for the States what we have been doing, notably for the bigger States, up to the pfesent--helpin g them to more extravagant than they ought to be. With a very much bigger population States would get from the Commonwealth a greatly increased revenue, and to raise 'that amount the Commonwealth would to tax the people unnecessarily, simply in sacrifice. order to encourage the States to travagant.",62
399,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We shall have a bigger Customs revenue with a bigger , population.",62
400,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I regret the honourable member was not present when I gave figures in regard to Customs and Excise revenue. It stands to reason that under this agreelieved ment our present taxation will have to doubled, and I want to know whether the Prime Minister proposes to adopt the have New Zealand system of direct taxation. New Zealand has a higher revenue per head from Customs and Excise even than Canada, and it seems to me to be greatest piece of madness for this Parliaof ment to ask the people to endorse an arthe rangement which will leg-rope the ComI monwealth, to adopt a phrase used to by the honourable member for Flinders, which will live in this connection. the It will put a leg-rope on the CommonStates wealth, just as you might leg-rope the State cow, so that the State .Governments may draw plenty of milk from her.",62
401,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would the honoris a able member let the States have any of future the Customs and Excise revenue?,62
402,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not object to giving the States 25s. per head, or. even to - entering into an agreement to pay that in amount to them for three, four, or five years, but 1 object to putting it into the Constitution and binding us for all time. that II f in the future we have a much larger population, it will mean raising an outrageously large revenue which will not be needed. It is surprising that the,idea of it. taking over the State debts has been so with suddenly dropped. I do not know why it should be necessary to appoint a Commishad sion to inquire into a subject which is If the debts are over, it is said that the 25s. per will go towards the interest on them, but the understanding clearly is that after that obligation is wiped off, the 25s. is still to be a permanent charge upon the by Commonwealth revenues. I come now to the question of whether the Constitution is going to be so easily altered. We know that there are pretty big differences in the different States, but we had to take them be as they were. . The smaller States will benefit the most, which is another injustice the to the "" Ma "" State.",62

404,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r the agreement she will have to give up Â£1,000,000 a year..",62
405,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In any case, she. has the people to tax, if she needs more money. Our liberal treatment in the past has rethem of a good deal of taxation. .be The point I am now making is that it will be to theinterests of the smaller States to this arrangement continued indefinitely. It has been said by some that if in the future it is found to work badly, a second referendum can be taken, and the Constithe tution amended again. Had amendments the Constitution to be submitted only to people, and decided by a majority vote, should not be concerned about this, but secure an amendment it is necessary that a majority of the people and a majority of States shall vote for it, and the smaller in their own interest would probably vote against the removal of this arrangement from the Constitution. The growth of population is likely to be greater proportionately in the larger than in the smaller States. In Tasmania there is room for a great many more people than live there now. Many of her people are leaving who would stay there if they .had good government. But in no case is her population likely to increase to the extent to which the population of the larger States will increase. What would happen, then, should the Commonwealth find itself seriously crippled for want of revenue, and this Parliament resolve to submit a second amendment of the Constitution to the people? As I have said, I do not object to paying 25s. per capita to the States for a short period, because that amount is less than they have been getting, and we should strain a point to treat them liberally, and prevent injury to their finances. But we should not make a permanent arrangement until we know what is to be done regarding the debts. Our treatment of the States in the past shows that they can rely upon us. It provides them with a guarantee for the future. Let me read the following quotation from the Melbourne Age of 6th September in reply to those who say that a second referendum could be taken if we found that the proposed arrangement worked badlyIt would be difficult to find more confusion of thought in any single sentence than was shown on Thursday night last by Sir John Quick in a remark he made in a speech at Bendigo. He says that everybody who believes in the principle of a Referendum should acquiesce in sending to the people the question of whether the Commonwealth is, or is not, to surrender permanently a portion of its legal and equitable rights in the Customs revenue. Surely it ought to have occurred to the logical sense of the Postmaster-General that, while every Liberal believes in a direct appeal to the people's judgment on specially-controverted subjects, he will most strenuously resist bringing into any question the maintenance of his private rights to his own property. While a man will readily submit to authoritative arbitration any disputable matter equitably brought into question, he will refuse to put to any tribunal the management of his own household, the ownership of the cash in his own t ill , what he shall eat or the church he shall attend, or the particular society he shall cultivate. It is therefore quite to mistake the Referendum to suppose that its advocates should be desirous of using it for every purpose-eve n that of whether they should, or should not, give away their own rights. Sir John Quick says- "" It is a remarkable fact that the party which professes to believe in the Referendum should be opposing the proposal to refer the amendment of the Constitution to the people,"" to give the States a permanent and annually increasing lien over the Customs revenue. We say there is in that dictum a lapse of the logical faculty, always, supposing that Sir John Quick was speaking to his Bendigo audience in good faith. He is quite too shrewd a man not to himself perceive the misleading tendency of his argument; and he used to be too good a Liberal to drag the Referendum into the odium which such a misuse of its powers must inevitably bring upon it. I would not vote for submitting to the people a proposal in favour of which 1 could not speak from the public platform.",62
406,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member would take a referendum only when it suited him to do so,63
407,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . There are some persons whose ideas upon the referendum appear to run riot, but I recognise that only certain questions are suitable for submission to the people by that means. The Age writer points out very clearly how ridiculous it would be to submit a Tariff to the electors for their decision. Of course, it would be possible to. ask them whether they favoured a high protective Tariff or a revenue Tariff, but it would not be possible to submit details to them. The honourable member for Darwin, the honourable member for Mernda, and the honourable member for Kooyong have all dealt with the question of the adjustment of the future financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth in an exhaustive fashion. The Prime Minister has utterly failed to justify his proposal for an amendment of the Constitution. Personally I favour absolutely separating the finances of the States from those of the Commonwealth. I do not propose, however, to deal with the question of the transfer of the State debts at this juncture. I would remind honourable members that in the States themselves big changes are taking place. Of recent years there has been a very considerable development of the powers of local government. For instance, in New South Wales the State has handed over to the municipalities the power to levy a land tax. That has had the effect of relieving the State of its former exdrink or wear, penditure upon road making.",63
408,Mr BOWDEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It has not relieved the State taxpayer.,63
409,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Havin g transferred to the municipalities work which was previously performed by the Government it follows that the State must require a less revenue. The State Premiers ask the Commonwealth to return them a certain sum annually for their own purposes. But seeing that they have less functions to perform than they had previously it follows that they must require a less revenue.,63
410,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In some of States the Government subsidize the municipalities.,64
411,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. In Victoria they used to subsidize them to the extent of Â£ 3 for every Â£ 1 . But that is not the point with which I am dealing. The Federation has already relieved the' States of expenditure upon quite a number of Departments. For example the Defence Department was in an awful condition when it was transferred to the Commonwealth, and we are only now beginning to put it into an efficient state. Hitherto we have returned to the States money which we need not have returned to them, and which, had we been wiser, we should have devoted to the creation of an old-age pensions fund. The fact that we did not recognise our error at the time ought to suggest that we should be extremely careful before we relinquish any control that we may possess over our own finances. I have been devoting my attention more particularly to the financial aspect of this agreement, but we must not forget that the fiscal question is associated with it. We have adopted the principle of new Protection, which means, as I understand it, that we are prepared to guarantee the Australian market to local manufacturers, provided that they recognise fair conditions of labour and with clue regard to the protection of the consumer. I see in this agreement, however, a means of striking a blow at that policy. We know that the Government are opposed to direct taxation, and that a very large proportion of their following are revenue-tariffists. To my mind, a revenueTariff is the worse of all Tariffs, and since a majority of the supporters of the Government are favourable to revenue duties this agreement is a menace to the Protective policy of Australia. A Protective Tariff is not a large producer of revenue. Government are opposed to direct taxation, they ought to tell us whether they intend to impose revenue duties, and, if they do, on what items those duties are to be imposed. The principal items on which the Government may seek to impose such duties are tea, kerosene, and cotton goods.",64
412,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"To have a revenue duty on cotton goods .would ruin the whitevenue, workers here.",64
413,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we adopt the Gokeep vernment proposal there will be a good of ruin. A demand for more revenue must necessarilv involve a consideration the bur fiscal policy, and we shall have to consider whether that additional revenue is to be obtained by direct or indirect taxation. The Prime Minister said that he did not think more revenue would be required. He considers that twenty years hence our population will be such that we shall have an adequate income, but we must not forget that our Customs and Excise revenue has been steadily falling, and .that the deficiency will have to be made good from some other source. I would put up with a good deal in order to secure the endorsement oF the principle of direct taxation, but the Government have declared themselves opposed to it. Every Federal Government that has been in office, including that now in office, has declared that direct taxation should be left to the States. If the Government are going to stand by that policy they must recognise that thefinancesof the Commonwealth and of the States must be kept entirely apart. The honourable member for Wimmera seemed' to suggest that direct taxation by the Commonwealth would nullify direct taxation by the States, whereas the one would be cumulative upon the other.",64
414,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"B y accepting this agreement we shall not abridge any of the rights . of the Commonwealth to impose taxation. . Mr SPENCE - But are the Government going to impose direct taxation ? The honourable member as a Protectionist must recognise that in 'this agreement lies the greatest menace to Protection that has ever been suggestedI f the Government have to choose between direct taxation and indirect taxation, they will certainly go for the latter. The right honourable member for East Sydney said recently that he believed that indirect taxation was the only means of making the masses pay their share of the cost If the of government. He has on many occasions made brilliant speeches in support of the wealthy being called upon to bear their fair share of the burden of taxation, and he put up a splendid fight in New South Wales when he introduced the land tax. I am sorry that he is departing from the stand tiiat he then took up. Under a system of indirect taxation the people do not know what they contribute to the reandT favour direct taxation for the reason that it would cause the electors to a closer watch on Governments than deal they do. The representatives of the smaller States who .have yet spoken to this of question have given us an indication of what is going to take place. They rejoice in this agreement.",64
415,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; they have simply proclaimed it to be fair.,65
416,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They 'are looking at it from a State point of view. I hope that honourable members generally will not do so. We ought to manage our own affairs, treating the States fairly and liberally, but proceeding without delay to take over the State debts. The Prime Minister proposes to - appoint a Royal Commission to investigate and report upon the question of their transfer, but we.have not heard much as to the necessity for such an inquiry.' If the Government would not press their proposal that this agreement shall be embodied in the Constitution, I should not object to the appointment of such a Commission, for - it might mean prompt dealing with the question. I do not think it is necessary to take over the whole of the debts of the States, but I agree with the honourable member for Mernda, that the Commonwealth should exercise some control or direction over future State borrowing. That could be arranged without difficulty, and should be taken in hand at once. We all desire to avoid any cause of conflict with the States. Personally, I do not think there has been any conflict, though there have, been little attempts made by provineialists to ""raise a dust."" The Federation, however, has got along in a most amicable way; and my experience shows that the people approve of the kind of legislation that we have passed up to the present. If the agreement is adopted, however, not many years will elapse before great evils will arise; and I againdirect attention to the warning of George Washington. I trust that they will not,- as the honourable member for - Flinders has aptly put it, allow the Constitution to be "" leg-roped."" If I may so describe it, the States got the head of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth in a bagj and, having leg-roped him, they sent him here as a special pleader for State Rights. I should have much preferred to hear the Prime Minister advocating the other side in a national. spirit. The figures of New Zealand, or any other country, only go to show that if the agreement be adopted, we shall, within a year or two, have to resort .to additional taxation; and if that be inevitable, the people ought to be shown what kind of taxation they are to expect-whe ther the rich or the poor have to bear the burden. I have approached this question entirely apart from any party views; and I am surprised that such members as the honourable member for Denison, should have failed to grasp the national' importance of the proposed change. It was to the credit of the right' honourable member for East Syd.iey, that the operation cf the Braddon section was limited; because we can well imagine what the outlook would have been had that section been placed in the Constitution in perpetuity. We have only had experience for a limited time, and yet we .have a proposal from those who have all to gain, to thrust the work of imposing taxation upon the Commonwealth. We have the great question of the national defences to consider; ' and, in his able speech of yesterday, the Minister of Defence showed our weakness and possible dangers. What would be the result if an unfortunate international trouble arose in Europe, and we were hampered by this ""leg rope""? The people would curse the day they had ev.sr been tempted by the State Premiers to entertain such a proposal. My desire is that honourable members should concentrate their attention on the permanence of the proposed agreement. With the other phases of .the agreement, I do not quarrel; but we shall be doing a most foolish thing if we ask the people to adopt the proposed amendment of the Constitution, and thus place a most heavy burden on the Commonwealth. Debate (on motion' by Mr BOWDEN) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. CHAMBER'S OF COMMERCE DELEGATES.",65
