The points I want to make about this are of the fact that it was working on a new plan Australia and preaching, in particular, about for funding private schools. But what we saw built from funding of state schools. It is hugely relevant to this GST debate because to get hold of the so-called growth tax understand why they do not understand that available to them in future from the proceeds in federal government programs which will getting specific purpose grants for education and for all the other general purpose funds from the federal budget.

Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) No. (b) No. Regional Assistance Program (Question No. 608) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 12 May 1999: (1) Under the Regional Assistance Program (RAP), what is the status of the memorandum of understanding between the departments governing the operation of area consultative committees. (2) What is the nature of the (a) planning and funding process, (b) performance assessment and project evaluation tools, (c) simplified lines and (d) updated Internet and email facilities relating to the operation of area consultative committees. NA (3) Will Ministers and Members play a greater role in the announcement of projects funded under the RAP; if so, how. (4) Have guidelines been established for area consultative committees to determine which Members will be consulted and involved in the preparation and announcement of projects funded under the RAP. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed on 30 March by th<:< Ministers for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business; Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Transport and Regional Services. It came into operation on that date. A copy of the MOU is a driver with 27 years' attached. (2) (a) Area Consultative Committees (ACCs) are required to develop a three year Strategic Regional Plan and an annual Business Plan. The Strategic Plan outlines the ACC's broad strategy for employment and regional growth and skills development in its particular region. ACCs are encouraged to develop Strategic Plans which provide an analysis of the issues and problems affecting the region, an indication of priorities for the region, a statement of the outcomes the ACC expects to achieve and an indication of the strategies the ACC will follow to achieve these outcomes. The Annual Business Plan is a practical document addressing costings of each ACC's operations and RAP activity for the year for budget administration purposes. The Commonwealth provides funds to support the operation of ACCs. Base funding of $7m was allocated in 1998/99 for ACC operations. Funds are. allocated ($33.3m* for this financial year) to State level on the basis of State unemployment levels. Additional allocation is provided to Tasmania and the Northern Territory in recognition of the geographic isolation of their labour markets. (*NB this amount includes funding for business incubators, national emergencies if required or RAP guide- nationally significant projects). State level indicative funding allocations for ACCs are based on their annual Business Plans. In determining an indicative funding allocation, the department may consider such factors as each ACC region's: - unemployment levels; - share of population; - forward project liability from previous financial years; - previous level of RAP activity; - share of youth and indigenous Australian populations; - size of labour force. Both operational and project funding arrangements are under review in consultation with ACC Chairs, with the aim of introducing improved, nationally consistent arrangements for next financial year. (b) To date there has been no formal mechanism through which to assess the performance of an ACC or to evaluate the impact of RAP projects. The department has engaged a consultant to develop an assessment and evaluation tool in consultation with ACCs. (c) A National Policy Framework and Guidelines for RAP are currently being developed in consultation with ACC Chairs and Executive Officers. A guide for applicants is being updated. (d) There is a public web site for ACCs on the Internet. This site provides information on, and contact points for, each ACC. The department has recently instigated a project to update the site regular basis, eg remove out of date information, update and correct links to other sites and improve menu access. It is also proposed to establish a secure (private) ACC web site for the purpose of improving communication between the department and ACCs and between ACCs. As an interim measure an email list (or 'acclist') has been established which allows secure communication between ACCs and ACCs and the department. (3) All RAP projects will be referred to the Minister for Employment Services for announcement. (4) No. NA Between: Ministers for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business Education, Training and Youth Affairs Transport and Regional Services Purpose The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to establish a cooperative working relationship between the Ministers' portfolio departments in relation to the utilisation of Area Consultative Committees (ACCs). Background ACCs bring together key industry, employer, and community representatives to identify priorities and opportunities for employment and economic development as well as linked education and training issues in their region. A network of 58 committees Australia-wide was established to provide regional leadership so regions could make the most of their economic and labour market strengths. The ACC Network is allocated operating funds through the Regional Assistance Program. The Government considers the ACC Network an important element in the achievement of its goals for employment and economic growth in metropolitan, regional and rural Australia. It has a primary communication role within its local community to both promote and disseminate government programs and initiatives; and provide advice and feedback on the impact of those initiatives to better inform implementation of the employment services market reforms. ACCs will continue to be administered by and operate under the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Through that department ACCs will have a strong relationship with the Departments of Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Transport and Regional Services. The Department of Transport and Regional Services has a primary role in coordinating programs and activities that affect rural and on a regional Australia across a range of portfolios. Responsibilities The proposed approach for this MOU will bring together the signatories, or their designated representatives, to provide leadership for effective communication, monitor and assess policy implementation issues, address data needs, improve overall management of dissemination and promotion of Government programs and initiatives through the ACC Network. A coordinating group will be established to enable practical implementation of the principles underlying the MOU. The group will be chaired by Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and comprise of representatives from the Departments of Transport and Regional Services and Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Consultation between the three portfolios, on the Regional Assistance Program, the strategic role, charter and operation of ACCs with a focus on identifying matters for inclusion in the annual statement of priorities issued by Ministers. The provision of advice and reports on relevant areas of interest to each portfolio will be forwarded to the designated representative. Access to ACCs, including national meetings/strategic planning sessions of ACC chairs and to appropriate ACCs on regional visits will be facilitated for each portfolio. The sharing of information on portfolio priorities that may affect ACCs will be undertaken regularly. The Ministers' offices will confer in advance of any major announcements impacting on. regional Australia. ACC advice and feedback on impact of government programs and initiatives will be provided to the relevant portfolio through appropriate communication mediums. Each portfolio will give consideration of resource implications where a discrete activity is requested of the ACC Network. Through consultation, appropriate communication mechanisms will be determined, developed, maintained and, as appropriate, funded. Authority This MOD becomes effective upon its signature by relevant Ministers. The MOD will continue in effect for three years, be reviewed annually and be modified by mutual consent. The Hon Peter Reith, MPThe Hon Dr David Kemp, MP Minister for Employment,Minister for Education, Workplace Relations and Small BusinessTraining and Youth Affairs March 1999March 1999 The Hon John Anderson, MP Minister for Transport and Regional Services March 1999 Holsworthy Correctional Centre: Disciplinary Action (Question No. 611)  Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 May 1999: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 551 (Hansard, 12 May 1999, page 4343) about Holsworthy Correctional Centre, was the use of Defence Force Corrective Establishment standing orders as a means of indicating new punishments referred to in the Department of Defence's submission to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into military justice procedures; if not, why not. (2) What is the head of power in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 that allows for the development of new punishments. (3) Have the standing orders provided for new punishments. (4) What is the specific standing order covering attitude adjustment training. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The use of the Defence Force Corrective Establishment standing orders as a means of indicating new punishments was not referred to in the Department of Defence's submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Inquiry into Military Justice Procedures in the Australian Defence Force. Punishments that follow from the formal disciplinary process are prescribed in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and there is no other source or authority for the imposition of punishments. The Defence Force Corrective Establishment is a military establishment that has a role in the implementation of certain sentences awarded to Australian Defence Force members by Service Tribunals. The Defence Force Corrective Establishment standing orders are not a means of indicating new punishments and have no relevance to the formal disciplinary procedures of sentence established by the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. As the Defence Force Corrective Establishment cannot in itself award sentences to Australian Defence Force members, its standing orders were not referred to in that context in the submission to the Inquiry. (2) Only Service Tribunals under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 may award disciplinary punishments as prescribed by the Act. There is no head of power that permits a Service Tribunal or a Defence entity, such as the Defence Force Corrective Establishment, to develop and impose new punishments. Development of new punishments requires legislative amendment. (3) The Defence Force Corrective Establishment standing orders do not provide for new punishments, nor were they intended to provide for punishments in terms of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. The standing order provision for 'Discipline Tours', which over time transformed into 'Attitude Adjustment Training', was solely intended to familiarise selected Australian Defence Force members with the procedures involved in serving detention at the Defence Force Corrective Establishment should they later be awarded detention by a Service Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. (4) The Defence Force Corrective Establishment standing orders of June 1996 at Annex B to Chapter 5 included a flow-chart relating to Discipline Tour procedures. In December 1996, the Defence Force Corrective Establishment was subsumed by the Military Police School. The Military Police School standing orders were amended to incorporate the operation of the Defence Force Corrective Establishment, and its standing orders included staff duty statements which detailed instructions for conducting Discinor pline Tours. Discipline Tours were suspended in July 1997 and all reference to Discipline Tours was deleted from subsequent standing orders. The practice of Discipline Tours or Attitude Adjustment training has not been undertaken since July 1997, is there any proposal to reintroduce the practice.",172
