2,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) raised as a matter of privilege comments reportedly made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in respect of the Speaker, and me Deputy Speaker. The honourable member I quoted from provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, and he presented copies of media reports referring to the remarks allegedly made by the Prime Minister. Section 6 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 abolished the previous offence of contempt by defamation by providing that words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence against the House by reason only that the words or acts are defamatory. It is still possible, however, for conduct, including the use of words, to constitute a contempt if it amounts or is intended or is likely to amount to an improper interference with the free exercise by a house or a committee of its authorities or functions or with the free performance by a member of the member's duty as a member. The honourable member's complaint puts me in a difficult position in that I am one of the members who have been subject to the alleged attempted intimidation. Despite this difficulty, as Acting Speaker. I am required to give a decision as to whether in my opinion a prima facie case has been made out. Having considered the arguments of the honourable member for Flinders, I have to advise the House that I do not believe anything improper has occurred or that there is evidence of attempt to intimidate either the Speaker or me. The House is indeed a robust place, and is no doubt unlikely that any occupant of the chair will be immune from criticism outside the chamber in respect of his or her performance in the House. I believe, however, that it would only be in exceptional circumstances that criticism of the occupant of the chair would give rise to a substantive issue of privilege or contempt. I do not believe that on this occasion there is prima facie evidence of a of privilege or contempt, so I am not willing to allow precedence to a motion on the matter. I call the honourable member for Flinders, by indulgence.",11
3,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I appreciate that so early in the day today we have had the benefit of your views on the matter that I raised yesterday. as Given your remarks yesterday, I suppose that was not surprised at the outcome. It is not a ruling that you have made, and that curtails our opportunities to take the matter further today. I am disappointed in the manner in which you have approached this particular issue. You say that you considered the arguments. With great respect, Mr Acting Speaker, you conspicuously did not consider the arguments because you did not give me an opportunity to put the arguments yesterday. You specifically said that all I could do was to table the documents supporting the submission. You specifically upheld a point of order from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) which prevented my putting to you the case that I believed provided a firm foundation for the argument that I thought ought to have been considered by you in a more favourable light. The opposition raised the matter yesterday not just in light of the particular remarks that were made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to you and, in his absence, to the Speaker but also in light of the conduct of question time and the government's approach to the proceedings of the House. I suppose it has long been a complaint from oppositions that they do not get a fair go in the parliament. I suppose it is also true that an the public has a fairly cynical view of our complaints about conduct of the proceedings. But the fact is-and you ought to know this, Mr Acting Speaker, given your family backit ground-that standards in this parliament have deteriorated significantly.",11
4,Mr GEAR,PRIVILEGE,Especially on the opposition side.,11
5,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,"It is a classic remark from the boy-the Assistant Treasurer--overthere that it is all the fault of the opposition. The fact is that the standards in this place are set by the Prime Minister. People talk about rule changes. No rule changes are required to lift standards in this parliament. That is the fact of the matter. Do not accuse us of party political point scoring. It is a matter of great regret for every member of this House that the standards of this House have fallen in the way in which they have. It is true that a lot of parents would hesitate to bring their children into the galleries of this place and hear Mr Gutter, our Prime Minister, perform as he does. That is the context, Mr Acting Speaker. Let me just remind members of some incidents last year. Following the 1993 election, we had a change in the speakership. I suppose we were hopeful and optimistic that a change in the speakership would see a lifting of standards in the parliament. I note that back on 4 May 1993 a newspaper article states that the new Speaker: ... proposed several changes to improve parliais mentary procedures: It was time the Government responded to a report by a procedures committee that had suggestconcerns ed limits be set on the length of ministerial swers. An interesting reflection, given that ministerial answers have considerably lengthened in the last couple of years. The Canberra Times, in an editorial on the same day, 4 May 1993, had this to say: The last Parliament was largely a farce because the mismanagement of the then Speaker,. Leo MCLeay. Mr Keating's bonds with Mr MCLeay meant that no amount of inept or partisan manship by Mr MCLeay could count against him. Mr MCLeay will be replaced today by Stephen Martin. Mr Martin has an opportunity to dignity of the chamber. Ifhe is to take it up, it will be primarily by restraining the Government rather than by keeping the Opposition down. The great possibility coming from the Martin appointment that he is the first Speaker in 17 years to higher political ambitions. Whether he can achieve them depends on his performance; the more the chairman and the less the cheer leader, the more likely he is to prosper. Not only his own career is in the balance. The Government has little to gain from abuse of the Chamber ... By the time we get to October 1993, this is what the Sydney Morning Herald has to say under the headline 'Sidelining the Speaker': The Federal Parliament is an institution which is run on precedent. I might add as an aside: I refer to these third party comments because I know that they carry greater weight with a. lot of people because they are independent comments. It continues: Because of this, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Stephen Martin, should resign from his position-in accordance with the Cope precedent-following the ruthless and humiliating action by the Prime Minister to use the Labor Party's majority in the House of Representativesto vote down new television broadcast rules which had been announced by Mr Martin only 18 hours earlier. The effect of the Prime Minister's action is to destroy the credibility of the Speaker's position. The implication is that the Speaker-who represents all MPs-must tailor his reforms to fit what is deemed to be the interest of the Government. That was said in October 1993. My concern, and the reason we raised the matter yesterday, that the reports of the Prime Minister's behaviour coming out of this week's caucus meeting fit exactly within the criteria and the expressed by that editorial. In other anwords, the impressi<;>n clearly is obtained that the Prime Minister exerts his influence and authority over you as a member of the caucus to ensure that he gets the results he wants in the parliament. That, of course, brings the parliament into disrepute. I do not say much about the substance of the Prime Minister's concerns. It was quite of incredible. It was a case of the wolf blaming the sheep for him to be attacking the Speaker. chairThat says a lot about the arrogance of the Prime Minister. It just shows you how he has not learnt anything out of the Canberra byrestore the election result on Saturday. But, leaving that aside, our concern is with the proper functioning of the parliament and is the maintaining of some order in and respect have for the high office of Speaker. Not for our own party political interests but for the sake of a well-functioning democracy, it is important that the office of Speaker be accorded the respect which it is due. 'I refer to your attendance at the caucus meeting earlier this week. The fact of the matter is that, when Sir Billy Snedden was the Speaker, he did not attend Liberal Party parliamentary meetings or caucus meetings. The reason he did not was that he was keen to .ensure, as much as possible within our party political system, that he was seen to operate as an independent Speaker. The one thing I would agree with the Prime Minister on-the sad truth of the matter-is that no Speaker since Sir Billy Snedden has matched the standards which he set for independence as the Speaker. That was the Prime Minister's remark. I would not suggest, however, that you take any notice of his injunction to you that people ought to be thrown out of the parliament more regularly. In fact, it was because he had a ty and was held in respect by most members of the parliament that the then Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, did not have to throw people out. The figures in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning show that Billy Snedden, who was Speaker for seven years, threw out nine people, an average of nearly one a year. Harry Jenkins was Speaker for around three years and he averaged three a year. Joan Child was Speaker for 18 months and she averaged nearly one a month. Leo MCLeay was Speaker for three and a bit years and he averaged one every three months. The current Speaker has averaged seven ejections in less than two years. It is a sad reflection on the parliament and on the way the Labor Party treats the parliament that the standards have degenerated. A sort of philosophical underpinning of that is that the Labor Party has long taken the view that, if you get the numbers, basically it is a winner takes all proposition, that you can use your numbers and the end justifies the means. You have never accepted one of the great principles upon which our democracy is founded; that is, the principle of the balance of power and a system of checks and balances. It is our view on this side of ment that the institution of the parliament and the way the parliament is run are a check and a balance against the abuse of executive power. Even though we may not have the numbers, we do have the conventions, the practices and the great traditions of this parliament to operate as a check against the abuses of people like the Prime Minister. It is a sad day when we read in the papers how you have been bounced around the caucus by a Prime Minister so that he can dictate to you the way in which you operate as the Speaker. This goes right down to the swearing in of Brendan Smyth, I was told this morning about it and I presume it is the case-someone one can deny it if it is not. Brendan Smyth on Saturday won a great by-election. The precedent is that, if the writs are declared when the House is sitting, you get sworn in at 3 o'clock in the full glare of the publicity so that the Prime Minister can get lot of authoriup and congratulate you. But, no, unlike Martyn Evans, for example, who came in at a by-election and who got sworn in at 3 o'clock with all the hoopla that went with it, the Liberal candidate is going to be sworn in at an earlier hour, at 12.30-very neatly divorcing his presence from that of the Prime Minister and the embarrassment that that would entail. I am told that is the precedent and that is what is happening. I can only assume that from on high the Prime Minister has given somebody marching orders as to how he would like the parliament organised today to suit his political convenience. I do not draw on this as an example, but I would have to say that someone was very quick on his feet this week. I wondered at the time what was upMr Bevis-I take a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. The shadow minister is speaking by indulgence that you have provided him in relation to the matters that you have spoken about this morning. He is now digressing from that issue to talk about other matters. I think he has now had the floor for in excess of 10 minutes by indulgence, and I would put it to you that, firstly, he should restrict himself to those issues that you have addressed yourself to and, secondly, he should the parlia- be asked to resume his seat.",11
6,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! I make the remark that it is correct that I have given the indulgence. I make the observation that my indulgence is starting to be limited by my capacity to absorb the generous advice that the honourable member for Flinders is giving me. I hope that he has come to his last point and that he will conclude, because I think I have given him a fair go. He is starting now to transgress across even further territory his submission to me yesterday. I just hope that he will now quickly come to a conclusion.",13
7,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I have to say that you have given me a fair go, and I do not mind telling you I am nearing the end of my remarks.",14
8,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I hope it is a quick conclusion.,14
9,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,"I conclude-as I was intending to anyway-with a reference back to the newspaper reports which brought this matter on in the first place. One in particular caught my eye. I did not read it out yesterday but the report in the Daily Telegraph Mirror, after further recounting the threats of the Prime Minister, said, 'Caucus sources said the Prime Minister had been mesmerising and at his best. ' Mr MCGauran-This is sycophantic.",14
10,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,It is sycophantic; it is sickening.,14
11,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I hope you are coming to that end quickly.,14
12,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,"I am coming to the end. The point I make to you, Mr Acting Speaker, is that we all know the Prime Minister is an aggressive personality but, ultimately, each and everyone of us has certain responsibilities to our electorate and to the institution the parliament, and we would like to see you exercise your full responsibilities. We are very concerned that this parliament's reputation in the Australian community has fallen to a new low. The incidents of the Prime Minister only give rise to concern in the public that rather than your high office being conducted in accordance with the great traditions of this place it is back subject to ence. There is that great quote of the Prime Minister about how he found Laurie Brereton on the street and he could put him back any time he wanted to.",14
13,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The honourable member for Flinders has stretched my indulgence.,14
14,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,"That is the fact of it. I conthan clude my remarks, Mr Acting Speaker. The fact of the matter is that we will come back to the issue. We have not been happy with the conduct of the parliament, and in particular question time, and we intend to continue to make this an issue until Mr Arrogance gives us and sets a higher standard.",14
15,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The honourable member should not use those terms.,14
16,Mr REID,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Acting Speaker, with indulgence?",14
17,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"No; I am sorry. If it is to take up these matters again, given the amount of time. I have given by indulgence",14
18,Mr REID,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I wanted to put the case to you that the arguments that the honourable member for Flinders was about to put to the House were overruled; in fact he did not have the opportunity to put those arguments.",14
19,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The honourable member will resume his seat. NA NA Conduct of Speaker,14
20,Mr CADMAN,SPEAKER," Mr Acting Speaker, I have a question to you. It is on the same topic. I wish you to give me an assurance that you will take note of previous of rulings, particularly of Speaker Child in regard to Mr Tuckey and me in regard to comments we made outside this place on the conduct of the Speaker, when you come to consider this matter again. The case is exactly parallel arid, if we are going to have a standard set, I suggest to you that you have to consider this matter in its broadest context, or otherwise we will slag you and the Speaker in influthe same way as the Prime Minister does.",14
21,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Order!,14
22,Mr CADMAN,SPEAKER,Why don't you set the standards?,14
23,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Mitchell should take it quietly. The reference in my comments in reply in the case of the honourable member for Flinders yesterday was to changes in the Parliamentary Privileges Act. It is my understanding that that covers his concerns.,15
24,Mr CADMAN,SPEAKER,So we can behave like the Prime Minister does. . Mr Acting SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Mitchell!,15
25,Mr CADMAN,SPEAKER,It is open slather.,15
26,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"Order! I warn the honourable member for Mitchell! BAUME, SENATOR MICHAEL",15
27,Mr WILLIS,SPEAKER,"I move: That the House: (1) notes that(a) the Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence punishable by 2 years imprisonment or a fine of up to $10,000 or both, for the unauthorised disclosure of a person's tax file number; (b) Senator Baume during the adjournment debate in the other place on 23 March 1995 tabled documents concerning the taxation affairs of Dr Peter Macdonald, which documents also contained his tax file number; (c) Senator Baume's only purpose in tabling these documents was to impugn the integrity of Dr Macdonald before the New South Wa1es State election in which Dr Macdona1d was an independent candidate; (d) Senator Baume, in seeking the leave of the duty Minister and the Senate to table the documents in question, did not draw attention to the tax file number identified therein, publication of which otherwise than under cover of parliamentary privilege would be a criminal offence; and (e) the New South Wales Premier, Mr Fahey, has publicly stated that he had been aware of Dr Macdona1d's taxation problem, understood the circumstances of it and had undertaken to Dr Macdonald not to raise the issue publicly; (2) condemns Senator Baume for his(a) commission of an act, the disclosure of Dr Macdonald's tax file number, which would have been a crime if done outside the Parliament; and (b) blatant indefensible disregard, for reasons of political advantage rather than any larger public interest, of the privacy of an individual; and (3) calls upon Senator Baume to apologise for his behaviour to (a) Dr Macdonald and (b) the Parliament. Clearly, from the terms of that motion, it is a very serious matter indeed. I think we all realise that parliament is a robust place and we expect to give and take a fair bit. I think, by any measure, the actions of Senator Baume last week in the Senate went beyond the reasonable bounds of behaviour; indulging in what, by any other person, would be a criminal action and, in fact, which may be' criminal action by Senator Bimme. himself. Last Thursday, in the adjournment debate, Senator Baume got up at 7.40 p.m - right at the end of the parliamentary sitting day-and, in his terms, 'dropped a bucket' on the Independent member for Manly in the New South Wales state parliament, Dr Peter Macdonald, just two days before the state election in which Dr Macdonald was a candidate. The nature of the bucket was that there was a letter from the Australian Taxation Office to Dr Macdonald regarding his tax affairs which followed a tax audit. It was a private letter from the tax office to Dr Macdonald, advising him of substantial adjustments to his tax assessment for the years 1984 to 1988 which considerably increased his taxable income for all of those years, thereby requiring him to pay substantial additional tax. The letter from the tax office also contained his tax file number, divulgement of which is a criminal offence. Altogether, this was a particularly nasty, disgraceful and appalling piece of conduct. Why did Senator Baume do it? According to his remarks in the Senate, he did it because he expected that Dr Macdonald's supporters were about to 'drop a bucket' on the Liberal candidate for the seat of Manly in the election that followed two days later. He was simply retaliating in advance, as it were. In expectation that this was going to happen, he was making sure that he got in and had a bucket dropped on Dr Macdonald. Of course, no such bucket was dropped on the Liberal candidate. So the action that he was seeking to counteract in his explanation is an action which never occurred. He acknowledged on ABC radio the next day that he understood the local paper, the Manly Daily, would be the source of this bucket job and that when he made his attack on Dr Macdonald in the Senate he was not aware that the Manly Daily was not going to proceed with its intention. So we have him assuming an intention on the part of the Manly Daily to do some heinous act in relation to the Liberal candidate and then saying that he was not aware that the paper was not going to proceed with this intention that he somehow assumed was going to be there. It all sounds very implausible. Whether there was ever any such intention by the Manly Daily or whether it was just a trumped up cover for a cowardly attack on Dr Macdonald's integrity, the fact remains it was a heinous action for Senator Baume to undertake. Even if he had good reason for his expected belief about what may be about to occur-and he gave no evidence for that whatever-to put it at its very simplest: two wrongs do not make a right. In any case, the wrong he was seeking to counteract never occurred. The nature of the wrong on Senator Baume's part is absolutely very substantial indeed. Let there be no doubt about the wrong perpetrated by Senator Baume: his actions engaged in by anyone outside this place would amount to criminal behaviour and may even amount to criminal behaviour by him. I want to refer to two tax minutes from the Australian Taxation Office that I have received on this matter, and I am quite happy to table them if the opposition would like to see them. Mr Reith-Can I have a copy now?",15
28,Mr WILLIS,SPEAKER,You can. I seek leave to table them. Leave granted.,16
29,Mr WILLIS,SPEAKER,"The first of these is dated 24 March, is addressed to me and is headed 'Use of TFN information by Senator Baume'. I will not refer to every part of it but I will refer to all the key parts. It says: The taxation law creates certain criminal offences for the collection, use and disclosure of TFNs. These offences are capable of applying to any person. There are also provisions which prevent the use and disclosure of taxation· information. Section 8WB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence for a person to divulge or communicate another person's tax file number unless there is authority to do so under a taxation or other Commonwealth law. The penalties for a breach of this provision are a fine of $10,000 or 2 years imprisonment or both. The TFN guidelines issued under the Privacy Act 1988 provide a similar obligation not to communicate or divulge TFNs. A breach of the TFN Guidelines is a breach of the Privacy Act which can be investigated by the Privacy Commissioner. Section 8XB of the Taxation Administration Act creates an offence for any person to communicate information about another person's taxation affairs in certain circumstances. Section 16 of the Income Tax AssessmentAct 1936 creates a similar secrecy obligation to prevent taxation officers from communicating information about the taxation· affairs of taxpayers. It goes on: The tabling of the information, which I understand included a TFN, by Senator Baume is prima facie an offence under section 8WB and possibly of section 8XB. However, I understand that parliamentary privilege would be relevant here and would prevent prosecution against the Senator. Nevertheless, it is possible that offences may have been committed under sections 8XB or 8WB by the person or persons who divulged the information to the Senator. I have commenced an internal ATO investigation to examine whether there has been a breach by ATO officers of the secrecy provisions in the taxation legislation referred to above. There is nothing at this stage to suggest an offence has been committed by a taxation officer. I am considering whether the matter will be referred to the Privacy Commissioner, Australian Federal Police or the Director of Public Prosecutions for further investigations. Obviously this was a matter that the Acting Commissioner, whom this minute is from, of the Australian Taxation Office took extremely seriously indeed, pointing out that major offences of the tax act would be involved if this action was taken outside parliamentary privilege. Four days later, on 28 March, I received another minute from the Australian Taxation Office, this time addressed to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), but copied to me, which is quite normal practice. It is headed 'Use of tax file number information by Senator Baume'. Again, I will refer to the key points. It says: In particular, Section 8WB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence for a person to maintain, divulge or communicate another person's TFN unless there is authority to do so under a taxation or other Commonwealth law. The penalties for a breach of this provision are a fine of $10,000 or 2 years imprisonment or both. Following the tabling of the information by Senator Baume, the ATO immediately instituted an internal investigation into the matter. As a result that investigation, I am satisfied that there is nothing to indicate that an officer of the ATO or any other Commonwealth Government Agency has breached section 8WB or any other secrecy provisions in relation to this matter. There has, however, clearly been a breach of section 8WB and that breach has a number of dimensions: a) the divulging of the information, which included a TFN to Senator Baume; b) the maintenance (i.,e., holding) of that information by the Senator; and c) the disclosure of that information by the Senator. Further, I understand that a number of journalists may have obtained the TFN before the Tabling Office disguised it in the document tabled. They may also be in breach of section 8WB by holding that information, whether they divulge it to any other person or not. In the circumstances, I have decided to refer these matters to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for further examination. Under established procedures a draft letter will be forwarded to the Treasurer for referral to the AFP through the Minister for Justice. This is clearly a matter which in this second minute becomes even more serious. There is more emphasis on the fact that, simply by holding the information-obtained from whatever source-about that person's tax file number, an offence has possibly been committed. That is a very important additional development and one which Senator Baume would do well to take considerable note of. Senator Baume's action is obviously exceedingly serious. It undoubtedly amounts to disgraceful behaviour and, indeed, criminal behaviour, for which Senator Baume relies on parliamentary privilege for protection. His action amounts to criminal behaviour for which any other person could be up for two years in gaol, a $10,000 fine or both. In fact, the issue really is whether parliamentary privilege extends to cover Senator Baume for holding and maintaining this number. Senator Baume's attitude to this has been to not apologise for the release of Dr Macdonald's tax information. He gave the excuse that it was only an intended retaliation for something that may have occurred but, in fact, never did. Senator Baume has expressed of ignorance that the documents contained a tax file number. He said the documents referred to a file number and had 'our reference' rather than 'tax file number' or 'TFN' on them. He said that, when he realised the documents contained a tax file number, he acted to have it removed from the documents-that is, after the documents had been tabled in the Senate and at least three journalists had obtained copies of them. Clearly, Senator Baume should not have tabled the documents with the tax file number on them. In his desperation to drop a bucket on Dr Macdonald, Senator Baume was not concerned about the impact on Dr Macdonald's privacy. He should have realised that a file number from the tax office could well be a tax file number, and he should have removed it from the documents before tabling them. But he did not do so. It should also be noted in this connection that, just by receiving and holding the documents with the tax file number on them, Senator Baume would appear to have breached the Taxation Administration Act. Holding information is an offence and revealing it is another offence. It is also interesting to consider who supplied this information. Senator Baume has not said how he obtained these documents, but whoever gave them to him was clearly acting illegally by holding Dr Macdonald's tax file number and revealing it to Senator Baume. Whoever gave that information to Senator Baume has committed a criminal offence. There is absolutely no doubt about that. Apparently, the New South Wales Liberal Party knew of Dr Macdonald's tax assessment revisions a couple of years ago but, according to statements by Premier Fahey in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 March and by Dr Macdonald on ABC radio, Dr Macdonald was given a clear undertaking that this tax issue would not be raised publicly. Of course, it all happened at the very last minute in this election campaign through Senator Baume's disgraceful actions. Under whose auspices was Senator Baume acting? Why did he do it? He obviously did it for political advantage. Was he acting entirely on his own behalf or was he acting with information of other people? It is particularly important for this House know, through this debate, what information the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) had about this matter. Everybody knows that Senator Baume is a close friend of the Leader of the Opposition. It is very important for us to know what the Leader of the Opposition actually knew about what Senator Baume was doing. Did he agree that Senator Baume should be able to undertake this criminal action? Or was it something he had never heard of? Even if he had not heard of it beforehandthat is doubtful-why has he not said anything since? It has been one week since this happened and, as far as I am aware, there has not been one statement from the Leader of the Opposition condemning Senator Baume's actions. That is the most extraordinary thing. You would think that honest John would be very concerned about the fact that one of his parliamentary colleagues had undertaken criminal action in the parliament and had cooperated with people who had undertaken criminal action by giving him that information. You would think that honest John would be very concerned about that and would make a statement distancing himself, and the opposition generally, from such action. But has there been any such statement? No, there has not. There has not been any dissociation at all. Here is the chance today, one week after the event, for the Leader of the Opposition to so dissociate himself from and to condemn Senator Baume. You would wonder why he would have to wait for this substantive motion to come before the parliament to do it but I invite him to come into this House and make that statement today so that we know, albeit somewhat late. in the piece, that he is prepared to say that this is an action for which his parliamentary colleague should be condemned. He should join us in supporting this motion because he knows, as everyone opposite knows, that this action is so utterly reprehensible and indefensible that, in conscience, they shouJd join us on this side in supporting this motion and should not seek to divide the House on it. We have seen the most appalling and to amazing developments in·recent times. There were the actions of the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who is sitting up the back, in relation to the Aboriginal affairs document relating to the Hindmarsh Island bridge case. That was amazing: interference with other people's mail; photocopying eight kilos of documents clearly not his. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition keeps going around, saying that the member for Barker acted honourably. Acted honourablyphotostatting eight kilos of somebody else's mail. and then disseminating it all over the place! That was a disgraceful and clearly reprehensible action, and he is now rightly on the back bench. Here we have another case of somebody else's mail being interfered with. This opposition seems to be breaking into people's mail all the time. How did they get hold of this letter, which was Dr Macdonald's personal mail? Is it going around breaking into people's mail all the time and then divulging it publicly? Leaving aside the divulging of the tax file number, the breaking in was a disgraceful enough action in itself because it goes to the privacy of the individual. When the tax file number issue came before this parliament in 1988 there was an enormous debate about privacy. The opposition made a lot of noise about the need to ensure that tax file numbers would not interfere with individual privacy. It made a lot of noise about how it had demanded changes to the original proposal so that the privacy of the individual would be protected. Yet here is an opposition senator clearly quite prepared to disregard totally the issue of privacy, not only in relation to a taxpayer's tax commitment as decided by the tax office-which is disgraceful enough-but also in relation to the tax file number itself, which he revealed. Coming from an opposition that has expressed an extraordinary amount of concern about privacy, that was a disgraceful action indeed. I hope the Leader of the Opposition will take advantage of this debate to come in and condemn Senator Baume for his action. If he does not, we can only assume that he agrees that Senator Baume is acting in an okay way and that he is not at all concerned about the criminaL action of his colleague. That would be an extraordinary development and one which would condemn the Leader of the Opposition as a person, who, for all time, will be a joke when the reference is made to 'honest John'.",16
30,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"The opposition rejects this motion. This is just a trumped up charge, and you know it. The fact is that the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) showed it, because he had 20 minutes given to him and he spent seven on the substance of the matter and spent the rest trying to score a political point. That is how he treated it. You would have run this issue yesterday, Ralph, but you were so uncertain about the merits of it that you had to wait until you were told by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to get down into the House and get stuck into Senator Baume. Senator Baume is a widely respected and liked senator, with a good reputation. Let us face the facts. You are into Senator Baume for one reason, and that is that he has been on to the Prime Minister and his pigs for years and he has been absolutely under the Prime Minister's skin. That is the fact of it; that is the motive of it. It is just a piggery cover-up. Your only other motive is that you are so worried about John Howard's successful return to the leadership that you thought you would have a shot at him as well, just for good measure. It was such a transparent, lacklustre effort by the Treasurer that it barely calls for a response. What a humiljating performance we saw from the Treasurer. This is just a payback for the fact that Senator Baume has been asking a very simple question: how come a bloke who has been on an MP's salary since he was 26 has been able to accumulate assets more relevant to and more likely to be accumulated by the get-rich-quick merchants of the 1980s? Explain how the Prime Minister can have millions of dollars worth of property in Sydney when he has spent most of his time in politics on a backbencher's salary. That is Senator Baume's crime. That is basically the charge behind this matter. Mr Horne- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The matter for debate is clearly defined on the front page of the Notice Paper. At this stage we have not heard the matter addressed at all. Eight minutes have gone. Would you ask the speaker to return to the debate.",19
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Mr Newell)There is no point of order.,19
32,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"Only three minutes have gone. We on this side did not come down in the last shower. We know when you guys are after one of ours and when you have a trumped up charge. I do start with that matter because people have to know the truth of the matter. The fact is that there is nothing in it. I am going to demonstrate, in an absolutely resounding way, why it is that this motion ought to be thrown out. It will not be, but the truth of the matter is that it ought to be. One pointer to the fact that this motion ought to be thrown out is that it could not get through the Senate. The proper place for this motion is the Senate. I see we have the two Independents in the House. Let me speak to them for a moment. Mr Cleary-How privileged we are.",19
33,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"In respect of the member for Wills, it would be a privilege for me to spend my time speaking to him. I have more time for the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), mainly because he is retiring. This motion simply could not get through the Senate because the Senate, after a fair-minded appraisal of the issues by the Independent senators, came to a different conclusion. I honestly thought the government would have amended this motion before bringing it into the House today. By way of a preliminary point on the facts, which is important, the Treasurer was right to focus on only one issue. He focused on only one issue and that was the question of the tax file number. Nothing that the Treasurer said referred to the question of other documentation. Tax documents were tabled, not tax returns.",19
34,Mr WILLIS,SPEAKER,That is totally untrue.,20
35,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"No, the whole thrust of what you have to say is that it is an offence to disclose the tax file number. That is the basis of your argument.",20
36,Mr WILLIS,SPEAKER,And to hold it.,20
37,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"And to hold it, fair enough. I just make that point. This is not an argument based on a last-minute bucket job done by Senator Baume. It is not on the basisMr Hollis-Of course, it is.",20
38,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"I have read the Treasurer's paper, and I listened to his speech. The whole basis of this relies upon a tax file number, which is an important factual point to get on the record at the start. There are three reasons why this motion ought to be thrown out. Firstly, it is an abuse of process-and I will quote House ofRepresentatives Practice in a moment to substantiate that point. Secondly, on its merits, I believe this motion is unworthy. Thirdly, the motives behind this motion are so transparent that I encourage the two Independent members to give it very careful consideration. To make a very strong point, I refer the member for North Sydney and the member for Wills to page 347 of House of Representatives Practice where it states: A motion of censure of a private Member has been moved on only one occasion. The motion was agreed to. A motion has been agreed to censuring the Leader of the National Party, then in opposition, for conduct unworthy of a Member. On a further occasion a motion was put to the House condemning the Leader of the National Party for reflecting on the Speaker, but the motion was withdrawn, by leave, after the Leader had apologised for and withdrawn his remarks. On a number of occasions a motion of censure of the Leader of the Opposition, or an amendment expressing censure in the form of an alternative proposition, has been agreed to. This is the particularly relevant point, gentlemen, and I encourage you to note it. The House of Representatives Practice states: These are considered to be bad precedents. Such resolutions, as distinct from a resolution of the House suspending or expelling a Member, are of no substantive effect and are only regarded as an expression of opinion by the House. A motion in the form of a censure of a Member, such as the Leader of the Opposition, not being a member of the Executive Government, is not consistent with the parliamentary convention that the purpose of a vote of censure is to question or bring to account a Minister's responsibility to the House. Furthermore, given the relative strength of the parties in the House, and the strength of party loyalties, in ordinary circumstances it could be expected that a motion or amendment expressing censure ... would be agreed to, perhaps regardless of the circumstances or the merits ... This whole process is to bring the executive to account. According to the House of Representatives Practice, this motion, if passed, would be bad precedent. There is only one precedent, and that is because the House in the past has not been prepared to use this process in the way proposed by the government. Regardless of the balance of the matter, I put it particularly to the Independent members that, whatever you think of the merits, a new process should not be hereby developed. The rules and conventions on this matter are absolutely clear. The only other precedent which is worth referring to is the one in respect of a senator being the subject of such a motion from the House. On a trip to Singapore, Senator Sim made some remarks which were apparently racist in their tone. On that occasion, the House repudiated the sentiments of what the senator had to say. That is the only precedent that might be relied upon for this motion. As I say, that should be differentiated on the basis that it related to the sentiments which might otherwise be attributed to his remarks. In respect of process, if this motion is passed, this would simply be an abuse of processand that is very clear authority. Mr Cleary interjecting",20
39,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"They may mean nothing to you., Mr Cleary interjecting",20
40,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"Sure, the answer to that question is that the precedents give you guide to the practice and conventions of parliament. I do not put it any stronger you. If you want to change the nature of process which has been used to bring the said wasexecutive to account, you are obviously going to do so. But, whatever you say, it is a subdone. stantial point. The second matter goes to the merits of the issue. The motion, firstly, condemns Senator Baume. In fact, when the senators considered this matter with a more independent flavour to the debate, they changed that. They plored his actions; that is true. But they referred to his negligence in tabling adocuwith ment, whereas this motion refers to the the condemnation of Senator Baume for his commission of an act. In fact, the Treasurer went further and said that it amounted to criminal offence but for the parliamentary privilege. That is a gross exaggeration. In this country you are innocent until proven gUilty. The fact is, as I want to show in a moment, that the release of the tax file number detail was entirely inadvertent and therefore the suggestion which is behind this whole mohe tion-the allegation that this was a deliberate act, a deliberate revelation, in breach Commonwealth act, of a tax file number-is totally false. Furthermore, the resolution of the Senate and the motion in this House call on Baume to apologise for his behaviour. He admits that the TFN was revealed and he has apologised for it. The precedent in this House in such circumstances where such a motion is before the House and the member then proit ceeds to apologise is that the motion is withaware drawn. On that basis the motion ought to withdrawn. It is quite clear. His letter of apology has been tabled and on that basis, respect of the restricted matter of the TFN, this motion ought to be withdrawn. The other thing which on its merits ought to be noted is that what happened in the Senate-the Treasurer failed conspicuously mention this-is that Senator Baume spoke in the chamber and then sought leave of the minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), the document. She did not just peremptorily a review the document; she studied it. Then she the on behalf of the government as the dutY to minister, gave the consent-the leave-for the the tabling of the document. What Senator Evans Mr Cleary-Tell us what you would have",21
41,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"I will tell you what Senator Evans said. He has completely removed the argument for this motion. He said: It certainly was not immediately apparent,dehe is talking about the tax file numberthe kind of scrutiny that documents sought to be tabled are usually given by duty ministers, that 'file number' referred to in one of the documents was the individual's tax file number. a The point he is making is that the document did not say 'tax file number' . Mrs Bishop--It says, 'our file number'.",21
42,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"It says 'our file number'. Thank you. So it did not say 'tax file number'. But the minister looked at it in exactly the same way as Senator Baume diddid not realise it was a tax file number any more than the minister did-and she then of a gave him consent. If Senator Baume has committed a heinous offence, quite frankly the motion ought to be amended and condemnation of Senator Crowley ought to be added Senator into it. It is as clear as that. There is no doubt that Senator Baume made a mistake-and he has apologised for it-and that that number should not have been disclosed. But he did not at the time realise that was a tax file number. As soon as he was of it, he took immediate steps, without be any prompting, to ensure that that document did not go any further. It really is as simple in as that. This was an unfortunate but inadvertent disclosure of a number. It was not obvious on the face of the document that it was a tax file number. It was tabled with the consent of the government. The senator has done to a reasonable thing in terms of attempting to curtail or limit its distribution. He has apologised to Dr Macdonald for this issue of the tax file number, and that basically ought to be for the tabling of the end of it. The reason it is not the end of it is: firstly, you people want to abuse the processes of parliament; and, secondly, you are not prepared to accept that the proper place for this is the Senate where there has already been a resolution. Like the thugs you are, you are going to use your numbers down here to put through a motion which you could not get through in the Senate under independent and reasonable scrutiny. That is the fact of the matter. On that basis, this motion ought to be chucked out. (Time expired)",21
43,Mr GEAR,SPEAKER,"How embarrassed you must feel! The first 15 minutes of your contribution in this House you lectured us about propriety, about how we should uphold the standards of this place, and the second 15 minutes you were trying to defend what is the indefensible. You know in your heart that what Senator Baume did in the Senate last Thursday night was rotten, it was grubby, it was underhanded and, for all intents and purposes, it is probably criminal as well. The holding of a tax file number, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has pointed out, clearly, on our advice, breaches the tax laws. An investigation will be held into that and we will see where the senator stands. I want to say a few things about the tax file number, the integrity of it, and the part it plays in the tax system. Mr Reith-You can't think of anything to substantiate the motion.",22
44,Mr GEAR,SPEAKER,"I can say a lot more than you ever said. What an embarrassing old performance you gave, racing through the Hansard and the House of Representatives Practiceanything but talk about what Senator Baume did. I do not blame you for that. I would hate to have to stand up as you had to and defend this-because it is indefensible, and you know it. The tax file number is the mostconfidential piece of information in a person's financial affairs. It is the number that identifiesMr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Throughout this speech and throughout the previous speech the member for Gilmore has carried on a tirade of objections. They have' been most unparliamentary. He has been using language that should never be allowed. He has been accusing people of being criminals, and it should not be allowed. I ask you to warn the member for Gilmore and tell him that he is not entitled to carryon the way he is at the moment.",22
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Mr Newell)This matter is obviously creating some emotion on both sides of the House. I would ask members on both sides to restrain themselves.,22
46,Mr GEAR,SPEAKER,"As I was saying, the tax file number is the most important and most confidential number you should have in your financial affairs. It underpins the integrity of the tax system. To divulge a tax file number, as the Treasurer has rightly pointed out, carries substantial penalties-a $10,000 fine and two years gaol. That is for the holding and disclosing of a tax file number. As I said, that will be investigated. Senator Baume, when the Australian Federal Police do come around, should answer their questions truthfully, and we will see how he comes out of it. I have had experience with these things and I would like to relate that experience and the double standards held by the opposition when it comes to the disclosure of what it sees as privileged information. A number of years ago I sought some information from the then Minister for Health, Dr Blewett. I was inadvertently given what were said to be doctor provider numbers. There was abig hullabaloo about that. When I sought information from Dr Blewett, I never sought those numbers-I never got them-and I never disclosed any information from those documents. But when Or Blewett came into the parliament and said he had given me information from the Department of Health, there was a censure motion moved. It was moved by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. I went back through Hansard to see what standards he had then in his former role as the Leader of the Opposition. He said this: I cannot think of a greater abuse of privacy, a greater abuse of privilege or a greater abuse of confidentiality than that which this Ministerthat is Dr BLEWETT has engaged in on this occasion. In actual fact Dr Blewett never knew anything about it, because I went to a member of his staff. The point is that, even though none of this information was ever released publicly and the only thing the then Leader of the Opposition knew was that I had received some coded information from the Department of Health for which I had asked one of his staff, that was enough for the Leader of the Opposition to move a censure motion against the minister and me. A subsequent investigation into that matter cleared everybody of any allegations. They were the standards set back then by the Leader of the Opposition. I want to look at the standards set since John Howard has become Leader of the Opposition. What we are looking at now is a totally different set standards from that enunciated by the then Leader of the Opposition when he talked about my involvement with that information back in those days. Since Mr Howard has been the Leader of the Opposition, we have seen push polling in the Canberra by-election-one of the grubbiest, dirtiest election tactics you would ever see. Since he has been the Leader of the Opposition, we have had stolen documents being used by the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) in this House. Worse than that, confidential information was distributed to all of the media in Adelaide and to defence attorneys who were challenging the Commonwealth. Now, while he is the Leader of the Opposition, we have this trafficking in tax file numbers in the Senate-all for grubby political purposes. . The previous speaker, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), said that all we were interest-d in was the tax file number. We are interested in more than that. We are interested in the whole ethos of the way in which this opposition is' conducting itself. Those three instances that I outlined have all happened since John Howard became the Leader of the Opposition. At the next election, if John Howard is still the Leader of the Opposition, we will be in for the grubbiest, sleaziest election campaign in this country's history. You can see the way in which it is headed. Ever since he became Leader of the Opposition, we have had from the Liberal Party these underhand, dirty tricks all aimed at its opponents-but none of which, I venture to say, have been as sleazy as that which took place a week ago. As the Treasurer rightly pointed out, what has Mr Howard said about this latest episode, about his friend releasing somebody's private tax details and tax file number? Not a word. The double standards are appalling. I tum back to Dr Blewett. Anybody who knew Dr Blewett would know what a principled man he was. What did Mr Howard say about Dr Blewett and the information given to me? In the conclusion of his censure motion against Dr Blewett, Mr Howard said: . He should resign' and go forever from the front bench of this Government. That is what Mr Howard said about Neal of Blewett in 1988 when he was taking the high ground. What has Mr Howard said to Senator Baume? Nothing. I do not know why they call him honest John. I really do not know. It is dishonest John, because he has said nothing to rebuke Senator Baume for what he did. Thank goodness there is a streak of decency and a bit of justice in the world, because I see in today's paper that Peter Macdonald has been re-elected to the seat of Manly. So all of that was for nothing. Senator Baume sought some political advantage out of it, but he did not get it. I would like to relay a story about the impact that this episode has had on the public. I received a call from a person in Manly who saw my name on the front page of the Manly Daily and the comments from my office in relation to this matter and the way in which the tax file number had been used. Last Sunday night, Senator Baume and the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) sat together on a flight from Sydney to Canberr-. This gentleman was sitting behind them. With Senator Baume's having performed this act, having dropped this tax file number and all of the information, you would think they might feel a bit embarrassed. You might think that was a bit below the belt and that the best thing to do would be to shut up. Did they shut up? Not on your life. They were bragging about it on the flight from Sydney to Canberra. They were laughing and saying what a great job they had done to put it up Macdonald and the Labor Party. This bloke was sick to his stomach. He said that he felt like pouring a glass of beer over them. He reported the incident to my office. So people do get offended about these things. They do get offended when politicians traffic in personal information about people. They do get offended when the law is broken. They get offended when politicians brag about it aeroplanes. You would think that Senator Baume would have the decency, having peranything formed this act, to just say, 'I have done the act,' and maybe slink off somewhere to hide. But, no, not on your life; here he was bragand ging about it. Mr Hollis-Now he expects an apology to be given.",22
47,Mr GEAR,SPEAKER,"You would never get an apology. I know the member for Throsby feels very strongly about this. Why would ever get an apology about this? These guys are actually bragging about it. They think it is smart. They completely misunderstand Australian people, because there is more than a streak of decency to Australians out there. They do not like these tactics. To the extent that the Leader of the Opposition by his silence condones these tactics, it paints him a leader not worth having. I turn to look at another matter. The fact that while Mr Howard was Leader of the has Opposition-and the Treasurer mentioned here this-we had a serious debate in the parliation ment about privacy matters. No-one was more strident in standing up for the rights of privation. cy of Australians than the then Leader of the Opposition. We all remember the Australia card debate and the high ground taken by members of the opposition. The then Leader of the Opposition was poncing place championing individual rights, claiming that the card was going to be used by the government to control the lives of individuals and that it was a tool of Big Brother. Why is the Leader of the Opposition not out there telling Senator Michael Baume that he should not be dropping tax file numbers? The simple fact is that what he says and he does are two different things. The Leader of the Opposition will stand up for everything that is good, but when it actually comes performing, when it actually comes to laying the cards on the table and rebuking one of close friends, where is he? When the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer he ran the taxation system of this country into the ground. He is still undermining the tax system but from a different direcdo tion. He is now condoning the release of tax on file numbers in the Senate. You can say that with certainty, because he is not saying against the people who do it. This in his view might be smart politics. It sure beats generating policies. It is a lot easier to get up assassinate someone' s character rather than do the right thing and tell the people of Australia how you would run the country. But the simple fact is that it is no substitute. As the Treasurer has rightly pointed out, the holding of a tax file number is clearly a you breach of the law. This matter has been referred to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and the truth will out in the end. But Senator the Michael Baume should not think for one minute that he is out of the woods on this one, because activities that he undertook outside of parliament will be investigated. Let me just draw those themes together. as Since John Howard has become the leader of the Liberal Party, the campaigning techniques is of the Liberal Party have hit the sewer. There been the push polling, this grubby tactic last week, and the use and the distribuof stolen material in this House-all while he has been the Leader of the OpposiI reiterate that, if he is still Leader of the Opposition at the next election, we will have the dirtiest, sleaziest campaign this country has ever seen. The writing is on the wall. The direction in which he wants to take the Libaround the eral Party is clear. The Leader of the Opposition is dishonest \and he is two-faced about the standards on privacy matters. During debate on matters he will always take the high ground. He will always stand up for the individual and say that nothing is more sacred than a person's privacy-until it comes time to do something what about it. What he should do-and he knows he should do-is to rebuke Senator Michael Baume publicly for what he did. Any decent to leader would do that. If anything like that happened on our side, the Prime Minister his would have us in the office so fast that our noses would bleed. You cannot trust the current Leader of the Opposition near a tax office. He could not run a decent tax system when he was Treasurer and now he is undermining it by condoning, by his silence, the unauthorised and illegal use of tax file numbers. This clearly shows the standards of the Leader of the Opposition. He is clearly unfit to be the Prime Minister of this country.",24
48,Mrs BISHOP,SPEAKER,"Mackellar) (10.40 a.m.)We know very well why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would not be in here participating in this debate, and we know why the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) can take the moral high ground-because the Leader of the Opposition acts in accordance with moral principles. Mr Keating is not here because Mr Keating himself has been the beneficiary of favourable treatment from the Australian Taxation Office. Let me refresh everyone's memory. A letter signed by Mr D.l. Cortese, Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, who incidentally signed the letter of comfort tabled in the Senate last week, reads: Dear Mr Keating, The purpose of this letter is to draw your to the need for you to file your 1986 income tax return which is now outstanding. As recently discussed your 1985 return is also ... overdue. I appreciate how busy you have been but I ask that you now give urgent attention to the filing of your returns, especially that for the 1985 year. Should you wish, your return can be posted marked for attention: Ms Yvonne Ellis, Liaison Officer, Priority Control Section, GPO Box 3523, SYDNEY NSW 2000. If you wish to deliver your return, you could contact Ms Ellis on 236 7341 ... or myself. Your co-operation and early response would be appreciated. Yours faithfully, (D J Cortese) NA The funny thing was, though, that in that same year 10,000 ordinary Australians got prosecuted for the same offence. Double standards? I think we are starting to see them. The next double standard I might bring to your attention is the case of Mr Charles Wright. Mr Charles Wright, a well-known fund-raiser for the Labor Party, was described in the Western Australia Inc. campaign in the following terms: The other payments of particular concern were made to Mr Charles Wright, who operated a fundraising and business relations consultancy. He had done work for the ALP since 1976 in assisting with fundraising at the Federal level ... Subsequently, Mr Wright made payments to Mrs Brush for which he was recompensed from the No. 1 account. In essence, Mr Wright was a conduit for $80 000 that was paid from the No. 1 Account to Mrs Brush. Mr Burke gave a similar explanation. The reason I raise Mr Wright is that he failed to remit PA YE tax payments to the tax office for three consecutive years. I previously asked the tax office what its record was in being able to detect these things and it told me it was excellent. The funny thing, though, was that it was the same Mr Wright, the Labor Party fund-raiser-the one whose tax records show who the bagmen were for the Labor Party and who delivered from which companies-who got preferential treatment when, to put the facts down as they became apparent, the tax office put in a tax claim for this attention man's concern of $176,960.55 in unpaid P AYE. Funny thing-more preferential treatment by the tax office for Labor Party people. A funny thing happened here. When the Fitzgerald inquiry was on, the tax office was asked for all the National Party people's returns. Quick as a whip, the Australian Taxation Office sent off those files to the Fitzgerald inquiry. Then we come to Western Australia Inc. It is Labor Party officials and politicians this time. Guess what! The tax office says, 'Sorry, we can't send the files, because it has to be protected.' Double standards! Then we come to the leaks themselves, and the most damning of them all relates to Mr Phillip Smiles who was the Deputy Treasurer of the New South Wales government. Amazingly there were details leaked about his affairs to the newspapers. There was no outrage about privacy; it was simply that the details were leaked about his personal tax affairs. There was no outrage at the timeexcept that it was, could we say, for grubby political purposes. There was the parliament on a knife edge. Had Mr Smiles been convicted of a criminal offence and forced out of the parliament at that time it would have meant there would have been a change of government; that there would have been a Labor government instead. So there was a very good political reason for leaking the details on Mr Smiles. When I asked the tax office in estimates committee and Public Accounts Committee hearings about those leaks, what answer did I get? Dr Butterfield, who was in charge of doing the security checks, asked that a report be done, and he came back and said, 'We were innocent; we didn't leak it.' I asked, 'Where is the report? Could we see the report?' He said, 'Oh no, section act prevents me letting you have a look at the report.' I asked, 'What happened to the report, Dr Butterfield? Did you actually read it?' 'No,' he said. 'Who makes the decision, Dr Butterfield, about whether or not a matter is referred to the DPP?' 'Oh, I do, or the commissioner does,' he said. 'I see. Did the commissioner read the report?' I asked Dr Butterfield. 'Oh no,' said Dr Butterfield. So we had a report; we didn't read it; we had the details leaked; we had the prosecutions commenced and-guess what?-not under the Taxation Administration Act, oh no, but under the Crimes Act because only then could you have been certain of having the government change hands. So what did we see then? We had a prosecution; we. had a barrage of publicity. Nobody said, 'What about Mr Smiles's privacy?' Nobody was concerned about the fact that his privacy had been breached. We said that this was a matter of importance for the public record. How come we have one standard for Mr Smiles and another standard for Dr Macdonald? Let me remind honourable members that the amount of money involved in Mr Smiles's case was $11,000 or $12,000 and the amount of money in Dr Macdonald's case is $104,000. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) will be interested in this because Dr Macdonald has a very important medical practice, yet in the year 1988 he said he had an income of only $7,000. You can blame your tax agent, you can blame your accountant, but he actually had to sign off his figures himself. If he actually believed he had a taxable income of $7,000, then he should have been on welfare. In fact, the tax office made him pay another $40,000. Mr Knott-Unlike Mr Sinclair, who got his father to do it. Mr Reith-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I find the remark made by the honourable member for Gilmore offensive, and he should withdraw. He should apologise as well.",25
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,I call on the honourable member for Gilmore 16 of the tax to withdraw. Mr Knott-I withdraw.,26
50,Mrs BISHOP,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"So we go back to the question of double standards. We had a debate earlier this morning and, when ministers stood up to defend the government's position, what did they say? They said that we were having a debate not about the Jact that it was hypocrisy and two standards but on moral integrity. Well, we are. The fact of the matter is that we see patently every day that there are two standards exercised in this chamber. There was a request for a serious matter to be referred to the Privileges Committee by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith) in this place. But, oh no. Were any of us surprised when we got the answer we got? Certainly not. We expected it, because that is the way business is conducted here-on double standards. I go back and point out that in several cases in the New South Wales parliament since the election in 1992 we saw again and again the question of taxation being relevant to the electorate of New South Wales. How come it was relevant when it was Terry Metherell or Phillip Smiles? Let me ask this: in the business of so-called grubby political capital or grubby political advantage, who was it that ran television advertisements, during the election we have just completed, featuring Mr Smiles as somebody who had been disgraced? Mr Smiles was in fact acquitted on the criminal ch-rge, the charge that was meant to trigger an advantage to the Labor Party when it was first raised. Then he was hounded by the likes of your confreres until he had to leave the parliament. Let me ask you why, then, it is not reasonable for Dr Macdonald's tax matters to be on the public record, when it was for those of Mr Smiles and Dr Metherell? It is the same issue. I want to come to the question of the leaking of the so-called tax number. I want to read from the document that was duly tabled in the House. The letter is from dear old Mr Cortese, who is so good at giving letters of comfort to Labor Party people or their friends. At the top of the letter it does not say 'tax file number' or 'file number'; it says reference number'-' our' meaning the tax office. Pardon me, but I thought the importance of the tax file number was that it was allocated to us as individuals. I would expect such a letter to say' your tax file number', not 'ours' meaning the tax office's number because that is not what it is. But that is what the letter says-'our number', meaning the tax office's number. Of course, we can go back a little further in the history of the tax office to something that occurred in 1992 when the tax office itself leaked documents about individual taxpayers-inadvertently, it said, because it pressed the wrong computer button. It sent details of individual taxpayers, including their tax file numbers, to the wrong people. What action was taken? Was anybody prosecuted in the Parramatta branch of the tax office? Oh no; certainly not. What happened? Wel1, we sent in a little team to do an investigation and we asked the Privacy Commissioner to have a look. Finally, what did we do? We wrote a little letter of apology to the people concerned. Here we go again-more double standards. We have got plenty of them, have we not? We have got Paul Keating who was not prosecuted for failure to put in his return but who got a letter of comfort, whereas 10,000 ordinary Australians got prosecuted. Mr Fitzgibbon-That is not true.",26
51,Mrs BISHOP,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"It is absolutely true. Check the estimates hearings. We also have the double standards concerning Mr Smiles, Dr Metherell and Dr Macdonald. Somehow, it was supposed to be unfair for the electorate to be aware that Dr Macdonald had underestimated his tax affails for six years, involving $104,000, and that is supposed to be kept private because it is not relevant in his case. But it was supposed to be relevant in the case of Mr Smiles involving $11,000 to $12,000 which was also repaid-a matter where he had to be prosecuted under the Crimes Act. Upon questioning, the tax office said that there had never been a prosecution under that section previously. Then we have the matter of the other members of the Greiner government who were investigated by the tax office, just 'our coincidentally, and again we finally got a backdown from the commissioner, saying, 'Yes, it was correct.' So we have double standards, don't we? We have double standards when there is an error and, dare I say, unacceptable conduct from people on that side of the House. The weight of numbers is used in order to avoid the consequences of that act. Last week we saw the electorate make a decision about what it thinks about Mr Keating and his cohorts. Last week we saw the most unmitigated swing, a huge swing, against the Prime Minister, who said, 'It's everybody else's fault but mine.' We saw a swing of up to 20 per cent in a safe Labor seat. The electorate made a judgment on what it thinks about Mr Keating. I come back to the motion that was moved this morning. It was debated ad nauseam in the Senate. The Senate rejected the proposition of the government, so here we are, having another go. The fact is that.you have given the opportunity to have laid bare once again the duplicity of this government, the dishonesty of its leader-the leader who gets rich while the people get poorer, the man who does not put in his tax returns, the man from whom we see double standards at every turn. This put-up job, as was said by the Manager of Opposition Business, to try to get Senator Baume is nothing but an exercise in duplicity and hypocrisy, as we have become quite accustomed to seeing in this place, and ought to be rejected.

52,Mr MACK,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"North Sydney) (10.55 am.)The campaign waged by the Liberal Party against the Independent member for Manly, Dr Peter Macdonald, has been a massively expensive series of vicious distortions and character assassinations. Character assassination of political opponents has a long and dishonourable history, but this effort has set a new low and a terrible precedent. The publishing of the tax affairs and tax file number of an individual for political advantage is something that every member should recoil from if only for self preservation. What has happened was not directed in the usual manner against a head-kicker from the opposite side of politics. It has been a vile and unprovoked attack against a decent, hard working man of principle, a local GP who became interested in public affairs when he realised the large number of people in Manly being infected by sewage outfalls and tried to do something about it. It culminated in the use this parliament by Senator Baume to vomit even more infectious sewage in a failed attempt to obtain political advantage. Senator Baume with his long record of similar actions has done more than most to bring the Liberal Party, this parliament and every elected member throughout Australia into public contempt. What Baume did arose out of a long sequence of events beginning with Dr Macdonald's tax returns of a decade ago. A tax review was instituted as a result of an investiper gation into the tax accounting practices of a Manly accountant used by Macdonald and many other people in the Manly area. On becoming aware of the investigation Macdonald voluntarily resubmitted his returns through a new tax accountant and fully satisfied the Australian Taxation Office. The tax office required only interest repayments on additional tax to be paid but no penalties were involved and the tax department noted the full cooperation of Macdonald and his new accountant. I have here a copy of a letter from the deputy tax commissioner confirming that, which I am happy to table. That should have been the end of the matter but in late 1992 the tax office advised Dr Macdonald that former Premier Nick Greiner's office had Macdonald's tax details and his tax file number. Greiner's office had contacted the tax office claiming Macdonald's tax details had been sent there by mistake. Shortly after this, the self-styled head-kicker for the New South Wales Liberal Party, Michael Y absley, sneered at Macdonald privately in the New South Wales parliament saying, 'Why don't you pay your tax?' In December 1993 the then member for North Shore, Phillip Smiles, who was later convicted of tax offences, rang Macdonald to let him know that he also knew about Macdonald's tax affairs. Many more snide remarks and rumours from local Liberal Party members in Manly correctly convinced Macdonald that an election smear was coming. Macdonald obtained documentation from the Australian Taxation Office clearly setting out the position, fully exonerating him, and sent copies to Greiner and New South Wales Premier Fahey, assuming he was dealing with honourable men. On 2 December 1994 Fahey telephoned Macdonald and indicated that he had examined the documents and quite properly agreed there was no basis for any allegations or question of wrongdoing. He undertook to advise the Liberal candidate and his advisers to that effect. Again that should have been the end of the matter. But a few weeks before the New South Wales election a reputable major poll had Macdonald comfortably ahead by about eight cent in Manly. He would therefore retain the seat in what was going to be a very close New South Wales election. The federal member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) took over the Liberal campaign in Manly about this time and, concurrently, an unprecedented campaign of vilification commenced. Three direct mail letters were sent to Manly electors savaging Macdonald,· one signed by John Fahey and the other two signed by ministers Peter Collins and John Hannaford. A further letter, organised and paid for by the Liberal Party, was circulated. It was signed by several parents of victims of horrific murders, implying that Dr Macdonald was supporting the perpetrators of such crimes: It is almost unbelievable that the New South Wales Liberal Party, for political advantage, would viciously exploit people in such tragic circumstances. Then push polling commenced. Then came a further letter of character assassination to the electors. That was signed by Nick Greiner, a man who cannot accept that he was the architect of his own failure and who is consumed by a vicious desire for vengeance. The same letter was distributed in the other torates represented by Independents-Bligh and South Coast. All this was on top of the usual massive campaign to be expected in a marginal seat. Finally, at the last possible moment, the Liberal Party used this parliament, through Senator Baume, to smear Dr Macdonald the full knowledge that he was totally innocent and in the face of a specific undertaking by the then Premier of New South Wales that Dr Macdonald's tax matters would not be 1988, raised in the election campaign. It is to the eternal credit of Peter Macdonald and the electors of Manly that this sickening parade of infamy was rejected, but I am afraid that Dr Macdonald would be less than human what has happened does not colour his relations to the detriment of the Liberal Party, given the likely state of the New South Wales parliament over the next four years. But, as the television advertisements say, 'There's more.' And it gets worse. Not only has this sewage engulfed many members of the Liberal Party-including Greiner, Fahey, Yabsley, Smiles, the Liberal candidate for Manly and the federal member for Warringah-it is also now being reinforced and enenable dorsed by the Liberal Party, both in this chamber and the Senate and by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The fact is that the documents illegally obBaume tained from the tax office have been widely disseminated to many members of the Liberal Party, disclosing Peter Macdonald's tax affairs and his tax file number. The Australian tax office has clear proof at this stage that doc'uments were in Nick Greiner's office. has been stated, it is a criminal offence ishable by up to two years in prison to use a tax file number and connect it to an individment. ual or to divulge or communicate an individParty's ual tax file number to a third person. It also certainly means expulsion from state or contempt federal parliament for any member convicted of or complicit in these breaches of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Senator Baume has used--or misusedparliamentary privilege in an effort to stay protected under his wet brick. He has, howelecever, no parliamentary protection for his actions in relation to Dr Macdonald's tax file number and tax affairs prior to the tabling in the Senate; nor have his informants. Senator Baume has no recognised privilege which would entitle him to refuse to disclose his informant's identity where he is otherwise in under a legal duty to do so. The disclosure to Senator Baume of Dr Macdonald's tax file number not only was a criminal offence but, under the Privacy Act also attracts civil liability for interfering with Dr Macdonald's privacy. Under that act, Senator Baume's informant was a tax file number recipient who is prohibited from disclosure of tax file numbers and is required if to safeguard access to the information. Under section 98 of the Privacy Act, Peter Macdonald will no doubt be proceeding for an injunction in the Federal Court against Senator Baume to compel him not to continue interfering with Dr Macdonald's privacy. No doubt he will also commence proceedings for preliminary discovery against Senator Baume in order to disclose Senator Baume's source or sources so that he or they can be sued. Proceedings for preliminary discovery will Dr Macdonald to discover the identity of the proper defendant or defendants in the action. The relevant Federal Court rule will enable Dr Macdonald to obtain an order for compulsory examination not only of Senator but of any other person-such as Greiner, Oldfield, Fahey, the member for Warringah or the member for Bennelongwho might have knowledge of the facts. This will enable Dr Macdonald to identify the the informant and all the others through As whom this tax file number has been passed. punThis could well lead to a number of byelections, both here and in the state parliaAll that is in the future. The Liberal actions in Manly have not only brought every member of this parliament into but added to the public loss of trust in the institutions of the country. Do not make any mistake. The people of New South Wales did not put the Liberal government out because of their love for Labor or its policies. The Fahey government went because, in the public view, it was the greater of two evils. It went because of the sleaze factor. The sleaze factor began in 1988, with the advent of the Liberal government, and saw the advent of the clandestine community polling organisation that funded dummy Independents to run out of Terry Metherell's office. It continued with controversies about jobs for the boys, peregrinations in Europe, tax cheating, illegal listening devices, sexual harassment, threatening phone calls, corruption of the public service, and the draining of millions of dollars from legal aid funds for politicians' court defences. This was not the result of any cross-party infighting; it was all the New South Wales Liberals' own work. It cost them a Premier and then it cost them government. I am aware that the Leader of the Opposition has been privately appalled by what has gone on in the New South Wales Liberal Party since 1988--or so he says-but since he has assumed leadership of the federal Liberal Party there are signs that he, too, is being submerged in a rising tide of sleaze. With his silent support of push polling by the Liberal Party in both Manly and Canberra, his support of the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan)who knowingly misled the House, falsely accusing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) of the sins he himself had committed-and his support of Senator Baume and the Liberal Party's activities in respect of the Manly election, he is now on the Greiner slide, sowing the seeds of his own destruction. I can only appeal to the Leader of the Opposition to draw back from such things as the obvious negative strategy he has embarked on to win the next election, namely, personal character assassination of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That strategy will degrade institutions and thousands of people throughout the country and, ultimately, it will be destructive .. Ie must dissociate himself from statements such as those made by the leader of the New South Wales National Party, who, in respect of the Manly election, said: In hindsight, I would have run a far more negative campaign ... The negative advertising we did was good but I'd drive it much harder nexHime. To endorse such statements by silence will lower the bar and sink political affairs to new depths, inviting even worse in the future. It is no coincidence that the non-major party vote in the New South Wales Legislative Council was a record 24.7 per cent in this election. It has climbed from 7.8 percent in 1978, the year of the first election of that body. Not only should the Leader of the Opposition support this motion to condemn Senator Baume; he should also demand Senator Baume's resignation and personally apologise to Dr Macdonald and his family. If he does not do so, he demeans not only himself but his party and the millions of party supporters.",27
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Order! The honourable member mentioned, before I occupied the chair, that he wished to table papers. Does he seek leave to do so?",30
54,Mr MACK,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,I do. Leave granted.,30
55,Mr ABBOTT,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Warringah) (11.08 a.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise not just to defend a political colleague but to support a personal friend. We have to ask ourselves why we are actually doing this-why is the House debating this motion in relation to Senator Michael Baume? It is not because Senator Baume has done wrong but because Senator Baume has done right. It is not because Senator Baume has inadvertently tabled a tax file number; it is because Senator Baume has consistently got under the skin of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).",30
56,Unknown,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Government members interjecting,30
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Order! The people on my right are making far too much noise in this debate. I call them to order and remind them to follow the statutes of the House.,30
58,Mr ABBOTT,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"The Prime Minister hates selfSenator Baume because of Senator Baume's consistent revelations about the Prime Minister's own conduct. The Prime Minister has taken every opportunity to victimise Senator Baume. First of all, in an unprecedented way, he took out a defamation action against Senator Baume. That was most unusual. It was an attempt to muzzle Senator Baume' s right and proper pursuit of the Prime Minister's financial dealings. We have had a Senate motion condemning Senator Baume. We now have a motion in this House because the Senate motion did not work. Today the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and other speakers threatened Senator Baume with police harassment because of what Senator Baume has done. That is an absolute disgrace and it shows that this government will do anything to victimise and harass people who ask reasonable questions of the Prime Minister; The important thing for this House to consider is exactly why the government's minions and the Prime Minister's lap-dogs and poodles are here engaged in this halfhearted attack on Senator Michael Baume. The Prime Minister has no interest whatsoever in Dr Macdonald's tax file number. the Prime Minister is trying to punish Senator Baume for the things he has done to him. Senator Baume's great crime, in the eyes the Prime Minister, is that he revealed the Prime Minister's multinational pig joint venture. It was Senator Baume who first revealed that the Prime Minister's one-off $500,000 investment-where did he get the money from?-was going to give the Prime Minister an after-tax return of $2.5 million every yeaL. Not even Kerry Packer could make that kind of money. Kerry Packer could not even make that kind of money when he was the Prime Minister's mate, let alone now. It was Senator Baume who revealed that quarantine service officials were changing rules or were considering changing the rules regarding the importation of pigs into this country, at the specific direct request of Prime Minister. It was Senator Baume who revealedMr Horne- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The debate is clearly defined in today's Notice Paper. He has been speaking for four minutes and has not addressed debate yet.",30
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Order! There is no point of order.,31
60,Mr ABBOTT,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"It was Senator Baume who revealed that, in April 1992, the Prime Minister had conducted private meetings with Danish pork officials who asked the pertinent question whether he was doing it in his official capacity as Prime Minister, was doing it to try to boost his own private income or was doing it as Australia's best known pig farmer. It was Senator Baume who revealed that the Prime Minister's piggery broke every environmental rule in the book. It was Senator Baume who revealed the disgraceful actions of the Prime Minister in breaking the environmental rules that the Independents in this House are so concerned about. It was Senator Baume who revealed that workers at the Prime Minister's half owned piggery had not been paid their award wages. Workers employed by the Prime Minister had not been paid their award wages. When it was found by the New South Wales industrial relations department that this was the case, what did the Prime Minister's half owned piggery do? It sacked the workers. It sacked them for of asking about their award entitlements. Senator Baume has revealed that Labor's leaders do not live up to Labor's principles, and this is why he is being victimised by this House today. The government's motion is a thinly disguised attempt by the Prime Minister to hit back at the one man in this parliament who has consistently questioned the Prime Minister's integrity-and rightly so. Mr Horne--Get on and defend Baume. That's what you're here fOL",31
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Order! The the honourable member for Patterson has spoken too much and he will come to order.,31
62,Mr ABBOTT,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"This motion is the latest the manifestation of a Prime Minister who has gone absolutely feral-a Prime Minister who has been said by his own ex-colleague former Senator Richardson to have millions of Australians scratching their heads in wonderment as to whether or not he is still sane as he the parades around the world conducting Mozart and redesigning Berlin in a single afternoon. Ever since Kerry Packer went on national television to declare that John Howard was decent, honest man who would make a good Prime Minister, the Prime Minister has gone slightly mad. But it was not what Kerry Packer said about John Howard that has made the Prime Minister mad. The real thing that has got under the Prime Minister's skin is fact that Kerry Packer was asked a question about God and he answered it without once mentioning the Prime Minister's name. That is the real problem with the Prime Minister. I used to think the Prime Minister had a Baume. Napoleon complex. I used to think he had a Bismarck complex. The fact of the matter that the Prime Minister has a messiah complex. But the only messiah he resembles is mad King Ludwig of Bavaria, running around building castles in the air. The Prime Minister blames anyone and everyone for his predicafar ment except himself. In the wake of the Canberra by-election, he has blamed exwhen Senator Richardson, New South Wales Labor leader Bob Carr, John Della Bosca, and even the Speaker of this august institution, for problems. Now, with this motion, he is trying to blame poor old Senator Michael Baume. I turn now to the substance of this motion. Senator Baume tabled documents in the Senate, and one of those documents had on 'file number'. This document was examined closely for five minutes by Senator Rosemary Crowley, the government's duty minister. weighed it, considered it, looked at it again and again and allowed it to be tabled. anyone is to be censured by this House, must be Senator Rosemary Crowley because friends. she was complicit in this act of tabling the tax file number. She should be added to this censure motion. As soon as Senator Baume realised mistake he took immediate steps to rectify But before he had a chance to do so, two Labor senators had had access to this tax file number. If this tax file number has got out, anyone has got hold of Peter Macdonald's tax file number, not only should Senator RoseIndeed, he said: mary Crowley be added to this motion but so too should the two Labor senators. While we are talking about the release of confidential information, when Senator dismissed. Crowley revealed confidential information a about a very tragic incident-she has made a few mistakes lately, hasn't she?-what did she do? She did not do what Senator Baume did and immediately apologise; she stood there and tried to tough it out even when her senior minister in this House, the Minister for the Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), had the decency to come in and apologise. If anyone is to be censured by this House for releasing information it must be Senator Rosemary Crowley, not Senator Michael Mr Knott-Did you know the number, is Tony? Did you think it was a phone number?",31
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore will cease interjecting. He has spoken too much and will remain silent.,32
64,Mr ABBOTT,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"It is very interesting that a similar motion was debated in the Senate, some of the Independents and some of the Greens refused to support it. They his accepted that what Michael Baume did was entirely inadvertent, and I would invite the Independents in this House to do exactly the same thing. It is interesting, is it not, that Senator Chamarette has this day withdrawn a it motion of censure of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) that she tabled in the Senate, because it is her understanding now She that one House should not censure a member of the other. That is a very fair understanding If and one that I commend to members of the it government and to my two Independent Let me turn finally to the substance of Senator Baume's claims in the Senate. Dr Peter Macdonald has been a consistent advohis cate of honest government. When Nick it. Greiner got himself into trouble, Dr Macdonald said he was guilty until proven innocent. When Phillip Smiles got himself into trouble if over the Eastern Creek raceway, Dr Macdonald said he was guilty until proven innocent. Whether a man is innocent until he is proven guilty is not appropriate in this instance ... if an element of doubt exists, the honourable member should be This is not my standard; this is Dr Macdonald's standard. This is the standard under which Dr Macdonald, not Michael Baume, has questions to answer. Senator Baume revealed that, in a five-year period from 1984 to 1988, Dr Macdonald's declared taxable income in no single year exceeded $7,191. Notwithstanding the fact that this man was able to declare an income that would have put him on social security, this wealthy general practitioner owns a $1 million-plus house in King Avenue, Fairlight, and four other properties in one of the most exclusive parts of Sydney. Notwithstanding having declared an income which should have put him on the dole, he was able to afford last Friday to bring a Supreme Court action-and we all know how that much costs. I was told by the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) today that Dr Macdonald is now bringing a Federal Court action, all. on a declared income of less than $7,000 a year. Not even the member for North Sydney could believe that. The fact of the matter is: everyone is entitled to pay no more tax than that which is obliged by law but people are not entitled to pull the wool over their own eyes. They are not entitled to allow themselves to be deluded about their own financial affairs. Dr Macdonald is saying that it is all his accountant's fault; that it was his accountant's mistake that he filed these returns. Well, Dr Macdonald had to sign the document; the accountant did not sign the document. Dr Macdonald had to sign the document, and for five years this wealthy medical practitioner signed tax returns claiming that in no single year did he earn more than $7,000. Dr Macdonald's campaign slogan 'Clean water, clean streets, clean politics' should have a new line added to it-'no tax', because that is Dr Macdonald's policy. If Dr Macdonald says that this was an honest mistake, this House should believe him, just as it should believe Senator Michael Baume when he says that he made an honest mistake. Let me say this about Dr Macdonald's tax returns: oh to be so lucky as to have that kind of lifestyle and be able to declare $4,000 a year. Dr Macdonald has done something which is rather common on the other side of the House. In signing his tax returns but not being prepared to own up to the contents, he has endorsed the cover but not the contents. Dr Macdonald is revealed as the Ros Kelly of Macquarie Street; the man who endorses the cover but not the contents of what he signs. This is the man who could still hold the balance of power in New South Wales-what a worry for the people of my home state! The fact is that he cannot manage $4,000 a year properly and we are being asked to believe that this man is entitled to playa crucial role in managing the $20 billion a year New South Wales budget. As it happens, Dr Macdonald has quite a lot in common with our Prime Minister. He has acquired a great deal of property while earning a very modest income. When he made a mistake with his tax, he received a very nice, gentle letter saying, 'Please fix this up.' He has a great deal in common with the Prime Minister. The government has moved this motion in an attempt to destroy the career of Senator Michael Baume. Like so many things this government has done, this has backfired terribly, because the only career that has been damaged today is the career of the Manly Independent Dr Peter Macdonald.",32
65,Mr HOLLIS,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Throsby) (11.23 a.m.}-I speak today for the many people over the years who have been smeared by Senator Michael Baume under parliamentary privilege. This is one of the most serious actions to take, to condemn a member of parliament. It is even more serious when this chamber moves to condemn a member in another place. I understand that never before has such an extreme move been taken. Indeed, I had to go back to 23 March 1972 to find a similar motion. This indicates the gravity of what has occurred. Indeed, if this had happened anywhere outside of the parliament, Senator Baume's behaviour in publishing this material, in particular the tax file number, would have been criminally punishable. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes the unauthorised disclosure of a person's tax file number an offence punishable by two years imprisonment or a fine of up to $10,000, or both. Colleagues: imagine the posturing of Senator Baume if this had happened to anyone else. Those opposite who are here defending this motion are defending the indefensible. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) spent 15 minutes speaking to this motion and did not mention Senator Baume once. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) mentioned Senator Baume only at the end of his speech. Often when members of parliament are in strife politically or socially, parliament being parliament this is used against them. But in all my experience of parliament it has always been used in a political way, except when Senator Baume has used it. Senator Baume always goes for the personal attack. Personal abuse and personal vilification are his stock in trade-kicking people when they are down. What happened in the Senate last week on the eve of the New South Wales state election was so crude, so intrusive into someone's personal privacy and such an abuse of confidentiality that I believe that only by its being condemned by this chamber can parliament be restored in the eyes of the people. We are harangued often by those opposite. Indeed, in the first 15 minutes of business in the chamber today the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was telling us how we had to lift our standards. Then he went on, as the first opposition speaker, to try to defend Michael Baume. The Leader of the Opposition, Baume's good mate, is always telling us that we have to lift the standard and behaviour of this House. Indeed, the media is often critical of the behaviour of this chamber. No-one would deny that there is often robust exchange. It is also true that things are often said in the heat of the moment that should not be said. Never in my 12 years of parliamentary life have I witnessed such an invasion of privacy, such a breach of confidentiality under parliamentary privilege. The action of Senator Baume has embarrassed the parliament, and unless action is taken we are all guilty. What Senator Baume did under parliamentary privilege, in the dying hours of the parliament, when the candidate he was attempting to smear had no chance of reply, is typical of the Baume attack. As Alan Ramsey said in the Sydney Morning Herald: It was a brutal hatchet job on an opponent given no chance to defend himself. His accuser attacked in the dark, under parliamentary privilege, at the last possible moment, from 300 kilometres away. Macdonald, campaigning on home ground in Manly, knew nothing of what Baume had done until much later. Only the next morning did he get an equal chance to strike back. It was a cowardly, sleazy and more than likely selfdefeating act. This, colleagues, is the well documented Michael Baume style. In 1977, in the last hours of the campaign for the state seat of Wollondilly, Senator Baume launched a vicious attack under parliamentary privilege on the Labor candidate for the seat, Bill Knott. Bill had lost part of his foot in an accident at the steelworks at Port Kembla some years earlier, and Baume said publicly and under parliamentary privilege how disgusting that a man who was an invalid pensioner should stand for parliament. Bill Knott made the wonderful reply that it was only his foot that had been amputated, not his brainlike Baume's had been. In the last days of my own campaign in 1983 for the then seat of Macarthur, where Michael Baume was the sitting member, he arranged for the local newspaper to put out a scurrilous and false report hinting that I had misappropriated funds from my previous employment. This was totally without foundation. It was only when someone from the newspaper, so shocked at this sleazy action, leaked the story to me that we knew about it. As at that time there was an electronic blackout I would not have had the means to reply to this scurrilous, dirty story. We had to take out a court injunction to stop the publication. Despite my frequent requests after the election for this newspaper and for Senator Baume to now publish the story, they have refused to do so to this day. The same Senator Baume persuaded the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), then on Malcolm Fraser's staff at the time of the 1983 election, to telephone at taxpayers' expense the London School of Economics in London to snoop on my university record. The same Senator Baume, who leaked details from my driving licence, which so mysteriously went missing in 1983, then arranged for confidential details of my house building application to be leaked to the local media. Political candidates, if Baume is in the area, expect to have their house raided by the police on a trumped up charge. It happened to me in 1983 and to the member for Gilmore prior to the last election. The senator has never been averse to throwing around defamation orders. I have been on the receiving end of a couple of these, and he is well known throughout the Illawarra for serving defamation orders on people. Consistently he has moved motions in the Senate concerning me and my staff, the member for Gilmore and his staff, and the member for Macarthur and his staff. This is the same Senator Baume who, in the lead-up to the last New South Wales election, raised false allegations in the House against the Labor candidate, Councillor Michael Samaras. This person, who takes the high moral ground on every issue, is the same person who opened an electorate office in the Wollongong area claiming that the local members were not doing a good enough job in representing the area, and promoting himself as a locally based senator-not that anyone ever saw him. But when Michael Baume decided it would be politically advantageous to open an office in Camden to campaign against the member for Macarthur, and was foolish enough to put an article in the Illawarra Mercury indicating his desertion of the Illawarra was for political reasons, the Minister for Administrative Services rightly refused to waste $100,000 of taxpayers' money on moving Michael Baume. Bear in mind that this is the same Senator Baume who wanted to have the Australian taxpayer waste $100,000 for his personal comfort. It is the same Senator Baume who was chair of the opposition Waste Watch Committee and who has consistently railed against what he claimed was a waste of taxpayers' money. This is the same Michael Baume who day after day takes the high moral ground in the Senate. This is the same Michael Baume whose good friend, the member for Bennelong, said on 23 February 1988 on the privacy legislation: I cannot think of a greater abuse of privacy, a greater abuse of privilege or a greater abuse of confidentiality than ... this occasion. He went on: What group in this community can possibly feel confident that if it gives this Government information, if it trusts the state ... with any information about private affairs, that information will be kept confidential? Why is the member for Bennelong so silent on the invasion of privacy by his mate Senator Michael Baume? Let the honourable member for Bennelong give us his views today on the abuse of privacy, privilege and confidentiality by his mate Senator Baume. During the censure motion in the Senate last Tuesday, Senator Baume said: It should not be a political stunt or some kind of political get square, it must rest on principle. Principle from Michael Baume! He went on to state: This motion was conceived in malice, born in deceit and swaddled in falsehood. This from the senator who has made the smear a political stunt and the political get square into an art form. He has made himself the master of the use of privilege of parliament to smear anyone where he thinks it is an advantage politically to the Liberal Party. In case there is any doubt, Senator Baume knew precisely what he was doing and he did it for political advantage. His action was poll driven. It was driven by Liberal Party internal polling. Over lunch on Monday in this very parliament, Senator Baume boasted that, before his attack on Dr Macdonald, Dr Macdonald had a five per cent lead. That lead disappeared after the attack. It was a deliberate attack by the New South Wales Liberal Party using Buckets Baume to take the seat of Manly from the sitting Independent. This is the same Michael Baume who tried under parliamentary privilege to find muck in the investment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the piggery and who made outrageous comments about the Prime Minister's purchase of a house. He is the same Michael Baume who, as chairman of the opposition Waste Watch Committee, had a Commonwealth car wait for him for almost two hours while he was at a dental appointment. He is the same Michael Baume who was involved with a failed stockbroking firm, Patrick Partners-the firm that cost thousands of pensioners their life savings. That is the high moral standard of Senator Baume. I have no doubt, in his usual style, Senator Baume will now mount another vicious attack on me. In the 12 years that I have been a member of this parliament, I and my staff have been attacked many times by Senator Baume under parliamentary privilege. This is the first time that I have ever responded, because enough is enough. Senator Baume, by his action, has brought disgrace and discredit to this parliament. He has finally overstepped the mark. He will squeal about this attack, but he should remember that those who live by the sword will inevitably, in the end, fall by the sword. Just to make sure that we are totally up to date in the election that the Liberals just lost in New South Wales, Senator Baume--{)n parliamentary headed paper-at cost to the taxpayer put a letter around to the electorates of the south coast. In the letter Michael Baume states: This state election has significant implications the federal level. This is a clear choice between responsible government under decent honourable leaders. That is from the Liberal Party-a 'decent honourable' member who has used this parliament to smear the name and the reputation of an Independent. I can think of no-one in this parliament who is more deserving of censure than Senator Baume. For 20 years he has used this parliament. Whenever the current leader of the Liberal Party wants someone to do a bucket job the call goes out, 'Where's Buckets?' and, no matter how much grime, how much filth or what the smear is, Buckets is there saying, 'Me, me, let me tip it.' They give it to him. Those opposite come into this parliament and make speeches about standards and about the way we are perceived out there in the community, but old Buckets is up there and as one lot of filth is thrown he is running out getting another one. They run from the offices of the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business and, no matter how filthy, how low or how much muck is in the bucket, they run and get Buckets Baume. In he comes. He runs every time. He will tip it. Today is a delightful day because, after 20 years of seeing Buckets bucket good, decent people in the parliament and in the community, Buckets is getting his bucketful. It could not go to a more worthy recipient than Buckets Baume. I support this motion. If there is any decency left on that side, when it is put to a vote, all the benches on the other side will be empty and the benches on this side will be crowded. There is no-one more deserving of censure. Mr Knott interjecting",33
66,Mr HOLLIS,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"As the honourable member for Gilmore has just reminded me, and it is very appropriate to our electorates, there have been some low people and some low actions, but to get lower than the good senator Michael Baume you would have to be a coal miner. I commend the motion to the House.",36
67,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) says it all. at The hypocrisy of the argument that the Labor Party is puttingMr Hollis-How much did the telephone call cost?,36
68,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"I will tell you about that. This is something that the House needs, above aB, to understand. On 23 February 1988, the inarticulate previous speaker voted in a motion in the old Parliament House to defend the member for Canning, the now Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear)-who self-righteously and hypocritically spoke in this debate-who had released, contrary to section 130 of the Health Insurance Act, the Medicare provider numbers of a number of Australian doctors as a political stunt. Mr Knott-He didn't even receive them.",36
69,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"You wouldn't know. When it comes to dirty pool, the way you behave in relation to local councillors in your elell:torate is indeed dirty pool. The fact is that the member for Canning, the now Assistant Treasurer, was happy to breach section 130 of the Health Insurance Act to release the Medicare provider numbers. Then, when we moved a motion in this chamber, the member for Throsby, the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and, let us see who else, the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland)-you, pal, will not be here; you are just a fleeting piece of light across the scene and you gone pretty soon-all voted in support of the member for Canning releasing confidential numbers contrary to section 130 of the Health Insurance Act. Here are their names on the Votes: ayes 72; Chynoweth, Cleeland and Hollis. Your names are all there. And there is Willis right down at the bottom. I am sure yours is there, Andrew. I will come to you in a second. Down the bottom of the page, who also voted in support of the actions of the member for Canning? The now Treasurer (Mr Willis). There is the name of Mr Willis down at the bottom of the list there. The whole lot of them are there. I am searching for the K's here. I have found the K's. The name Kelly is there. Remember her? But what is interesting about this vote is that on that occasion even the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) voted in support of the member for Canning. What is the point? The point is that this whole exercise is a complete and utter stunt. You people are absolutely desperate-I have seen it over and over again in the last 10 years-to manufacture a political issue out of nothing in order to make a cheap political point. This is one of the most common political stunts from the Labor Party. By the way, I think you will find the name Theophanous on this list as well. He is also part of the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. What did Senator Michael Baume actually do? Are you people claiming that Dr Macdonald did not understate his income? Is that one of the claims you are making today? Or did he understate his income? Silence. You know the answer to that question is, first and most, that Dr Macdonald did understate his income. Mr Chynoweth interjecting",36
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,The member for Dunkley will cease interjecting.,37
71,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"It is pretty fanciful that a bloke can sign off on his tax return the sorts of numbers we have heard through this debate for his gross taxable income and then say, 'I didn't know anything about it.' That was the Ros Kelly defence-remember Ros Kelly?in relation to the environment document: 'I will be didn't read it; I just signed it.' That is an argument you people on that side of the House may be familiar with. It may not be an argument that the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) is familiar with, but it is an argument that you have been happy to use and so you think that is an acceptable standard. I do not. It does not matter what accountant put together his tax return, he should have had the decency to make sure he knew what was in it. He should be held responsible for signing a document that was in the end misleading. Then there is the issue of the tax file number. Senator Baume has been the first to admit that he inadvertently tabled the document with the tax file number on it. He has admitted that, just as the member for Canning tried to extricate himself, I seem to recall, from the releasing of the Medicare provider numbers. Sure, he inadvertently tabled the document with the tax file number on it. He apologised for the tax file number being tabled and took measures immediately to make sure that tax file number was not published-measures which were successful. When he sought leave to table the document, he asked permission from the minister at the table, the notorious Senator Crowley, who we will return to in a moment. When it comes to low standards, tabling documents and giving material to journalists, what gall they have! Senator Crowley was the minister sitting at the table-the woman who has done so much damage to one family in the last few days. She has done so much damage that her fore- senior minister has had to come into this chamber and apologise for her behaviour. So bad was itMr Cleary-It might have been silly, but it was not deliberately malicious.",37
72,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,It was deliberate; it was quite deliberate. She quite deliberately gave that material to journalists.,37
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Order! The member for Wills will cease interjecting in his loud voice. I understand that this is an emotional debate and the chair has been fairly tolerant, but I will not be tolerant of people who continually yell out in a loud manner.",38
74,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"The point is that Senator Crowley had five minutes to peruse that document. She did not identify on that document a tax file number, and agreed to its being tabled. As Senator Evans pointed out in the Senate, the reason she did not identify the tax file number on the document was that it was not obvious there was a tax file number on it. Sure, there were numbers on the document-there was a file reference number and there was a number with 'file number' by it but not 'tax file number'. Senator Crowley did not recognise the number as a tax file number and Senator Evans's excuse is, 'It would have been hard for her to have realised that was the tax file number.' Hang on-that is a defence for Senator Crowley but apparently it is not an acceptable defence for Senator Baume. It was all very well for Senator Crowley not to recognise the number, but apparentlyMr Knott-The Liberals had it for three years.",38
75,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Could you be quiet! You poor, sad creature. Mr Knott-Did you see it in that three years?",38
76,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"When it comes to Independents, I would have thought you would be one of the people in this room who would be a bit silent because the Liberal Party has just won a seat from an Independent in your area which gives us, thank you very much, a very good foothold towards wiping you out at the next election. At least we will have a little less noise, I would have thought, from a man who physically threatened councillors in his own electorate. But don't worry; you will hear a lot more about that in the lead-up to the election, pal-a lot more. The point is that the standard acceptable Senator Crowley, according to the Labor Party, is unacceptable for Senator Baume. This is part of the complete hypocrisy of the whole exercise, a point I think I convincingly proved with the assistance of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) by referring back to the 1988 incident involving the honourable member for Canning which, of course, you have all conveniently forgotten. Mr Knott-You are backto push polling.",38
77,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"You weren't here, maddie. You weren't here, you nut case, but the point I am makingMr Knott-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",38
78,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Don't tell us you are not a nut; millions won't agree with you. Mr Knott-Apart from the fact of what this man's opinion of me might be, it is against standing orders to vilify someone in this place. I would like to say what I think of him, but you would then throw me out of the place because I would have questioned his parentage.",38
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Order! There is no point of order, and you will remain seated. All members of the chamber who are still here will remain quiet, and that includes the honourable member for Gilmore, irrespective of points of order.",38
80,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"I rest my case. The point is that this is characteristic of the way the Labor Party behaves. Let us just have a 190k at what you yourselves have done in campaigns over the years. During the last federal election campaign in the electorate of Adelaide when Trish Worth had been preselected as the Liberal candidate in that marginal seat, you were dead worried about losing. Of course, there was all the bravado--'Wewon't lose; we won't lose'-but you were dead worried about losing, and for good reason: you lost. During that campaign the Labor Party got a state politician to stand up in the state parliament and make allegations that the honourable member for Adelaide was involved in some kind of financial kickback for arrangement with a firm with which she worked at the time. It was totally unsubstantiateo and totally untrue but, after all, with only a few weeks to go before the election you thought, 'At least we can run a smear and hopefully some of the mud will stick'. The fact is that in Senator Baume' s case what was said about Macdonald happened to be true. What was said about Trish Worth by the Labor Party was a bare-faced lie; it was totally untrue. When we move across Adelaide to the electorate of Makin-and this is just Adelaide, where I happen to live-we find the same thing. A Labor backbencher in the state parliament, one of those you only ever hear from when mud is thrown which is totally untrue and unsubstantiated against the Liberal Party-and the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) is a great one for arranging these sorts of things as I will explain in a moment-stood up and made claims about the financial arrangements of the Liberal candidate in order to elicit this headline: 'Libs new candidate bombshell'. The allegations made by the Labor Party on that occasion were bare-faced lies-totally untrue and never substantiated. But you thought that was all right, did you? You thought it was all right, that that sort of behaviour was acceptable. Mr Cleary-No, we don't think it is all right.",38
81,Mr DOWNER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"You are not in the Labor Party, and the Labor Party moved this motion. The fact is that that is the standard that you apply, and you try to imply that people on the other side of the House would behave in the way you have. But we would not; we simply would not do that sort of thing. That is a cultural difference between the two sides of politics and something you really need to understand and remember. In the Torrens by-election in South Australia we had the case where somebody on the staff of the honourable member for Makin went to the launch of the Liberal Party campaign and started asking questions while professing to be an Adelaide Advertiser journalist. He gave his name as that of an Adelaide Advertiser journalist, which was totally dishonest and totally deceitful. What happened? The journalist whom he was professing to be happened to be standing beside him while he was professing to be that journalist. As a consequence, we thought that the member for Makin was going to sack the staffer. It is typical of the tactics of the member for Makin, the man who runs around the press gallery whispering smears, innuendoes and lies. He had one of his staff, pretending to be an Adelaide journalist, caught in embarrassing circumstances. So the member for Makin sacked the staffer--or did he? It was only for a little' while and the staffer is now back on his staff. They are the standards of the Labor Party. They are the standards that you apply, and you have the gall to come into this chamber and move this puerile motion today. Really and truly, the stench of the hypocrisy of it is simply revolting. There is no question about that. In this instance SenatorBaume did inadvertently table a document with a tax file number in on it. He immediately took action when he realised his mistake to have the number taken off. These two people over here, the Independents, are not concerned about the tax file number, because they know that Senator Baume did it inadvertently, not deliberately. He would have no motive to do it deliberately. He would have no motive to table the tax file number but, of course, he had a motive to table the information. The point that you two guys need to remember, as well as the rest of you, is that the information was true. So the truth does have a role in this place. Part of the truth of this debate is the hypocrisy of what the Labor Party is claiming here today. There is one standard for you and another standard for the coalition. That is the game that you have always been trying to play. The point about this is that the Australian people recognise what you are up to. They now know what you are up to. They heard your lies and deceit during the last election campaign and they know you are up to deceit and hypocrisy yet again. (Time expired)",39
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Before I call the member for MCEwen, I will say again, to the few members in the House, that decorum shall be maintained and staff outside shall not be tempted to have conversations with them when they should not.",39
83,Mr CLEELAND,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"MCEwen) (11.52 am.)We have seen what the opposition calls a defence of the actions of Senator Baume. They are trying to put up a defence for a set of circumstances which should again be spoken of in this House. What are the circumstances? Senator Baume obtained, from sources unknown, a letter which was a private communication between the Australian Taxation Office and an Australian citizen. It should not matter that Dr Macdonald is, or was, a candidate for public office. The fact is that Dr Macdonald is an Australian citizen and communications between the Australian Taxation Office and an Australian citizen are private and confidential. Nevertheless, that is the document that Senator Baume had. It is not denied that Senator Baume tabled this document in the Senate. Hence the act which we are complaining about is proved. It is not denied by the defence that the act took place. What they say, though, is that there was no mens rea-what was done was a totally innocent act. There is mens rea and it is demonstrable that what Senator Baume did is part of an overall tactic of the Liberal Party led by John Howard. It is part of an overall strategy to bring this parliament into disrepute by unfairly attacking Australian citizens, whether they be members of parliament or otherwise. That is demonstrable. In looking at these events, one can clearly see that the mens rea-the intent-is demonstrable. It is not an excuse for members on the other side to say that the date upon which Senator Baume tabled the document had nothing to do with anything other than· an honest desire by Senator Baume to reveal a matter of public importance, because it was tabled on the Friday before a state election. It was tabled to induce the voting public of New South Wales to think that Dr Macdonald was a person of low repute or of criminal proclivity. That was the only reason why Senator Baume tabled the document and then ran with the media story on Dr Macdonald's alleged breach of the law. None of the people on the other side has given any explanation why Senator Baume would table it-none of them! Not one of these great defence wizards over here has suggested anything other than it was all right except for the tax file number. So they do not see anything wrong with an Australian citizen's private information being made public. Yet we now know that: the matter was resolved with the Australian Taxation Office; no charges had been laid against Dr Macdonald by the Taxation Office; tax had been paid according to law; and Dr Macdonald had neither committed any offence nor breached any Australian taxation law. We know that to be the case; we know that to be the fact-and the Liberal Party knew that to be the fact. The Liberal Party knew because Dr Macdonald had written to the then Premier, Mr Fahey, advising him of what had occurred, advising him of the full circumstances. So the Liberal Party, which comes in here and runs a collective defence, was in possession of all details of the circumstances. Yet the day before the state election they chose, through Senator Baume-and it is the Liberal Party that is under attack here-to table that document. There is a strong case that the Liberal Party has a tactic of going deep into the sewers of Australia and, indeed, it is going deeper and deeper into those sewers. To gain the evidena ce for this, look at number of incidents that have occurred recently both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Look at the behaviour of the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) in this House when he used leaked material from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission to attack former Senator Richardson on the so-called Operation Wallah. Despite the fact he could not prove his case, he nevertheless had no hesitation in standing up in this House and doing a bucket job. Look at what occurred in the Senate. A Queensland member of parliament, Mr Grice, again relying on confidential, leaked material from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, let that information be used in an attack against Senator Ray, despite the fact that it was demonstrable that the information used by Mr Grice was false. Yet today we now have Senator Chapman with a notice of motion in the Senate which, if passed by the Senate, would require the National Crime Authority to give to the Senate all material or documentation it mayor may not possess on this Operation Wallah. The Liberal Party is saying, 'These are good tactics.' But it is moving a motion that would create a criminal offence. If the Senate agreed to Senator Chapman's motion that the National Crime Authority produce documents concerning Operation Wallah to the Senate, the National Crime Authority would be in total breach of section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act which says that a person to whom this section applies, either directly or indirectly, who makes a record of any information or divulges or communicates to any person any information is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction or by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a year or both. It is interesting to look at the definition of who should not get it. A person to whom this section applies shall not be required to produce any document in any court. What does the word 'court' mean? A court is defined in the section as being any tribunal, authority or person having power to require the production of documents. The Senate is clearly an authority having power to require the production of documents. Liberal Party members are again at it. They are deep down in the sewers, trying to force the commission of criminal offences by using the forms of this House. It is part of a pattern. We have honest John Howard running around the countryside, accusing the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of behaviour which brings the standards of this House into disrepute. That is what he is saying. He is saying that the government and the Prime Minister behave in a way which brings this House into disrepute. Who abuses the forms of this House more often than anyone? Who ignores the standing orders of this House more often than anyone? It is certainly not the Prime Minister. Some people on the opposition front benches could well qualify as being those who have no respect for the forms of this House, the chair of this parliament or the laws of this country. That is the way opposition members are behaving. The member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), as part of the overall strategy of the Liberal Party-led by honest John Howard-breached both decency and law. Yet opposition members came into defend him. This is the norm. This is the pattern of behaviour the conservatives of this country are now running on. Let us not run away from it. The member for Mayo (Mr Downer) came in here and said, 'There is one standard for the Labor Party and one for us.' Let us see who breached those standards. Let us see who in this parliament breaches the law. Senator Baume broke the law-no ifs, no buts, no defence. The law clearly states that it is an offence to disclose the tax file number of any person. There are no ifs, no buts, no excuse and no argument about it-Senator Baume did break the law. Today Senator Chapman is trying to force the National Crime Authority to break the law. These are two examples of where the opposition members have total disregard and disrespect for the law. Then, of course, there is the member for Barker, who has total disrespect, not just for decency, morality or feelings, but for law. Yet the member for Mayo says, 'There is one standard for us and one standard for you.' Frankly, your standards stink. Your standards are appalling. Your standards have clearly been demonstrated in this parliament to be abhorrent. The standards of the Howard-led Liberal government are demonstrably illegal, abhorrent and leading you into the sewers. For your behaviour, you give a pale excuse. What happened this morning when we convened in this House? On indulgence from the chair, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) stood up and ran a case against the Prime Minister. Where was the case? What was the argument? It was fallacious and not in accordance with the forms and procedures of this House. Even at the very start of today's sitting, we had a clear demonstration of the total contempt you people have of this House and its proceedings. I notice the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) sitting over there. Members should note my forecast. 'Bucket' Katter will get up and go through Operation Wallah. He will use material leaked from the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland-material which is not necessarily trueMr Katter-Come on, there's been a court case!",40
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Mr Andrew)Order!,42
85,Mr CLEELAND,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"He will use it in a way that will attack the reputation of people who are not in this parliament to defend themselves. He will demonstrate to the Australian people yet again the character of the Howardled opposition because he will be doing it with the consent of that side of the House. Not only do we have 'Bucket' Baume but we will have another example of the sort of bucketing the Liberal Party does-I can see the member for Kennedy nodding his headin just a few minutes. That will prove the government's case that these people have no scruples, no decency and no morality. They will use material that has been criminally obtained-use the bucket., --and deny their criminality in so misusing it. They will not use information honestly and they will not give people a fair right of reply. That will demonstrated soon by the member for Kennedy. But he will feel no shame-his father might-because he is part of the bucket brigade. The Howard-led opposition stands condemned. The Australian public should listen to what the member for Kennedy is going to say. Frankly, the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission should be charged. It leaks like a sieve, and the person doing the leaking is Mark Le Grand. He should be brought to this House to justify his behaviour and that of the Criminal Justice Commission because there is something smelly, dirty and stinking about a law enforcement body that would leak material to politicians in this House in order to attack Australian citizens.",42
86,Mr TUCKEY,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"O'Connor) (12.07 p.m.)Let me correct a number of things that have just been said by the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland). Not an ounce of evidence was produced throughout the debate in the Senate-which, because of its length, will require members of this House to sit past midnight tonight-and no evidence has been produced here to link the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) with any activity relating to the motion before the House. Unless the government is prepared to produce some evidencewhich it failed to do in the wake of the prime ministerial allegations about the Packer dealit should stop talkingMr Chynoweth interjecting",42
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Mr Andrew)Order! The member for Dunkley might bear in mind that the member for MCEwen was heard in relative silence. When the member for Kennedy interrupted him I called him to order. I expect the same courtesy to be extended to the member for O'Connor.,42
88,Mr TUCKEY,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"I would like to add to what the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said relating to the information I provided to him about this government's hypocrisy. PreFebruary 1988, the then health minister-the former member for Bonython, Dr BLEWETT - in an effort to discredit doctors, gave to the then backbencher, the now Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), a series of documents which he probe posed to use in his role as chairman of Labor's price watch committee. The now Assistant Treasurer was at that time running a campaign against doctors that was associated with this government's attempt to reduce the burgeoning cost. of Medicare. As is always the case with such campaigns, the strategy was: attack the providers. Blewett, either mistakenly or deliberately, handed over documents which, in the first instance, seemed to have come to him illegally from the Health Insurance Commission. Section 130 of the relevant act makes it illegal. for the commission to pass on such things as provider numbers but that information was given either to Blewett or to members of his staff. He handed them on to the now Assistant Treasurer who used them publicly. They were caught. Not only would those provider numbers give access to all sorts of details about what individual doctors have been charging; they would also give access to information about patients against whom doctors had been levying those charges and the services involved, which could relate to embarrassing sexually transmitted disease or whatever. But they got caught. We came into this place and questioned the minister, and the minister admitted what he had done. We sought to censure him. The evidence of the attitude of the members of this House is, as usual, recorded in Hansard. The names of those who voted in favour of a minister releasing those medical provider numbers are all there. We called out a few before. R. J. Brown is one of the names there. That was his view. We have mentioned others, including Mr Chynoweth. Others have been mentioned before. They all came in here, notwithstanding their protest today, and voted in favour of the release of that sort of confidential information, notwithstanding that they passed an act, which includes section 130 that says it is illegal to do so. So much for the morality of this particular challenge. In fact, those people voted that way. One who was caught with his fingers in the till was the Assistant Treasurer, and he came into this place and participated in the debate. It is unbelievable. All your names are here. That is one thing about this placeeverything is on the record. That is how you voted. Let us put the morality of this issue aside. On both occasions the parties have claimed innocence. They claimed they did not know the gun was loaded. If the truth be known, both claims are correct. But that is not the point. This is a day when we level charges and this is a debate where we level charges at each other. Words have been used in this place by the member for MCEwen such as 'the Liberal Party has sunk deep into the sewers of Australia'. In the history of Australto is-from my recollections of the history of A ustralia-the greatest depth to which any politician has sunk deep into the sewers was when John HeIden MLC rose in the upper house of the state parliament of Western Australia to attack two women on behalf of a constituent. The constituent had a long record of being a Labor Party hack. His name was Brian Easton. There was a background to all of that. The two women being attacked were sisters. They were both government lawyers. One was the ex-wife of Brian Easton. At that time, the other was working for the Legal Aid Commission in Western Australia and had been appointed to represent the interests of women who had been defrauded by a woman called Robyn Greenberg, who conducted a form of building society called Western Women. These women had been defrauded. They had been recommended to go to Robyn Greenberg for financial advice. Many of them came with the pittance of their divorce settlement or maybe the inheritance from the death of a husband and were told by a government instrumentality called Women's Information Referral Exchange to go down to Robyn Greenberg because she was a female financial consultant-a woman who had been through two previous bankruptcies-and take her advice as to how to invest their money. They did seek her advice. She invested it for them and then stole the money. She is now in gaol for having stolen $3 million. These women were trying to recover from the government of the day, the then Labor government under Premier Carmen Lawrence, that money. They had a heap of evidence that they had been advised by a government agency to invest with Robyn Greenberg'S Western Women. Just prior to this date, I think it was 22 November 1992 or thereabouts, and HeIden raising these allegations of perjury against these women in the parliament, Margaret MCAulay, one of those women, the lawyer representing the interests of these women, went to Premier Lawrence and told her that the case was insubstantial. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The people listening the member for O'Connor's contribution have been waiting to see whether in fact his remarks are related to the matter under consideration. I think not. The member for O'Connor should be brought back to the substance of the issue.",42
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"The member for Charlton raises a point of order that, clearly, I have been considering too. But, having witnessed this debate, a number of members have used the form of this debate to indicate points at which, in the history of the parliament, various parliamentarians have impugned the integrity of others. 1 presume that the member for O'Connor is about to link his remarks back to the debate. I am waiting for him to do so.",43
90,Mr TUCKEY,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I also remind you that this is censure motion and those rules of relevance do not apply. Furthermore, I have listened the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) and a the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), and this censure debate has been wide ranging, as they always are. The point I want to make is that, just days before these allegations were made, Margaret MCAulay, the lawyer appointed by legal aid to represent the interests of these womenand I would have thought the member who just rose would have been rather interested this-went to the Premier, Carmen Lawrence, to tell her that on her inquiries these women had an irrefutable case against ment, that they had been so advised and that the government should settle. Margaret MCAulay told me she has never seen a person so angry as Premier Lawrence after receiving that advice. As history records, Premier Lawrence refused at any time to settle with those women. She was eventually out of office when the Court government took up the proper responsibilities of government and settled with them. So much for the government's adviser on women's affairs. To protect her own party and her own government from the accusations of making a very bad mistake, she was prepublic pared to leave women in poverty. But, of ment. course, Margaret MCAulay had to be punished. But then another embarrassment arose for Premier Lawrence relating to some $5,000 of travel money she had been given two years before but had failed to repay.

91,Mr TUCKEY,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"According to their squeals would you know them. Dr Tbeopbanous-I rise on a point of order. I know that this has been quite a wide ranging debate but if, in the process of the debate, there is an attack on an existing member of this House which impugns that person's integrity there are forms of the House which are",44
92,Mr TUCKEY,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"That is right. And you are right in the middle of one. Dr Tbeopbanous-Yes, but in that debate a you do not try to impugn the integrity of another member unless you want to move a to motion. If you want to move a motion, it is different matter. But the reality is that not only is this not relevant but in fact he is trying to impugn an existing member. I think you should rule him out of order.",44
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Order! The parliamentary secretary raises a point of order on which I have already ruled. This is a wide ranging debate. I regret the form that it is taking but, because it is a wide ranging in debate, I believe the member for O'Connor is within the scope of the debate. He may, however, like to link his remarks to the the governmotion before the House.",44
94,Mr TUCKEY,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"My linkage is the hypocrisy of these people today when, amongst their ranks, they now have a person who has behaved in this fashion. The point I am making is that that embarrassment was on the cards. The government needed a smokescreen and it proposed some form of attack on the then Leader of the Opposition, Richard Court, because there was.also an allegation floating around that one of these women had attended his office and requested certain information relating to her ex-husband. It was clear from police inquiries that Mr Court had never given anything and had referred that lady to the record of things he had said in parlia. But the simple fact was that John Halden MLC brought down a petition which he knew to be false. Worse, he had actually been an adviser, counsellor or something in the Family Court and took to the parliament secret from the Family Court. He could not make the claim he did not know the gun was loaded. He was an experienced person. He took information to the parliament which attacked a woman called Penny Easton, the ex-wife of Brian Easton. He brought down a petition attacking Margaret MCAulay's sisters and accusing both of them of perjury when in fact both he and the Premier knew that the information that they had provided in the court was true. What was the outcome of that? Penny Easton suicided. And what was the outcome for Mr Halden? He was found by a parliamentary committee to have acted dishonestly, trying to cover up for his then Premier. What happened to him? These are the standards of the Labor Party on these issues. He got promoted to the front bench by his then leader, Carmen Lawrence. Of course, Carmen Lawrence was up to here in it. She eventually admitted some knowledge, though she had correspondence directed to her office which, of course, in her typical fashion, she neither saw nor remembered. What happened to her? The Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) invited her to come over here and join his front bench. They are the level of standards of those opposite. It was one of the most disgraceful episodes ever in parliament, a total abuse of parliamentary privilege, with lies. It was for the wrong reasons, because it was purely political. It was done against women in all three cases. One only tried to protect some women's rights from the power of government. What did the Labor Party do with the people? You promoted both of them. Now you are floating the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) as your next deputy leader instead of Brian Howe, a bloke who might not be all that smart and that quick but who at least has some integrity. At least if you ask him what happened last week he can still remember. This is what you have done. You have come in here posturing about someone who inadvertently left a tax file number on a document which was absolutely true and who did make some attempts to rectify what he had done. Of course, your minister for health has. told lies about the situation. She has denied knowing, when written evidence has said that she did know.",44
95,Dr THEOPHANOUS,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask that that be withdrawn. It is contrary to standing orders.",45

97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Mr AndrewOrder! I do not need assistance from either the parliamentary secretary or the member for O'Connor. Reference to the minister for health as having told lies is invalid and should be withdrawn.,45

99,Mr LATHAM,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Werriwa) (12.22 p.m.)Michael Baume's disgraceful abuse of this parliament in tabling a tax file number in the Senate is not an isolated act. That is the thing that is most disturbing about this debate: it is not an isolated act and breach of privacy; it is part of a coordinated and sustained campaign of personal vilification and character assassination by the New South Wales'Liberal Party. Members of the New South Wales Liberal Party have introduced the politics of the big smear, from the garbage bins of the Lodge-and the garbage man himself is at the done front table-to the Hindmarsh Island papers affair, to push polling in Canberra. Some of the push pollers are in the gallery and the beneficiary of push polling, shamefully, is about to be sworn into this parliament. There is also the member for Kennedy and his unsustainable slurs on Graham Richardson's reputation right through to the tax file number of Dr Peter Macdonald. They have one strategy and one strategy aloneMr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The remarks made by the previous speaker are a reflection upon me and are totally incorrect. All of the things I have said have now been confirmed in three courts of law in Queensland.",45
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,Order! The member for Kennedy does not have a valid point of order. I rule that it is an invalid point of order.,45
101,Mr LATHAM,DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION,"Those opposite have one strategy, and one strategy alone: the politics of the big smear. Basically, in 1995 the Liberal Party has pulled down the shutters on policy development. At the last election it tried the big bang of Fightback. It tried the big bang policy, and it failed. Now it has moved to the big bang of the big smear, smearing the characters and personalities of those who stand in its way. This is an outfit that is absolutely bankrupt of ideas and replaces them with the politics of the big smear. The Liberal Party and the National Party in the 1990s cannot beat their opponents on policy or performance. They cannot beat the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on policy or performance. In the state seat of Manly they could not beat Dr Peter Macdonald on policy or performance. Their only strategy.,-the strategy that has become the stock-in-trade of the Liberal Party in the 1990s-is to play the man, not the ball, to smear at any cost. No matter the personal hurt, the cost to the reputation of Australian politics or the cost to the reputation of this parliament, they will smear at any cost. There was evidence of it yesterday in question time. Shamefully, opposition backbenchers went to the all-time low of trying to raise the Prime Minister's children as a political issue. The chief goon on the opposition side, its expert on the whoopee cushion and imitation spider, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), was right into it, raising the Prime Minister's children and his wife as a political question. Anyone's personal details are up for grabs under the big smear from the Liberal Party in the 1990s. No-one's privacy is safe. No-one's garbage bin can be left unattended at night, not so long as the Liberal Party has the garbage man, the iron bar, the goon from Cowan, raising these matters of personal vilification and character assassination. This is the outfit that in the 1960s and 1970s thought it was born to rule Australian politics. But now, unable to match the ALP on policy or performance, it is a party of spoilt brats and pointy heads whose only purpose is to vilify and assassinate the character of its opponents. The really disturbing thing about this is that it goes The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was there in question time yesterday sniggering away as his goons on the back bench raised matters about the Prime Minister's children and family. He is in this up to his neck. He coordinates opposition strategy at question time. He is so close to Michael Baume, his best friend in politics. When the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer in the 1970s and early 1980s, we used to follow the money trail to the bottom of the harbour, due to his neglect of the taxation system. Now, in the 1990s, we follow the smear trail from Senator Baume to the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), the campaign director in Manly, right through to their close personal friend, the Leader of the Opposition. The smear trail, the smut trail in Australian politics from the Liberal Party, leads right to the door in this parliament of the Leader of the Opposition and his office. Michael Baume is the Leader of the Opposition's best friend in politics. Yet the opposition leader will tell us in this debate and other places that he knew nothing about it. He knows nothing of these things happening in the Liberal Party. He knows nothing of the action of his frontbencher, the garbage man, rummaging through the garbage at the Lodge; he knows nothing of the actions of the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter); he knows nothing of the actions of the member for Cowan. Where is he? He must have been in Rio. He is the Ronald Biggs of Australian politics. He knows nothing about it. He was away in Rio. It is no wonder he was christened the rodent of Australian politics by none other than Andrew Peacock. The rodent is right in it, undermining the reputation of people. He is down there like any rodent would, in the gutters, in the sewers, in the garbage bins of Australian politics. It is an absolute disgrace that the Liberal Party would pull down the shutters on policy development and anything to do with performance in Australian politics and get down with its leader, the rodent, in the gutters and sewers of Australian politics. No-one's privacy and no-one's personal details are safe from its examination and vilification in the Australright to the top. Ian parliament. It is absolutely absurd for Senator Baume to maintain he did not know the tax file number of Peter Macdonald was on the document. He must have known. Is he trying to tell the Senate that someone of his background, who spends so much time raking over personal details, who spends so much time studying private documents, would not have noticed that the document had on it the tax file number of Dr Peter Macdonald? Even if we accept his absurd and ludicrous assertion that he did not know the tax file number was on the document, the point is that the tax file number is only there to protect the sort of personal information that Michael Baume tabled in the Senate. He had absolutely no regard, like the rest of the Liberal Party and the National Party in the 1990s, for privacy, for personal dignity and personal arrangements. He was prepared to use any method at any cost to bring down Peter Macdonald in the state seat of Manly. The Liberals could not beat him on the substance and what used to be in this country the mainstream of political debate. This is the same Michael Baume who came to this parliament in 1975 after a seedy and undistinguished career with the infamous Patrick Partners. As we all know, under the present laws of the Australian Securities Commission, if any stockbroking firm now carried out what Patrick Partners did then, it would be charged. This was the shoddy practice of producing TV programs to induce people to buy shares with the offer of a bonus payment. He has not changed one little bit. Had the airing of Peter Macdonald's tax file details occurred outside the parliament, Senator Baume would have been charged and criminally punished for his act. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence punishable by two years imprisonment or a fine of up to $10,000, or both, for the unauthorised disclosure of a person's tax file number. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA",45

103,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER SWORN,"With your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker, on behalf of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party and on behalf of the federal coalition, I would like to extend an extremely warm welcome to the newly sworn member for Canberra, Brendan Smyth. Our new colleague enjoyed the largest swing in modern political history in Australia. A swing which approximates to 17 per cent on a twoparty preferred basis is bigger by three or four per cent than the swing in the Tasmanian seat of Bass in 1975 that heralded the end of the Whitlam government. Mr Reith-No wonder Paul is not here.",47
104,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER SWORN,"It is no wonder the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is not here. It is not without moment that the government resolved that, against the normal practice, the member would be sworn in at 12.30 p.m. rather than immediately before question time. Perhaps the Prime Minister would have found it rather uncomfortableto have witnessed his swearing in. All I can say is' that this is not so much a victory for the Liberal Party or a victory for Brendan Smyth; it is overwhelmingly a victory for mainstream Australia, which is demanding of its government a recognition of the difficulties under which mainstream Australia has been labouring now for a very long time. I know those opposite find this uncomfortable, but they are going to find the next eight or nine months even more uncomfortable. In case they see the New South Wales result as some of kind of fleeting hour of triumph, let me remind them that, even in New South Wales, there are some very interesting statistics. At the last federal election, in New South Wales the coalition enjoyed 45.6 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. Last Saturday we got 51.8 per cent of the two-party preferred vote which, if you extrapolate that consistently, would give us 10 seats in New South Wales. I know that this afternoon in his normal fashion the Prime Minister will have something to. say abo.ut it. Well, I am getting in first o.n this o.ccasio.n. I am saying so.mething abo.ut the New So.uth Wales result. But, mo.re than anything else, this is an o.ccasio.n to. welco.me the new member fo.r Canberra.

110,Mr LATHAM,MEMBER SWORN,"But, as my friend and colleague the member for Throsby correctly points out, it is a saga to be continued. As long as the Liberal Party trumps into this parliament your Michael Baumes, your Tony Abbotts, your David Connollys and Richard Evanses-the garbage men and the goons of the Liberal Party-as the stock-in-trade of the Liberal Party in the 1990s dealing in the politics of the big smear, they can have one personal guarantee, shared right across the government backbench, and that is it will come back with interest. Those failures of the landed aristocracy in Australia, those dropthe outs of corporate Australia who come into this place pretending they are angels, have a lot to hide in their own backgrounds. They can be assured by the Labor Party that in debates like this we are not going to cop it any longer. We are not going to cop their failure to develop policy, their failure to develop ideas and their failure to debate matters of substance. We are going to hold them to account by their own standards on questions of tax minimisation, property dealings, rummaging through garbage bins and raising in parliamentary debate people's children and their spouses. We are going to hold them fully and totally to account for those sorts of standards.

That is completely false and I would like to take the time to read that particular question. I read directly from Hansard: My question is directed to the Minister representing Minister for Defence. Is it true that the Prime Minister was so impressed with the pomp and circumstance of guards of honour overseas that his own department and the defence department considered giving him one of his own? Is that because the old guard like Graham Richardson has deserted him? Is it to fight a rearguard action against his backbenchers?Is it because he does not think he is getting enough protection from the Speaker, or is it just another method of protecting him from the real anger of the Australian people? Minister, will the Prime Minister ask Priscilla designer and Oscar winner Lizzie Gardiner to design the guards' new uniforms? Will their badge contain the new Keating crest of the mortgage grindstone and a clock that keeps part time? Will the Prime Minister donate one of his former pigs as a mascot? MinisterAnd then I was interrupted by the Acting Speaker, who talked about irony. I went on to say: Doesn't all this ironical content just go to prove that in the real world the Prime Minister is considered an out of touch joke? Nowhere in that particular question did.

127,Mr KATTER,MEMBER SWORN,"Kennedy) (12.48 p.m.}-In rising to defend Senator Baume today, I might say that it amazes me that more people in this place have not read the following books: The Bold Riders by Trevor Sykes, John Pilger's book The Secret Country, and two other books, about what happened in this country during the 1980s. Trevor Sykes, a very reputable person in every way-I do not think anyone in this House would deny that-said in his book that $16,000 million was lost to some degree to the benefit of about 20 people whom he names in the book. During that period the banks lost $28,000 million. To give you an indication of where that money went and how this money was allowed to go to these areas, I will refer to a Time magazine article on corruption-not in Australia but in another country. Let me hark back for one moment to the fact that the result of $28,000 million being lost by the banks during the 1980sby being loaned out to various people and the money then. vanishing was that one in four farmers has gone broke and been forced off his land since 1986. Over 800,000 small business families in this country have been broken over the last eight years. In my electorate there were two suicides last year. One was a person being hounded by a bank; he had to shoot his cattle because of the drought and he then turned the gun on himself. The other was a young man, the son of a prominent grazier family in the area. Like every other family, they were finding it very tough. Only last week we had the deplorable case mentioned in the House by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) where a young man who was about to be foreclosed on by the banks locked himself in his homestead. The reason that this is happening in Australia is that $16,000 million was creamed off by 20 men. If you go through the list of 20, you will see that about half of them were prominent beneficiaries of the Australian Labor Party. In fact, they served on committees to raise funds for the ALP; and I can name them in this House. Let me turn back to the Time magazine article. It was an article about the corruption that exists in Indonesia. The Australian press is wonderful at casting aspersions on countries like Indonesia. This article says that it is possible that this person could have blown away as much as $200 million of public funds on a project. He had friends, maybe even in the ministry, who facilitated money from government instrumentalities to go into a petrochemical plant project. This was horrific. It demonstrated how endemic-and it was the worse case yet---corruption is in the Indonesian government. He may have got away with $200 million. It was alleged in the article that this was simply a device dreamed up to take money out of the public purse and put it into private pockets, and some of that money went back to government officials. I refer to the petrochemical plant project, because that is what we are talking about today. We are talking about corruption, and those people who have the courage, aggressiveness, energy and surveillance to be able to stop corruption from occurring in this country, and Senator Baume is one of those people. I refer to the petrochemical plant project which is before the courts in Australia. It is not speculation; it is reality. Effectively, it involves two men: Laurie Connell, who was the head of fundraising for the ALP in Western Australia; and Dallas Dempster, another prominent bankroller of the ALP in Western Australia. To say that he bankrolled the ALP in Western Australia but not federally is to insult the intelligence of every person in this House. Anyway, they had this great scheme for a petrochemical plant project. I am sure that they were definite about building it. They sold this project to the Western Australian government for $392 million. The liquidator moved in later on, as it did in just about everything in Western Australia, and liquidated the assets of the petrochemical plant project. The liquidated assets of the petrochemical plant project totalled $11 million. These two men had effectively pocketed $381 million. Indonesia is terribly corrupt, but in Australia, of course, we have a very clean government. We do not have that sort of thing happening in Australia. If that is endemic, and that is the worse example yet of corruption in Indonesia, all I can say is that it must be a very honest government compared with the government of this country. I will move on and talk about Bell Corporation. The beneficiary of Bell Corporation now sits on the Reserve Bank of Australia where, undoubtedly, she was put by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I have it on very goOd authority that he used to stay with them when he was visiting Western Australia when Robert Holmes a Court was alive. Bell Corporation was sold to instrumentalities of the Western Australian Labor government fordepending upon which article you want to choose-$360 million, $465 million or $260 million. It rolled over dead two years later and not a single cent was paid out to the shareholders in that corporation, which of course were the taxpayers of Western Australia. A delightful article, I think in Business Review Weekly, said that the stories about it were wildly exaggerated and that, in fact, the taxpayers had lost only $160 million to the owners of Bell Corporation which, substantially, was the Holmes a Court family-only $160 million! Those are just two examples. I could sit here for the next half-hour and quote examples from these truly magnificent books which disclose what happened in Australia during the 1980s. I ask myself-and historians in future years will also ask themselves-why nobody in this place had the courage to stand up and say, 'This has got to stop.' These were government instrumentalities, government banks. It was the job of the Reserve Bank of Australia to stop this from happening. That why the Reserve Bank exists-to act as a watchdog in overseeing all of the banks in Australia. Again and again in those books you will see reference to the fact that the Reserve Bank failed to take any action whatsoever. That was particularly glaringly obvious in the case of the savings bank of South Australia, as it was in all of these other cases. One must ask why the Reserve Bank did not act. Why did the people who were paid a king's ransom to oversee and stop this from happening allow $28,000 million of people's hard-earned savings to go up in smoke in deals of this nature? Senator Baume has had the courage to speak out. He faces a very serious defamation action. Unfortunately, in Australia the defamation laws are different from those in any other country. We do not have a freedom of speech principle in our laws in Australia. strongly commend the High Court action. Maybe one good outcome of the terrible events of the 1980s is the fact that the High Court has now moved in the Theophanous case to virtually abolish defamation action where matters of public interest are involved. So we are moving into the same situation applies in the United States. I rather enjoyed some of the comments that have been made. Ray Martin interviewed me and said, 'How would you like these things to be said about you?' He referred to some the things I had said about some other people, and I burst out laughing. That was not the sort of reaction he expected from me. I said, 'That is extremely mild compared with the things that I have been called and the concertand ed attacks made upon me, my family, my character and my honesty over the last 20 years in the state house. And you must be the only journalist in Australia that is not aware of some of those attacks because they made the national dailies on a number of occaChairman. sions.' As a minister and a member of the Queensland parliament I went through six separate investigations. No politician anyhis where in the world has been more ed than the National Party of Australia memis bers of the state house in Queensland. Mr O'Keefe-With good reason too-and you would be the first to admit it.",50
128,Mr KA TTER,MEMBER SWORN,"I was expecting that. I welcome the interjection-a classic example of fools rushing in. I think the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) earlier described Mark Le Grand as the 'dirty leak' from the CJC. I have a friend, who happens to be a friend of a policeman, who had heard some information-and this is very serious stuff. He told me that Mark Le Grand had applied to tap my telephone and Senator Chapman's telephone. If Mark Le Grand was supposedly leaking to us, it would be very funny for him to apply at the same time for wire-taps on our telephones. That is how well informed the ALP is. If honourable members read the newspapers in Australia, they would have thought that the I Queensland government was a very corrupt government. For six years $65 million was spent looking up our toenails. At the end of all that the courts found that $26,000 had gone astray. After we spent $65 million, the courts decided that $26,000 had gone astray! That was defined, Mr Acting Chairman. as The leading case was the case of the Queen v. Brian Austin. Brian Austin went to gaol because he had used his government car for private purposes. He had used his government car to visit his kids at school on the weekend of and on a number of other occasions. He had used his plastic fantastic to take people out to dinner. That was why Brian Austin, a human being, was put in a steel cage for two years of his life-he was sentenced to four years he served two years of that sentence.",52

130,Mr KA TTER,MEMBER SWORN,"I would love to have more time. Mr Deputy Speaker, the figure in Queensland was $26,000. The figure in Western Australia was $876 million. The figure in Victoria was $3,000 million and the figure in South Australia was $3,100 million. That is the story that the history books will tell. I refer to articles in the Financial Review and the Australian. I do not know about any of these things, but those articles Prime Minister owned half of a company that owned a piggery worth $80 million. The articles said that the Prime Minister had a $20 million interest in the piggery. A journalist said to me, 'Oh, well, he borrowed the money.' I said to the journalist, 'How much money could you borrow?' When I eventually forced him to name a figure, he said, '$200,000.' I said, 'Right, you can borrow $200,000, but this bloke, on a take-home pay of $70,000 a year, can borrow $20 million!' We are discussing the things which have been disclosed by Senator Michael Baume. If he is in trouble for disclosing secrets, then the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) should resign, for there could not be a worse example of invasion of the privacy of an ordinary, decent Australian family than was displayed by Senator Crowley, and yet no action has been taken against her whatsoever. Mr O'Keefe-I rise on a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker. I would ask you to ask that, if the member is going to develop these hypotheses, he at least deliver them in a way that we can understand rather than with this convoluted drivel.",53
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEMBER SWORN,The parliamentary secretary knows better than that. The member for Kennedy was responding to the chair's invitation to draw his debate relative to the motion before the chair. The member for Kennedy has the call.,53
132,Mr KA TTER,MEMBER SWORN,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, owns a multi storey building, a $3 million-plus home, half of VITAB, and numerous other assets around the countryside, and he acquired all that on a take-home pay of about $70,000 a year. That is certainly very interesting, is it not? All the remarks I have made about Senator Richardson are on the public record in the courts of Queensland. People said that I came in here with unsubstantiated rumours and told lies, but it is on the public record, and yet David Thomas, who has done a lot of excellent work for me, is being prosecuted and so is Craig Nicholls, the resource officer.

139,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following NOES proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Maintenance dredging of Kedron Brook floodway, Brisbane. The 1994-95 budget provided for the maintenance dredging of Kedron Brook floodway, at an estimated cost of $9.1 million. The Commonwealth owned Kedron Brook consists of an 8.5-kilometre long deep-water channel, passing through approximately 500 hectares of flood plain, linking the Kedron Brook with Moreton Bay. It was constructed in 1980, by the Commonwealth, as part of the Brisbane airport development, to replace the existing flood plain drainage system, which was filled during airport works. The Kedron Brook floodway has not undergone any maintenance dredging since it was constructed. The dredging now proposed will remove silt deposits which have accrued over the last 15 years, and will restore the channel to its original design performance capacity. The dredge spoil is to be placed on lowlying areas of the old Brisbane airport site. It is proposed that the dredging works commence by August 1995, and be completed by June 1996. I table some supporting drawings and commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",54
140,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"--I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Refurbishment of Scarborough House and construction of Commonwealth offices, Phillip, ACT. Scarborough House has not undergone any major refurbishment since it was constructed in 1970. The building'sinternal fabric is now at the end of its life, and its services are generally below currently required standards. The proposal is for the total refurbishment of the building and the upgrading of base building services, to a standard commensurate with current commercial office building standards. The proposed new building will provide approximately 10,400 square metres net lettable area of office space and approximately 600 square metres net lettable area for storage. The estimated outturn cost for both the Scarborough House refurbishment and the new building's construction, including AIPO's fit-out cost, is $50.38 million. The project will be undertaken in two stages, with the construction of the new building scheduled to commence in July 1995 and to be concluded with the refurbishment· of Scarborough House, which is to be completed by February 1998. The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in December 1994. The committee tabled its report on 27 March 1995, recommending the refurbishment of Scarborough House and the construction of an annex building on the adjacent site, at an estimated cost of $50.38 million. I thank the committee for its report and I commend this motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Accounts Committee Report",55
141,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"--On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I am pleased to table Report No. 335-Finance Minutes. Ordered that the report be printed.",55
142,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I am pleased to present Report No. 355-Finance Minutes. Report 335 contains copies of the two Finance minutes received by the committee during the 1994 calendar year. As many members will be aware, the Finance minute process is the· mechanism by which the government responds to many of the recommendations contained in the committee reports. The only recommendations which are not responded to by a Finance minute are those which address policy matters. Recommendations of this nature are responded to separately by the government. Each of the Finance minutes contained in report 335 has already been tabled separately, but they are reproduced here in an annual consolidation for ease of future reference. The Finance minutes deal with the committee's reports on: an inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office; and its reviews of Auditor-General's reports tabled in the period May 1991 to September 1992.· The Finance minute on Report No. 326-An assessment of tax was tabled in parliament on 20 October 1994, together with comments by the committee. Report 326 was the result of the first major public examination of the administration of taxation laws in Australia since the enactment of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In its report the committee sought to introduce balance to a system which it saw as having grown to ignore the people it serves. When tabling the Finance minutes in October last year I noted that the vast majority of the 88 administrative recommendations had been accepted and were being implemented. I can now advise the House that since that date the committee has taken steps to continue its interest and involvement in the reform process generated by report 326. The first was to invite the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, to brief the committee on progress in the implementation of those recommendations which had been accepted. The briefing took place in December 1994 and at that meeting Mr Carmody undertook to provide the committee with regular progress reports. The first of these reports is due shortly. The other step we have taken is to announce a watching brief over the work of the tax law improvement project. The improvement project was established by the government in response to one of the key recommendations in report 326-that the Income Tax Assessment Act be rewritten and simplified. The improvement project has already produced impressive results with its simplified rewrite of the substantiation provisions of the tax law. Just yesterday the committee was briefed by officials from the improv-ment project on their proposed framework for the new income tax assessment law. The framework, which will be released for public discussion in late April, promises to be a major step forward in the process of producing clearer and simplified tax law. The second element of the committee's watching brief is to examine the concerns raised by some in the tax profession· that, because the improvement project is not authorised to consider policy matters, it will be unable to deal with the problems inherent in the current tax law. The committee intends to seek submissions from interested parties on this issue in the coming weeks. The second Finance minute reproduced in the report I have just tabled is· in relation Report No. 330-ReviewofAuditor-General's reports, May 1991 to September 1992. Report 330 contained the results of the committee's review of the 72 audit reports tabled from May 1991 to September 1992. The committee is pleased to note that 10 of the 12 recommendations contained in the report have been accepted or accepted in principle by the relevant agencies. One issue of concern to the committee arising from report 330 is an apparent inconsistency between: information provided by the Department of Human Services and Health in response to a recommendation about the validation of nursing home funding; information provided by the same department in response to the Senate community affairs committee's recent report on nursing home funding; and the findings of a recent audit report on the same subject. The committee has sought an explanation from the secretary to the department and will consider his response closely. I thank the House for its time. NA BILL (No.2) 1995 First Reading Bill presented by Mr O'Keefe, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr O'Keefe; ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 29 March. Second Reading",55
143,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (1.26 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The National Health Amendment Bill 1995 amends the National Health Act 1953 to to continue the benefits achieved in the last four years of the agreement with community pharmacy. The bill reflects the fact that both community pharmacy and the government recognise the importance of the current agreement in being able to make fundamental changes to community pharmacy, and the need to continue those changes. The current agreement has provided the incentives and the stability to allow these necessary changes to occur in an environment of cooperation and planning. This agreement has provided assistance to over 600 pharmacists to voluntarily accept payment to hand back their approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits. In general, these pharmacies have been the smaller, less viable pharmacies which adversely impacted on the cost of supply of pharmaceutical benefits. The agreement has encouraged pharmaceutical services to be established and maintained in isolated areas. Over 400 pharmacies in isolated areas now receive extra remuneration to assist in meeting their higher costs. The agreement has produced a period of stability during which government and pharmacy have not been locked in conflict over remuneration issues, a situation that has unfortunately dogged past relationships. This has given both pharmacy and government the opportunity to explore the beneficial role of pharmacy in health care for the community at a time when community health care is changing rapidly. Noticeable now is the recognition by the pharmacy organisations of the need to monitor the performance of community pharmacy and to measure the outcomes of their activities in health care. In other words, pharmacy is moving from a reactive to a proactive service to the community. The bill will allow these changes to continue while building on the experiences gained from the current agreement. Both the government and pharmacy agree that the number of approved pharmacies is now at about the correct level and that the closure and amalgamation payments should cease. The ratio of pharmacies per 1,000 population is now within the range of international figures, unlike the higher levels previously experienced. It is now a matter of continuing to encourage a good distribution of pharmacies rather than the clumping that has occurred in the past and that still exists in some areas of our capital cities. To achieve this distribution, the current controls relating to the relocation of pharmacies are to be relaxed so that developing areas around the capital cities and other growth areas can be provided with appropriate pharmaceutical services. It is expected that these relocated pharmaci-s will come from the presently overserviced areas. To encourage the provision of pharmaceutical services in rural and remote regions, the incentives for pharmacies to operate in isolated areas will be continued under the legislation. The bill will permit simpler procedures for approved pharmacists wishing to sell a business or change the ownership. In other cases, the valuable work and successes of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority will be maintained. The authority will be reduced in membership and its name will be changed to the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. It will continue to use the experience of hands-on pharmacists to advise the secretary on applications for new approvals and on relocations of approvals. The criteria for these considerations will, as is the case under the present agreement, be set out in a determination made under section 99L of the National Health Act 1953. It is necessary to be confident that pharmacists who supply pharmaceutical benefits maintain adequate standards of practice. The bill will permit the secretary to apply conditions for holding an approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits, primarily applying standards of practice developed by pharmacy itself. The bill also introduced the ability of the minister to agree to professional allowances for specific professional pharmacy activities outside the pharmaceutical benefits supply functions. One such area is medication review of residents in nursing homes, a very important area. At present, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, in making a determination concerning the remuneration of approved pharmacists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits, is required to give effect to any agreement in force between the minister and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on this matter. This provision in the legislation is to continue in operation. I commend the bill to the House.",56
144,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I will not take up too much of the time of the House to discuss the National Health Amendment Bill, which the coalition does not oppose. The National Health Amendment Bill 1995-and I must say that I have noticed the name change-is the enabling legislation for the new pharmacy agreement between the Commonwealth and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, as the professional association of retail pharmacists. It replaces the agreement which has operated since 1991 under which the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority has presided over a major shake-out in the retail pharmacy industry. The bill replaces the authority with a new Australian Community Pharmacy Authority which will make recommendations to the government on applications to supply pharmaceutical benefit items, the payment of allowances in isolated and rural areas and the payment of allowances for specific professional services. The bill will also end the financial assistance program which has operated under the present agreement to facilitate the restructuring process. I am advised that that process has seen the number of active pharmacists in Australia decline by about 10 per cent. The coalition notes that this agreement will introduce two new allowances to replace the essential pharmacy allowance. These new allowances are the isolated pharmacy allowance and the remote pharmacy allowance. We see the importance of ensuring pharmacies continue to operate in areas which may not be as financially attractive as other locations. Therefore, we support these allowances. The bill also introduces a professional allowance which will give some recognition of the professional activities of pharmacists outside the supply of drugs, such as participating in drug evaluation trials and the simple giving of professional advice over the counter. We welcome this wider conception of the role of pharmacists in our community-a role I wholeheartedly support and endorse. I should add that we also have no objection to the government's amendment extending the life of the new agreement by one year. This is welcomed by the industry, as the longer period will create greater commercial certainties for retail pharmacies. In summary, we do not oppose the bill, because it is sound and, more importantly, it has been negotiated with the Pharmacy Guild over a period of time and is quite acceptable to the players involved. In this regard, the government is to be congratulated and I commend this consultative approach to the portfolio minister in respect of other areas of health that we will be debating in this House later today. With this bill, however, the government has certainly fallen short of best practice in some respects. We are going to the wire with this piece of legislation as the new pharmacy agreement is still unsigned-I understand that this will happen later today-and the agreementitself comes into force on 1 April 1995. That is this Saturday. As a result, my office has received many queries from colleagues and from pharmacists themselves, particularly those who would be seriously affected by the sudden delay .of the remote and isolated pharmacy allowance. It is not good enough for the governmentto be bringing this legislation through the House 36 hours before the deadline. We are also aware that negotiations between the government and the Pharmacy Guild have been protracted, having opened as long ago as November 1993. Indeed, cabinet only approved the agreement last week. Meanwhile, thousands of pharmacists have been hanging on anxiously as the bureaucratic wheels ground on. Finally, I am concerned at the way that this reflects on the government's treatment of this parliament. We are here now rubber-stamping an act of executive government, which still requires a major agreement to be signed. While I appreciate the cooperation that I have received from the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in relation to this bill, the government cannot walk away from the fact that it is operating, in the passage of this biII, on the assumption that the parliament will simply be a rubber stamp for the executive. It reminds me of our debate last year on what is now the Employment Services Act 1994. In that instance, you may recall that the government passed enabling legislation to establish the Employment Services Regulatory Authority to oversee its job compact. Yet, on the weekend before the bill was debated, there was an advertisement in the national media seeking a chair for the authority-a position eventually given to one Joan Kirner. That advertisement appeared before the parliament had passed the legislation. Also, the explanatory memorandum to this bill is simply unprofessional. A prose rendering of each provision of this bill, a mere jargonistic paraphrase, gives little understanding of the operation of these provisions. The general outline is little more than a very vague narrative. This is something which has been raised in this place before, by my colleague the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I want to raise it specifically in relation to the explanatory memorandum provided by the Department of Human Services and Health which has been circulated in this place in the life of this parliament. I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous)-who has a respect for the processes of this place-to take this concern back to his minister and to make the point forcefully to the Department of Human Services and Health that it should get its act together. It may be a small thing, but it reflects the dim view that the executive arm of government has about the members of this place. I, and my coalition colleagues, simply say to the government that, whatever the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) may think, Australia is a parliamentary democracy we in this place are the people's representamisunderstanding tives. By showing disdain for the representafor tives in this place, the government shows disdain for the Australian people. It shows that disdain at its own peril, as shown by swearing in of the new member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) today. I will finish by moving, as a reflection of the coalition's concern, the following second reading amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a reading, this House: (1) notes that the Pharmacy Agreement to take effect from 1 April 1995, which is subject of this Bill, is still being negotiated by the Government; (2) notes that this is far from being the only instance of the Government legislating in anticipation of a set of circumstances which are still to be resolved; and (3) condemns the Government for its continual treatment of the Parliament as a rubber stamp of executive action"".",57
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Is the motion seconded? Mr Ronaldson-I second the motion.,59
146,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (1.39 p.m.)This has been a very short debate on the National Health Amendment Bill, but I note that the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has felt so strongly as to move a second reading amendment. I am rather surprised at that. He puts forward an interesting case. He says that he agrees with every feature of the bill, in particular with such very important matters as the question of pharmacies in isolated places, the special allowance and the professional allowances for pharmacists. I am also very enthusiastic about this new development. I have met with the Pharmacy Guild and with other pharmacists' representatives and they are all very happy with that. It seems as though, on the basis of the and second reading amendment, there is some on the part of the member Chisholm about the procedure here. We had to have the framework in which to progress the negotiations. That framework is the the bill. We have not assumed that everything is going to be concluded entirely in the context of the bill. All we have said is, assuming that to be the case in the general structure-we have not concluded the negotiations; we are . going to conclude the negotiations after the bill is passed-that the passing of the bill will view give us the opportunity. So I am not sure why he says that we have pre-empted the parliasecond ment and that the parliament is a rubber stamp. It is not a rubber stamp in these matters. As the honourable member well the knows, this parliament is not a rubber stamp like some parliaments in the Westminster system, because we do have the other place, and at the other place the government does not have a majority. Mr Ronaldson-Thank goodness.",59
147,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"--Thank goodness, the honourable member says. You never know, in a few decades you might win government, but certainly not in the foreseeable future",60
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Order! The parliamentary secretary should remain on the subject.,60
149,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,--The honourable member had a wide ranging,60
150,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,It wasn't wide ranging at all.,60
151,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"--The Senate has in fact passed this bill; so the majority of parties in the Senate have supported the bill. We are not in any sense taking it for granted or assuming the parliament to be a rubber stamp, especially at the moment having regard to the Senate. That is an argument that we simply do not accept, and I think that the honourable member is just trying to make a couple of naughty political points in the context of the current heated atmosphere. Mr Ronaldson-Of which you've never been guilty.",60
152,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"--I have not. Others have, but I have not.",60
153,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,What about the explanatory memorandum?,60
154,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,What is your problem with the explanatory memorandum?,60
155,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,It is sloppy.,60
156,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,--It is not sloppy.,60
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Order! We cannot have a conversation across the chamber.,60
158,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"--The honourable member does not disagree with anything in the bill, with any of the arrangements, but he wants to try to make some kind of political point about the process. There is no political point to be made about the process. This has been a good process. I want to commend the Department of Human Services and Health for the great work which it has done in this whole area. This has been a tough process of getting a preliminary agreement, putting things in legislation and having negotiations. Even the honourable member for Chisholm has said that it is good that we have had negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild and with pharmacists. So I still do not understand what he is complaining about. Fundamentally, this has been a very good process for pharmacists. It has been a good process for achieving a very positive outcome in terms of the health of the nation. I cQmmend the department and all those involved in the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and elsewhere for the negotiations and in our getting to this point. I look forward to the conclusion of the discussions and negotiations in the next few days once this bill passes this House, as I hope that it will. After that, we will have a very good agreement in place, which I know many pharmacists throughout Australia are looking forward to. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative.

159,Mr TICKNER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (1.46 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill reflects the continuing commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, referred to in schedule 1 of that act, may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977 a total of 58 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. The effect of this bill would be to bring within the schedule to the land rights act that area of land which is the subject of the Hodgson Downs land claim. The Northern Territory government, the Northern Land Council and claimants in the land claim have entered into an agreement which settles that land claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the land rights act to grant the claim area, excluding the Hodgson River road and the Miniyeri community access road, to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the land rights act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple. The government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account. There are no financial implications arising from this bill. I commend the bill to the House.",60
160,Mrs GALLUS,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Hindmarsh) (1.48 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, as the matter has been canvassed already in the Senate with exactly the same speech as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has given here, I certainly do, not want to, repeat wh-t has been said. I just wish to add to what he has said, that it is under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 that the most gains have been made by Aboriginal people. This has certainly been the landmark legislation in the area of Aboriginal affairs and certainly land rights. It was legislation enacted by the Fraser government in 1976 and since that time, as the minister has noted, there have been a number of parcels of land that have come under the act. The amount of land that has now passed to Aboriginal ownership under this act and separate from other acts is 536,000 square kilometres, altogether 40 per cent of the Northern Territory land mass. Certainly the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory have gained momentously from this act of the Fraser government which followed the Woodward report. However, I might add that, in contrast, not one Aboriginal person has gained anything from the Native Title Act to date. There have been seven determinations made under the act and all those have been made in favour of non-claimants. In passing I wish to contrast the effect of those two acts. (Quorum formed)",61
161,Mr GIBSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The bill we are discussing this afternoon is the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.2). The purpose of this bill is to add one parcel of land to those granted to Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. The land is situated in the Mataranka region, south of Katherine in the Northern Territory. The land, with an area of some 3,232 square kilometres, is of cultural significance and contains a number of sacred sites. Known as Hodgson Downs, the area is under pastoral lease from the Northern Territory government and is used as a cattle station. It has a population of 240 Aboriginal people, and was purchased by ATSIC in 1991. Because all interests in the property are held by or on behalf of Aboriginal people, a land claim over the station was able to be lodged under the provisions of the original act. In effect, this bill seeks to convert the title from the Northern Territory leasehold to Commonwealth freehold. Despite its opposition in principle to the lodging of land claims over Aboriginal owned cattle stations, the Northern Territory government in August last year agreed to a settlement of this land claim without the need for a hearing by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. This is a positive development for a number of reasons. Not only did the Northern Territory government do something which for once showed a bit of thought in dealings with Aboriginal issues; it also saved a considerable amount of time and money. Most importantly, however, it will enable the handover of title to take place while the elderly traditional Aboriginal owners are still alive, something upon which they place enormous importance. As already noted, because all parties agreed to the station being granted to an Aboriginal land trust under the act, there was no need for a hearing by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. Therefore, the only way for the station to be granted a trust was by means of an amendment to schedule 1 of the act. Therefore, this is a very clear and well thought out process and a very positive development, and this government is pleased to bring this bill before the House to achieve this purpose. In enacting this bill, the government sees the practical and positive manifestation of our policy towards indigenous Australians and the broader goals of our social justice policy. I understand that the opposition is supporting this legislation and therefore there is a lot of controversy with the bill. Although in the scheme of things in this House it may be seen as a minor piece of legislation, for the Aboriginal people concerned it is a very major and positive development, and I am pleased that we are able to pass it with bipartisan support in the House. While we are talking about the issues of land and social justice, I would also like to take the opportunity of congratulating the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation on the great document that it released last week called Going forward: social justice for the first Australians, which is in response to the request that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to come forward with some ideas about what it believes should be put in the social justice statement that the government intends to make later this year. I am very pleased that my friend and colleague the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the Liberal Party representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, is here because I wish to convey to hirl my personal congratulations on the importam 'ole he played in achieving this document. I must say that I think it is an act of bravery on his part that he has signed it on behalf of the Liberal Party, endorsingMr Nugent-Bravery is code for something else.",61
162,Mr GIBSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I see. It is brave to have endorsed all of the recommendations in this report, because there are some quite significant recommendations. I look forward to the Liberal Party of Australia supporting the implementation of many of these recommendations. I am not sure which ones of these the government will pick up, when they will be picked up, and what the process is. The government, of course, has only just received the document and is considering it in detail, as we have similarly just received the A TSIC document, which is its submission to the government on the social justice statement and also contains some important points. What I think is so important about this booklet-and if other honourable members of the House have not yet read it I would urge not them to do so-is that it puts together in one very valuable document the way forward for achievement of reconciliation. This House has unanimously endorsed the principles and the objectives of achieving reconciliation between the indigenous peoples of Australia and the non-indigenous peoples of Australia and this document, Going forward, gives us the very clear pathway towards achieving that. One might use the term radical for some of the suggestions in here which will provoke discussion and debate, which was the very purpose for putting them in the document. As a parliament and as a House we need to have our preconceived ideas challenged from time to time. We need to do a little bit of lateral thinking. I do not think enough lateral thinking occurs in politics in this country. This document sets forward some very important and valuable suggestions. It does not say, 'Thou shalt do this. Thou must do that.' It is not a letter of demand or an ambit claim by Aboriginal people. It is meant to be a means of promoting and stimulating discussion and consideration of very important issues, and I think, people need to understand it in that context and not just summarily reject out of hand certain suggestions that are made in the book, without really thinking about what they are trying to achieve. In this parliament and in the greater public domain there has been a lot of debate and discussion about constitutional reform and the Prime Minister is on the public record stating the agenda that he believes should be achieved in constitutional reform. One of the important things that is set out in this booklet is the plea by indigenous people in this country, saying, 'If you are going to consider constitutional reform, you need to also consider indigenous Australians.' If you read the constitution of Australia, it ignores the very existence of an indigenous people. In 1991 the High Court of Australia pulled us up and told us that the myths that we had based our constitution on had to be torn up; that we had to face the reality that when European people first settled in this country there was prior occupation and ownership of this country. The High Court forced us to do that because this parliament failed in that respect. Now we are saying that, if we are going to give some· real meaning to that High Court decision, we need to look again at the constitution. We need to write within the constitution a recognition of the importance in the current structures of government of the prior occupation of this continent. I as a member of this parliament respect and strongly support those structures, but they are built on ignoring the fact that there was a prior civilisation occupying this continent which had a very strong culture and a very strong identity, and it has rights. Our constitution needs to recognise the existence of these people and that they were the owners of this continent. These people need to have their rights respected and recognised in the constitution. That is a very important issue that I think we in this parliamentneed to take up. The document also raises a few other issues which I am sure some people are going to be a bit hesitant or nervous about. It talks about the lack of any parliamentary representation for indigenous people. Only one indigenous person has been elected to the federal parliament of Australia, and that was a senator from Queensland who represented the Liberal Party, Senator Neville Bonner. In 94 years of national parliament, with 1,000 or more politicians elected to either the Senate or the House of Representatives, it is a disgrace that there has been only one indigenous person in parliament. It is a disgrace that all political parties-my own included-need to think about. We need to accept the challenge this document has set us. We need to accept that our political structures and the way in which our political parties operate are very exclusive. They exclude a lot of groups. In the way they operate, in the way they select members and in the way they select representatives for political office, most mainstream political parties in this country exclude indigenous people. We need to address that. This document says that we need to work around the great undemocratic injustice that exists. We as representatives of major political parties should get Aboriginal and Islander people into our parliament and our parties, standing not just for major indigenous electorates-and there are a few electorates in this country which you may believe an indigenous person should represent-but for major urban electorates where there may not necessarily be large populations of indigenous people. Indigenous people with qualities, merit and ability should be elected. But our processes at the moment operate to make sure Aboriginal people do not feel comfortable about our political parties. They do not join the parties, they do not work within the parties and they certainly do not stand for political office. This document has suggested that, to correct that anomaly, that undemocratic symbol, we may need to consider reserving seats in the parliament for indigenous people. It is not saying, 'You shall do it.' It is not saying, 'We demand this right.' It is saying, 'This is something you need to consider.' It is floating the idea and saying, 'We want you to seriously consider it.' That there are no indigenous people in this parliament is a very clear symbol of the lack of fairness, equity and social justice in this country. We have 223 parliamentary representatives in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Not one of them is an indigenous Australian. Indigenous people make up some 1.65 per cent of the population of Australia and a representative proportion of them in the parliament would be at least three people, probably four. This booklet is saying that indigenous Australians are entitled to have three or four members of the parliament. It is saying that if mainstream political parties are not prepared to look at themselves and do something about this situation, perhaps three or four seats should be reserved in the federal parliament for indigenous Australians. That is not a unique concept. New Zealand has tried it and, while there have been some problems-I am not sure whether it is the way to go-I would not reject the suggestion out of hand. There are certainly things about the present situation that we need to seriously consider because it highlights one of many anomalies that exist in our society. Australians tend to pride themselves on being an egalitarian and fair societybasically, we are-but there is one huge anomaly in that image and that is our treatment of indigenous Australians. I have participated in many debates in this parliament about the way in which we need to go forward. My views on Aboriginal health, housing, land rights and opportunities for employment in mainstream occupations are all on the public record. I urge the parliament to seriously consider the submissions made by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in this booklet, titled Going forward. Since it was not tabled in the parliament it does not appear on the Notice Paper as an item for debate. However, because it outlines the agenda set by the council, it would assist if members included it in their contributions in debates on Aborigithe nal issues. On another issue relating to land and recognition of Aboriginal interests, I would like to spend a few moments to comment on the issue which cost the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) his shadow portfolio. The way in which those events unfolded, backbench members of the parliament did not have an opportunity to comment. I was greatly disturbed by what occurred. I will not use this opportunity to try to score cheap political shots-that is not my stylebut there are some very serious fundamental issues which, as a parliament, we need to look at. One of those issues is about respecting the rights of other people. This is the International Year of Tolerance. Unfortunately, I do not think our parliament has exercised much tolerance in the first three or four months of this year. What most disturbed me about the events that unfolded with respect to the secret letters and the matters associated with them was not only the opening of private mail-that has already been heavily canvassed-but also, and more seriously, the absolute contempt for people's sacred religious beliefs that was demonstrated. To me, it was like someone walking into St Peter's Cathedral and spitting on the altar. It was that type of action and it should be viewed as being as contemptible as that action would be viewed. It was a sign that some people in this place are prepared to go to any lengths to score political advantage and will use anybody's personal, private, secret, religious beliefs or views to distort a situation to their own political advantage. That is why the member for Barker should have resigned. I know that he misled the House and formalities demand that if you mislead the House you give up your position. That is the reason he gave for resigning his position. But he should not hold any further shadow ministry position because he demonstrated such a clear and total contempt for the religious and sacred views of another group of people in our society. For that reason, he should never seriously be contemplated for another senior position in the opposition. His actions demonstrated that he does not have personal qualities that Australians want to see in someone making important administrative decisions about the affairs of people in this country. This is an important piece of legislation. I am pleased the Northern Territory government has supported it coming here. It is an interesting development for the Northern Territory, particularly when one looks at some of the other things the Northern Territory government has said. The Northern Territory government does not have a good record in its administration of Aboriginal affairs. It gains significant financial resources from the Commonwealth but is not expending those resources appropriately or in the way in which they were originally allocated. This is of little surprise when we hear statements from people such as Shane Stone, a member of the ruling party in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. He said that all the problems in the Northern Territory were the federal government's fault because we like to support Aboriginal people and we have a view that is strangling business interests because we are actually trying to give the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory some opportunity to live in a reasonable environment and to develop and assert themselves. One must remember that the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory account for more than 25 per cent of the population in the Northern Territory. It is a great disappointment to read statements from Shane Stone such as: ... the simple fact is ... that if Canberra was to get their hoof off our throat and get rid of absurd policies like ... the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. . . we could get on with the business of making a dollar ... This statement shows that this member in the Northern Territory does not even support his coalition colleagues who were, in fact, the ones who introduced the Northern Territory land rights act. He is prepared to try to destroy the rights of Aboriginal people to have ownership of land so that he can make a dollar. He is not interested in the rights of the indigenous people-the traditional owners of this country. He is just interested in making a fast buck for himself and for people like him. (Time expired)",62
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Mr Vaile)Before I call the honourable member for Aston, I might remind honourable members that we are debating the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.2). I would request members to restrict their comments to the subject of the bill.",65
164,Mr NUGENT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for his generous comments about me. I am not too sure they will help me much, but thank you. Very briefly, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, after your directive: the honourable member raised a matter about the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). It seems to me that, without going into detail, if he believes we will advance the welfare of the indigenous people of this country by taking a more cross-party line, once that matter is over-and his resignation seems to me to have brought that matter to a close-it does not serve a lot of purpose to keep dragging it up again in the future. The honourable member made a comment aboutthe Northern Territory government. We could stand here all day and exchange comments about what the Goss government has or has not done. I know the government is embarrassed about that. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.2) is a very simple bill. For those in the gallery, it is two paragraphs and, although I have not counted them, there are probably a couple of hundred words. It is a very straightforward bill, at least superficially. It says that under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 a particular portion of land, by agreement between the Northern Territory government, certain Aboriginal people and the federal government, will be transferred to Aboriginal ownership. This is the 59th or 60th piece of land that has been so scheduled under this act in the last 18 or 19 years. I think we in this place all acknowledge that transferring land is a critical part of Aboriginal culture. They have a special attachmentto the land, but the legislation has far more practical and, in my view, more far-reaching implications. The federal government, the Northern Territory government and the indigenous people concerned have all agreed on this issue, so it is not contentious, and we could pass the legislation fairly quickly through the House. But it is important to look at some of the underlying features that are relevant to this piece of legislation and like legislation in action. The legislation was passed by the Liberal government in 1976 when the then minister was Ian Viner, who, to the government's credit, was recently appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Council for A boriginal Reconciliation, which council produced the report Going forward that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton, referred to at some length. When we talk about passing land to Aboriginal people, it is more than just handing over a deed or a bit of paper and sitting back and forgetting all about it. There are some fundamental issues here. All members of this House, without exception, and increasingly the general public, will understand that the indigenous people in this country-a small percentage of the population-are, by any yardstick, significantly disadvantaged compared with the rest of the population. The average male life expectancy is 18 years less than the broader community-for women it is 15 years less-and there is overcrowding in houses. The parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is sitting across the chamber, and I have been to communities where we have seen 20 or 30 people living in quite small three-bedroom houses with limited sanitation and so on. There is an almost permanent unemployment rate in Aboriginal communities of 70, 80 and sometimes 90 per cent. You do not need a recession to make it bad in Aboriginal communities; it is a fact of life throughout life. Aboriginal women have diabetes at a rate eight times that of the general population. In many Aboriginal schools 50 per cent of the children will have middle ear infections. So they have a health problem and an education problem, because if you cannot hear you certainly cannot learn. One can go on with the statistics. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will recall that only recently we had tabled in this place a comprehensive report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which documented in really quite appalling and frighteningly awful detail the disadvantages of indigenous people in this country. We all l.mderstand that it is significant problem. One of the sad things that I have learnt in the five years I have been in this chamber-a number of measures have been put in place over the years to try to address some of these problems-is that, as I go around, I do not see any real evidence that the situation is improving significantly at all. Certainly, the statistics do not suggest the situation is improving at all. I am concerned that the government, which I have acknowledged previously in this place has good intentions to try to resolve the problems, in the last 12 years it has been here has not been successful in the various things it has done to improve the lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have had a number of initiatives. Money has been spent, organisations like ATSIC have been set up and health, education and language strategies have been put in place, but the reality is that those things have not worked very effectively at all. Therefore, we need to look at some new ways of dealing with that situation. In- my view, and most Aboriginal leaders whom I talk to have a very strong feeling about this, we have to break the welfare mentality-the fact that we just hand out money and people take it, and often it is regarded as sit-down money, but they still have nothing to do with their lives; that they are still living in appalling conditions; that they do not have the infrastructure or the sanitation; that the local council does not empty their dustbins; that the attendance rates at school are appalling; and that there is alcohol and substance abuse. For example, in the Pitjantjatjara lands I saw four-year-old kids sniffing petrol. It is quite appalling. Those sorts of things are going on all the time. We have to try to break this whole cycle of poverty and disadvantage, and we will not improve the situation while we take what I believe is a paternalistic view and just hand out money and think that that will fix it. We have to look at some underlying changes to our philosophy. For example, in the whole criminal justice system, a 15to 19-year-old Aboriginal youth is far more likely to be in a gaol' or in custody in some shape or form than a non-Aboriginal of the same age. It has nothing to do with the colour of the skin. In a country where there is disadvantage in tenns of employment, health, education and all those things, Aboriginals are going to get into trouble with the law anyway. But in Western Australia an Aboriginal of that age is 50 times more likely to be in custody than a nonAboriginal of that age. We have had inquiry after inquiry. We had the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, with 339 recommendations. The government has allocated millions of dollars to implement those recommendations. The government, the opposition and the state governments have accepted almost all those recommendations, and we have had voluminous reports tabled in this parliament every year saying how much effort has gone into implementing those reports. But the reality is that the bureaucracy has gone mad but we are not seeing much change on the ground. Therefore, it is important that we start to look afresh. It seems to me that we have to get installed-or reinstalled-into the Aboriginal psyche in some shape or fonn some selfesteem, some pride and some determination to try to help themselves. That is not to put them down. But we cannot just say to them, 'Here is some money. Get on your way.' We need to have a number of initiatives in place that will involve the Aboriginal people in decision making and in decisions of how money is spent. They also need to be given help from the ground upwards. We need to put in place a number of preventative measures rather than trying to fix problems after they have occurred. For example, in the health area, yes, need health centres, treatment, doctors and those sorts of things. But, rather than having national health strategies that come from federal government and go via the state governments-with regional bodies and such ATSIC involved in the act and political stoushes as to whether the Minister for Husince man Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), or ATSIC via the minister, have control-we ought to be looking more at the simple things that will in with Aboriginal culture, and we should put some responsibility in the communities so that people's time is occupied and they will start to take an interest in their welfare. For example, perhaps far more money should be put into community nursing so that the nurse goes along to the house and makes sure that little Johnny is eating properly, that the hygiene standards are in place and that he has his jabs when the doctor tells him to, and so on. A fundamental change of attitude is needed. We need to get back to some more simple, straightforward, basic approach to dealing with some of these matters, and we have to get the Aboriginal community itself committed to doing some of those things instead of always sending in outsiders. Obviously outsiders will be needed for training, but we need to get the bureaucracy out of the way and some practical action in place on the ground. It is important to Aboriginal people, if we are going to get them to take a larger degree of responsibility at the ground level for a number of these matters, that we give them self-respect and pride, that we get them off alcohol, and that we give them things to do in terms of work. It is important, therefore, that we acknowledge some of the symbolic things that will restore that pride and self-esteem. The grant ofland is one way, and that is what this bill is all about. But other things need to be done. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), referred to the report of the Council of Aboriginal Reconciliation Going forward. One of the things mentioned in there is that there should be a recognition, in the preamble to the constituwe tion, of indigenous prior occupation and all ownership of this country before European settlement took place. It is an historical fact. the It seems to me that, when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was set up, just a preamble was included in the legislation. I have not noticed the heavens fall in that legislation was passed, and I very much doubt if the heavens would fall in if it was in the constitution preamble. But it would be an important symbol for indigenous people to have that sort of recognition. It seems to fit me that, unless you undertake a few important symbolic things as well as some of the practical things, then you are never going to get on top of the problems and issues that I have been talking about. The previous speaker also referred to representation in parliament. The council did not recommend that there be separate indigenous seats in the parliament. It said very specifically that it was an issue that was raised by many indigenous people during the consultation process. It is an issue that, in consultation with the wider community, a number of people raised as well, and it is therefore something that needs to be looked at and understood, and perhaps debated. If there is general community and bipartisan support, then you would perhaps go to a referendum to give effect to that. But, if there is no general community support, the council says you would not proceed because it would be divisive-and that does not do anybody any good, particularly the indigenous people in this country. There are a number of things in the report that emphasise the sort of thing we are talking about in this bill in terms of land and also indigenous people's basic rights-the same rights anybody who sits in this chamber would have. We all have normal expectations that our dustbins will be emptied, water supplied, our roads made up, sewerage facilities supplied-all those things-and, as citizens, Aboriginal people should also have those things. The report also talks about Aboriginal people having rights to acknowledgment as well. I do not think any of us, if we are treated as second-class citizens,would have the self-esteem to be able to get ourselves out of some of the practical problems that would then beset us, and Aboriginal people are no different. When we pass a fairly straightforward, simple piece of legislation such as this, it is important to remember the underlying issues that are behind it. It is not just a question of saying, 'Here is a bit of dirt that we are going to give to Aboriginal people.' That is important. They may live on it, they may work it, they mayor may not make profits out of it, but it is part of an overall package of activity. It is an amendment to a piece of legislation of which the Liberal Party has always been proud-and justifiably so-and it is part of an ongoing battle to try to make sure that we do treat our indigenous people better. I certainly commend the bill to the House.",65
165,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I am also pleased to participate in the debate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.2). As the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) said, this bill, which we are in the process of considering at present, is probably one of the briefest pieces of legislation to become before the parliament. That of course belies the importance of it. It is extremely important. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon), who represents the Northern Territory-the area about which this piece of legislation is concerned-and the constituents that occupy that area, is at the table. The fact that he is in the federal parliament representing the Northern Territory with the overwhelming support which he has been able to gain and maintain indicates the way in which he and his colleague Senator Bob Collins are respected by the constituents which they represent so effectively in the Northern Territory. As has been indicated, this legislation refers to the Hodgson Downs property in the Northern Territory. The purpose of this legislation is to transfer it to the Aboriginal people, the traditional owners of that land, and the people who occupy that land. I acknowledge that the reason this legislative approach is being used on this occasion is that it was possible to get agreement between the Northern Territory government, the Aboriginal claimants and the Northern Territory Land Council in order to undertake this process of having that land transferred to them. It is an area of something in excess of 3,000 square kilometres. It is a cattle station south east of Mataranka in the Northern Territory. It was purchased by ATSIC in 1991. The property contains a great many sacred sites of significance and has a population of 240 Aboriginal people. It continues to op-rate as a commercial cattle station. The member for Aston, the Liberal member who preceded me, made a number of observations, many of which I would agree with and many of which I would not. The member for Aston is one of the better informed members of the opposition in relation to Aboriginal people in Australia. He is one of those relatively few members of the opposition who have some sympathy for Aboriginal people, some understanding of their background and the circumstances which they face as a minority people who originally owned and occupied the whole of the Australian land mass 200 years ago. Some say the Europeans invaded; others say they settled. I do not think the question is so important. Certainly, the opportunity occurred 200 years ago for white Europeans to take from the Aboriginal people in Australia, sometimes under horrendous circumstances, land which those people had previously occupied and owned. I think it is to the credit of those three organisations that that agreement was reached. It is not always the case that agreements between responsible people and responsible organisations in Australia are able to be achieved in order to achieve, in turn, a proper outcome for those people most affected by it. It is interesting that we are amending the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which was introduced initially in 1975 by the Whitlam government. That legislation followed the findings of a royal commission which was appointed by the Whitlam government in 1973. The royal commission was chaired by Justice A.E. Woodward and became known as the Woodward royal commission. The findings of that royal commission were essentially incorporated in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1975, which was introduced by the then Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Les Johnson. In the process of introducing that legislation, Les Johnson said: In the field of Aboriginal affairs, this is ly the most important legislation ever to be introduced into the Australian Parliament. While several States have moved towards the recognition of Aboriginal land rights, this legislation goes much further than has previously been contemplated in Australia. This Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission-the Woodward reportand grant land rights to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. It will provide for freehold title over all reserves and certain other lands to be vested in Aboriginal ownership and give Aboriginals control over what happens on their land, including control over mining developments. Major political changes took place after that, with the sacking of the WhitIam government at the end of 1975, and that particular legislation lapsed. Fortunately, it was reintroduced under the Fraser government by the then Minister Viner. The interesting thing is that, while the opposition continues to claim credit for many of these initiatives, an examination showed that it so frequently sought to thwart, frustrate and obfuscate-to place obstacles generally in the way of - significant initiatives being taken. That October 1975 Labor land rights bill followed 15 months of investigation by Justice Woodward. It followed a further 18 months of consultation with Aboriginal groups. In the process of Labor dealing with that legislation, the coalition opposition, the conservative opposition, sought to refer the bill to a standing committee for a further report. That is typical: delays compounding delays. That has always been the tactic. It disappoints me because I know that there is goodwill on the part of many members of the opposition in connection with Aboriginal people, Aboriginal interests and Aboriginal rights. But they make collective decisions which are intended deliberately to place obstacles in the way of significant initiatives being introduced and significant initiatives being achieved. In June 1976 Mr Ian Viner introduced the Aboriginal land rights bill which followed on, as I say, from that Labor legislation which was initiated during the period of the Whitlam government. In November 1976 debate was resumed by a conservative coalition government and that government itself was responundoubtedsible for introducing 42 amendments. A conservative coalition government introduced 42 amendments in 1976 after it became responsible for that legislation. We do not need much more evidence than that to prove the claim I make that, to a very large extent, the conservative coalition's position in relation to many of these issues concerning Aboriginals and Aboriginal interests would appear to be less than genuine. Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I exclude you and those of your colleagues who participate so actively and so conscientiously in the consideration which this parliament gives to questions concerning Aboriginals from any of those comments about the opposition in general, about the conservative coalition in general. I exclude you personally; I exclude the member for Aston; I exclude the member for Cowper e Mr Nehl); and I exclude those other members who have worked conscientiously towards the achievement of justice for Aboriginal people. We all remember Senator Neville Bonner. I rejoiced-as you did, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure-when Neville Bonner, a proud Aborigine, was elected to the Senate ona Liberal Party ticket. I then deplored the fact that Neville Bonner disappeared from the Senate when he was relegated to the third unwinnable place on the Senate ticket by thLiberal Party as a result of the fact that Neville Bonner was speaking out for Aboriginal people, for people from his own race.Noone can deny that. It was a deliberate act by the Liberal Party to place Neville Bonner in an unwinnable position. I think Ernie Bridge, a shadow minister in Western Australia, is the only parliamentarian in Australia at present of Aboriginal extraction--except perhaps in the Northern Territory-and he is a Labor member. Your Senator Neville Bonner is no longer here. The Liberal Party gave him an unwinnable third place on the ticket. In 1976 when Les Johnson was responding to that legislation introduced by Ian Viner, also referred to his concern that 42 government amendments had been introduced to its own legislation in order to delay it and to achieve whatever other objectives it had set out to achieve in connection with it. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would just like to mention some of the comments that were made by former colleagues of you and your present colleagues in the conservative coalition. Mr Kevin Cairns, a former member of the Liberal Party from an electorate in Brisbane, said in relation to that legislation: The Government has introduced this legislation knowing that there has to be social harmony and that is enshrined in this land legislation. ' Billy Wentworth, who I think was going to attempt to rejoin the upper house in New South Wales-a direct descendant of the original W.C. Wentworth, who, together with his two mates, found a route across the Blue Mountains-was recognised and is recognised today as a person with a genuine interest in Aboriginal problems and Aboriginal people. He said in relation to that bill: The Bill deals with traditional land and the rights of traditional Aboriginals are worth protecting. If we have any decency we will look to these people about whose land we are talking in this Bill. Philip Ruddock, who was then the member for Parramatta and is now· a front-bench member of the opposition-another Liberal member-said: ... something which I see as important and which !""ir Justice Woodward saw as important, and that IS a recognition of a fundamental principle. to Aborigines-their sense of Aboriginality was their affinity with land. Increasingly now that is being recognised. It was recognised in an important and historic way by the High Court in its Mabo decision. It has been entrenched in an important and historic way by this government in the legislation which grew from that, the land fund legislation, and every time that this present Labor government acts in relation to Aboriginal questions and Aboriginal land. It is interesting that there appears to be an impression that, right from the start of British and European colonialism-when they invaded, occupied and expropriated the land of native people, wherever that happened to behe there was a failure to recognise those interests. That is not so. Initially, to a very large extent, the rights of indigenous people, wherever they happened to live, were respected and were expected to be respected by those people who acted on behalf of the Crown. Let me give some examples. George III-who was the King of England towards the end of the 18th century, at the time that Australia was first 'discovered' by Cook-in 1763 said: And whereas it is just and reasonable, and essential to our interests, and the security of our colonies, that the several nations or tribes of Indians with whom we are connected, and who live under our protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our dominions ... George III, a British monarch, was making declaration about the rights of native people in their own lands to be respected-not molested-by those people who acted for George III as the monarch of England. One of the instructions given to he was sailing in the south-west Pacific and representing the interests of Great Britain was worded in this way: You are also with the Consent of the Natives to take possession of Convenient Situations in the Country in the Name of the King ... I emphasise 'with the consent of the natives'. One of the instructions Governor Phillip was given when he came out to make the first European settlement of Sydney Cove in role relation to Australian Aborigines stated: You will conciliate their affections. He was not told to come here and authorise or encourage shooting expeditions against we have. Aboriginal people of a weekend. He was not instructed to come here and encourage and facilitate the taking away of children from their Aboriginal parents. He was not authorfeel ised to come here and facilitate or encourage the poisoning of Aboriginal waterholes. was he given permission to come here and encourage or facilitate the poisoning of flour which was then handed to Aboriginal people. No, he was not. The following direction was respect of South Australia as late as 1836. South Australia then was a British colony; subsequently it became a state of this Commonwealth.",68
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,I the would remind the honourable member the is about the Northern Territory.,71
167,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"And I would outset remind you, with respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, as well that it is about Aboriginal land rights, and that is what I am talking about. Let me get this on the record. In relation to South Australia it was said: ... provided always that nothing in these our Letters Patent contained shall affect or be construed to affectthe rights of any Aboriginal Natives said Province to the actual occupation or enjoyment of their own persons ... of any lands ... Yes, we are talking about land, Mr Deputy Speaker; I agree. We are talking about land in a the Northern Territory, a territory of this Commonwealth, which traditionally has been to be owned, occupied and used by Aboriginal people and which is now being used as a cattle station by the 240 Aboriginal people James Cook when who occupy it. We are talking about an agreement that was reached between three responsible authorities, including the Northern Territory government, to ensure that the transfer of this land, which was bought by A TSIC a few years ago, could be made to those occupants, and it is to the credit of all those who participated in it. All of us in Australia, in a conscientious way and in a state of increasing awareness about the and position of white Australians on this continent, increasingly are coming to understand in a more reasonable way the position that we occupy and the responsibilities that I will close on this point. When addressing many of these questions I have always made the point that white Australians today should no guilt about the historic realities of the past but that we need to accept them, to Nor understand them, and to ensure that the inequities and the injustices which developed on this continent as a result of administration by white authorities over the last 200 years will not persist and that justice will finally issued in prevail. (Time expired)",71
168,Mr MCGAURAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"In addressing this Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.2), I wish to review the role played by Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Terribill tory) Act 1976 in the ongoing debate on Aboriginal land rights and mining. At the I wish to state unequivocally that there is no benefit for Aborigines or other Australians in politicising this issue or in taking an extremist position. The sole aim of any person who enters the debate should be to move the issues forward. In this regard no-one who has seen the survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait of the Islander population recently released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics could fail to be moved by the implications of those stark facts. I remind the House that the report noted an unemployment rate of 38 per cent overall with a rate of 50 per cent for those Aborigines aged between 15 and 19 years. Of the 40,200 unemployed persons, 77 per cent had been unemployed for three months or longer, and over 50 per cent had been unemployed for 12 months or longer. Examining health related issues, the survey found that 17 per cent of rural Aboriginal households did not have doctors available at all, or that they were available less than once per month, while 54 per cent did not have access to dentists and 74 per cent did not have mental health services available. It is a truism that there i- no simple panacea to improve this utterly unacceptable situation. Aboriginal communities are diverse with very different needs and circumstances. For examAboriginal ple, more than 50 per cent of the Aboriginal population across the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland live in communities of 1,000 or less. In those communities there are widely differing government jurisdictions and ployment opportunities and many other hisfor torical, cultural and social factors contributing to their present situation. Such complexity defies simple analysis, yet it is my belief the issues are becoming clearer, particularly as they relate to economic advancement for Aborigines. For instance, there is a clear perception among the community and decision land. makers that economic advancement prQvides a significant platform of opportunity to benefit Aborigines. The entitlement to the safety net of welfare assistance is a right no needy Australian should be denied, yet beyond the safety net economic independence is the cornerstone of self-determination for any community. The granting of land rights through the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was a significant step towards economic advancement for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, particularly through mining ventures. This act established nisms for negotiating the exploration and mining of minerals on Aboriginal lands and the use of the resultant royalties for Aboriginal advancement. The act created Aboriginal land trusts to receive grants of inalienable freehold title to Aboriginal land, with property rights to minerals retained by the Crown. Land councils were also created to act as agents for the traditional owners on land matters and to negotiate terms and conditions for exploration and mining with an independent arbitrator if an agreement could not be reached. Equivalent amounts to the mining royalties returned to the Commonwealth or Northern Territory governments were to be paid into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account. Forty per cent of the funds obtained were to be divided between the land councils as general funds, with 30 per cent to be paid to the land council in whose district the mine was located, and intended for the affected community. The balance 000 per cent was to be distributed between Northern Territory Aborigines as a whole, as payments to cover administration of the trust account and as further payments to the land councils if they could not cover their expenses from emother payments. Anyone wishing to explore minerals or acquire a mining interest over land granted to Aboriginal owners had to negotiate through the relevant land council. that The act provided that the consent of the relevant land council and the Commonwealth minister was required before either exploration or mining was allowed on Aboriginal Since its proclamation on Australia Day 1977, the act has been subject to considerable amendment. In 1987, in response to claims that that the legislation was unworkable and was inhibiting resource development in the Northern Territory, the act was amended to remove the right of Aboriginal owners to veto mining if they had previously agreed to exploration. Amendments at the same time required traditional owners to decide on new mining proposals within 12 months, with the possibility of extension. If an exploration proposal was rejected, then no further applications mechacoul- be made for five years. In 1991, the Industry Commission, in its report on mining and minerals processing in Australia, examined the operation of this legislation as it applied to mining investment. In addressing the effectiveness of the legislation, the Industry Commission said: The holding of land rights by Aborigines may lead to smaller levels of mining . . . activity in the Territory relative to those which would have occurred. However, provided Aboriginal landowners face appropriate incentives, it would be wrong to conclude from this that land and subsurface resources were not being devoted to their socially optimal use. In this sense, the ... real test of the workability of the Aboriginal Land Rights (N orthern Territory) Act 1976 is not necessarily the amount of land under exploration, or the number of mines on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, but rather the extent to which Aboriginal landowners are able to freely exercise their ability to withhold or grant consent for exploration and mining. The key point that I wish to draw out of this conclusion by the Industry Commission is that, for natural justice to prevail, the traditional landowners must be able to make a completely informed decision on an exploration or mining proposal. Thus they must be able to assess the incentives offered by the developer, negotiate on these incentives and then decide whether the benefits outweigh the possible disadvantages. Looked at this way, the point of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act is to facilitate the negotiation process so that all parties achieve a positive outcome. So has the act achieved its goal? In 1991 the Industry Commission concluded that: The current institutional arrangements for dealing with applications to explore and mine on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory are not working well. .. Communication is poor and there is little trust. While there is widespread agreement that the existing system is unsatisfactory, views on the causes of the problems and the possible solutions vary considerably. This analysis is just as valid four years on. For instance, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the beginning of February this year seeking discussions on amendments to the act, including mining leases. But this government is not interested. On 28 September last year, the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) wrote to the Australian saying: Because of a range of significant developments since 1992, there are no plans to initiate further consultations over possible amendments to the Act. This followed a commitment in April 1991, when the minister himself said the recommendations of·the Industry Commission report: would need to be considered by the Government in consultation with Aboriginal traditional landowners, the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Councils and the Northern Territory Government. The only action to result from this promise of consultation was the cabinet submission from the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), the then Minister for Resources. As revealed in the Australian in September last year, the January 1993 cabinet submission recommended the implementation of most of the Industry Commission's recommendations. However, the submission was withdrawn at the last moment. The significant developments since 1992 referred to by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs must surely include the Mabo decision and the advent of the Native Title Act. Yet these developments are reasons why the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 needs to be revisited. The Native Title Act provided an opportunity to institute a streamlined, national administrative system for land rights. Instead, the Northern Territory now has two pieces of Commonwealth legislation addressing native title issues from different perspectives, and with no effective resolution of the overlapping issues. Mr Tickner-Would you repeal them, though?",71
169,Mr MCGAURAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"No, we certainly would not repeal the veto. We want more negotiations directly between proponents of developments and the traditional landowners themselves. We certainly do not believe there are anywhere near enough negotiations between those directly affected and those who propose development. The veto held by traditional owners in the Northern Territory is an issue to a great many people because they believe that the veto inhibits, if not prevents, this direct negotiation between traditional landowners and developers. I certainly would not abolish the veto, but I do not want to see the veto used to quash direct negotiations. So the issue of uncertainty for Australian resources investment is very significant across the country. The mining sector confers enormous benefits on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians alike. In the Northern Territory the mining industry generates one-quarter of the territory's national product; employs three per cent of the work force; and has a turnover of around $1 billion per year. For Aborigines in the Northern Territory, some $300 million has been paid in royalties under the auspices of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. On a national level, it is worth reminding the House that the resources sector provides some $30 billion in exports, or half of Australia's merchandise exports, and employs 90,000 people directly with a further 400,000 in manufacturing and energy industries based on mining inputs.",73

171,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, who said a short time ago in Sydney that popular concerns that the Australian economy is in danger of lapsing into our old boom-bust ways, with the current account careering out of control, are legitimate concerns for policy makers at this time? Does the Prime Minister also agree with his statement that further tightening of monetary policy has to remain on the agenda, and that even a good budget would not necessarily rule out further interest rate adjustments?",74

184,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can think of no better exa-ple of form rather than substance than the little stunt the Leader of the Opposition just put on here. I have read the speech and I have my own markings on it. There are a number of references to monetary policy and wages. Mr Fraser says he believes the government will introduce a good budget. He is correct in that. Mr Fraser said: On the basis of current government projections, budget deficit would decline from 2.7 per cent GDP in 1994-95 to a surplus in 1996-97. He went on to say: I am confident the government will deliver improvement of at least this order. A government member-Exactly.",74
185,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Exactly. Earlier, he said: Viewed in these terms, a good budget could as easing the pressure for possible policy tightening. That is true. But even a good budget would not necessarily rule out further interest rate adjustments. For one thing, we could not be sure that such a budget would cause the economy to slow sufficiently, partly given favourable effects it could have on confidence answers. generally. In other words, he is saying that a well delivered and well received budget will actually add to confidence itself, and that that may be a spurt to growth. Why is he saying that? One of the reasons he is saying that is that he was Secretary the Department of the Treasury in the As the government kept reducing those big budget surpluses and cutting government spending, as that contracted from activity on the public sector side of the economy, it added to private sector activity was far more confidence about the economic settings. That is the point he was making there. It is a sophisticated point. That is why it got past you. Mr Fraser also has some references to wages, which I agree with. He says: I think some commentators assume too readily that there will be major slippage on wages. I agree with him on that. The record has shown that this government has introduced a contestable economy in this country by removing tariff barriers and by introducing enterprise bargaining. We are getting natural growth in productivity and that is holding down wage costs. As well as that, we are seeing a general understanding by the work force about wages growth. Mr Fraser is talking about four to five per cent. When the Leader of the Opposition was last Treasurer, it was 16 per cent. Is it any wonder we were uncompetitive. Let me make this point-I made it in a speech last night but let me make it again the today-in the period between 1983 and now, of Australia's international competitiveness has improved by 40 per cent. In the eight years between 1975 and 1983 it increased by an nothing-there was no change in underlying competitiveness during the whole period of the opposition leader's tenure as Treasurer. In the years since, our competitiveness has be seen improved by 40 per cent. So when Bernie further monetary Fraser makes",75

191,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can he advise the House whether today' s current account deficit figure is consistent with official forecasts? What do the components of the current account deficit indicate about future growth prospects?,75
192,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Today's current account figures for the month of February are quite consistent with the mid-year review forecast for the current account outcome for this year. As well as being consistent, we have an outcome which has some encouraging signs. Firstly, it is five per cent less than for previous month, which is a good developmade ment. Also, the composition of the factors that produced that outcome are quite encourbefore aging. Merchandise exports increased by four per cent but merchandise imports increased only one per cent. Clearly, the movements that area are in the right direction for us. In relation to exports, I make a couple of points. Firstly, the impact of the drought is showing through, particularly in regard cereal exports which, in the last three months, are 43 per cent down on what they the same three months of the previous year. We are seeing drought having quite an impact in some areas of rural exports, particularly relation to cereals. Despite that, total exports for February were at their highest level ever. There are some encouraging signs in regard__ to non-rural exports. The figure for non-rural exports was the highest ever. For non-rural commodity exports, which have .been trending down for the year to September of last year, we are seeing increasing signs that that is being reversed. We are seeing a pick-up in both volumes and prices. The rise in imports of one per cent was entirely due to imports of capital goods, which went up by J 3 per cent. That, of course, reflects the fact that investment growing strongly. With a 24 per cent increase in investment now forecast-a figure that the opposition said was impossible to believe; it said that 14 per cent was impossible-we expect to see strong capital imports. That what we have here. That is a good thing, because it means we have a greater capacity to sustain economic growth and employment in the future. It also means that we avoid high capacity utilisation ratios. If you have very high ratios, it means that there is a situation in which inflation can easily take off. Imports in areas such as consumption goods are down six per cent and imports of intermediate goods are down one per cent. So, on the import side, the general picture shows some degree of encouragement. We want to have sustainable growth for the future. It means lesser growth than the five per cent to six per cent growth that we are the currently experiencing-a point that Mr Fraser in his speech. I can say in that respect-and since this is the last sitting day the budget-that the budget will be designed to achieve a more sustainable rate of by economic growth. It will be designed to in achieve a better balance of demand and growth so that we do not have demand spilling over into imports. It will also be designed to achieve a structural improvement in savings to in this country so that we can continue to experience substantial growth without a were in balance of payments constraint. I make one other point. I notice the Greens have been saying that they will not cooperate in with the budget, in the sense that they do not think we need to have a reduction in the deficit. They do not believe in the twin deficit theory. We are not pushing twin deficit theory here. We are not saying that it automatically follows that if you reduce the budget deficit you reduce the current account deficit, but we do say it goes in the right direction. The key issue here is the savings investment balance. If you have strong investment, you need to have stronger savings. If you do not do that, you will certainly have a large current account outcome. In the circumstances we face with strong investment, it is crucially important that we improve our savings performance. That is what the budget will, in is part, be designed to achieve. Current Account Deficit",75
193,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in is 1987 you said, 'The worse is over,' about the current account deficit. But since then Australia has been whacked with a further $130,000 million worth of current account deficits and our foreign debt has doubled to $162,000 million. In 1990 you deliberately engineered the worse recession since the Great Depression to solve the problem. With Australia now in the middle of yet another current account crisis, how will you try to solve it this time? Given that a long recession and a short recovery did not fix the problem, is it not a fact that a lasting solution to the problem is completely beyond your capacity to deliver?",76
194,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The current account deficit was six per cent of GDP in the Leader of the Opposition's second last year in office as Treasurer. Let me just correct the claim that he often makes about the recession. The deepest recession since the war was in his term as Treasurer. If you doubt that, just go to the Statistician and have a look at the loss of product during the last recession and the loss of product during yours. If you doubt it, it is simply a matter of record.",77
195,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,John Kerin should answer it.,77
196,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is answering the question.,77
197,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In terms of the change, this is the first time, the first period, in Australia's history where rural and resource exports form the majority of our exports-the very first time. This is the first time when manufactured exports and services predominate in the Australian balance of payments and balance of trade. That is an enormous structural sea change for Australia. It occurred by a shift in manufacturing production, manufacturing exports and exports generally which has improved our capacity in relation to the current account. The terms of trade have been running against Australia for a long time. That postwar years the things that Australia traditionally exported commanded very high prices and the things it imported commanded low prices. Therefore, our standard of living rose. In the 40 years since the war, we have had a complete reversal of that: the things that command the high prices are the products with intellectual innovation in them and the things that command the low prices are the bulk traded commodities-agriculture and minerals-and this has seen our terms of trade fall dramatically. It was the constant fall in those terms of trade that the Liberal Party, when in office, never picked up on. The Liberal Party made no change to our manufacturing structure to make the adjustment for when it happened. The salvation coming from higher exports and from the shift in the composition to manufacturing and services was delivered by this government. It was delivered by this government because, had we relied on the same composition of exports as John Howard was prepared to rely on from 1977 to 1983, Australia would be absolutely dead in the water. We would have a recession prone and massively interest rate ridden economy of the variety we have seen in other parts of the world. The change was the belief on this side of the House that the notion that you could not have a competitive manufacturing sector sitting beside an internationally competitive primary exports sector was a nonsense and that, by a change in our education system-a change in participation in education and tertiary education and in research and development--our product innovation would rise and, with a 40 per cent change in competitiveness, we could find exports of manufactures and exports of services growing. That is why for the first time ever we now find ourselves no longer in the position where we are a majority rural and resources exporter. As a consequence, exportsMr Reith-Come on, wind it up.",77
198,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You asked the question; you can listen to the answer. As a consequence, exports have risen from 13 per cent of GDP, way down the end of the OECD is, in the early league table",77
199,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why don't you abuse him?,77
200,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mitchell is not helping.,77
201,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to 22 per cent. Exports have gone up from 13 to 22 per cent of GDP, that is, by eight to nine per cent of GDP-by $36 billion a year or thereabouts. Could you imagine the hole we would be in without that change under this government? Could you imagine the ambient economic climate if we were now exporting $30 billion to $35 billion less in terms of GDP, less in terms of those overall exports? That is the sea change. The other sea change is that the proportion of our exports which now goes to our debt service component has dropped from 21 per cent to 11 per cent. We have seen our capacity to service our debt change dramatically as a proportion of our gross domestic product. These are the two core matters that the Leader of the Opposition is quite happy to forget about. That is, he would not have had the wit or the capacity as an individual or as a party of government to make this enormous change in the nature of our export base to reinvigorate our manufacturing, tertiary and service sectors. The members of the opposition could never have done it, and they showed in office that they were incapable of doing it. That is where the fundamentals have changed. Another fundamental that is worth noting is that wage inflation is now under control. Last quarter's data show an overall annual increase of 4.1 per cent. Mr Abbott-I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker, understanding order 145. The question specifically asked what the Prime Minister was going to do in the future, not what had happened in the past. We have had enough of the ancient history lesson. Why does he not tell us what he is going to do in the future?",77
202,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is in order.,78
203,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Low inflation, low wages growth, a low level of strike activity-and still falling-are some of the other fundamentals of our competitiveness which make this change a climate change and not simply a one-off change. I just say about the current level of the current account that the unsynchronised nature of the world recovery has meant that Australian demand for imports has picked up ahead of world demand for Australian exports. When that world economy gets into better synchronisation, we will have a better outcome. So let the Leader of the Opposition not dupe himself, even if he is prepared to dupe his party or the public, into believing that he ever had any solutions for dealing with the current account at source-a fundamental change in manufacturing services. Let him very clearly understand that the climatic change in inflation, wages growth, competitiveness, product innovation, education, manufactured exports and services is the only salvation for a country that let itself be lured into the dangerous position of relying exclusively on agriculture and mining, to our long term detriment.

205,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the forthcoming Council of Australian Governments meeting. Has it been decided to postpone the next meeting of COAG? If so, why?",78
206,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a change to the date of the Council of Australian Governments meeting. It has been rescheduled to meet in Canberra from 11 to 12 April. That has happened principally so that the declaration of the New South Wales poll could allow the elected Premier to attend this meeting. I am very happy to say today that that is going to be Bob Carr. In saying that, let me say that this was a tremendously welcome result for us and I take this opportunity to congratulate Bob Carr and Helena Carr on their great and historic win. The fact that it comes in the most populous state of Australia means that it is a complete disaster for the Liberal Party-a complete disaster. I just remind the House of what the Leader of the Opposition said: A win by the Fahey government is tremendously important to the Liberal Party's chances of beating Labor at the next federal poll. Well, he got a negative outcome. He was dead right about the influence, except that it went the wrong way for him. He played a major role in the campaign, and he said he would. He said: I am prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with Premier John Fahey to help him win in New South Wales.",78

208,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister should be heard in silence.,79
209,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He went on to say: A win in New South Wales for John Fahey could propel the federal Liberal Party into successive terms of government as it did for the ALP from 1983 to 1995. There is no doubt that this has been a disastrous outcome for the Liberal Party. A headline read: Fahey win vital to us, says Howard. There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition's sticky fingerprints were all over this poll. Let me just remind him that he appointed the member for Mackellar as his nominee to the state Liberal Party executive, to make sure that he is ripped round through the state machine. He intervened in the preselection for Wentworth, in the middle of it. In the most brazen and shameful intervention of all, his closest soul mate and colleague, Senator Michael Baume, was delegated to king-hit Dr Peter Macdonald, the Independent candidate for Manly.",79

If the front-bench of the opposition have some query they wish to place by point of order, I will take the point of order. I will not take it by interjection directed at me. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. Let me take up your invitation. Under standing order 145 the question from the member for Banks related entirely to the deferment of COAG. The Prime Minister stated the reason for the deferment of COAG. He is now totally irrelevant to that particular question.

231,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Mr Abbott- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am trying to help the House. The Prime Minister claimed that a member of this House had been engaged in trying to frame someone. That is what he said.

239,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is this a new point of order? Mr Abbott-Yes, it is. I appreciate that some of the matters that the Prime Minister referred to have previously been dealt with by substantive motion, but that does not give him the right to keep repeating smear after smear in this place, which he has just done about the member for Barker.",80
240,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have ruled on that point of order. I am not taking any further points of order on that matter. The Prime Minister will now conclude his answer.,80
241,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the most populous state of Australia, the Liberal Party has lost the election. It is a disaster for you. The fact that John Howard stood shoulder to shoulder with the leader in that state has produced a complete'disaster.

251,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is my first oppordoing tunity to see the member for Canberra. I glad to take his first question, and naturally I congratulate him on his victory. I do. I sat almost in the same position in the old parliament when I first came here. Mr MCGauran-Oh, very interesting!",81
252,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did. It is very interestfrom; ing. It was 26 years ago, and I used to ask John Gorton questions. The burden of the question from the honourable member was about the consequences and impact of interest rates on his electorate . The matters that we debated earlier in question time-references to things said by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the attendant outcome on inflation, his references to wages-are the core matters in respect of interest rates. Who has the policies to keep wages growth in this country consisOpposition members-Not you.",81
253,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We got it there. Why would you say not us? The other question is whether, in terms of activity in the economy, the early, but I believe timely, increases in interest rates by the government to slow the recovery and make it sustainable have not in the long run been entirely in the best interests of the economy and the community at large. As a consequence of the things the Treasurer eloquently said earlier, the government will, between now and the next sitting of the House, bring in a budget. Both he and I have said that the import of that budget will be, we believe, to make further interest rate increases less likely. There is only one way to low interest rates in this country; that is, through low inflation a proper balance between the demand and I supply sides of the economy. I cannottell the honourable member-because he was not around at that time, obviously-this was never so under his party in office. The Leader the Opposition, when Treasurer, had wages growth of 16 per cent, and he did not know what to do about it. When the last big wage round came through, Malcolm Fraser caught a plane to England to see the royal wedding; do you remember that? When wages blew out-they were right on the table-instead of staying and fixing it and dealing with it or his best, Malcolm Fraser jumped on the am plane and went to the royal wedding. The wedding present we got was the 16 per cent Of course wages growth which followed. That is why interest rates peaked under the now Leader of the Opposition at 22 per cent. It is no mystery where the 22 per cent came it was the high inflation from the 16 per cent wages growth plus the real interest rate. When you compare that to 10 per cent or nine per cent interest rates today, or 8% per cent for bills, it is a far cry from anything the federal Liberal Party was able to deliver. I hope for your sake that your party can understand what the influences on inflation are and understand that no mayhem wages system will deliver wage restraint and at the same time, in the doing of that, produce high productivity which reduces wages costs and holds inflation down. I think they· are the central matters in the price and inflation equation. 1 hope that, as I did sitting in that place so long ago at his age, he can come and learn some of the lessons of economic policy as we saw the Liberal Party's disasters occur one after the other. Let me give you this little bit of commentary on history: iri the last year that the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, he was the most worried person in the world. After we became the government he was the happiest, because all of a sudden the burden had shifted to some crowd who could actually do something about it. He works on the basis that if you stay here long enough the cycle will repeat itself. That is the one part of the lesson you should not take any notice of. Higher Education",81
254,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the minister aware of reports that unmet demand for higher education has fallen this year? Can the minister confirm these reports and advise the House whether this will impact on the government's funding commitments to higher education?",82
255,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Preliminary indications are that unmet demand for university places will be down eight per cent this year over last year. There are two significant reasons why that circumstance has come about: firstly, we have put more places into universities; and, secondly, there are far more jobs available for people to choose to go to. The significant indicator is that, since the probability of a student completing year 12 and going on to university has doubled. It has gone up from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. It has gone up because of our policies. Our policies have been committed to massively expanding the higher education sector; policies that we will persist with and that we have developed without having to resort to up-front fees for undergraduate students. Last election, the Liberals went t() the campaign on a policy of fees and vouchers for funding universities. Their justification then was: 'If we allow overseas students to pay for places, why don't we let our own students pay for places?' Where is the equity in the argument which says that our own people have to pay up-front to get into universities? Where is the equity in that? . This week we have seen a surprising about face by the opposition in this direction because the shadow spokesman on higher education, Senator Hill, does not believe in fees any more. In a radio interview on 28 March, in justification of this position, he said: Now that the situation has changed somewhat in that there has been a stabilisation of the number of students, there is not the demand now. There is a simple point of contrast between that statement, which was made on 28 March, and what the Leader of the Opposition had to say just four days before. He said: One of the big problems with tertiary education in Australia is that every year there are thousands of young Australians who are shut out of tertiary education and there aren't enough places. His shadow spokesman said that we do not need to raise fees because there are sufficient places; yet he said four days before that there are not enough places. The message out of that is twofold. The first is that they will say anything to suitthe occasion and the second is that, if demand for places does go up, the Liberal Party will resort to fees to fund them, because the only basis upon which it has ruled them out now is that the demand does not justify it. The students also have another concernthat universities, through their commercial 1983, arms, are seeking by the backdoor to charge up-front fees. In the House yesterday I indicated quite clearly what our position was on that, but the shadow spokesman for the opposition, in relation to the backdoor approa,ch, said that he has some sympathy for that position. Not only would the opposition bring back fees if demand rose, but it would allow far greater flexibility to the universities to charge for postgraduate fees. The simple facts are these. The Liberal Party does not support growth in the higher education sector. It does not support equitable access to it and it does not support student organisations. Most importantly, on 23 February the Australian summed up completely the Liberals' position when it said: The Liberal Party, however, has been without a semblance of a higher education policy since the sinking of the voucher scheme. . . The Liberal Party is promising nothing to the future students of this country. Labor has delivered and will continue to do so. Drought",82
256,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Last night you forecast that recovery from the drought is bound to increase our export revenues and, therefore, contribute to an improvement in Australia's horrendous current account deficit. Will you tell the thousands of farmers struggling to make ends meet in officially declared drought areas when the drought broke and when they can expect to see a turnaround in their fortunes? Given that in many areas of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria the already horrendous drought is worsening, isn't your indifference more evidence that you still haven't got the message?",83
257,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said 'the recovery from the drought', which does not necessarily mean that the drought all over Australia is complete or over. Mr Tim Fischer-It is actually getting worse.",83
258,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why do you draw that? You draw it maliciously. You draw it for malicious reasons. Are you seeking to deny the fact that there will be a pick-up in export volumes from rural products over the course of the year? Of course there is going to· be a pick-up in rural production. I see no value in the notion being put about to people that there has not been some relief with. the rains we have had or that there is not going to be a pick-up in production; of course there will be. It was only this government that put the real support in for people who were disastrously affected, by extending income support to farmers in exceptionally affected areas-as a consequence, from memory, 8,000 farm families have now availed themselves of that income support-that is, by removing the impact of the assets test for benefits, as we have not done in any precedent way anywhere else in the social security system. That was a quite revolutionary change and that was acknowledged by the farm community and the farm leadership. The sole policy was fodder subsidy. That was his sole policy for the drought. It was absolutely bucketed up hill and down dale by all the farm groups and farm leaders, as if, whatever value it was, people could sustain themselves personally with a fodder subsidy which was only going to support those people who had some fodder to sell. As always, even in the depths of the rural depression coming from the recession, there could not even be a generous response from the National Party to them as individuals, or to their children going to school. There was nothing generous-only a hidden subsidy for the people who had some fodder. They were always working the government backhander, the policy backhander or the subsidy backhander, rather than thinking about the farm community as individuals. That is what this government did. That· is why we have had acknowledgment for it. That is why this question, as with all the others you ask, reflects poorly on you. Australian National Training Authority",83
259,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. It refers to the forthcoming review of the Commonwealthstate agreement on the National Training Authority. How much does the Commonwealth contribute to technical and further education under the ANTA agreement? What requirements does the ANT A agreement impose on the other signatories to the agreement? Have they met all those requirements?",83
260,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bonython for his question. The Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that all young Australians receive an education which is both full and relevant. We have already achieved Labor's goal of encouraging more young people to stay at school to finish year 12. One out of three students used to complete year 12; now three out of four do so. These young people are now demanding, quite justifiably, further skills. With around one-third of them going on to university, the Commonwealth has been determined to make additional places available for vocational education. In 1995 the Commonwealth is contributing $695 million in basic funding for TAFE through ANTA. We also contribute growth funding. This year we are making $310 million available, which brings to $820 million the Commonwealth's contribution to meet growth in the TAFE system since the agreement was signed. However, this growth funding is dependent on the states and territories maintaining their effort. We do not ask them to increase it; simply to maintain it. As the honourable member indicated, the ANTA legislation requires a review later this year. I have recently seen documents from one state which no doubt will be of great concern to that inquiry. It is already established that South Australia has not maintained its effort. As a result, the ANTA ministerial council decided at its last meeting that a portion of South Australia's growth funding should be withheld. The South Australian Premier and Treasurer are now considering not what we would expectthat is, an increase in funding to make up the shortfall-instead, a pea and thimble trick to have the Commonwealth's own money counted as the state's contribution to TAFE so that, in turn, the Commonwealth will provide more money. I have a copy of a leaked budget document from South Australia",83
261,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,84
262,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,84
263,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The document to which I refer, which I will be happy to table at the conclusion of my answer, says that payments from the better cities program for the construction of a college of hotel management at the Regency Institute ofTAFE should be directed 'thro_ugh.the department's accounting records' - that is, the South Australian Department of Employment, Training and Further Education's accounting records-' in order to further enhance ANTA qualifying expenditures' . This plan would be a fraud on the many young people in South Australia who want a place in TAFE to gain the skills they need to compete for jobs and to contribute to the economy. Not one extra TAFE place would be created in South Australia by this sleight of hand. Not one extra brick would be laid.at the college of hotel management because of this paper shuffle. It is a scam, pure and simple. No federal Labor government, having come this far in providing our young people with the education and the skills that they need to take their place in our economy and in our society, is going to let a state government steal their future. I table the document. National Forest Policy",84
264,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I draw his attention to the comments made by the member for MCEwen last night on radio 3A W when referring to the government's forest policy. He said: It is in my view the most dismally handled issue that the Government had in its entire term of office. Quite some achievement! I refer the Prime Minister to his remarks in the Sir John Monash Memorial Lecture last night when he said: Good policy is not always popular-not at first, at least. Prime Minister, when are you going to apply this dictum to your forest industry policy which has degenerated to the point where cabinet is considering the future of each of 509 forest coupes and has plainly substituted politics for good policy? Is it a fact that your failure to adopt good policy continues to frighten investors away from the forest industries and is a major reason why this nation recorded a forest products deficit of $521 million in the December quarter?",84
265,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has always been a conundrum for those people who want to see the best of our native forests preserved and those who want to see a viable forest products industry to be able to see themselves sitting beside one another in harmony. There will never be, in this policy, in this whole area, the capacity to serve everybody's aspirations completely. But this government seeks to try to serve them well. The government has considered, over a substantial period of time, all the issues involved in representative reserve systems and how we might keep a decent representation of species amongst particular stands of trees. At around half past four this afternoon I will be saying something public about it. The cabinet considered it at length again today. Part of the difficulty always in forest management in these terms is that the environmental imperative has been operated through the residual powers of the Commonwealth under the export powers. The Commonwealth is not a manager of state forests. It is because of this need to refer to state management systems and state managers of forests that there could never be within the Commonwealth a management system that would adequately serve the full expression of those powers. That is what this discussion has been about. With a lot of goodwill between ministers, departments and the states, we are seeking to come to the right conclusion about it. This is in marked contrast to the coalition. When Mr MCLachlan, as the former shadow minister for the environment, said recently that he was adopting a policy for the coalition against clear-felling of trees for land clearance, the Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, said he would not have a bar of the policy. He overturned it completely. I also observe that the opposition spokesperson for the environment recently appointed by the Leader of the Opposition believes that the Commonwealth's external affairs powerits treaty power-should not be used in any way for environmental protection. That is, things like the Gordon below Franklin and the world heritage listings would not be there were we to see this person's view that the external affairs power should not be used. _ So if the Commonwealth were not to use the external affairs power or its external powers in respect to exports, or export licences for woodchips, then its influence on forest policy would be very greatly diminished, and that side of the argument which seeks to have a representative reserve system in our forests and the preservation of native stands of trees could not be served. That is the key point. It has only been this side - of the House which has taken the view that there has to be a balance between this-that we do want to see that but at the same time get to the position where we can have reasonable forest agreements where there are, on a scientific basis, the preserVation of large, adequate reserve systems for trees. As a consequence of that, it would mean that we would not in the future be going through a coupe by coupe analysis of export approvais. But with the states tardy in coming into RFAs, regional forest agreements, there has been no recourse but for the Commonwealth to try to judge from this distance, as the nonoperator of forests, which of these particular coupes can be made available for woodchips. This was, of its essence, always a complex matter, it always has been and it will be until we have representative forest arrangements, RFAs, across the Commonwealth. And, of course, Mr Speaker, you already know that the state where this has been the heaviest industry, Tasmania, has not even signed the national forest policy statement-Premier Groom has not even signed the national forest policy.statement. So let us not have anybody from the National Party, of all people, asking us about forest management. When the member for Barker made a reasonable policy expression saying that they would - not allow continued clear-felling of trees, the Leader of the National Party said he would not have a bar of the policy, he would overturn that in government. That is where they are coming from and that really means, in terms of this debate,they disqualify themselves on the basis of not being able to add to the debate in arty meaningful way how we might keep these important native trees and, at the same time, end up with a sustainable wood products industry. Sustainable Development",84
266,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Yesterday, the government launched Greenhouse 21 C, a plan of action for a sustainable future. Can the minister inform the House of what impact the measures in the statement will have on the urban environment-in which 85 per cent of Australians live?",86
267,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his· question which, in some respects, is complementary to the previous question. The government's concern with ecologically sust.ainable development with the environment goes to the green issues; it also goes to the so-called brown issues. The decisions made and announced this week represented a very substantial step taken by the government towards achieving the target set for us-a target that will result reduction of 15 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. As with other environmental issues, of course, that represents a balance between the interests of industry and what can be achieved at the environmental level. The package that the minister announced yesterday, I think, makes that balance in a way that has industry contributing very substantially through voluntary agreements. It also has a substantiill commitment of people working through rural based programs, particularly around Landcare and REEP, where something like $250 million will go into employing something of the order of 25,000 people in making their contribution through their programs to the reduction of greenhouse. I want to emphasise very quickly, in answer to the honourable member, the importance of a longer term agenda which goes to urban issues. Fifty per cent of all emissions are essentially related to urban life and the way that we live in urban society. So the solution to the greenhouse issue lies in energy efficiency in terms of industry and it lies in the billion dollar tree planting program across Australia. But it also will depend upon our capacity to green our cities. Urban forests and forestation programs within cities play a very important role. Secondly, transport systems are important. It is important to see where improvements in urban public transport can contribute, just as the efficiency-or lack of efficiency-in housing can play a very important role and the Commonwealth, through the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, can demonstrate effective ways forward. Finally, what greenhouse is about is achieving outcomes over specific periods. We need to see how we can achieve that by working with the states in Commonwealth-state programs where Commonwealth funding is involved. Part of yesterday'S announcement was to look at ways to legislate to ensure that, where we make contributions to major state programs, we look to the outcomes environmentally in terms of reducing omissions. In its statement, the government indicated in a that it can achieve a great deal through the measures announced. But, in the longer term, we need to think more about what we can achieve through the urban environment. I think many people in the community will take very seriously the agenda in yesterday's statement. I encourage them to look at that part of Greenhouse 21 C. It will be very important to environmentalists who operate with, are thinking about and are concerned with the brown agenda as well as the green agenda the Prime Minister referred to in terms of forests. Prime Minister: Role of Speaker",86
268,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the wide reportage of his criticism of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker at the recent caucus meeting? Can the Prime Minister confirm these reports and also confirm that, at the same meeting, he set Sir Billy Snedden as the benchmark on how the Speaker should control the parliament? Does the Prime Minister also recall saying to Speaker Snedden in 1980: You are corrupt, you are biased, you always speak in favour of the Government, you are of the Government and you have besmirched the office of Speaker. You have been partisan and biased all week. Is it not true that the Prime Minister needs a scapegoat for his appalling performance in parliament and that he is nothing but a thug on the matter of the Speaker, no matter who the Speaker is?",86
269,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the language towards the end of the question was unnecessary. I ask the Leader of the National Party to withdraw that remark. Mr Tim Fischer-I withdraw that aspect. I leave the question with the Prime Minister.,87
270,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the caucus of the Labor Party, I made references to the management of the House and the performance of the House. I think that in the public debate-in which we are all participants-there should be a device for the dissemination of real argument and real information. We have had quite a bit of that today. The interesting· thing is that the question was put in the context of a debate about my parliamentary style. But my style does not go to things like push polling. My style does not go to things like using documents to assail the minister on something you know to be completely untrue. My style does not go to dropping tax information into a public debate. I notice that a letter the Leader of the Opposition recently wrote to the Department of Administrative Services states: Senator Baume has responsibilities involving a very close liaison with me and my office. It would suit my convenience to have him as readily accessible as possible. I will.table that document. Mrs Bishop-- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 145, and I refer to Steve Martin's ruling on 15 March 1993, when he said that the relevant minister was playing politics with the question and that the answer was not relevant to the question. He told the minister to restrict his remarks to the question asked. I now ask you, Mr Acting Speaker, to uphold the ruling of Speaker Martin on that date and again on 26 May 1993, and the former rulings of Speaker MCLeay. I ask you not to be intimidated by this Prime Minister, to call him to order and direct him to address his remarks to the question as asked.",87
271,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is answering the question. He has decided to answer it by contrasting styles.,87
272,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr Acting Speaker Mr MCGauran interjecting,87
273,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Gippsland might wish to withdraw that remark, that reflection on the Chair. Mr MCGauran-The reflection that 'He's got to you'?",87
274,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Mr MCGauran-I will withdraw it.,87
275,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Unequivocally.,87
276,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We can all stand a debate in this parliament about the way the House runsMrs Bishop-- Mr Acting Speaker, I asked you for a ruling on my point of order. You gave no ruling. If you decline to give me a ruling, are you telling this House that you decline to uphold those previous rulings?",87
277,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! .By implication in. my ruling, I find the Prime Minister in order.",87
278,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We can have a debate here about how the House is conducted. But it is pretty amazing that we can have a debate about the style of any of us in parliament when, in a period of eight weeks, a Leader of the Opposition has been into push polling, framing a minister, dropping tax information and doing all of these things",87

289,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"relates to what the Speaker may do after having called the attention of the House to the conduct of a member who persists in irrelevant or tedious repetition his or her arguments or of the arguments of other members. The Prime Minister is just reading from notes. He has already gone through this once in answer to this question, and he went through it earlier in question time. The member for Werriwa was reading from the same notes earlier today. The Prime Minister is just reading from Labor Party speakers' notes. If that is the best he can do, it is tedious repetition and you should ask him to sit down.",88
290,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,88
291,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude on this point: that any reference I made to Speaker Snedden never implied perfection on his part because I do not think even he would claim that of himself. There is something to be said for having a public debate in this country on how, in record time, a Leader of the Opposition has so besmirched the system by these tactics. Yet that is not the matter in the public debate. We are debating matters without substance rather than the substantial matter of the Leader of the Opposition trying to introduce the immorality of the American political system into Australia, bringing with it his endorsement of the sort of tactics which I think most Australians regard as un-Australian and, need I say, unparliamentary. If the House of Representatives seeks to be able to transmit information and have a real discussion, this sort of noise and interjection, in which those opposite now specialise, and the disruption which is their principal tactic, will never become the stock-in-trade of a parliament that enjoys widespread support and respect. Electronic Vote Counting",88
292,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. It concerns an electronic counting system for Senate elections. What progress has been made in implementing such a system?,88
293,Mr W ALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is very timely. In today's Sydney Morning Herald, cartoonist Moir very appropriately lampooned the slowness of the traditional manual counting method of votes in New South Wales of elections. It is extraordinarily slow. We saw a similar performance in the ACT elections and also in the last Senate election. I am happy to announce that, in this day of the information superhighway, the AEC will soon be ready to implement a computerised scrutiny package which will greatly speed up the counting of votes in the Senate elections. In essence, the new system is called 'Easy count' and it will dramatically slash the time taken to complete the Senate count in each state. New South Wales, Mr Acting Speaker, as you well know, is the slowest state to count manually because of the number and size of the ballot papers. It now takes weeks of counting to produce a final result. The reason the Senate takes so much longer than the House of Representatives is the below·theline ballot papers. There are some 180,000 in New South Wales that need to be laboriously checked. Some ballot papers take 15 minutes each to be checked. That is why the Senate count goes on and on for weeks after the expiration of the statutory i 3 days that we have to wait for postal votes. But hopefully no more. Under 'Easy count' the AEC advises me that it will take the computer just two hours to do all those weeks of counting. The new system can be used in all states for the Senate. Party scrutineers will be reassured to hear that under 'Easy count' a detailed audit trail of the ""entire counting""process will make their jobs much easier. The keying in process for each ballot paper will be by two independent operators with the computer cross-checking any variation in their entry on the ballot paper. I think the House will be pleased to hear that the proposed change will not cost anything for the taxpayers. In fact, there be a saving of $375,000. Superannuation",88
294,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer confirm his promise to the ACTU that any compulsory employee superannuation contribution will be accompanied by a taxation trade-off? If the Treasurer cannot confirm this, is this one more instance of the government plundering wage earners of up to $6 billion on top of their already rising mortgage interest rates in a clear attempt to remedy it- mismanagement of the economy?",89
295,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Far from plundering wage earners, real wages have been increasing for the last several years, although members opposite probably have not noticed that. We have been looking at a situation of improving real wages and improving real household disposable incomes. In the last couple of years we have seen very strongly rising real household disposable incomes in which wage earners have been participants. We are not talking about a situation in which people are suffering declining real incomes and declining living standards. The substance of the member's question gets to issues which are probably more properly addressed when I next confront the House on budget day.",89
296,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. ",89

You have very high standards for us.",89
312,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I am satisfied that the matter has been dealt with. The minister will go to where he has been misrepresented.,89
313,Mr GEAR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am saying that this is absolutely wrong. As the then chairman of the national price watch committee, I released information about doctors overcharging patients by more than $100 million above the schedule fee-information I thought would have been in the interests of hundreds of thousands of patients. I gathered that informadevastation tion from statistical records of a general nature, which were released to me through the minister's office by the department of health. The now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the then Leader of the Opposition moved a censure motion.",90

318,Mr GEAR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,":-I am. I am showing exactly where I have been misrepresented. I never released doctor provider numbers, the names of doctors or the names of patients. Never. At no stage did I solicit Medibank provider numbers, and I was never given them. Both the Solicitor-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions made it quite clear that there was no breach of the law. If the members who made the allegations think there is, I challenge them to provide them.",90

325,Ms HENZELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,-If the rabble opposite will contain themselvesMr MCGauran interjecting,90
326,Ms HENZELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Pathetic. In a press release by the member for Mara!10a (Mr Bruce Scott) dated 29 March, he saId: Bruce Scott, Memberfor Maranoa, has blasted the Member for Capricomia, Marjor!e Henzell, for h-r statement that the massive socIal and economIc being experienced by rural Australia due to the drought and recession was ""inevitable"". This refers to a speech I made in the House. To show where I have been misrepresented, I will simply quote the only sentence in the whole speech where I used the word 'inevitable' and we will see if the members of this House can make the distinction. I said: And, unfortunately, it will be left to the National Party-which has become a - ral rump paI""o/ peddling a pretty conservative s.oclal and ec-momlc policy and platform-to come l!ltO t!te parlIament, bleat and whinge, and decry the mevltable and very difficult changes that primary industries, a- weB as other industries in this country, must face If we are going to be an exporting nation. Most upper primary children doing a comp.rehension test would not make that assumptIon out of that sentence.",90
327,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member has made her personal explanation.,90
328,Ms HENZELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"- Mr Acting Speaker, I seek leave to table the offensive press release and my press release in reply. Leave not granted.",90
329,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Acting Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",90
330,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,90
331,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do, grievously.",90
332,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,90
333,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"-Earlier today I made a personal explanation. T-ere have ?een some statements in the House SInce that tIme. I would like to outline where I have been grievously taken to task-misrepresented. - e member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), earlIer today in the motion moved by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), said: Their only strategy-the strategy that has become the stock-in-trade of the Liberal Party in the 1990s-is to play the man, not the ball, to smear at any cost.",90
334,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Could I seek clarification from the honourable member for Cowan. You have already made a personal explanation on the speech made by the honourable member for Werriwa. Are you going to go to other places where you claim to have been misrepresented?,91
335,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,--That is correct.,91
336,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I think we should ignore the honourable member for Werriwa's statements and get to the other matters.,91
337,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"--It is all part of that. There was evidence of it yesterday in question time. The honourable member for Werriwa said today: Shamefully, opposition backbenchers went to the all-time low of trying to raise the Prime Minister's children as a political issue. The chief goon on opposition side, its expert on the whoopee cushion and imitation spider, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), was right into it, raising the Minister's children and his wife as a political question. You may recall that I went on to explain my question in my personal explanation. I will read the question to you.",91
338,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"To help me, can we go to the claim of the further misrepresentation. So far, you have gone over the matters that were covered in your initial personal explanation.",91
339,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"--As I explained in my personal explanation earlier on today, I went on to say that I would never talk about the family of another person in this place. The member for Werriwa stood up and said: I do not deny any of the words that I said in the debate. What I do dispute is the recollection by the honourable member for Cowan. The truth is that as he was called to order by the Acting Speaker in the Housebeing you, Siryesterday he sat down and, as he sat down, he continued his question by saying, 'Will the Prime Minister's children be used as mascots in the guard?' It was not recorded by Hansard because he had been called to order by the Acting Speaker of the House. He knows full well that he is now misrepresenting himself in this place. I did not say this. What I said as I sat down was: Will the Prime Minister donate one of his former pigs as a mascot? I went to Hansard after the .member for Werriwa raised the matter again after my personal explanation and I viewed the video of the speech. That confirms that I did not say what the honourable member for Werriwa asserts. The honourable member, in raising this assertion, is acting contrary to standing order 76, and I ask that an apology and withdrawal be made. Mr Acting Speaker, I ask you to make a ruling on that.",91
340,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,You have raised the matter of a personal explanation. Mr Beale-He doesn't know the standing orders.,91
341,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I know enough the to know that if he wishes to raise a point of order, which it turned into, he could have Prime raised a point of order. The honourable member is stretching my patience. Is the honourable member now asking for a withdrawal from the honourable member for Werriwa?",91
342,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,--It is clear that I did not say what he suggested.,91
343,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Are you asking for a withdrawal?,91
344,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,--I am asking for an apology and withdrawal.,91
345,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I take it that the honourable member for Cowan did not advise the honourable member for Werriwa that he was going to make this personal explanation.,91
346,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,--I did speak to the honourable member for Werriwa in a rather gruff way outside the chamber. He reasserted that I did say that. I checked with Hansard and saw the video. I did not say that. He is asserting it contrary to standing order 76.,91
347,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am in a difficult situation because what you have put to me has not been recorded in Hansard. I acknowledge that the honourable member has indicated where he feels the honourable member for Werriwa, in his further explanation, has further llPset him. I think that at this stage I would have to leave it at that, even though the honourable member might continue to feel aggrieved. Mrs Sullivan- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have been listening very carefully-and I was sitting here yesterdayand the allegation is very disturbing. What the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has said in words of one syllable is that, having made a personal explanation to put the record straight, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in this place has called him a liar. The member for Cowan has stood up and denied that again, having gone through all the measures that he could. Under those circumstances, I think it is incumbent on you to at least check the facts. The statement was made in here that the member for Cowan statement of untruth to this House in his previous personal explanation. I do not really think that is something that can just be allowed to slide away. I think the Werriwa has to be asked to withdraw and apologise.",92
348,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Acting Speaker, this dispute involves allegations of references to the wives and children of members of parliament. think I would speak for all members of this of the House! House to say that we all deplore references to wives and children. Let me say for my part would never approve, support or endorse in any way a reference to the Prime Minister's children or his wife by any member on my side of the House. I was well aware of the substance of the question asked by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). By no stretch of the imagination was there ever any intention to refer to the Prime Minister's children. All of us on this side of the House would regard that as utterly unacceptable. He clearly ferred to the Prime Minister's pigs. There no reference to children. I think it is outrageous that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has deliberately again misrepresented the position to the member for Cowan, and if he had any sense of decorum and responsibility he would come into the parliament and apologise.",92
349,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order: I am afraid the House is being misled. There have been a number of occasions when those opposite have raised issues relating to the Prime Minister's wife and children, when they brought up issues relating to babysitting at different times in this chamber. This is a complete piece of unctuous nonsense.",92
350,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat.,92
351,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,That is not right. Mr·Downer-You filthy minded people. MrBeazley-Not again. Mr Downer-What about his comments made a about my wife last year?,92
352,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,What about evidence,92
353,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Ordei""! The member for Leader of the Opposition!",92
354,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,What about him? Mr Downer-He should apologise to my .,92
355,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The I honourable member for Mayo and the Leader,92
356,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,You wouldn't apologise to I Costello for what you said about him.,92
357,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! When the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House have finished, we will go back to the honourable merriber for Cowan's grievance. On the basis of now three personal explanations about this matter and the opportunity that has been given to the honourable member for Cowan to put his grievance and his side of his personal explanation twice, I believe that is as far as this matter can go at rethis. 'stage. If the honourable member for was Cowan would wish to take this further, there are other forms of the. House that he might like to 10bk at.",92
358,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Acting Speaker, in an attempt to resolve the problem, could I suggest with your indulgence that you invite the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) with you to review the tape and, that having been done, to invite the honourable member forW erriwa to come into this place and apologise as the honourable member has requested.",93
359,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"At this stage, whilst I appreciate the sound advice from the right honourable member for New England is meant with good intent, I have indicated where. I thii1k this matter lies at the moment, and I would leave it for the honourable member for Cowan to consider his options. Mr Lieberman- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise. a point of order. I am sorry if you are exasperated, but you have a duty, as Acting Speaker, to be patient in these matters. I draw your attention to standing orders 77 and 78. Standing order 77 states: When any offensive or disorderly words are used, by a Member ... who is present, the Speaker shall intervene. Standing order 78 states: When the attention of the Speaker is drawn to words used, he shall determine whether or not they are offensive or disorderly. On the words used by the member for Cowan in his personal explanation, very clearly the words used by the member complained of are not accurate and should be withdrawn. Mr Acting Speaker, you should say that you find them to be offensive and disorderly. You should not put it on the backburner.",93
360,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The usual practice for matters of withdrawal is that they are arranged at the time they take place. A personal explanation is a device that allows an honourable member to make a personal explanation, which has been done in this case. Again I repeat: that is where I think the matter should lie. Mrs Bishop- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 79, which states: The House will interfere to prevent the prosecution of any quarrel between Members arising out of debates or proceedings of the House or of any committee thereof. Mr Acting Speaker, I suggest to you that a method of interference by the House would be for you to take up the suggestion of the right honourable member for New England for the viewing of the tape to take place. You should report to this House on what you have observed and then make a ruling on whether or not the member for Werriwa, who I note is still absent, should make an apology.",93
361,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! I am not willing to take the course of action outlined by the honourable member for Mackellar. I call the honourable member for La Trobe, on a further point of order. Mrs Bishop-But you haven't ruled on that one.",93
362,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I said that I was not willing to take that course of action. Mr Charles- Mr Acting Speaker, I draw your attention to precedent and an issue in which you were involved several years ago. I remind you that one day the then member for Capricornia stood in this place and said words which were highly offensive to me. I rose at the time, objected to the words and demanded a withdrawal. He refused to withdraw, and you later negotiated with him and convinced him to come back to this place, apologise and withdraw. I suggest that you might follow that precedence in this case.",93
363,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! On that occasion, it was clear at the time what was said. I have never checked the record. I assume that it was recorded in the Hansard. As the honourable member for La Trobe quite rightly outlined, the chair had a great deal of difficulty in getting the withdrawal that was required. Whilst I was not involved in the counsel received by the honourable member who made the statement, I believe the counselling went on through the whip's office at that stage. The honourable member for Capricornia came back into the House at a later stage and made the withdrawal that was required.",93

371,Mr ANDERSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,There was a misrepresentation. I furnish as evidence the fact that we had a 13-point response plan to the drought. I seek leave to table that plan.,94

379,Mr WALKER,COMMISSION,"-I table a letter from Mr Justice Morling, the Chair of the Australian Electoral Commission, in relation to comments made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in Monday's grievance debate regarding the electoral redistribution process in Queensland. NA Current Account Deficit",95
380,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Prime Minister to deal with disastrous current account problems after several years of claiming he had the solutions in place and that the worse was over. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number ofmembers required by the standing orders having risen in their places",95
381,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"-If there were ever any doubt in the Australian community as to the charge made against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) by his former numbers apparatchik, Graham Richardson, a couple of days ago on the John Laws program-I raise the John Laws program quite deliberately because, if ever there were a direct line into the Australian people which the Prime Minister periodically uses, it would be the John Laws program because it has a very wide coverage-it would have been put to rest by what Graham Richardson said on that program. He said that the Prime Minister had well and truly lost the plot and that he was no longer listening to the concerns of mainstream Australia. The ultimate demonstration of the accuracy of that statement was revealed today in the supreme self-delusion of the Prime Minister which lies at the heart of Australia's chronic inability to cure its current account deficit problem. For most of question time the Prime Minister invited the parliament and, through the parliament, the Australian people to believe that, when it came to parliamentary noise and the cut and thrust of parliament, he was an innocent abroad who was the victim of the rowdy tactics of the opposition and the incompetence of those in the chair. It is very instructive that at no stage did the Prime Minister deny reports of what he said at the caucus meeting about the incompetence of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. All he sought to do was to claim that it was all our fault. The Prime Minister is very good at blaming other people for his problems. This week, which is only to Thursday, these are the people he has blamed for his problems: the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the House the of Representatives; Graham Richardson; Bob Carr; John Della Bosca; Barry Jones; Ros Kelly; the voters of Canberra, that is 99,000 people; university students; the ACT Labor Party and the Legislative Assembly; the Sydney Morning Herald; the journalists of the Canberra press gallery; the televising of parliament; and, most of allyou will love this, Ralph-lazy ministers. The trouble is that he is doing 90 per cent of the work. The last time. I remember another Prime Minister of Australia blaming his ministers for his problems, he lost the election eight weeks later. I think it is a very bad habit that Prime Minister has fallen into. The serious part of it-the real rub--is that, while the Prime Minister deludes, Australia burns. That is the rub. For 12 years we have put up with this hubris. We have put up with this man who is drunk with his own and arrogance. We have put up with him day after day, month after month, year after year offering one more excuse and asking for just one more opportunity. We all remember when he went on the John Laws program nine years ago and declared that, if Australia did not tackle the current account deficit problem, it would become a banana republic. That was a call to economic arms; that was how the Prime Minister later rationalised it. I do not think that was his original intention. He is very good at the post facto rationalisation-like suggesting that, when our vote goes up in New South Wales by six per cent, which extrapolated would give us a gain of 11 seats, it is a disaster. That is one of the most monumentalits ly deluded rationalisations that I have from the Prime Minister. But he has done the same with the economy. Back in 1986 he that, unless we cured the current account deficit problem, Australia would become a banana republic. Nine years later, three elections later, 25 broken promises later, the Prime Minister is still saying that our major problem is the current account deficit. I ask you, Prime Minister: how long must the Australian people wait until you finally deliver on the promises you have made about curing the fundamental problems of the Australian economy? That is the simple question. The Prime Minister tried again during question time to run this fictitious that, in some way, the current account deficit problem during the time that I was Treasurer was worse than it is now. I happen to have been given a set of statistics. It shows that, in the seven years Fraser government was in office, the current account deficit at its highest point, which in the second last year of that term of government, was 5.6 per cent of GDP. During every other year it was below four per cent of GDP. Let me tell you what has happened since Mr the Keating has been either the Treasurer or the Prime Minister of Australia. In 1985-86 the current account deficit was six per cent, 6.1 per cent, 6.1 and 6.1; in the pre-recession period it was 6.1, 6.4, 6.4 and 6.4. On most occasions, it has been way in excess of what hubris it was on any earlier occasion. Today's current account deficit figure for February is $2.2 billion. For the first time in history, Australia has recorded four consecutive monthly current account deficits of over $2 billion. The current account deficit over the year to February is 50 per cent higher than it was for the corresponding period last year. This is the problem that nine years ago the Prime Minister said he was going to fix. The reason why we have high interest rates in Australia is not only the size of the budget ex deficit but also that overseas lenders are charging a risk premium to lend to borrowers in a country whose current account deficit is the second worse in the OECD. Foreign investors regard Australia, when it comes to current account deficit, as a bad risk. You heard cannot blame anybody-the Fraser government, foreigners, the British, Sir Henry Parkes said or the prophet Moses-except yourself. You have now been in charge of this country for 12 years and there comes a time of great political accounting. We saw a taste of your political future last Saturday right here in Canberra. That was a time of great political accounting, because what the people of Canberra said more than anything else was: 'Prime Minister, we no longer believe you. We no longer trust you. We no longer have any faith that you can deliver solutions to Australia's problems. We want to send you a resounding message in no uncertain terms.' line That is why they sent Brendan Smyth here with the biggest swing in modern political history in Australia. That is why, unless the Prime Minister stops sniffing his hubris the herbs-until he comes down to earth and the understands that ordinary Australians in the mainstream of this country are bleeding, and was bleeding very badly-he will suffer the same fate as your Sue Robinson suffered just last weekend here in the city of Canberra. You no longer have any credibility when it comes to the current account deficit. You said in 1987 that the worse was over. You said in 1988 that the policy would continue to lower the current account deficit and so restore Australia's sovereignty over its own affairs. Sovereignty is a very interesting subject. It is something the Prime Minister is interested in. He keeps telling us that, unless we become a republic, change our flag and do what other people want us to do with our national identity-not what Australians want us to do with our national identity-we are not a sovereign country. What your Prime Minister has done in the last 12 years has been to more trade in and denude this country of real sovereignty than any constitutional set-up could possibly do. You have handed this country over to the foreign bankers of the world, you have handed us over to the bureaucrats of Geneva when it comes to the treaty making powers and processes of this country; yet you have the nerve to talk about national stature. Your Prime Minister has got the nerve to talk about Australians walking proud and tall in the world. I do not walk proud and tall in the world when I know that my country's foreign debt has gone to $180,000 million from a figure of $21,000 million back in 1982. Mr Willis interjecting",95
382,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You ought not to feel very proud about it at all. The reality is that this country's economic situation, because of the negligence of your part-time Prime Minister over the last 12 years in his various positions, has become gravely weakened. You boast about how many jobs you created in the 1980s. You created a lot of jobs in the 1980s. But do you know how you created them? You created them by running the economy at an unsustainably fast rate. Any fool can create hundreds of thousands of jobs if he is prepared to go into debt to foreigners. That is what you did. Mr Willis interjecting",97
383,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We did not go into debt to foreigners the way you have. Mr WiIIis-""-You did.",97
384,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You talk about the sovereignty of this country,97
385,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition might direct his comments through the chair.,97
386,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, he is interjecting.",97
387,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Don't lecture me either, thanks.",97
388,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, through the whole of the 1980s, the economy of this country was run at an unsustainably fast rate. You went into debt to an unacceptable degree in order to purchase an unsustainable increase in the number of jobs in this country. The net effect is that we still have in this country the most sustained level of long term unemployment that we have had since World War II; we still have 800,000 Australians out of work; we still have an unacceptably high level of youth unemployment; and, on top of that, we have the highest level of foreign debt since the Great Depression. That is your legacy. That is your record. That is the achievement of your Prime Minister, Mr Deputy Speaker, over the last 12 years. What the people of Canberra said last weekend, and what the Australian people are saying all around this country at the present time, is that they no longer believe somebody who in 1987 said that the problem had been solved; in 1988 said that the policies were working; in 1990 said that the problem was no longer with us; in 1992 said that the basic challenges had been met and overcome; and now, in 1995, went down to Monash University last night and restates the problem all over again. You could write out the year 1995 and you could substitute the year 1986. Nothing has changed. Those on the other side used to talk about how the Bourbons forgot nothing because they learnt nothing. If ever there were a Bourbon of Australian economic management, it is the current Prime Minister, because the rhetoric has not altered. Yet he expects us year after year to go on believing what he is saying. The fact of the matter is that the people no longer believe what he is saying. That is why so many of your colleagues are quaking in their boots this week. That is why you got that 17 per cent swing against you in Canberra. That is why your caucus members ravaged your Prime Minister. That is why all of those people queued up to give their doorstops on Tuesday morning as they marched into this building and told the Prime Minister to start listening. But do you think this Prime Minister is going to listen? Do you think anybody seriously expects the Australian public to believe that he is an innocent abroad when it comes to the rough-house of the Australian parliament? Do you seriously believe that anybody who asks the Australian people to think that he is put upon when it comes to parliamentary procedure could ever possibly summon a modicum of humility to say that he is sorry, to apologise to the Australian people for the fact that he lied to them and misled them, to apologise to the Australian people for promising them tax cuts at the last election, yet taking them away, and for telling them in 1987 that the current account problem was solved but admitting last night that the problem had not even begun to be solved? How on earth can anybody take such a person seriously? Yet, apparently, there are still some misguided people opposite. Over the last 12 years the Australian economy has been progressively handed over to the bankers of the world. A Prime Minister who boasts about the importance of national independence has done more to pawn our real independence than any Prime Minister in Australia's history. I do not think the Prime Minister has learnt anything from last weekend, because I believe this Prime Minister is incapable of learning anything. I think his long record of failure over the last 12 years, particularly in relation to the current account deficit, is eloquent testimony to that proposition. MrWILLIS (Gellibrand-Treasurer) (4.48 p.m.)-It was interesting to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) say that any fool can create jobs if he is prepared to increase foreign debt. When the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, he certainly presided over a considerable increase in foreign debt, but he did not create any jobs. It takes a real fool to do that. When the Australian people come to make their judgments about the relative performance of the Labor government versus its predecessor, they will do well to look at the record of the previous government. I am not going to spend much time on it today, but since it has been made an issue by the Leader of the Opposition let us just recall the fact that, when he was in office as Treasurer for five years, there was growth of employment of 52,000 a year and that under this government it has been 154,000 a year-l 00,000 jobs more a year. That is an extraordinary record when compared with that of the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. He thinks he can persuade the Australian people to believe that he can run the economy better than this government, when he has a record which is appalling compared with that of the present government. Whilst he was producing one-third of the rate of employment growth, he was doing it with an inflation rate of 9.7 per cent per annum compared with the average rate over our 12 years of 5.4 per cent. So he produced about one-third of the job growth rate and about twice the rate of inflation. That is the kind of record that he has. On foreign debt he is also saying that he is a bit of a cleanskin. That is not true. In fact, I can go to no better authority than a member of the Liberal Party, Mr Michael Warby, who wrote an article in Quadrant in May 1994. In the footnote to that article Michael Warby is described as a member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party. In that article he said: The Fraser Government's performance was, to be blunt, poor. The Fraser Government presided over the period when high inflation, mass unemployment and plummeting national saving rates became entrenched, and growth in living standards stagnated. That is a member of the Liberal Party Federal Council giving a one sentence summary of the performance of the Fraser government, of which the now Leader of the Opposition was a m'inister all of that time and Treasurer for five of the seven years. He went on: ... on foreign debt, the Fraser Government can clearly be held responsible for presiding over the start of the growth in foreign debt, which grew from 11 per cent of GDP to 21 per cent in a mere two years from June 1981 to June 1983. This rate of growth of foreign debt has only been briefly approached, and never exceeded, under the HawkeKeating governments. So here we have a prominent member of the Liberal Party saying publicly the truth-that there was this rapid growth of foreign debt as a proportion of GDP. In the last two years of the now Leader of the Opposition's period as Treasurer of this country, he had this explosion of foreign debt alongside an economy which was going through the floor. He had it wrong every which way. We have now a situation where the economy is growing stronger than any other country in the OECD. He had an economy which was going through the floor, going into recession-remember that 1982-83 was a year of recession-and soaring foreign debt. He had the absolute quintessential, awful outcome; and with that he had double digit inflation. This was an appalling end to the Fraser government. No wonder it got thrown out. Of course, with the effluxion of time, people tend to forget all that, but it is very relevant to considerations of the relative weight that people should give to the two parties. This government certainly has been in office for 12 years and we will stand on our record over that period which, economically, looks fantastic compared with that of the opposition when it was last in government. It is a record which has produced for the Australian people a prolonged period-obviously there are ups and downs of the business cycle-of much faster employment growth than they ever had before under the Fraser government, much lower inflation and a tremendous reduction in industrial disputes. There have been some current account problems which we have been grappling with over that time and still are, as the Prime Minister said in his speech last night. We have not just been sitting there saying, 'Here is a problem that the Australian nation has and we are not going to bother doing anything about.' We have been addressing that problem we inherited from the previous government of a structure which simply was not taking the Australian people anywhere. We were a developed industrial country with a Third World pattern of exports. We relied on things that you can grow and dig up out of the ground rather than value added commodities, goods or services for exports. We were overwhelmingly Third World in our pattern of exports, and that meant that we were facing a long-term decline in our terms of trade. We had to grow and dig up more and faster just to stay in the one place. As the end of the Fraser government period shows, as I already demonstrated, there was an inability at that time to stop a considerable increase in foreign debt. The terms of trade were adverse and we were facing a situation where Australia was going down the gurgler because we had a structure which simply was not suited to maintaining living standardscertainly in a relative way and maybe not even absolutely in the longer term. As well as producing those major changes on employment, inflation, industrial disputation and productivity improvement, this government has been about making a major structural change to the economy, which particularly shows up in the export field. We said we had to get away from the high protection policies which had been pursued in the past, bring protection down and make our manufacturing and service industries much more competitive so that they can compete and are not so reliant on commodities which are subject to supply and demand on world markets. Although they will always be important to us because we have that enormous comparative advantage in those areas, we simply can no longer rely on them. We had to structurally adjust the Australian economy in a major way to make our manufactured exports and service industries internationally competitive. That meant reducing tariffs, which meant a higher propensity to import. As tariffs keep coming down, obviously more imports keep coming in. This also means that our industries have to become more efficient or die. They have clearly become much more efficient. Manufacturing industry is now able to produce not 10 per cent of exports, which it was back in 1983-84, but 17 per cent of our total exports. We have seen a very rapid growth of exports of manufactured goods. We will see a lot more of it in the future. That is of tremendous benefit to the Australian nation, because the price of manufactured goods on world markets is much better, when taking into account the long-term trends, than the price of commodities without much value added. It is very important to us to pursue that course. We have seen service industries increasing their exports markedly as well. We have near balance on the services side with exports and imports. Tourism is the obvious example of a tremendous growth in an export industry. There are others: education, health and so on. These are major changes. The accusation of the Leader of the Opposition that the government was sitting there and unable and not willing to address the current account problem is massively untrue. No government in the history of this country has addressed that issue more than this government has. Certainly we do have a high current account now-at least that part of his speech is right-in comparison with most other developed Western countries. We are also growing faster than most of those countries. We are doing it at a time of drought. That drought is knocking some $2 billion off our exports. We are growing at a time when the rest of the world has not been growing rapidly. The prices for and volumes of our non-rural commodities have not been good. They are starting to pick up now, as the rest of the world lifts its game. Obviously that is a good portent for next year. Today's figures, as I said at question time, show quite a deal of encouragement in that regard. We can look forward to an improvement in exports of non-rural commodities, and rural commodities for that matter, as, hopefully, the drought does completely break and the rest of the world has higher activity, and prices for commodities continue to increase. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects a nine per cent increase in commodity exports next year, or about $5 billion. That is clearly a great plus for the current account next year. At the moment we have a combination of high growth and very high investment, which is capital intensive and which puts pressure on the current account. Temporarily we have this high figure. As the Prime Minister said in his speech last night, these long-term trends are encouraging for the future. The efforts which we have made to bring about the structural adjustment and develop manufactured exports in a big way are exceedingly important to the future of this country. Dr Kemp-It has not been good enough.",97
389,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It has been a damn sight better than you could ever do, that is for sure. It is important for us to produce those improved manufactured exports. We have seen some major demonstrations in recent times of how that can be done. Mr Tim Fischer-Waterfront reform? It has stalled.",100
390,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The Treasurer should address his remarks through the chair. Mr Tim Fischer-I am trying to help him. He is trying to find a piece of paper.,100
391,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am trying to find a piece of paper. We have had a lot of micro-economic reform and a lot of reform to improve productivity. We have seen productivity increase considerably. The Leader of the National Party said that the waterfront reform has stalled. We have seen a much better performance on the waterfront under this government than under previous governments, that is for sure. Productivity is improving quite strongly now. That productivity improvement is something which is helping us to maintain the faster exports of commodities. It is absurd to suggest that this goverriment is not addressing the issue of the current account. It is absolutely doing so. Part of that process is to improve national savings. This government has taken the major step towards the development of superannuation in this industry. That superannuation through the sqc is a major step forward in improving our national savings performance. The Fitzgerald report expected it to improve national savings by some two per cent in the longer term. That is a very important addition to national savings. We have said.that we will be pursuing an improved structural performance in the budget You will have to wait until the budget to see exactly what that involves. I had already given that assurance to the House earlier today at question time. I repeat it The budget will be about, in part, a structural as well as a short-term improvement in the national savings performance. We will be looking to reduce the deficit and so reduce public sector dissaving and improve national savings. That is important when investment is growing so strongly. We will also be trying to ensure that we improve the long-term structural performance on savings. That is what the nation has to do in the end if it is to bring about a major improvement in its current account performance. Obviously, the problem has developed over a long period. The structural change in the economy over the last decade or so is a key element in ensuring that we can overcome that problem and that we can grow strongly without a current account limitation. It also requires us to have that major improvement in our savings. Savings improvement will be something which we will be demonstrating that we are very much about in the forthcoming budget It is pretty rich indeed for the Leader of the Opposition to try to lead the House to believe that any government can create jobs like we have been creating them so long as it is prepared to see some increase in foreign debt That is a most amazing statement He could not do it; he could not increase employment, but he could increase foreign debt more rapidly, as Mr Warby has shown, than this government has done at any stage that it has been in office. Dr Kemp-What utter rubbish!",100
392,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is what Mr Warby said in that article. He is absolutely right In two years foreign debt went up from 11 per cent to 21 per cent of GOP when John Howard was Treasurer. That is what happened. The growth rates under us have been nothing like that John Howard is the record foreign debt increaser in the history of this nation. For him to lecture us on that subject is abundant hypocrisy.,101
393,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The House is considering a matter of public importance brought forward effectively by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). It relates to the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating): . . . to deal w'ith the disastrous current account problems after years of claiming he had the solutions in place and that the worse was over. I will deal with the matter of the drought, the matter of the national debt and matters arising from the comments of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), and I will make some comments of my own. Very sadly, we have reached a stage in this country at which the recovery is very fragile indeed. The drought is worsening. On the matter of the national debt referred to by the Treasurer: at no stage when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country was the national debt anywhere near $25 billion. It was a great deal lower. In terms of ratios, it was in a better shape. To quote from the official documentation of the government, today that national debt is $162 billion-a sixfold increase in net debt terms or in quantum terms. Whichever way you look at the economic performance of this government-to take up the Treasurer's challenge-there is one other thing which the official ABS statistics show. It is a very sad statistic. The gap between rich and poor over the 12 years of federal Labor government in Australia has got greater. They are not my figures; they are the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is at armslength from the government and even at two arms-lengths from the opposition. Those figures show that the gap between rich and poor is the true legacy of Labor. How left wing members can dare show their faces in this House and support this government in these circumstances, when they face the social inequities arising from the outcome of the Prime Minister's policies as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, is shameful. It is an awful legacy; it is one which you will pay the price for. You did pay the price for it in the Canberra by-election last Saturday. I congratulate the new member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) for taking his seat in this place. The Treasurer also referred to structural adjustment. It must be some little time since he sat down with the shippers of this nation because, whilst with the introduction of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority there was - nitially a degree of impr-vement, the truth IS that that has dropped off m the last 12 months. Shipper after shipper, freight forwarder after freight forwarder, will tell you that the ports of Australia in terms of efficienit cy are lagging behind best international practice by a country mile. We are lagging further and further behind, for example, one of our competitors in many commoditiesN-- Zealand. The taxpayers had to pay mllhons of dollars as part of an equation to bring about waterfront reform, buy-out termination packages and the like, only tfind that the situation today is worse, not better. Waterfront reform improvement existed for about five minutes. Now the sky is starting to fall in. There are several high jump bars that Australians should apply to the Prime Minister because he will never get over them. They will never believe the Prime Minister again when he says that he will bring home the bacon. They will never believe him again on the matter of taxation. They will never believe him again on the matter of interest rates. Mr Braithwaite---You can't trust him.",101
394,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And why should they? The member for Dawson says that you cannot trust him in terms of his intention. You certainly cannot trust him in terms of the output of his policies. Today's current account deficit figure confirms absolutely the senti-ents expressed by the Leader of the OppositIon when he said that with this government you get five minutes of sunshine and then the sky falls in. We all know how much that line gets up the nose of the Prime Minister. We all know how much it gets up the nose of those opposite. We all know why that is sobecause it is the absolute truth. We all know that the current account deficit problem was the reason given by the government for the last recession. Remember that one? The greatest since the Depression. We now have a current account problem again. So what do we have to look forward to? Another recession caused by higher interest rates-is that what this government has in store for us again? I hope not. The fact is that yesterday the Prime Minister said that eventually the current account deficit would decrease. How is it going to decrease? What policy prescriptions does this government have? What levers will it use to bring down the current account deficit? Again, the government is reaching, as did three times late last year, for higher interest rates. That seems to be about the Qnly lever it knows. That is why it got savaged properly in Woden Valley and elsewhere last Saturday. By the way, the truth about the New South Wales election results is that 11 federal seats held by Labor would fall to the coalition if Saturday's New South Wales voting was repeated at the federal level-and I think it will be. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you do not believe me about interest rates going up, I refer you instead to the government's own advisory bodies. The House should be aware that ABARE, the government's agricultural research economics body, has forecast that the prime business lending rate will average 11.5 per cent for farmers in the next financial year, 1995-96. Mr Anderson-But they said it was a low interest rate regime.",102
395,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Do you know what that means for farmers? That means a rate of 15 per cent once risk margins and charges are added in. In other words, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) correctly points out, the government has totally misled the Australian people with regard to the actuality of interest rates facing farmers who are facing drought at this time. It is small businesses as well as farmers, in country towns and regional centres right across Australia, who are paying through their agony at this time as a consequence of those economic policies. , I have in my hand a map showing the state of Victoria-parts of the electorates of the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). I will visit the electorate of the member for Mallee on Monday; I will be attending a mini-summit on the drought at Sealake. The Deputy Leader of the National Party will travel to Bendigo a few days later. I want to commend Tooheys for adding to the drought relief fund. It is showing very clearly that Victoria is suffering the agony of drought as we speak. Sixty per cent of New South Wales is suffering the agony of officially declared drought, as opposed to those areas on the edge, as we speak. I concede that coastal New South Wales has had good rains. There has been progress and bright prospects in some areas. I refer to the sugar industry, wine grapes this season in parts of Australia, the rice industry and the dairy industry in parts of Australia. I am the first to talk up those prospects because we need those exports; we need that confidence. What broke my heart, and the hearts of farmers and small business operators, was hearing the Prime Minister say last night that there was going to be a bounce back from the drought, as if it were already over. In the Sir John Monash Memorial Lecture last night, with regard to the current account deficit, he said, in an insensitive way, 'You'll have to put up with what I've got to say. This is what I'm going to say: there's going to be a bounce back in exports as part of drought recovery.' It was only after we prodded him today, on the floor of this House, that he eventually acknowledged that for so many the drought is not over and that for so many the drought is getting worse. If he had listened to his Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) on the matter, who warned two weeks ago that for so many the drought is not over, then we might have had a more realistic assessment from the Prime Minister-a more realistic assessment of our prospective export performance, a more realistic change, alteration and review of exceptional circumstance provisions which are denied to so many across Australia. Not one Victorian farmer has eligibility for exceptional circumstances provithe sions; many in New South Wales do not and some in Queensland do not. That criteria has to be, and is being, reviewed-again, too slow, too little, too late. On this matter of public importance, it is time for the government to account for its 12 years of disastrous economic policy and to admit the price so many thousands of Australians-in large cities and small, on the farm, so many families-have suffered under the hands of a Keating Treasurer and a Keating Prime Minister. It is time that he admitted that he has failed to bring home the bacon; that he has failed with regard to his taxation policies and his interest rate policies; that he is, in fact, a failure as Prime Minister of this country. He is one of the most arrogant and divisive prime ministers of this country and the sooner we go to the polls and he is dislodged from the Lodge the better for all our sakes. (Time expired).",102
396,Mr TANNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Melbourne) (5.17 p.m.)Australia does have a serious current account deficit problem but it is important that we do look at the issue in some detail rather than just the rhetoric that we get from the other side. The figures that were released today did contain some encouraging signs. We still do have a serious problem but they did contain encouraging signs. For example, there is a substantial increase in the percentage of m-rchandise exports. Today, Toyota Australia announced a $400 million per year contract to supply left-hand drive Camrys to six countries in the Middle East: the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. This will be 16,000 units in 1996, increasing in the following year to 20,000 units. That will allow that new plant to operate at full capacity. So there are good signs in the export area. It is also worth taking into account that there are a number of factors which are, in effect, inflating the current account deficit at the moment, the drought being the most obvious one. Other factors are: lower commodity prices, following on the recession internationally, which are starting to rise in many cases and will continue to rise; the fact that we had a bit of an expenditure burst in latter part of last year which flowed into imports, which I would see as a flow-on from the recession; and, finally, the burst of business investment which the Treasurer (Mr Willis) gave further details of in question time today. This clearly has been pushing the current account deficit a little further than it otherwise would have been, and it will gradually return to a level of equilibrium. Yes, we have a problem but the magnitude of the problem is nothing like what has been suggested by the opposition. It needs to be put into some serious context. The context is nearly six per cent economic growth. There has been rapid employment growth, with 500,000 jobs having been created since the government was re-elected in 1993, a year ahead of the target that we set and which many ridiculed as simply impossible. There has been a 40 per cent increase in competitiveness since the government was first elected in 1983 and a 24 per cent increase in business investment. Real incomes have risen; irrespective of the sort of stuff that is said some on the opposition benches, it is a fact. Low inflation has been sustained. The Australian dollar is still reasonably stable in the middle to low US70c range. There is clear evidence of structural economic change. This latest information, with respectto the contract signed by Toyota with countries in the Middle East, is yet another very good example of that. The latest example is the car industry, which the opposition would have removed all assistance from as a result of its Fightback package and let go to the wall-a car industry that is proving that it can both produce well and export. Yes, we do have economic problems. But, looking at the total picture, we have economic problems that most Western governments would kill for by comparison with the sorts of difficulties they face with their levels of foreign debt, budget deficit, unemployment, inflation, interest rates and the like. In the total picture, we are outperforming virtually all other Western governments. What is the opposition's position? All it is able to do is grab the latest set of economic statistics, look for a bad one, pull that out wave it about. All members of the opposition are able to do is grab the latest set of economic statistics and bleat about one bad figure. No analysis. No policy. Nothing is asked of them. What will they rule out? Will they rule out any interest rate increases should they become a government? What is their policy on savings? Do we have any policy from them about Australia's savings? Not one word! What will you do? What is your position on all of these issues? Where is your strategy? Let us hear some of it instead of the populist rantings that we get time after time.",103
397,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member should direct his remarks through the chair.,104
398,Mr TANNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was using the term 'you' generally, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I take the point. Populism has its place and we are all guilty of it, to a degree, from time to time. But this is the party of John Hewson. This is by the party of economic credibility. This is the party of serious policy. This is the party of Fightback. Where are they now? Where are their policies now? Where is the substance now? Their position is: 'We support lower interest rates.' Their position is: 'We support lower taxes.' Their position is: 'Oh, no, we don't support any specific cuts in government expenditure. In fact, we can probably dream up a few additional items of expenditure'including such nonsense as pensions for everybody at an additional cost of $5 billion. At the same time as all this, they are going to cut the current account deficit by some sort of . magical process. Something very strange is going on over the other side, Mr Deputy Speaker. You might have noticed that today, when the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), walked in, he looked a little bit taller. There was a distinct pout in the lips, the bum was sticking out a bit more, the chest was sticking out a bit more and there was a little bit of a blue tinge in the hair. Do you know what is going on? The opposition leader is turning into Andrew Peacock. John Boward and is turning into Andrew Peacock! The great problem for the Liberals is that the legacy of Andrew Peacock",104
399,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne should call members by their correct titles.,105
400,Mr TANNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"My apologies-the opposition leader is turning into the former member for Kooyong. The Liberal Party has had the former member for Kooyong's legacy hanging around its neck throughout the 1980s and now the 1990s even when he was not the leader. In 1987 he flirted with the Joh for Canberra campaign to help undermine the campaign by the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). In 1993 the Liberals decided to stay away from Andrew Peacock and, for a change, have a serious policy, but then they ran an Andrew Peacock election campaign and they lost. Now we have the hard man of the New Right, the member for Bennelong, coming along. What is he doing? He is turning into a souffle. He is becoming Andrew Peacock. Now we hear, 'There will be no big bang on industrial relations'; 'We'll retain Medicare'; 'Bulk-billing-that's okay,'; 'Asians? They're okay now.' I have no doubt the honourable member for Bennelong will be seen in every Chinese restaurant in Australia between now and the next election, but that will not fool anybody. 'The monarchy and the republic? We'll have a think about those sorts of things.' 'Oh, we didn't really support the third runway.' 'The land fund? No, we weren't really opposed to that sort of stuff.' 'Yes, we're tolerant conservatives.' Nobody will be fooled by that sort of stuff at allnobody. Here we have the champion of the New Right, the self-styled most conservative leader that the Liberal Party has ever had. What is he doing? Running away and hiding from every policy debate that is before this nation. He cannot run and hide forever because he is a man of the past, he is a man with a past and he is a man whose time has passed. On this issue he is a man with a past-like on every other issue. As was pointed out earlier in this debate, when he was last in office as Treasurer our current account deficit was about 5Y:! per cent of GDP-roughly the same as it is now. Where is the distinction? What is the difference? The difference is this: there was 10 per cent plus unemployment; 10 per cent plus inflation; business investment was dying; and interest rates were substantially higher than they are now. The total picture-and this is the emphasis that I place in this debate-was dramatically different from the total picture that we have now. It is relevant to make these comparisons. It is true that a fair amount of time has gone by since then: Nonetheless, these comparisons are relevant. When he was in charge he had a current account deficit as bad as the contemporary current account deficit. But where were all the other good economic indicators that this government has been able to deliver? Where were the sorts of economic indicators that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) sneers at? Like the 500,000 new jobs that have been created. Like the prolonged low inflation. Where were those economic indicators in the early 1980s? We have a leader who has turned himself into a policy fraud. The honourable member for Bennelong had some integrity in the 1980s because he stood for a hard right position, he articulated it and he kicked some heads in his party in order to do so-one of the reasons why the honourable member for Goldstein is here and not his predecessor. But now he is running away from it and descending into pure, populist nonsense and today was a very good example of precisely that. Instead of engaging in the substance of the debate, instead of looking at the detailed factors of our current account deficit problem, it is pure, unadulterated populism. No serious economic analysis. Unlike his counterpart in Victoria, Jeff Kennett, when the election is called he will not be able to get away with going to the electorate with no policies. The member for Bennelong will not be able to get away with just simply presenting himself and saying, 'Australia's got problems, and here I am. Aren't I wonderful? Please vote for me.' That will not happen. When his policies are open to scrutiny he will be in trouble because not only will people have a track record to judge him by but they will have the real policies-what the Liberal Party really stands for-to look at. So, when looking at the current account deficit problem, yes, it is a problem. But you have to look at the total picture. You also have to look at short-term factors that are exacerbating the problem and that will alter. You have to look at the track record of the people opposite and see how much credibility they have in dealing with this issue. The answer is: not very much at all. To the extent that they had any credibility at all, it is rapidly dwindling as a result of the stance that they are taking.",105

404,Mr LINDSAY,TARIFF PROPOSAL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (5.33 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1995. The tariff proposal which I have just tabled contains an alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1995) formally places before parliament, as required by law, a tariff alteration made by notice published in the Gazette during recent recess of parliament. The alteration operative on and from 17 March 1995. Following the government's acceptance 1991 of recommendations contained in IndusOf try Commission report No.9 on the commerhave cial tariff concession and by-law systems, terms of item 31 in schedule 4 were revised. This concessional item allows the duty-free importation of aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft, with the exception of goods used for the servicing of aircraft. By a broad application of the current conditions, it has been possible to import, duty free, most goods used in aircraft. The government has now decided to restrict the coverage of this item by excluding textiles and goods made of textiles for use on aircraft. This initiative will remove the competitive advantage previously accorded imported ing goods over locally sourced goods. It will also encourage the use of Australian raw textile materials. A summary of the alteration conyou tained in this proposal has been prepared is being circulated for the information honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adthe journed. NA (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",106
405,Mr MCGAURAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Before interruption of the debate, I was speaking about the major contribution to the Northern Territory and Australian econoin mies that the mining sector makes, and how this benefits Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Consequently, the question of access to land for exploration is one that concern all Australians. In this context, it instructive to review the status of exploration licences over Aboriginal freehold land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Terrihesitant tory) Act 1976. As of 31 January this year, the Northern the Territory minister had given consent for is applicants to commence negotiations on 606 exploration licence applications since the proin clamation of the Commonwealth act in 1976. the 606 licence applications, a total of 51 been granted under the Northern Territhe tory Mining Act. A further 14 have received approval by the relevant land council and the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and are awaiting grant. As well, 157 proposals for exploration have been vetoed, leaving 211 currently considered by the land councils. I do not dispute for a moment that many of these applications will have had complex implications and that their consideration and negotiation are no doubt subject to unforeseen delays and difficulties. But, with only 8.4 per cent of exploration proposals granted, one has to at least question whether the act is providAborigines and other Australians with the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of mining ventures. This is especially so when consider the high risk and low rate of and successful commercial discoveries from of mineral exploration. As I said earlier in the debate, the 1987 amendments to the act were intended to ease situation of land access for mineral exploration by removing the right of Aboriginal owners to veto mining if they previously agreed to exploration and by imposing time limits on the decision process. Unfortunately, there is significant doubt as to whether these amendments actually benefit any of the groups involved in the process. On the surface, the amendments seem to provide more for mining interests in that they have a clear decision time frame and are not faced with the possibility of having invested heavily exploration only to find the mining denied. The traditional owners have to make a decision to allow exploration and mining before the results are known. At times this will makes revenue, employment benefits and is disadvantages from mining very difficult to accurately quantify-sometimes impossible. Traditional owners will tend to be more to allow exploration on their land, resulting in fewer and more complex agreements. There are undoubtedly cases where a less constrained negotiation would have resulted in an agreement and the benefits of mining accrue to all parties. The opportunity to go the extra mile and reach a negotiated outcome beneficial to both parties is vital to the goal of Aboriginal economic independence and a healthy resources industry. In 1991, the Industry Commission commented: Negotiations without artificial extemal constraints would seem far more likely to result in mutually satisfactory agreements which adequately address the main concems of both Aborigines and those of developers. To my mind, there is no question that negotiation is the key to unlocking the benefits of mineral wealth for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. There is a vital need for greater freedom for negotiation between the traditional owners of land in the Northern Territory and mining interests. In advocating this, I am not suggesting that the powers of traditional owners of land in the Northern Territory to determine their future and the future of their land should be weakened. The Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments have a duty of care to ensure that such negotiations are effective, fairly conducted and of benefit to all parties directly involved as well as to the wider community. To achieve this goal, it is imperative that all parties have as clear an understanding as possible of the implications of their actions and any agreement that may be reached. In the last few years, the power of negotiation and communication to cut through decades of mistrust has been impressive. For example, in 1993 the mining company Zapopan and the Jawoyn Association reached agreement over native title issues for the proposed $100 million Mount Todd golct,m-e, which is 50 kilometres north of Kathenne 10 the Northern Territory. The successful conclusion of the negotiation process provides an important model for resolving other issues of this nature and followed a lengthy history of claims around the site. In 1978, a traditional land claim was lodged on land in and around Katherine by the Jawoyn. When the land commissioner presented a report on the claim in 1987, the area of the Mount Todd mine was specifically excluded from the grant of land. Shortly after that report, two repeat land claims, which included the Mount Todd area, were lodged. Following the Mabo decision in 1992, Zapopan sought legal opinion on the effect .of the decision on the proposed mine, recogmsing the possibility of further native title claims to the area: Theri, in November 1992, ongoing discussions between the company and the Jawoyn Association, which had been primarily concerned with employment and contract opportunities, became focused on the issue of land rights. With legal advice that a repeat land claim would fail and that there was a limited chance of success for a native title claim, Zapopan chose not to pursue its interests aggressively but, instead, to seek a resolution through negotiation and discussion with the Jawoyn Association. The Mount Todd result was truly a win-win situation for all concerned. It is worth commenting that the issue bf land rights and native title was resolved in only three months of discussion between the parties, which compares very unfavourably with the delays experienced under the Aboriginal Lan? Ri-ts (Northern Territory) Act and the NatIve Title Act. I have no doubt that outcomes, such as those of the Mount Todd negotiations, have resulted from an increased awareness by developers of the importance of issues of native title and Aboriginal advancement, while Aborigines see the economic and social benefits of employment, infrastructure and income that result from successful mining ventures. One very pertinent issue associated with the successful Mount Todd agreement is the topic of representation of the traditional ow-ers of land in negotiation with mining comparues. At present, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act requires negotiation to be conducted through the appropriate lancouncil. In recent times, a number of tradItional owners have queried the activities of the land councils in representing their interests. While I do not want to pursue it at this time by detailing their claims, I note the difficulty of effective negotiation occurring when there is disagreement of this nature. It is heartening to see the progress made by the mining committee of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in achieving mutual understanding of the position of miners and Aborigines on mining matters. As a result, a new committee-the Joint Council on Aboriginal Land and Mining-is to be established. A further significant development in this regard has been the decision by Aboriginal groups to join the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines. The Jawoyn Association joined the chamber last year and, recently, Yirrkala Business Enterprises and the Gagadju Contracting Company became members. I look forward to further developments such as these in fmding the common ground for Aborigines, miners and the community to benefit from mining on Aboriginal land. (Time expired)",107
406,Ms HENZELL,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Capricornia) (5.44 p.m.)I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994. The explanatory memorandum states: The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred 1993. to in Schedule 1 to the Act may be granted to Aboriginal Land Trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the Act came into operation in 1977 a total of 58 separate parcels have been scheduled under the Act. The amendment arises from a settlement agreement reached between the Northern Territory Governlegislation ment, the claimants to the Hodgson Downs Land Claim (No. 139) and the Northern Land Council. This agreement includes a clause in which Northern Territory Government agrees to request the Commonwealth to effect the grant of an estate in fee simple in the land which was the subject the Land Claim. I will pass over the less than appropriate comments that the preceding speaker in the debate, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), made after question time today, but I will look with interest at the Hansard. I do, however, note the comments he made in this debate on successful negotiaRights tions between Aboriginal communities and mining companies, although I doubt strongly that, had we not put the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 into place, we would still be a very long way off having any sort of effective recognition of the rights of Aboriginal people. We certainly would not have had it from the opposition members in this parliament. This issue has a very long history. A couple of weeks ago the High Court upheld the Mabo decision over a claim by the Western Australian government. In fact, the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) was visiting my electorate when that news came through. Then there was the presentation to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of two significant reports. The first was a report by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation titled Going forward: social justice for the first Australians. The second, titled Recognition, Rights & Reform: a report to the government on native title social justice measures, was presented to the Prime Minister here at Parliament House on 27 March by the Chair of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue. We have also seen the conclusion to a number of consultative processes that have been endorsed by this government and which precede the native title legislation that was passed in this House at the end of I have said previously, and I repeat, I anticipate being in this House for a lengthy of land period-well past the next election-and, I dare say, will be participating in a number of important pieces of legislation. But there is no of which I would feel more proud to have been associated with and to vote for than the native title legislation that this House the endorsed, and which was passed, after much recrimination, in the Senate towards the end of of 1993. I believe history will indicate that what the government did on that occasion was very important. More recently we have seen the passing of the second part of our commitment to justice for Aboriginal people-the land fund bill. The social justice measures we are now considering, which are pertinent to the Recognition, & Reform report, are also part of our continuing commitment to Aboriginal and very Torres Strait Islander people. When the Prime Minister received that report from Ms O'Donoghue on Monday of this week, he said that what pleased him most about receiving the report was: ... the fact that we are seeing the public manifestation of the esteem that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold for themselves, have always held for themselves, but which in other times when that sense of justice and sense of decency in the country has not focussed on their concerns such a report like this would never have appeared. Then, referring to the Native Title Bill and the land fund bill, he said: It was a great victory for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and for social democracy in this country when the High Court held its validity-seven judges to nothing-a· couple of weeks ago. And then on its heels, of course, we bailed up the opposition with their manipulative approach in the Senate to try to destroy the integrity of the Land Fund Bill and despite the Leader of the Opposition's cockiness when faced with the prospect of an early polland, I might say, a double dissolutionhe caved in and passed it. So, we got the double the century in a week. Seven to zero on native title and the Land Fund Bill. These were very important landmarks. The Prime Minister further commented in his speech that there have been many people advising him to get back to the mainstream issues, the real game of interest rates and economy, as if we had left them. We are not like President Ford. We can walk and chew gum and do a few other things all at the same time. While the Prime Minister has committed himself to the issues of great concern to not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country but also the whole community, and which affect our international reputation on these issues, at the same time he has presided over a government-as it was shown earlier in the MPI debate-that has produced 560,000 new jobs in less than two years. This government has produced the best productivity this country has had for a long time, and the lowest inflation and interest rates compared with the previous Liberal government. It is very important to make this point to the wider community. It is absolutely vital that the Australian people understand the importance of social justice for Aboriginal people. I want to acknowledge the contribution of the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), because he was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs during the time of the development of this land rights legislation for the Northern Territory--one of our earlier commitments. While there may be many differing comments that one hears in the electorates and various communities around the countrycriticisms of what we as a government have done on Aboriginal land rights-there is a prevailing sense of justice and fair play in the Australian psyche which acknowledges the importance of these measures if we are to go forward as a nation and if we are not to deny our past, the injustices of the past and the injustices of the present day. This legislation is part of that. . I will now take the House back a little to 1988. It is always helpful to see how far we of have come in terms of where we were at the time. In an earlier speech on the land fund bill, I mentioned the issue of the motion that was aimed to be presented to the opening of the new parliament. Honourable members may well recall that we were unable to get bipartisan support because the church leaders the had actually suggested a form of words that would relate to the issue of social justice for Aboriginal people. The resolution, after much consultation with the opposition at the time, stated: That the House of Representatives/Senate1. acknowledge that: (a) Australia was occupied by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who had settled for thousands of years before British settlement at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788; (b) Aborigines and Torre- Strait Islanders s--­ fered dispossession and dIspersal upon acqUIsItion of their traditional lands by the British Crown; and (c) Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders were denied full citizenship rights of the Commonwealth of Australia prior to the 1967 referendum; and 2. affirms: , (a) the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage; and (b) the entitlement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to self-management and self determination subjectto the Constitution and the Laws of the Commonwealth of Australia; and 3. considers it to be desirable that the Commonwealth further promote reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens providing recognition of their special place in the Commonwealth of Australia. Although this motion had already been modified to accommodate opposition concernsthat is, references to legal recognition of land rights and to the desirability of a compact were dropped-the joint party meeting of the opposition on the morning of the debate endorsed supporting the motion only if the entitlement of self-determination already qualified by the words 'subject to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth' wer<;.l further qualified by the words 'in common with all other Australians'. Father Frank Brennan said in his book Self-determination for Aborigines-limits and powers of November 1991: At best, the proposed amendment was amb-gu?us suggesting that the entitlement to self-determmatlOn was universal but exercisable discretely by separate groups. At worse, it was ruthlessly assimilationist suggesting that self-determination could be exercised only collectively by all Australians ... The amendment was not accepted and the opposition did not support the motion. Unfortunately, time and time again in debates in this House we have heard much of the same from members of the opposition on all the great social issues regarding justice for Aboriginal people. They have had to be dragged-to coin a phrase-kicking and screaming towards the issue. That is a great shame. Let us go back to another moment in 1988 when, at the Barunga festival in the Northern Territory, the Barunga staterhentwas read and some of its items adopted by the then Prime Minister. I have made no secret of the fact that one of the legacies of the previous administration was that we did not fulfil our commitments to Aboriginal people. But the position in that statement is telling becau-- of the things we have resolved and the posItIon we are at now. The other thing it does is exemplify the fact that Aboriginal people, because they have occupied this land for thousands of years more than our miserable 200, have never lost sight of their claim of ownership to the land, their cultural and spiritual identification with the land and their resolution to maintain that in spite of all that has been inflicted upon them. I feel the Barunga statement is worth reminding ourselves of. It states: We, the indigenous owners and occupiers of Australia, call on the Australian Government and people to recognise our rights: To self-determination and self-management, including the freedom to pursue our own economic, social, religious and cultural development; To permanent control and enjoyment of our ancestral lands; To compensation for the loss of use of our lands, there having been no extinction of original title; To protection of and control of access to our sacred sites, sacred objects, artefacts, designs, knowledge and works of art; To the return of the remains of our ancestors for burial in accordance with our traditions; To respect for and promotion of our Aboriginal identity, including the cultural, linguistic, religious and historical aspects, and including the right to be educated in our own languages and in our own culture and history. . The statement then. goes on to point out·the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various international covenants. It goes on: We call on the Commonwealth to pass laws providing: A national elected Aboriginal and Islander organisation to oversee Aboriginal and Islander affairs; A national system of land rights; A police and justice system which recognises our customary laws and frees us from discrimination and any activity which may threaten our identity or security, interfere with our freedom of expression or association, or otherwise prevent our full enjoyment and exercise of universally-recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms. We have not achieved all of that; there is no doubt about that. But it is helpful to know that this government, particularly under the leadership of the Prime Minister, has been determined to deal with the issues raised in the Barunga statement. I will now read from the up-to-date report Recognition Rights & Reform. It states: This report is about recognition, rights and reform. It is about recognition of the unique place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australian history and society today. It is aboutthe rights of Australia's indigenous peoples. It is about the further reforms necessary to secure and underpin those rights and to ensure they can be exercised and enjoyed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It further states: Our focus is on institutional, structural, collaborative, cooperative reform. It is about a fundamental shift from welfare to basic rights, from dependence to autonomy, from government assistance to power. Central to the social justice agenda is self nation. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have never wavered from where they knew their rights should be, in spite of all that dispossession has inflicted upon them. We now have a considerable responsibility to put in place those institutional arrangements which, in spite of all our efforts, have never been met by state governments. This fact was picked up by the Northern Territory Central Land Council back in 1991 when ATSIC was being developed in response to the Barunga statement. The Central Land Council report on the infrastructure provision in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, August 1991, on pages 116 to 117, states: Despite the success of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act making it possible for Aboriginal people to regain control of their traditional lands, NT Government opposition to land claims and the existence of guidelines which prevent the delivery of services to small remote communities, limit the extent to which access to land can achieve meaningful improvements in the living standards of remote Aboriginal people ... if health conditions, in particular, show no ment because of poor water supplies, for example, then the ability of the community to take control of its own affairs will be seriously weakened. The government's focus now will be to try to right the wrongs, having given rights and access to land through the High Court Mabo decision on native title and the land fund bill in spite of opposition from those opposite and a lack of leadership from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). The opposition leader has shown a disastrous inability to come to terms with a position of moral integrity on Aboriginal land rights. We saw an example of that most recently in the Hindmarsh Island debacle. He sat on his hands knowing full well that his then shadow minister for the environment, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), had perpetrated many wrongs in his misuse and misappropriation of those documents. The opposition leader came into this House with the current opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), and sat on his hands and did nothing. He did not show any leadership. He did not determi- sack his front-bench person. Finally, when public furore forced the resignation of the opposition spokesperson for the environment, the Leader of the Opposition said he was an honourable man. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello) has said, 'We must have him back in the shadow ministry because we cannot afford to lose his talent and ability.' Unfortunately, this is the sort of moral integrity that we always get from the Liberal National Party coalition in spite of the several good people on the opposition benchesusually on the back benches-who have the best interests of Aboriginal people at heart. There is only one government that will work with the Aboriginal people to get to the future: a Labor government. The Aboriginal people know it and the media know it. On any assessment of the debate, we have always given moral leadership and effective legislative leadership. This amendment is further evidence of that. We will not leave Aboriginal people behind. We will make sure that they get their justice, infrastructure and enough support to make land rights work for them in improve- the Northern Territory and elsewhere.",109
407,Mr WAKELIN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.2) because the Aboriginal lands are of great interest to me, in particular because my electorate contains the Pitjantjatjara and Maralinga Tjarutja lands. Furth-r, I spent a significant amount of my early life in the Northern Territory working on various pastoral properties and enjoying the tropical way of life in Darwin. Various members of my family are still spread in that fine state. I have a continuing and abiding interest in that part of the world. As some preliminary comments, I would like to try to put a regional Australian's point of view on Aboriginal matters. We must be very careful that we do not get caught up too much in our own rhetoric. We must be very honourable in the way that we conduct our affairs regarding the original inhabitants of this fine country of ours, because I have a feeling that too many times in the parliament Aboriginal people have been exploited for political purposes. At a time in our history when we must aim for a cooperative and integrated society based on non-racial grounds, we must be very careful that we bring the whole country with us in any reforms or any changes that we make. In speaking as a regional Australian, I would like to remind the House that Aboriginal people inhabited every square kilometre of this land. Yet, in the native title issue, we find that it is only ever regional Australia gets caught up in the practical detail. We do know that only five per cent of Aboriginal people-if, indeed, five per cent are fortunate enough-will have an opportunity to access land through the native title legislation. We also need to look at the white people who live in regional Australia because, there again, we have a minority group. There are perhaps 10 per cent or five per cent of white people living in regional Australia who will be in any way affected by the issues of land. In the case of the Northern Territory, we know that 40 per cent of the land mass-like the 30 per cent of my own electorate, which effectively is 30 per cent of South Australiais controlled by Aboriginal people. Any decisions made by high courts or parliaments of Australia-and, indeed, any judgments that are made by the majority of our peopleimpact disproportionately on regional Australia. I do not think that that fact is acknowledged. I was fortunate enough this morning to spend a bit of time with Justice French, a name familiar to many of us now and certainly to all of us in this House. When asked in a perfectly friendly and cordial meeting how many native title claims had been put forward, he said he thought that about 60 had been put forward and 35 had been accepted by the tribunal, but none had been finalisedthat is, none had finally come to fruition and been accepted as native title leases. So the grand vision that sometimes plays a little too much on the lounge rooms of our capital cities and a little too often on the urban comfort zone, and which a little too often exploits Aboriginal people, is a process which almost totally ignores regional Australia and most of its inhabitants. As someone who has lived in regional Australia all his life, I feel very acutely that it is too easy for white Australia simply to pass Aboriginal issues back to regional Australia. I welcome the opportunity to put those preliminary comments on the record. If we are going to genuinely live together in this country in harmony and on a non-racial basis, where we are all accepted as equal, we must acknowledge that regional Australia is carrythat ing a disproportionate share of the burden. This bill seeks to add another parcel of land to the Northern Land Council at the request of the Northern Territory government. It is a considerable piece of land and is already owned by the Aboriginal community. With the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act 1991, the Pitjantjatjara lands that I mentioned earlier were returned to the Aboriginal people during the Fraser government years, at the initiative of the state Tonkin Liberal government. The Pitjantjatjara lands, as I indicated earlier, cover about 15 per cent of South Australia, from the Western Australian and Northern Territory border down to Marla at the top of the Maralinga lands, taking in numerous distinct communities, including Pukutja, Umuwa, Mimili and Fregon. The Maralinga Tjarutja takes in a similar amount of country. It has been my pleasure to visit these lands on many occasions and it has proved a very interesting and educational experience. I am proud to be well acquainted with many Aboriginal people living and working in these areas. One of my particular interests concerns those people struggling to make a living from the land there. The land is harsh and dry but can sustain significant pastoral pursuits and other industries. There are many teachers, health workers and other professionals based in these lands. I have enormous respect for their dedication. The disturbing aspect of the Pitjantjatjara lands is that the Aboriginal communities living there continue to live in what are considered Third World conditions. Basic health care and cleanliness are still major problems. Earlier I mentioned that regional Australia is carrying a disproportionate share of the burden. In my work with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I visited a significant regional community in Western Australia. I would like to counsel a note of caution before we get into Commonwealthstate divides and too much political acrimony is engendered in the debate. This committee, when visiting the west, went to a local goyernment area, or shire, as it is known there, which has about a 50 per cent Aboriginal population base. About 90 per cent of the intake of the district hospital Aboriginal. There is a 50 percent Aboriginal population base but a 90 per cent Aboriginal involvement as clients in the hospital. whole range of issues flows from that, but main point I would like to make now is that the state is at the front line of providing that service. It is no good-no good at all-for Commonwealth to engage in constant carping criticism of the states when the states expected to pick up a disproportionate share of the burden. We need to look at the task, break down the boundaries-whether ciently Commonwealth, state, local or Aboriginalthere and see how we can best cooperate. whole debate has a long way to go. Despite the fact that the federal government believes that returning land to Aboriginal communities will somehow solve their probwhat lems, we can see from the example of the Pitjantjatjara experience that hind alone is a solution. The Maralinga Tjarutja lands provide their own unique story because of the British nuclear testing that took place there the 1950s and 1960s. I visited Maralinga last month with the parliamentary Public Works committee to assess the first stages of the clean-out process. That is in 1990s terms. Of course, there have been significant clean-up operations since the tests of the 1950s and 1960s. This is, hopefully, the finalisation of that process. The British government has acknowledged that it has a responsibility for the effects its testing had on the area. It has made an ex gratia payment in recent times, and that agreement is to be welcomed, but the effects which the testing had on the Aboriginal communities of that region can never be fully redressed. We can only look to the future and help the traditional communities take control of that land again. The Pitjantjatjara and Maralinga lands in Grey are not dissimilar to the lands of the Northern Territory in administration and in scale. Both these large parcels of land are owned by Aboriginal people. Unfortunately they have not always had a happy past but, hopefully, they will have a much happier future. My underlying concern with Aboriginal is lands is that the communities that live there must be given every fair opportunity to develop the land and to genuinely take control A of their own lives. There are, no doubt, the hundreds of reasons why this has not taken place to any significant degree in the Pitjantjatjara lands and the Maralinga Tjarutja lands. the Some of these go right back to the root problems of European habitation of our are country, urban paternalism and, as I have mentioned already, the inability of the Commonwealth and the states to focus suffiwell on the issue. Sadly, too often, is also too much political exploitation of The the Aboriginal issue. I come back to the Pitjantjatjara lands. There are fundamental differences between what the Aboriginal community wants and the government bureaucracy delivers. Many homes were built on the lands. Hownot ever, a lot of the homes that I have seen have been destroyed or vandalised or are uninhabited. While there have been numerous calls for in greater spending on Aboriginal housing, we must first ask ourselves why past housing in areas such as the Pitjantjatjara lands was destroyed or was inappropriate. Some good work has been done but we must apply the research in a very practical way. In speaking to people on the housing issue, I know that the housing provided was not exactly what the Aboriginal people wanted. There is still plenty of room for much improved communication in planning those homes. I offer this example. Many traditional Aboriginal people like to sleep outdoors. When some of the homes were built, families found they preferred to sleep on the front porch. However, the front porch, if there was one, was not always located on the right side of the house. For example, it may have faced the hot sun. This is one example of homes not being suitable for the Aboriginal way of living. It needs to be reinforced time and time again that practical solutions do exist and that it is for all of us, to the best of our ability, make sure that we apply those practical solutions. It is extremely important that, before the government goes gung-ho into handing out funding, Aboriginal communities are consulted from the outset and asked exactly what they want. I believe the failure to do this is one of the reasons we have seen very little improvement in certain areas from the millions the government has spent. There are those who will say that the situation in some areas has grown worse over the years. I am insufficiently knowledgeable to be able to judge because I have been in this office for only two years and it would be too arrogant of me to make a judgment as to whether it is better or worse. I know that there is much to be done. The issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody is well documented, and that in itself has been investigated. Being a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs gives me a better understanding from my perspective. While governments are willing to provide funding, they are not always willing to go that one step further to ensure the best management support. A number of people in my electorate have raised the subject of Aboriginal funding, including members of the Aboriginal community. They are the people that I am most keen to listen to. There is a deep concern that certain people are keeping tight control over funds, and from time to time there is rorting. The more important part about some of the side issues-we have to keep focusing on the core issue; that is, improving the lot and making sure that we spend our money well-is that we recognise that in a country as wealthy as ours funding will always be limited. As people working and living in the lands say to me, 'We cannot waste money, scarce resources, we have to target them in the most appropriate way.' .I will not dwell on the recent issue of ATSIC and the Ombudsman, but we should not be too frightened to make sure that accountability is in our mind, particularly in the commercial operations-and to I think this is improving over the years-and we should apply strong accountability in the expenditure of the financial resources available. In conclusion, while this bill proposes a non-contentious amendment, because all relevant parties are in agreement that the parcel of land near Katherine should be granted to the traditional owners, this is an opportunity to reflect on the issue of land and its relevance to improving other aspects of the Aboriginal community's lives. It is obvious that we still have a long way to go. It is important that the federal government-and I speak most sincerely from a regional Australian's perspective and as someone that I hope has a practical application in lifedoes not dwell too long on the grand statement. It is important that we do not dwell too long on the political rhetoric but that we get down to it and look at the issues in a practical way; that we do not exploit these Aboriginal people for political purposes but genuinely work in partnership with them. We have the wit and the capacity in this nation to do that. We will be judged in the generations ahead for the way that we have been able to cooperate, the bipartisan way in which we have been able to address the issue, and the way that we have been able to acknowledge that those of us who live in regional Australia, and I keep coming back to that, do bear the very significant-I will not say 'burden', because for me it is a privilege to know the Aboriginal people-practical consequences of the management of many of these issues. I urge the government to recognise that there is a willingness in the community to apply in a practical way solutions, support and a genuine recognition of the fair go, and I am sure that if we do apply ourselves appropriately we will make. progress.",112
408,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (6.23 p.m.)-I am very pleased to be able to contribute to the debate this evening es . an amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, and in particular deals with the scheduling of land under the act and recognises the ownership of Hodgson Downs as a result of a land claim process by the people there, having purchased the property some time earlier.. . I address my remarks to the question of Hodgson Downs because it is important that we understand the significance of this particutheir lar block of land for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory which, of course, is in my electorate. The first thing that should be is that Hodgson Downs is an extremely important ritual centre for the whole of the Roper River area. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Northern Territory, that an extensive area of country to the east and south-east of Katherine in the Northern Territory. The dreamings that pass through the property make it very important for the whole of the Northern Territory. In cultural terms, in sacred terms for Aboriginal people, it is of primary importance. The dreamings were recorded in the early days and have maintained their importance through the years of settlement, and indeed some might say theft, of Aboriginal land by non-indigenous Australians in the past. Sadly, a number of the people who were very well known as ritual leaders, both women and men, have died between the preparation of the claim and the negotiations which settled it. Unfortunately, that seems often to be the case. There are and there have been claims outstanding in the Northern Territory for over a decade primarily-not in this case, but in most cases-as a result of the resistance of the Northern Territory government to the rights of Aboriginal people under the land rights act. What they have done is try to frustrate any attempts by Aboriginal people to obtain land under the act continually, which has often meant that primary claimants-principal claimants-have passed away during the period from the lodgement of the claims and the claim being finally settled. That is sad and an indictment on the CLP government of the which address- Northern Territory. In this instance some of the people who died were members of the Roberts and Farrell families. Sir Philip Roberts and Silas Roberts are two of the well-known people associated with the lease who have passed on. Both of these men were very significant individuals in the Northern Territory, whether in the context of Aboriginal society or non-Aboriginal society. Both men are immensely important in own right with standing across the community. In this particular instance, the Northern said Territory government cooperated in the settlement of the claim. I am not exactly sure of the number of times that the Northern Territory government has taken challenges to is land claims either to the Federal Court or the full bench of the High Court, but it is in excess of 30 and it has not won very manyless than five. It is an important precedent that the CLP in this instance has cooperated with the settlement of the claim. I acknowledge that approach by it. But I would not get too carried away with it, and I will explain why in a moment. Hodgson Downs was purchased as a pastoral lease and then claimed by Aboriginal claimants. As a result of the claim process it became Aboriginal land under the land rights act, tQus our amendment this afternoon. What is significant is that Hodgson Downs has not operated as a pastoral lease since the 1960s. That in itself is important, and I will come to that in a moment. Why it is important is that there can be no argument by opponents to land rights, some very conservative vested interests in small sections of the pastoral industry. That the granting of this lease will have a negative effect on the Northern Territory cattle industry is clearly, patently, untrue. The great importance of this amendment today is that the strength of the spiritual attachment to the land has been recognised and respected in the legislation. That respect was incorporated in the legislation, which significantly was prepared initially by the Whitlam government and subsequently, although amended by the Fraser government, put into force by a conservative coalition government in this country. The Fraser government needs to be congratulated for having the foresight to carryon the work of the Whitlam government to pass this piece of legislation, which was based on recommendations of Justice Woodward in his royal commission report. For those on the opposition benches who have reservations about the importance of Aboriginal land and how it should be dealt with, I commend to them their reading of that report. I have already alluded to the CLP government in the Northern Territory to the land rights act and to the practice of Aboriginal people purchasing pastoral leases and, in some cases, seeking to convert them to inalienable freehold title under the land rights act. I think we as a nation need to be concerned that, despite the very many good words I have heard this afternoon from opposition members in this place, there are conservative political leaders in this country who do not share the views expressed by the opposition and who have sought to disparage in the most insulting way the efforts of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to acquire land and then transfer its title. A disingenuous concern has been expressed by the Northern Territory government about the ability and desire of Aboriginal people to purchase pastoral leases. Indeed, in his address to the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, which was put out in a press release on 6 May 1994 in the lead-up to the Northern Territory election, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory stated: Depending how you are situated, there seems to be good times and bad times for the cattle industry. Note this particular point: [I]f you're in Central Australia and you haven't recovered from the drought, or are surrounded by properties that have been taken over by Aboriginal interests, it's hard to find a silver lining. He further states: Now for more bad news. We've heard on the grapevine of a push for Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account reserves of around twenty million dollars to be used to buy up pastoral properties [for Aboriginal people]. I, as a non-Aboriginal Australian, as a Northern Territory citizen, as a citizen of this country, am concerned at those sorts of views being expressed by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. When discussing the issue of social justice in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on Tuesday, 10 May 1994, and when referring to issues relating to the provision of services to meet the disadvantage of Aboriginal people in this country, the Chief Minister said: Is it social justice that provides benefits to sonie based on racial ancestry which others pay for but attitude of the are not entitled to? That is the attitude of the Northern Territory Chief Minister-an attitude which, frankly, I regard as racist; an attitude which 'is replicated in his state'ments time and again about the issue of land rights. That attitude is not shared by some of our opponents here- I was delighted this afternoon to hear the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), when referring to· this land rights legislation, which was passed after development by the Whitlam and Fraser governments-and they deserve due credit for it-say that the Liberal Party is proud and justifiably so of it. His pride, his satisfaction, his endorsement-and I hope the endorsement of the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus)-are not shared by the CLP or by Marshall Perron. I will read what the Northern Territory Chief Minister said about the land rights act. I ask the shadow minister to take note of this.  There should not be one law for one group of people and a completely different one for others. He said that his government would be 'vigorously pursuing' the right of territorians to be equal with the rest of Australia when it came to land rights. The Northern Territory government has made it very clear that it does not support the key aspect of this legislation, which is the right of Aboriginal people to withhold consent for development on their land. That is the key aspect or centrepiece in terms of Aboriginal control. An article in the Australian of 10 May 1994 states: The Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Mr Perron, yesterday challenged the validity of sections of the federal Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act and in particular Aborigines' right of veto over land.  ought to know is that there is no mention of the word 'veto' in the act in any event. His views are shared by others in the Northern Territory government. The erstwhile pretender to Perron's throne as chief minister is Shane Stone. He said in the legislative assembly of October last year: . . . that if Canberra was to get their hoof off our throat and get rid of absurd policies like the 3 policy, and the Northern Territory land right act, with Mabo legislation across the top, we could get on with the business of making a dollar ... I ask the shadow minister, who is sitting in the chamber, whether she supports these views or whether she will step·· away from them. Will she walk out of this chamber and say that she supports the views of the Northern Territory Chief Minister, or the views of the erstwhile chief minister Shane Stone, or the views of other members of the CLP government in relation to the land rights act? Or will she support the member for Aston, who proudly speaks of his endorsement of this particular bill? I am waiting with bated breath, and I doubt that I will ever know. We know of the association that the CLP in the Northern Territory has with this opposition. I ask the shadow minister to ask her colleague Senator Grant Tambling-Grant Rumblings-what he thinks of this legislation. Does he support your view, if you have this view? If that is not your view, what is your view? Do you have a policy or not in relation to this particular piece of legislation? Mrs Gallus- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I bring to the attention of the parliamentary secretary that there is a proper way to address people across this chamber. He is not using that proper form.",116
409,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,I ask the honourable member to please observe the courtesies of the House.,118
410,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Most certainly. I am just referring to the shadow spokesperson, Mr Deputy Speaker-if she has such a thin skin. She should ask the opposition whether or not it endorses the policies of its CLP colleagues in the Northern Territory. That is very simple. It is not a hard question. Just walk outside and say whether or not you do, or say it in here on the public record. I doubt that you will. Mr Ruddock-She's walking outside now. You should go and join her.",118
411,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Quick, go and make a public statement. I know what it will be. I am sure that, if she does support Marshall Perron, she will not tell us, and that, if she does not mine support him, she will not tell us that either. That illustrates the dichotomy which opposition members find themselves in. Their colleagues in the Northern Territory do not support their position. But they will not tell the Northern Territory CLP what their position is. They will not tell the CLP that they will not tolerate the stunts being pulled by them in the Northern Territory. As I think the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) said this afternoon in this chamber, the opposition will support the right of people to withhold consent over mining on their land. The Northern Territory government needs to be told this to see whether it will espouse the same principles, to see whether the Northern Territory Chief Minister will retract his previous statements. Comment has been made in this debate in this past week about reports, particularly about Mick Dodson's second report as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. He makes particular reference to the issue of land acquisition. I think it is important that we understand this in the context of this debate because this was about the purchase of a property which was ultimately transferred into Aboriginal title as a result of a land claim process. Mr Dodson states: Aboriginal land acquisition programmes, for instance, are constantly being criticisedwe know they are, by the Northern Territory CLP government, as I have already illustrated, and by sections of industryfor not being primarily directed towards maximising monetary profit ... That is Shane Stone's line. Mr Dodson continues: Such criticisms indicate a failure to understand or respect the fact that Indigenous peoples may place just as great a value on their social and cultural well-being as they do on economic gain. What is at issue here is the practical application of the self-determination and, specifically, the nonIndigenous system's willingness to surrender control of the way in which Indigenous peoples manage and develop their resources. He goes on to make a comment on the assessment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's land acquisition package. I quote from that assessment: There was very high satisfaction with the movement of kin to remote properties, considerable satisfaction with the levels of harmony achieved, and on cultural matters, high satisfaction with the establishment ·of outstations, the protection of significant areas of land and with culturally appropriate schooling .. That is very important. I just want to quote from the report of Pat Dodson from the Council for Aborigipal Reconciliation in which he says: A number of general principles can be derived as to what rights Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would wish to see recognised, in the legal framework, so that there is appropriate empowerment to ensure that these rights can actually be accessedby indigenous communities and organisations. These principles might be set out: . the right to own and control their cultural and intellectual propertya fundamental right and one which we should all endorsethe right to protect sacred and significant sites; the right to own and control management of lands which are conserved in whole or in part because of their indigenous cultural values; the right to benefit from the commercial exploitation of indigenous flora and fauna; the right to camp and hunt or gather for personal or family use in conserved land and marine areas; and the right to participate in the commercial harvesting of native resources of the land and sea where previously the granting of rights, licenses or quotas have had the effect of excluding indigenous individuals or communities. That range of issues is in part directly addressed by the Northern Territory land rights legislation-a very important piece of legislation. I would think it is one of the key pieces of social legislation passed in the history of this parliament and passed on a bipartisan basis. It was initially developed by the right to Whitlam government and finally passed by the Fraser government, based on the reports of the Woodward commission. It is something which is being supported in this chamber by the opposition. It is something which, most significantly for the people in the Northern Territory, for those people who are subject to this legislation, is not supported by the conservative Country-Liberal Party government in the Northern Territory. That should concern all Australians. If we are to strive towards reconciliation, if we are to accept difference and diversity, if we are to accept the importance and significance of Aboriginal cultural and heritage values and if we are to accept and take pride in the spirituality of Aboriginal heritage, what we should be saying to the Northern Territory government is: 'Get your act together. You're an international embarrassment. You're a shame on Australia for not supporting this very key piece of social legislation,' which, as Pat Dodson has said, gives people a priority. It is something which I know is supported in the good hearts of many of our opponents in this chamber, but something which is significantly not supported by the government with the primary interface in terms of the provision of services for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. It is a shame that the CLP cannot live up to the standards that the Australian community requires, but it should not be a surprise to us.",118
412,Mr TICKNER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (6.43 p.m.)-in reply-I would like to say some relatively brief words in summing up the debate that has ensued in respect of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.2) before the House. I note that the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) made a very important contribution highlighting the policies of the Northern Territory government as they relate to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. I should say for the record that my recollection is there are some 30 Federal Court or High Court challenges that have been launched in respect of intended grants or in respect of land claims hearings under the Northern Territory land rights act by the Northern Territory government. Of those 30 legal actions, my recollection is that, at best, only one-half of one of those cases has, in fact, been successful. What we have seen is tens of millions of dollars of public money over a very long time used to thwart the finalisation of land claims. Regrettably, that process of frustration has led to the death of a great many traditional owners who pave not been able to see the ultimate return of their traditional country. To those of us in the parliament who have been privileged to be either directly involved, as ministers or as observers, in the return of traditional land under the Northern Territory land rights act, it is a deeply moving experience. I do not think I have been to one single land title return where the traditional owners have not wept with a mixture of joy and sadness on that occasion. Often, the sadness is because of those who are no longer with them to witness that great occasion. Having said that, it is important to put on record that this is a very positive piece of legislation and a very positive development that we see the land council, the Northern Territory government and, indeed, the Commonwealth parliament unanimously coming together to settle and resolve one of the outstanding land claims. This is how we, as a nation and as governments, should transact business and regulate our dealings with indigenous people. If we can settle claims, if we can negotiate a successful outcome, it is a far better approach than litigating at great cost to the whole community, including the non-Aboriginal community, and at great personal cost. One of the things I have been very pleased to be deeply involved in during my time as a minister is trying to address the backlog of land claims under the Northern Territory land rights act; that is, those claims where there has been a land commissioner's report but no decision has been taken in respect of a return of the country. It happened through various reasons-I do not think it was the fault of any minister-that some of the land claims had been effectively outstanding for the best part of a decade or more. We now have a position where we are virtually up to date with all the land commissioners' reports. With minor exceptions, they have now been acted on, proper decisions taken and the land returned. That is how the land rights act should work for indigenous people and for the wider community. The member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) made an important contribution on behalf of the coalition. What he said, in response to a comment I made in the course of his speech, was that the coalition was committed to the retention of the veto under the Northern Territory land rights act. That, of course, was the very issue which led the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) into the troubled sands of the central Australian deserts in the course of last year. It was the issue of whether there was going to be a repeal of that veto provision or not that regrettably caused him and the wider community so much confusion. Today, we have an important statement from the shadow minister for resources and energy, the member for Gippsland, committing the coalition to the retention of that veto. The member for the Northern Territory is right to raise the issue of the stance of the Northern Territory government. I do not know whether the shadow minister's comments will be reported in the Northern Territory News in the morning or whether they will be in Saturday morning's paper that greets the Chief Minister with this news. But I would hope that the comments by the shadow minister for resources and energy would, for all time, end the threat that has been hanging over the heads of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory that their rights would in some way be eroded if, in the distant future, if ever, a coalition government came to power. So at least in that respect I think this debate has been important. The debate has also been characterised by a large measure of cross-party cooperation. We should not be ashamed about that. As parliamentarians, and often protagonists, we should not be worried that on this occasionshock, horror-political parties and members of parliament agree. We are agreeing about some important principles. The return of land to its traditional owners is a very important measure of social justice. We need to find far greater areas of common agreement. There is very much a need for a return to the greatest degree of crossparty cooperation in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs that we can possibly achieve. I do not think that Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders want to see a bitter divide in this parliament on indigenous policy. I remind the House that during the first three years I was in this job the then shadow minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), played a very constructive role in the coalition-and I give him credit for that-in achieving a large measure of crossparty cooperation. It worked well for him as the shadow minister and it worked well for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Regrettably, after the 1993 election, the coalition took a very big step away from that cross-party cooperation. It is not my intention to recanvass what has sometimes been described as the Mabo debate, which was a pretty sad and sorry time in Australian political history. The Mabo debate concluded in the most dramatic way by a 7:0 decision by the High Court of Australia in upholding the validity of the Native Title Act. We now see a genuine sea change in the attitudes of not only key people in the community but also very significant sections of the Australian mining industry. This change was reflected in the statement by Mr Leon Davis, the managing director of CRA. When he recognised the significance of the Native Title Act, he indicated that his company could work with that legislation and, of even more significance, he indicated a commitment to negotiate with Aboriginal people. Again the shadow minister for resources highlighted the importance of that negotiation. He spoke of the agreement that had been achieved in respect of the Mount Todd goldmine in the Northern Territory, where the NT government negotiated with Aboriginal people and with the company in question, Zapopan, with the support of the Commonwealth. We had an outcome there that gave the title of that land to Aboriginal people and got the goldmine off the ground, but very importantly it gave Aboriginal people an economic interest in the region and in the development of the mine proposal. This need to move to equal negotiations with and mutual respect of Aboriginal people in the mining industry is one of the most important agendas for corporate Australia. Until Mr Davis made that statement, CRA, to be very frank, did not have a recognised good public track record in dealing with indigenous people. It is sad, but I think it is true to say that. I am so full of hope that Mr Davis's statement will be further reflected in the range of initiatives and policies taken by CRA that will make that company a pacesetter in the Australian mining industry in its dealings with indigenous people. I think the statement is a bona fide one and one that comes with considerable commitment from the chief executive. I want to say a couple of other things before I finish up. There have been some very significant developments elsewhere in trying to achieve a greater degree of cross-party cooperation. In this parliament today we had formed a group called 'Parliamentarians for reconciliation'. Its conveners are Senator Reynolds from Queensland and the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a former shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I hope that that group can play a constructive role in the parliament in building cross-party cooperation. That does not mean that issues of principle are not going to be defended, fought for and upheld. I think, if we do have rational debates about issues of policy, it is possible to get that very large measure of cross-party cooperation. It gives me no joy whatsoever to have issues of Aboriginal affairs policy the subject of bitter division. I thank the House for its generosity in allowing me to explore a number of related issues mostly raised in the course of debate. Another important area where we need to work with great wisdom as parliamentarians and to approach in the most constructive and open-hearted manner possible is the important issue of social policy, the third stage of the response to the High Court decision in the form of the social justice package. There has already been a report from A TSIC advocating proposals; there will be a report from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner; and there is a report by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. I commend to the House and to all those who might be listening to this parliamentary broadcast the significance of that document. It is a unanimous document supported by Democrat, coalition and government members on the council and a wide array of Australians-Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal-that really sets out a potential agenda for constructive and sensible social reform in this country. If we can get behind the broad thrust of that document-by all means let us have a discussion about particular issues that some of us might not support at a particular point in time-if we are open-hearted in the way we approach it and if we show respect to the processes of further consultation and negotiation and strive for the greatest degree of cross-party cooperation, we will be doing the same service to the nation as a parliamentthat we did in initiating unanimously the reconciliation process itself. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to conclude the debate. I thank individual members for their contribution, and I feel confident that the legislation will pass the House unanimously.

422,Mr GEAR,WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,"I move: That this Bill now be read a second time. The Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1994 will assist the government in ensuring. that A-str-l-a is fulfilling its treaty obligattons and ItS cIttzens do not contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in any part of the world. Controlling weapons of mass destruction is one of the most important security challenges facing the post-Cold War world. Th- i-sue is a high foreign policy and defence pnonty for the government. International recognition of the horrific results of the use of weapons of mass destruction-nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and their missile delivery systems-and concerns over the destabilising impact of the proliferation of such weapons have resulted in several major achievements in addressing this problem. Of greatest importance are the multilateral treaties either banning or restricting the proliferation of - uch weapons, principally the nuclearnon-prohferation treaty, the biological weapons con,:ention and the chemical weapons conventton, which is not yet in force. In addition to these global treaties, and reinforcing their objectives, are other measures which have been taken to stem proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, WMD. In concert with other similarly minded countries, the Australian government has maintained a range of· export controls aimed at preventing the transfer, directly or indirectly, of goods and technology, which could be used in the development of WMD, to programs known to be or suspected of posing a WMD proliferation risk. These controls were developed by international export control regimes of which Australia is a member-the nuclear suppliers group and the Zangger committee (nuclear), the Australia group (chemical and biological) and the missile technology control regime (missile delivery systems). Australia's export controls on goods, including technology in a tangible form, are covered by the Customs Act 1901 through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Exports of dual use materials and technology, equipment and technology which have both commercial and military uses, are controlled under a series of these regulations. It is not possible to identify and describe, for regulatory purposes, all items that might be used in a WMD program. Some items may be identified but, because of their widespread commercial application, it would be impracticable to control them under the customs regulations: once in regulations, all exports these items would require a permit, which would create an unnecessary administrative burden on the licensing authority as well as for industry. However, the government would still want to have the authority to stop such items from being exported to a destination considered to be a WMD proliferation risk. The customs regulations also cannot control the supply of goods and technology by an Australian overseas or the provision of services or other assistance to a WMD program. Services or assistance could for example take the form of a consultancy contract to provide technical, operational or management advice to a WMD program; financial assistance; broke ring the supply of materials; or specialised training. It would also cover the transmission of information by telephone, fax and other forms which cannot be covered under the customs regulations. A number of similarly placed countries have responded to this problem by the development of the catch-all or safety net provisions as an element of the barriers to WMD proliferation, for example, the United States and Germany. Although it can take different forms, essentially it works in two ways. It puts an onus on a person not to export goods or provide a service or other assistance intentionally or recklessly to a WMD program. It also provides the government with a mechanism to prevent the export of goods or the provision of a service or other assistance to an actual or possible WMD program. While there is a wide range of goods and services that can be used in a WMD program which have legitimate commercial uses and are not specifically controlled under existing legislation, it would be inconsistent with Australia's strong support for the international non-proliferation regimes and strong opposition to WMD proliferation for the government not to have all necessary authority to prevent the provision of goods and services to WMD programs. This is not a theoretical problem for Australia. There have been several cases in recent years where Australian companies have inadvertently become involved in activities which could have assisted WMD programs, of and these activities were not specifically covered by Australia's existing non-proliferation legislation. Fortunately the companies involved were cooperative and ceased the activities in question when the government informed them of its concerns. We cannot, however, conclude from the positive outcome in those cases that this will always be the case in the future, particularly in the face of the possible financial inducements on offer from those associated with the WMD programs; hence the need to provide clear legislative backing for the government's comprehensive WMD non-proliferation policy. The prohibitions under the bill would apply where the person involved knows of or suspects the connection with a WMD program. The bill provides for a ministerial certificate to be issued prohibiting relevant activities in cases where government authorities are aware of the risk of the potential contribution to a WMD program, but the exporter is not aware of the connection or has ignored or not appreciated warning signs. An important element of the bill is the provision for a mechanism to be established for companies and individuals to obtain written guidance from the government on the risk, or not, of a particular planned transaction contributing to a WMD program. This legislation is not meant to be the prime or sole barrier against possible Australian assistance to the proliferation of WMD. The customs regulations, information programs and persuasion will continue to serve an important function. The legislation would be used only when other measures fail or are unavailable. It would also serve to underline again the government's clear commitment to prevent Australian assistance to proliferation ofWMD. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.",123
423,Mr TAYLOR,WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,"I think it is worth reiterating for the benefit of the House part of what the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has just said which goes to the heart of the rationale for the Weapons of Mass Destruction (prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1994. I quote in part from what the Assistant Treasurer has just said: Controlling weapons of mass destruction is one of the most important security challenges facing the post-Cold War world. The issue is a high foreign policy and defence priority for the government. He finished by saying-and I think this is a point that we need to reinforce: This legislation is not meant to be the prime barrier against possible Australian assistanceto the proliferation of WMD. The Customs Regulations, information programs and persuasion will continue to serve an important function. The legislation would be used only when other measures fail or are unavailable. It would also serve to underline again the government's clear commitment to prevent Australian assistance to proliferation of WMD. With those comments by way of background, the coalition supports the general thrust of the bill. However, we do have some reservations about the mechanics of one or two clauses of the bill, especially in relation to the bureaucratic demands imposed by it. I will come back to those specific items a little later. As the Assistant Treasurer said, the general purpose of the bill is to restrict trade in any materials likely to be used in weapons of mass destruction, the so-called WMDs, which describes nuclear, biological and chemical weapons capable of resulting in mass destruction of the population. The bill does so by levying penalties for export of goods which may be used for the construction of such WMDs, with a couple of strong qualifiers that it only covers exports where a person believes or suspects on reasonable grounds that goods will or may be used in a WMD program, and also that its broad framework allows normal exports and allows for clarification by the minister if doubt exists. I suppose the basic question that we should all he addressing this evening is: why, therefore, should all Australians support this bill? I suggest that there are five reasons why we should do just that. Firstly, it recognises a general repugnance of any proliferation postCold War of such weapons. Secondly, it signals a very specific commitment to the associated international treaties. Thirdly, its strong theme strengthens and reinforces our attitude to an indefinite extension of the non-proliferation treaty at the NPT review and extension conference in New York next month, between 17 April and 12 May. Fourthly, it exemplifies Australia's commitment to regional stability by showing the strength of our own commitment to non-proliferation. Finally, it is very consistent with last year's defence white paper. I take the opportunity to refer to that defence white paper, specifically to pages 108 and 109, under the heading or sole 'Non-Proliferation and Arms Control'. I quote: Effective controls on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles contribute significantly to Australia's security. Twenty years or more of sustained negotiation between the then superpowers and in multilateral forums have led to the development of an unprecedented array of non-proliferation and arms control regimes (particularly the Strategic Arms Limitations Agreement and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the Treaty Banning Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treatywhich I referred to a moment ago-the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions, and the Partial and Threshold Nuclear Test Ban Treaties). However, with the end of the Cold War, economic growth and strategic uncertainties have increased the potential for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As a result, non-proliferation issues are at the forefront of international security concerns. Australia shares a global interest in reducing the risk of countries acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. We have a strong direct interest in ensuring that such weapons are not acquired by countries or terrorist groups which could use them against Australia. While the mere acquisition of these weapons would not indicate a threat to Australia, their existence within reach of us would complicate and add to the cost of our defence. Furthermore, if one regional country acquires weapons of mass destruction or missile capabilities other regional countries may respond, possibly by developing matchingcapabilities. Such a sequence would de stabilise regional security and further complicate defence planning. The best way to prevent proliferation is to establish effective global regimes, such as the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention. Australia will continue to support and if possible strengthen these regimes, and ensure they are fully implemented and effectively verifiable. Defence will continue to promote and implement regional non-proliferation and arms control measures. A key priority is limiting the proliferation of ballistic missiles. The Government will continue its efforts to make the Missile Technology Control Regime an effective mechanism for this purpose, and will seek the broadest international commitment to controls on developing and exporting ballistic missile technology. Our involvement in international processes will be complemented by continued efforts to secure acceptance of, and adherence to, this Regime within the region. In this context, it is appropriate that we should review Australia's track record on these issues. I point out, for those who are not aware of it, that we are party to three international treaties concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons-the so-called NPT, which I would like to comment on in a little more detail later-was ratified by Australia on 23 January 1973, and WL, substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. We also have the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and their Destruction. This was ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977, and was substantially implemented by the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976. Finally, we have the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, which was ratified on 6 May 1994, but has not yet come into force internationally. It will be substantially implemented by the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, which will come into force on a date to be proclaimed or upon the convention coming into force. It is therefore quite unambiguous that these three treaties and their associated legislation place limits on the use and transfer of chemical, nuclear and bacteriological material. In addition, Australia is involved in four relevant international groups which aim to control the international transfer of weapons grade materials. The first of these groups is the Zangger committee, which was formed in the early 1970s by countries which supply nuclear materials and which have developed a list of equipment, the export of which should be subject to safeguards. The overall aim of this group is to develop controls on the export of equipment for use in the production of special fissionable material. The second of these groups is the nuclear suppliers group, which was formed in 1974. This group has developed guidelines for the export of nuclear related equipment and technology which is aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The third group is the missile technology control regime, which was referred to in the extract I read into the record from the defence paper of last year. That group was established in 1987. It comprises a group of countries which have agreed to a basic set of guidelines on the export of missile technology, and these guidelines are incorporated into national export regulations. Finally, there is the Australia group, which was established in 1987 to facilitate a chemical weapons treaty. It deals with the export of material for the making of chemical weapons until such a treaty comes into force. It has also developed a list of chemicals which require export controls. It is therefore pretty clear that Australia's record is very good. We have met our international obligations arising from treaties and international group involvement by enacting important legislation-as I have just indicated-to deal with such nuclear chemical and bacteriological material. Export controls have been imposed also through the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations under the Customs Act 190 1. Clearly, we are playing an important role in these matters. Turning to some of the more significant clauses of the bill, at international law, Australia would not have jurisdiction to legislate in relation to things that happen outside Australia unless it had this connection with Australian citizens, residents or companies. To this end, clause 6 of the bill provides that the bill will apply not only to actual acts or omissions in Australia but also to actual acts or omissions done outside Australia by Australian citizens, people who ordinarily reside in Australia and bodies incorporated in Australia. Clause 7 sets out the constitutional basis the bill. It draws on four areas: the external affairs power, under section 51(xxix), to the extent that it gives effect to the three conventions I referred to previously; the defence power, under section 51(vi); the corporations power, under section 51(xx); and the trade and commerce power, under section 51(i). Clause 9 provides that, where a person supplies goods to another, believing or suspecting on reasonable grounds that the goods may be used in a program for the development, production, acquisition or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction-the so-called WMD program-a person is gUilty of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of eight years. Clause 12 refers to the issuing of a ministerial notice if the minister does not believe or suspect that the goods may be used in a WMD program. Clause 13 specifies that a person is not guilty of an offence if the supply of goods is authorised by a permit granted under that particular clause. Clause 14 allows the minister to send out notices prohibiting a person from exporting the goods or services. The minister may issue such notices only if he or she has reason to believe or suspect that the goods or services might be used to assist a WMD program and the minister considers a permit could not be given under clause 13. Such a notice lasts for 12 months. It is an offence for a person to knowingly supply or export goods or services contrary to a notice. The penalty for this is imprisonment for a maximum of eight years. Clause 15 attributes the belief or suspicion of a director, employee or agent acting within his or her authority to the relevant corporation, unless the corporation proves that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct. If a corporation is convicted, section 4B of the Crimes Act 1914 allows a court to impose a fine upon it of up to five times the maximum fine which could be imposed on an individual. This raises the issue of our reservations about the bureaucratic demands and potential legal risks of the bill I referred to in opening this debate. The bill imposes additional burdens on companies to become aware of the for ultimate use of goods or services that they might provide or export. Although the criminal provisions require a level of intent of belief or suspicion, a jury could attribute suspicion to a company if it held or had access to information which indicates that the goods or services might be used for a WMD program, even if nobody in the company had actually turned his or her mind to it. The company must also take care that none of its directors, employees or agents hold suspicions without alerting the responsible person in the company. Otherwise, the knowledge of the director, employee or agent could be attributed to the company, and this could result in conviction, a fine and confiscation of the goods. The bill makes provision that a company in an uncertain position over the so-called end use can at least apply to a minister for a statement upon which it can rely. I point out to the Assistant Treasurer that this burden on companies needs to be balanced against the importance of limiting the capacity of countries to construct weapons of mass destruction. The coalition therefore hopes that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) will recognise these potential difficulties and ensure that an awareness program arising from this bill is provided to the commercial sector generally and, more specifically, to those industries likely to be affected or with the potential to be affected. We suggest also that the minister disseminate a list of materials and destinations likely to represent cause for concern, although I appreciate that the Assistant Treasurer did make one or two of those points-albeit briefly-in his second reading speech. With those caveats, the coalition supports the bill and its underlying commitment. I would like to say a few words about the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons-the so-called NPT-which proto vides the international framework for preventmake ing the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT, along with the UN charter, are the key docuan ments on international security. The NPT was concluded in 1968 and entered into force 1970 after ratification by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdomprovided the so-called depositary powers of the treaty-and 40 other states. One of the broad objectives of the treaty is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons to states other than the five states which had already developed nuclear weapons in 1968. These states are United States, the Soviet Unionsions Russia has since acceded to these obligapeaceful tions-the United Kingdom, France and China. Other objectives are to facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation between treaty members, and to work towards general and complete nuclear disarmament. In the coalition's view, the NPT has come vital to global and regional security. provides essential assurances for international trade and cooperation in the peaceful uses nuclear energy. Without the assurances fered by the NPT and the system of Internain tional Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, distrust of nuclear intentions would feed regional security problems. Without the assurances offered by the NPT, international nuclear cooperation would dwindle. Projections in the 1960s were that 20 to 25 states would have developed or acquired nuclear weapons by the 1980s. Despite challenges to the non-proliferation regime, it is a measure of the treaty's success that such fears have not been realised. Australia ratified the NPT in 1973. Current membership is an impressive 174, reflecting the treaty's success in establishing a norm against nuclear weapons proliferation. Parties include all five of the original nuclear weapon states, as I have already indicated, and most states with advanced nuclear programs, regrettably with Israel, Pakistan and India remaining notable but increasingly isolated exceptions. The NPT provides for five-yearly conferences, which have been convened since 1975, review the operations of the treaty and to recommendations about its future implementation. This review process will be important part of the 1995 conference in New York and, despite disappointing progress in on disarmament during the Cold War years, the review conferences have nevertheless a forum for the international community to continue to maintain pressure on the nuclear weapon states to stop nuclear testing, to halt the arms race and to start nuclear reductions. But much more productive has been the work of successive review conferences in strengthening other key proviof the treaty, including safeguards, uses of nuclear energy and nuclear supply, and recommendations for complementary nuclear agreements and arrangements. Let me make it very clear to the House that the coalition believes that the NPT makes a vital contribution to international peace and besecurity, as do all ASEAN, Indochinese and It north Asian countries and all South Pacific Forum---except Vanuatu-members of the of NPT. It has provided the framework for the ofsmooth development of the nuclear industry the region and a firm foundation for the long-term planning and major investments required by nuclear technology. It has facilitated regional nuclear cooperation and trade, as well as trade and cooperation with countries outside the region. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) might be interested to hear that this side. of the House strongly supports the indefinite extension of the NPT in New York in May of this year. We believe that the indefinite extension of the NPT is the best guarantee of the continuation of the international and regional security benefits provided to date by the NPT. We also support urgent conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty of indefinite duration. We want to see a thorough review in New York of the operation and effectiveness of that treaty. We want to encourage NPT members to see the conference as an opportunity to shape the environment of the next century so that we can achieve the nuclear-free world we all seek. We do not want to be looking back at what was and what was not done over the past 25 years with the constraints of the Cold War. I note and acknowledge some of the reservations and criticisms of the NPT: that the treaty is discriminatory, dividing countries into nuclear haves and have-nots, and should be rewritten; that nothing serious has been done about nuclear disarmament and there are more nuclear weapons today than in 1968 when the treaty was negotiated; that indefinite extension will legitimise the status of the nuclear weapon states for ever; that the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards are ineffective, as demonstrated in the case of Iraq and North Korea, and do not prevent proliferation; that the NPT has not delivered access to nuclear technology for developing countries and suppliers have imposed export controls which hinder the economic development of developing countries; that nuclear smuggling is the new challenge-I do not think anybody would disagree with that-and demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the NPT, with which I hope the House would disagree; and that the NPT has been a failure because it has not attracted the support of key threshold countries such as India, Pakistan and Israel. Nevertheless, the coalition believes that New York conference provides an historic opportunity. We believe it is an appropriate opportunity to continue to strengthen the safeguards, nuclear supply and peaceful uses provisions of the treaty, to build further momentum towards universal membership, and also, for the first time, to lock in the post-Cold War disarmament achievements and to ensure the most propitious environment for future nuclear disarmament. As I said before, that means extending the treaty indefinitely. Anything less would only provide arguments to those who wish to see the disarmament process go no further. It would undermine the normative effect of the treaty, create uncertainty in nuclear trade and send wrong signals to the threshold states about the commitment of NPT parties to this important treaty. I hope to see the requirement commitment first-hand when I visit New York. Hopefully, I will be accredited, albeit for just a few hours, to the NPT extension conference. The coalition supports this legislation, with the caveats that I referred to briefly a moment ago. I commend the bill to the House.",125
424,Mr GIBSON,WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,"The House is debating the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1995. We do so at a time when, for the first time in the world's history, we have experienced the use of a weapon of mass destruction by a terrorist group. I am talking about the use of chemical weapons in the Tokyo subway system which resulted in 10 or 11 deaths and more than 5,000 injuries. It is therefore very pertinent that this House and this parliament considers this legislation, and that this government puts on record its very firm commitment to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and its intention to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The purpose of this bill is to supplement existing controls, such as customs controls, on the export of material which could be used in the production of weapons of mass destruction and to restrict the provision of services or the export of ordinary commercial goods which might be used to make, develop or store the weapons of mass destruction. When we talk about weapons of mass destruction, we are talking about nuclear weapons, biologicai weapons and chemical weapons. It is also important for the House to understand that, although we do not possess any one of those three types of weapons, Australia has taken a leading role in negotiations around the world to achieve the limitation and ultimate elimination of those types of weapons. Australian Foreign Affairs officials and disarmament negotiators have taken a very strong and leading role in achieving finalisation of treaties and agreements, of regulations and legislation, both here and in other countries, so that we can achieve a world regime under which these weapons no longer exist. It is a tribute to this government that we have taken such a leading role. In 1993 the chemical weapons convention was finally signed after some 26 years of negotiation. We thought it would never he completed but it was finalised because of the intervention of Australian officials who came forward with a set of words that those UN member countries which actually possessed chemical weapons, or which were involved in their production, could agree with. Australia played a key role in finalising chemical weapons convention. That weapons convention has not yet been ratified by the whole world. For the treaty to be ratified, we need to get some 60 or 70 countries to sign. This legislation and previous legislation that this House has carried are Australia's legislative fulfilment of its obligations. We are hopeful that by next year this chemical weapons convention will be able to come into force. But that is a sign of the very important role Australia has played for many years in trying to achieve disarmament across all of these types of weapons. My friend and colleague the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) has outlined the important work that is now under way with regard to the extension and review conference for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The government fully supports the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We agree-and I personally agree-with all the comments that the member for Groom made about the importance of having an indefinite extension. There are problems with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and I will be talking a bit about them. I want to make it clear to this House that I, personally, and the government fully support the indefinite extension of that treaty. That is the only signal we can afford to send to the nuclear weapon states, the nonnuclear weapon states and some of those rogue states that want to seek to develop nuclear weapons. The world community does not support the proliferation of nuclear weapons. What the world community wants is the end of nuclear weapons. That is why an indefinite extension is a very important signal. Like the member for Groom, I also hope that through the indefinite extension we can convince those countries, those nuclear weapon states that are not signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, to come on board. I refer to the states of Israel, India and Pakistan. They are the only three states where it is clearly acknowledged that they have nuclear weapons. There were a number of other countries which were in the process of developing themArgentina and South Africa were two that of them-but they have come on board the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and have ended their development of nuclear weapons. A number of other countries that are signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty did commence the development of them: North Korea and Iraq. However, the world community intervened very strongly and made sure that those two countries ended their development of nuclear weapons. In discussing the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it is important to understand that there are some weaknesses in that treaty. I am hopeful that in the extension review conference that is held at the end of April and early May in New York-and I am pleased to hear that the member for Groom will get an opportunity to observe that process-we can tighten up the review procedures. As the member for Groom outlined, one of the weaknesses of the treaty is that it is discriminatory. It protects the nuclear weapon states and maintains their status and leaves all the non-nuclear weapon states in a separate and discriminated status. That is important, because we do not want to see any more countries becoming nuclear weapon states. However, there has been a bit of unfairness in the application of the treaty. A lot of countries that have interests in developing nuclear weapons have had the pressure put on them to cease that development and production. Similar pressure has not been effectively applied to the nuclear weapon states to stop their further development and enhancement of nuclear weapons and their increasing of stockpiles. It has been acknowledged in this House that the nuclear weapon states now have more than twice as many nuclear weapons as they did when this treaty was ratified in 1970. They have not actually fulfilled their obligations under the treaty. The treaty was developed in an era of the Cold War. I recognise that and there was, of course, a different political dynamic than we have today. But, because we now have a new world political dynamic, it gives us a real opportunity to put into effect review requirements that set much firmer targets and guidelines for the nuclear weapon states. Only two of the nuclear weapon states are actively involved in disarmament: the United States of America and Russia. Countries such as France, Great Britain and China, which are the other large recognised parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, have not engaged in any disarmament negotiations at all. There are no disarmament treaties or arrangements applying to their nuclear stockpiles. It is about time those three parties came board and joined with the United States of America and Russia in cutting down their stockpiles and meeting their obligations under the treaty. If you read the actual treaty, it makes it clear that the nuclear weapon states are supposed to be part of an active program of disarmament and reducing their nuclear weapon stockpiles. Those three signatory states are not fulfilling their obligations. What I personally would like to see, and what a number of my parliamentary colleagues would like to see, is a much tougher regime of review so that each five years, when we are reviewing what is happening, we look back over the previous five years and ask, 'What have each of the parties done to fulfil their obligations?' Then, when we report back and determine how they have gone, we set very clear targets for those countries about what we expect to happen in the next five years. We should make it very clear that, as signatories to that treaty, we expect all parties to fulfil their obligations under the treaty in that regard. That does not diminish in any way the effectiveness of the treaty. What it does seek to do is fulfil some of the obligations of the treaty and make all of the parties to the treaty fulfil their requirements. I think we should be setting some targets for the next five years. We need to conclude a comprehensive ban on all nuclear test explosions. This should come into force completely. There are agreements and arrangements occurring at the moment. People are saying, 'No, we won't.' BiII Clinton has outlined that the United States will not be testing. France has suspended its testing. China, unfortunately, has not suspended its testing. There is no binding agreement on all the states to cease testing. If the United States wanted to change its mind tomorrow, it could. BiII Clinton, as President, has said that he will not, but there is nothing binding in place. There is no regime to effect that decision. We need a comprehensive test ban treaty in place with everybody as signatories and the full force of law. We need to commence and conclude negoon tiations for a ban on the production of special fissionable materials for weapons purposes and the entry into force of such an agreement. At the moment, there is still a significant production of special fissionable materials occurring around the world. Stockpiles of that material are being made available. We need a complete ban on that production. We also need an agreement from all nuclear weapon states that they will cease producing new nuclear weapons. At the moment we have some 70,000 nuclear weapons still stockpiled in all the nuclear weapon states, which would mean that we could blow up the earth completely at least 10 times over if we had the desire to. We do not need any more nuclear weapons being added. We have now had the end of the Cold War. We have had the end of the dividing of our world between two different groups, where each side had approximately equal numbers of nuclear weapons and forces. We have ended that. There is no need for any member state to have nuclear weapons. Over the next 10 years, every nuclear weapon state should be engaged in a process of destroying their nuclear weapons. It is in the best interests of all member states to do that. Removing those weapons not only ends the tension and the threat to all civilisation but also saves countries money. It enables them to have funds to invest in their people rather than in the production of nuclear weapons. It is for that reason that I also support am involved with another group in this parliament, and it is being active as well. Parliamentarians for Global Action, which I convene in this Australian parliament, supports a project called the World Court project, which is a case before the International Court of Justice to declare nuclear weapons illegal. That case does not have the support of the Australian government but it does have the support of many other countries and many parliamentarians and people around the world. We are very hopeful that, through the World Court decision, we can get a declaration that nuclear weapons are in fact illegal, that they should cease production and that all member and nuclear weapon states should immediately commence disarmament and destruction of all of those weapons. There is broad international agreement that we need to put in place a comprehensive test ban treaty. The first target that I have set for the nuclear weapon states and the non-nuclear weapon states for the next five years should be achievable. There are concerns around the world about the proliferation of fissionable material. So there should be sufficient goodwill in this world community to .achieve a ban on the further production and distribution .of fissionable nuclear material. Within the world community, and within the communities and popUlations of the member countries that have nuclear weapons, there is a desire to end the threat that nuclear weapons pose to their welfare. It is in the best interests of those countries to also cease further production, further enhancement and further improvements to their nuclear weapons. 'Save the money. Invest the money in your people' is the message I would like to give those countries. The community, government and people will certainly benefit from such a decision. I had the opportunity to attend the final preparatory committee meeting of the extension and review conference for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in January in New York. It was a great pleasure for me to meet and work alongside Mr Ian Cousins, who is the First Assistant Secretary of the International Security Division of the Department of and Foreign Affairs and Trade, who heads the Australian delegation in negotiations on the extension review of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. He is a very impressive negotiator for and representative of Australia. I congratulate him and his team on the work they are doing. It was quite a matter of pride for me as an Australian parliamentarian to see how well the Australian negotiators put forward our views when negotiating and discussing matters with a whole range of member states and their representatives. Australia has an enormous influence on this process, even though we are a non-nuclear weapon state. Ian Cousins was listened to and taken quite seriously by the representatives from the United States, Great Britain, China and a lot of the senior representatives of the non-aligned movement who are very influential in these negotiations. Australia can be very proud of the work that our representatives are doing. I wish to express my congratulations to Ian Cousins and the OF AT team for the negotiating they will be doing on Australia's behalf in April. I sincerely hope that they succeed in getting a clear and strong vote in favour of an indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. If it does occur, Australia can take some significant pride in that achievement because we can claim that we contributed greatly to that result. I wish the member for Groom well in his participation in that conference, and I ask him to pass on my congratulations and best wishes to our negotiating team. I think he will also be impressed by the work they do and the way in which they represent Australia's interests in those negotiations. I will conclude by highlighting the international importance of legislation such as this. Australia takes its international obligation seriously. It is ensuring that no Australian companies are involved in any way in the distribution of materials that could be used the production of any sort of weapon of mass destruction. As I said at the beginning of my contribution, in light of the recent terrorist attack in Tokyo where chemical weapons were usedand I believe this is the first time a weapon mass construction like that has been used in a terrorist attack-which is something we all should be incredibly scared about, it is very important that we have legislation like this in place which restricts and confines companies from being able to produce the necessary goods that make chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. I certainly hope that the other countries in the region will follow our lead and similarly legislate to prevent the distribution and production of such material. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1995 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gear; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith. Second Reading",129
425,Mr GEAR,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994, the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Act 1985, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 and the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. In addition, this bill will repeal the Livestock Diseases Act 1978. The Livestock Diseases Act 1978 is to be repealed to remove the Commonwealth's responsibility for exotic disease eradication activities in the Australian Capital Territory for and remove the Commonwealth's liability for payment of compensation to ACT producers whose property is destroyed or damaged as a result of exotic disease or associated eradication activities. In addition, the proposed repeal of this act will allow the ACT to join in the of Commonwealth-state cost sharing agreement for sharing the costs of exotic animal disease eradication campaigns on an equal basis with the states and the Northern Territory. The amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994 are to address the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, the NRA, commencing registration activities in 1995 and not 1994 as was originally intended. The amendments will enable the collection of levy act to apply for 1995-96 and thereafter. In addition, experience with the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Interim Levy) Act 1994 has identified the requirement for a number of minor amendments which will improve the administrative efficiency of the collection of levy act and hence benefit industry. These amendments include changing the date for payment of the levy from 1 June to 31 July each year. This will remove the necessity for industry to pay both the interim levy and main levy during the 1994-95 financial year. In addition, the NRA will be able to approve levy payments by instalments, thus spreading the cost to industry over a period of time. The proposed amendments to the late penalty payment provisions will allow for those payments to be set by primary legislation, rather than prescribed by regulations. The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 provides the framework for the operations of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, AHC, and its subsidiary product board, the Australian Dried Fruits board. When the AHC was established, provision was made in its enabling legislation for the chairperson to report to the annual general meeting of the eligible industry body representing a levy paying industry. In the fIrst few years of the corporation's operation, when there were only a small number of industries participating in the corporation, this approach worked well. However, with nine industries now participating in the corporation, the chairperson of the corporation has been required to undertake a signifIcant additional workload. This workload is likely to increase again in the short term as a number of other industries have signalled their intention to commence levy contributions to the corporation. It is therefore proposed to amend the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 to enable other members of the corporation's board to provide the annual report of the corporation's activities to the annual general meetings of eligible industry bodies. This will reduce the burden on the chairperson while at the same time maintaining the accountability linkage between the board of direCtors and its levy paying constituents. When the Australian Dried Fruits Board was established, provision was made in the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 for product boards to convene an annual general meeting for the purposes of reporting on their activities to their levy paying constituents. Two such meetings have been held by the Australian Dried Fruits Board-the fIrst in June 1993 and the second in June 1994. Following representations from the dried vine fruits industry, the government has decided to remove the need for product boards to convene an annual general meeting. The government has accepted the recommendation from the Australian Dried Fruits Association, which is the eligible industry body for dried vine fruit producers, that the chairperson of the Australian Dried Fruits Board report to the annual general meeting of the association. This will replace the need for the Australian Dried Fruits Board, and other product boards which may be established under the act, to hold an annual general meeting. This approach is consistent with the accountability arrangements for the parent body, the Australian Horticultural Corporation, which also reports to the annual general meetings of its eligible industry bodies. The repeal of the annual general meeting provisions of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 will have a retrospective effect from 1 July 1994. The chairperson of the Australian Dried Fruits Board will be required to present the report of the board's 1993-94 activities to the 1995 annual general meeting of the Australian Dried Fruits Association. This arrangement has the total and unqualifIed support of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, the Australian Dried Fruits Board and the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Horticultural Research and Development Corporation is a statutory body which was established in 1988 with the responsibility for the coordination and funding of horticultural research and development, R&D. Horticultural industries which participate in the corporation contribute through statutory levies and export charges and voluntary contributions. Expenditure of industry funds on R&D is matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the industry. It is a requirement of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 that the chairperson of the corporation report each year to the annual conference, or a meeting of the executive, of each eligible industry body representing a levy paying industry., As the number of industries now participating in the corporation has increased to 11, the chairperson of the corporation has experienced a similar increase in workload as the chairperson of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 to enable other members of the corporation's board to provide the annual report of the corporation's activities to the annual conference or meeting of the executive of each eligible industry body. This is consistent with the approach being proposed for the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will extend farm household support to farmers who have reached the pension age. This will provide a further option for farmers who are unable to receive the age pension, or who receive a reduced pension, because they have a relatively high level of farm assets which they are not able to realise. Access to farm household support for this group of farmers will enable them to meet basic living expenses while they arrange for the sale of their property or work to place the farm on a firmer footing. In addition, the Farm Household Support Act 1992 is being amended to provide for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to authorise payments to a RAS authority that has incurred costs in connection with the issue of drought exceptional circumstances certificates. These certificates are used by farmers applying for drought relief payment, or who wish to have their farm assets excluded from the assets test normally applied to farmers for Austudy, as evidence that their farm enterprise is located in an area affected by drought exceptional circumstances. The issue of amending the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Act 1985 arose because the Queensland parliament passed a new act covering fisheries management which was brought into effect in January 1995 before the implications flowing from Commonwealth legislation had been dealt with. Because the Queensland Fisheries Management Authority is a new agency constituted under the new act, the Commonwealth guarantee to the Queensland treasury now has no effect as the Commonwealth act which establishes the loan guarantee refers to the old act and the old agency, namely the Queensland Fish Management Authority. By changing the definition to reflect the current situation in Queensland state legislation, the Commonwealth guarantee for the northern prawn fishery voluntary adjustment scheme can be restored. Many of Australia's entrenched rural adjustment problems are regionally concentrated. A number of rural regions are currently faced with substantial challenges of economic, social and environmental adjustment. The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 is being amended to allow the rural adjustment scheme, RAS, to operate at a regional level. This will allow RAS to better address the structural adjustment needs of specific regions. The amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill No. . 3 seek to do three main things: to provide for a regional component to the rural adjustment scheme, RAS; to provide flexibility in relation to the provision of support for regional and other elements Of RAS; and to make it an explicit requirement for Commonwealth support under all elements of RAS to be subject to Commonwealth-states agreement. A regional approach to RAS would not replace the existing individual based approach. Direct delivery to individual farmers through the state RAS authorities will continue with the two approaches operating in a com,plementary manner. The proposed changes will allow the Commonwealth the flexibility of dealing directly with farmer groups and organisations involved in rural adjustment, and is an important step in the overall implementation of the regional approach to the scheme. The amendments provide for payments to be made directly to beneficiaries, for payments to entities other than farmers under all elements of RAS and for flexible cost sharing arrangements under all elements of RAS, subject to Commonwealth-state agreement. The ability to make direct payments and payments to organisations and groups will allow greater efficiency and effectiveness in program delivery. It will allow, for example, one cheque to be paid directly to a training course facilitator, rather than multiple cheques being paid to individual farmers that attend. It will also allow closer linkages to other programs with direct payment elements such as rural counselling, Landcare, and agribusiness. Activities for support within the framework of regional RAS may include the identification and development of appropriate training courses across the region to address local needs. This may include training on issues such as productivity enhancement options for farm business enterprises, financial management, environmental management, and marketing. Support may also be available for possible further funding of farm exits, and training schemes for those leaving the sector. The flexible cost sharing arrangements allow provision for states or the Commonwealth to make greater funding contributions to regional projects should they so wish. This flexibility is essential to permit RAS assistance to be tailored to regional and community needs. RAS regional initiatives will be implemented consistently with principles for rural regional development developed by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, ARMCANZ. Many communities are already working cooperatively on a range of issues and governments can help foster this locally driven initiative through regional RAS. Amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 were initially considered by the Senate on 9 February 1995 as part of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill No.3, PIELAB. The proposed amendments were referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for further consideration. In considering the proposed amendments, the committee generally supported a regional approach to the RAS, but raised a number of concerns, in particular: the constitutional validity of the amendments; administrative arrangements to be established to implement the regional approach to the RAS; and consultation with the states in developing the regional approach to the RAS. The committee's report on its deliberations made a number of useful observations on the proposed amendments. The amendments now proposed respond positively to the committee's report and accommodate the committee's substantive concerns. The Attorney-General's Department has provided clear advice that the proposed amendments are constitutionally valid and that this validity is not affected by any administrative arrangements that may be put into place. The Commonwealth's ability to enter into agreements with persons other than states, and to make direct or indirect payments to farmers re- and persons other than farmers, for the purposes of rural adjustment, is supported by the appropriations power in section 81 and the incidental power in section 51(xxxix) of the constitution. In a regional context, the Commonwealth funding is intended to be provided for community based activities relating to rural adjustment. The activities would be driven and undertaken by the states, local government, community and industry. In addition to its funding role, the Commonwealth will also monitor the expenditure of such funding ensuring that it is spent for the purpose for which it was allocated, a role which the Attorney-General's Department advises is within the constitutional powers. With respect to the committee's concerns as to the lack of clarity on administrative arrangements, on 3 March 1995 ARMCANZ endorsed in principle the implementation of integrated and community based regional approaches involving the linked implementation of rural programs such as the RAS, NAP, agribusiness programs, and rural communities access program. ARMCANZ also agreed in principle to the early implementation of a rural partnership program, RPP, based on a model incorporating input from the case studies report undertaken by SCARM which focused on south-west Queensland and Sunraysia. The framework supported by ARMCANZ involves a competitive bidding process, extensive community consultation, and joint development of regional strategies with the states and the community. The suggested approach is consistent with that developed by the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, RASAC, and discussed between Commonwealth and state RAS officers in May 1994. The south-west Queensland regional strategy is a pilot project for the development of a regional approach to rural adjustment. The strategy is generally consistent with the ARMCANZ approach, incorporating an integrated package of adjustment measures, including RAS, landcare, and rural counselling. The strategy was initially proposed by community based organisations which recognised the need for rural adjustment within the SWQ region, and is a real partnership between the community and governments at local, state, and Commonwealth levels. Amendments to the original proposed amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill No.3, PIELAB, address concerns that the RAS may not be implemented in full consultation with the states. They put in place a requirement for all Commonwealth RAS assistance to be the subject of Commonwealth-state agreements, including regional initiatives. It has always been the Commonwealth's intention that, within the broad framework discussed with the states, the detailed adminisup trative arrangements under a regional approach would be developed in consultation with the states on a case by case basis and with their full cooperation and consultation. A successful regional initiative can only be effectively and most efficiently implemented with the full cooperation of all parties, Commonwealth, state and local governments community and industry. The states were consulted on the proposed approach to a regional component to the RAS, including on the nature of each of the proposed amendments to the act, at a meeting of state-Commonwealth RAS officers in May 1994. The states have been consulted in detail on these additional amendments and support the proposed approach. In conclusion, I believe that the proposed amendments to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act 1992 will facilitate the achievement of the overall goals of the scheme. I believe that support on a regional basis will encourage the development of a more profitable farm sector that is able to operate competitively in a deregulated fmancial and market environment, and improve the competitiveness of the farm sector in a sustainable manner. I commend the bill to honourable members.",133
426,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"After that dissertation, I wondered how long it would take to read the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995 in total. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is leaving the House at this moment, certainly gave us a very lengthy explanation as to what the amendments to the bill will mean. The coalition previously supported the majority of this bill but was concerned that amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 might mean that the federal government could decide land use for an area without consulting the states which have the constitutional power for land use. Listening to the minister, our concerns had basis. The federal government has been actively trying to whip up local support for restructuring-and I refer to two areas of New South Wales, the western and central west-in a way which looks to the outsider as a bottomsapproach. But when you take a closer look at it, it is really a tops-down approach and being driven more from the federal government. The coalition does not object to the concept of the rural adjustment scheme being used on a regional area basis, but it wants to ensure that the states are in agreement with the plan and that restructuring is not imposed on an area which does not want to be restructured. The minister in his explanation a moment ago pointed to the south-west Queensland strategy, which is a pilot scheme that was developed by the people of the south-west Queensland mulga lands. As they are all my constituents, I have taken a very close interest in the development of the south-west Queensland strategy. I believe that the people of south-west Queensland were the driving force behind the development of a regional approach to rural adjustment. In last week's Country Lift, the President of the Warrego Graziers Association, Mr Rigby, when reporting to his association in Char leville, said that the wheels have fallen off the south-west Queensland strategy. This is a practical grazier who has been grazing sheep and cattle in those very harsh mulga lands in south-west Queensland for more than 20 years. The president of that association has to be a pretty tough nut. He is going to have to stick up for those people out there and understand the problems of the community. I would like the House to bear in mind that the Warrego Graziers Association has always been behind a regional approach to the rural adjustment package. In his report last week, Mr Rigby said: · .. the South west Strategy has been ""fooled about with"" by every conceivable government department. When you listen to the minister's explanation of the amendments to this act you can understand th- concerns of Mr Rigby. He said: · .. it was no longer recognisable and was being used as ""carrots"" to encourage graziers into areas like property management and planning. In my view, our right to implement our own management decisions is under very grave threat. He continued: · .. help was not available unless landholders had an approved property management plan, or signed property enterprise agreement. For these enterprise agreements or property management plans to be understood by people in capital cities, they must understand that the south-west Queensland area is a very large part of Queensland, that towns are not just dotted every 20 or 30 miles, and that the people who could approve these plans are not every 20 or 30 miles down the road. That is what he is referring to when he said that he believed that this had been fooled about by every conceivable level of government and is at grave risk of running off the tracks. Mr Rigby said: I remain very hesitant about the scheme. While I fully support and commend the effort and expertise that has gone into establishing the scheme, and while I most totally support our original aim of property build up in the mulga lands of south west Queensland, the scheme has gone much further and I believe to its detriment. The concerns of the President of the Warrego Graziers Association-we should bear in mind that this was the pilot scheme for a rural approach to rural adjustment in this countrybears out our concerns on this side of the House, and that is why we had this bill sent up to a Senate committee to be investigated. The coalition's decision to send the bill to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee resulted from the lack of information about how the rural adjustment scheme and the regional plans would work, how they would be funded, and whether they would be constitutionally acceptable. These concerns have been borne out by the committee's report, as the minister suggested in his explanatory memorandum. Whilst recommending that the bill be passed without amendments, the Senate committee recorded its concerns that the explanatory memorandum, and in particular the second reading speech, did not contain detailed information on the proposed amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. Mr Andrew-They were our concerns.",137
427,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Absolutely. The honourable member for Wakefield, coming from South Australia with a rural constituency, certainly understands the concerns that we had and the concerns his constituents had. The Attorney-General's Department had concerns. Its report stated: The administrative arrangements to be undertaken by the Commonwealth in relation to the new nonstate-based component of the RAS are not clear from the available material. It is this lack of information which appears to be of concern to the Parliamentary Research Service. In the absence of that information, it is not possible to form a view whether the proposed administrative arrangements would be valid. . That is the Attorney-General's Department in scrutinising this bill. The committee concluded that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the minister must provide information that will allow the parliament to make informed judgments when considering legislation. During the inquiry, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy said that funding for rural adjustment scheme regional plans would come from the underspends of each state-in other words, the underspent amount of each state's rural adjustment funding. The coalition is concerned at evidence given by Mr Malcolm Smith from the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria who said that the federal government wanted to impose a levy on states on top of the underspends, which would create a larger pot of money. Mr Smith correctly pointed out that the Victorian government would not be happy to provide finance for a regional restructuring plan in Queensland. He is quite correct. Quite rightly, any state that puts money into a scheme must receive the benefits for its own citizens. As I said earlier, it is the right of the state to manage the land administration arrangements of the state. The Victorian concerns were also of concern to the coalition. The coalition is aware that the regional restructuring area in Queensland-which is in my own electorate-appears to be welcomed by the people in that area. They were originally very supportive of the scheme. They continue to be supportive of the scheme, but they do not want to be run over by a federal government trying to impose unnecessary conditions on this very important approach to regional adjustment. They want it to be driven from the bottom up---at the grassroots level. These are the people who are out there in the paddocks in the south-west Queensland areas. No-one better understands the problem of the mulga lands or of any rural area than the people who are working it on a day-today basis. For this reason, the coalition is pleased that the government has finally agreed to put forward an amendment in line with the Senate committee's dissenting report which says: . .. as a minimum, the legislation should be amended to require the Commonwealth to consult with the States on regional adjustment initiatives, fully recognising that the States have the bility for land management. The government's amendment ensures that a regional restructuring program cannot go ahead without the agreement of the particular state or territory. If it were not for the concerns of members on this side of the House, a bill would have been passed through this parliament which would have seen the federal government gaining greater control over the rural reconstruction packages out there in rural Australia. Thank goodness the people on this side of the House understand the concerns of those people out in rural Australia. This bill demonstrates yet again the lack of understanding or the lack of knowledge of the problems confronted by people in rural Australia. Whilst this is a small example, it is another example of the arrogance not only of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) but also of those people who would have had a say in the bill when it was. brought forward to their caucus committees. The other government amendments are to the Farm Household Support Act 1992. These amendments are to allow the Commonwealth to reimburse the states for the costs incurred by state rural adjustment scheme authorities in issuing drought exceptional circumstances certificates. These certificates play a very important role. They are certainly being widely used in my own electorate and in many parts of New South Wales. Unfortunately, they are not being issued in Victoria or in some parts of New South Wales which are in desperate need of a declaration of exceptional circumstance. These certificates are used for the purposes of drought relief payments and concessions under the Austudy assets test as evidence that farm enterprises are affected by drought exceptional circumstances. The expected cost to the Commonwealth is $240,000. At this point, I would like to congratulate the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee which today reported to the Senate its finding on the impact of Austudy on rural families. Mr Andrew-Another coalition initiative.",138
428,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Absolutely. I responsicommend the chairman of that committee, Senator Brownhill, a member from the central regions of New South Wales. He is one of those from a drought declared area who is not carrying an exceptional circumstances declaration. In that report to the Senate the committee recommended to abolish the assets test on farm assets. Some of the evidence in that report highlights the lack of understanding of the plight of those families in rural Australia. The great tragedy of the assets test, as it is applied and as it is still being applied in this country, is that the children out there in rural Australia are being denied an education. The assets of parents are stripping their children from being able to receive Austudy and gain secondary or tertiary education. Mr Andrew-And they have to be boarders.",139
429,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Absolutely. This is another matter that those opposite do not understand. There is not a university on every comer of our electorates. In many cases, there is not even a complete secondary education out there in rural Australia. I draw on the experience of my own electorate. Many towns have educational opportunities to year 10. People living in many of those rural towns have to send their children away to a regional centre to complete even secondary education. When it comes to university or tertiary education, they usually have to go to a capital city. I would like to know how on earth the government thinks that assets in a· drought declared area or assets in farm situation will constitute an ability to pay for children's education. So often we see that education and access to it in capital cities is taken as a right, but out there in rural Australia it seems as though the government thinks it can apply different rules. The interesting thing in that report is that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy identified that 5,400 students' would benefit from the removal of the assets test. They would have been eligible under the income test but were being tripped out because of the assets test. On this day, 5,400 students are being tripped out of any assistance in terms of Austudy support because of their parents' assets. Their parents' income clearly means they can qualify, but their parental assets trip them out of assistance from the federal government. I welcome that report, and I congratulate the chairman of that committee for bringing forward that report. Quite clearly, the evidence received out there by committee members was evidence that they listened to. They have certainly understood the plight of those many rural families. The government's approach has been to issue these exceptional circumstances certificates which means that, with the students out there in these drought areas, their parents' onfa:rm assets will not be considered in terms of Austudy eligibility. I would ask the minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Eduction and Training (Mr Free) to look at that report very carefully and to consider it in the context of the removal of the assets test on farm assets. It is just a deplorable situation that, in the 21st century, a report of a parliamentary committee presented to the Senate today identified 5,400 students in rural Australia who are being denied federal government assistance because of a very unfair assets test that has been applied by this Labor government. If this government does not take notice of that report, it will demonstrate yet again the arrogance not only of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) but of the Labor Party as a whole. a The other aspect of the bill that I want to comment on briefly is the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Act 1985. To assist with the restructure of the northern prawn fishery, the Commonwealth government guaranteed a loan obtained from ·the Queensland Treasury Corporation to a maximum of $40.9 million. The loan was paid to the Queensland Fish Management Authority. The Queensland government has since dissolved this authority and established a new body, which took over the previous body's assets, rights and liabilities from 27 January this year. Because of the name change the Commonwealth guarantee no longer legally applies. The Queensland government wants it reinstated to the newly-named body to cover the $13.3 million still owed. Quite clearly, that scheme is working well because the original loan for $40.9 million is now down to $13.3 million. The northern prawn and fishing industry plays avery important part in providing job opportunities in northern Australia, partiCUlarly in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The industry - as entered this restructuring scheme on a voluntary basis; in other words, it is being driven by the fishermen and the people involved in the industry. It is good to see that it has paid off some of that debt. The coalition has no objections to the government's amendments. We are pleased see that, on this occasion, the government has listened to the Senate recommendations on this bill and accepted these amendments. feel that, if the government can listen to read very carefully that Austudy report that was introduced into the Senate today, if it listen as well as it has listened ori this· sion, then perhaps we can progress things for those people out there in rural Australia.",140
430,Mr WAKELIN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Maranoa (M- Bruce 'arrange Scott), who preceded me, has laid out the very well. He was appreciative of the efforts of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Transport References Committee in making valuable additions to this Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). I will concentrate on two or three issues in the bill. Before I do that I would reiterate my belief-as I said yesterday in my speech on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (Drought Relief Measures)-that the rural adjustment scheme, and the farm household support as part of that, can only ever be a second-best to sound economic policy. The point I made yesterday was that when Peter Walsh abolished the old lED scheme he should have put something in its place-as he acknowledged in December of last year. While I was angry yesterday' when I rememcommittee bered that and I expressed that anger in speech, and I still feel that, at least he honourable enough to acknowledge that he should have put something in its place. For a decade we have had an agricultural industry that has been exposed more than it has ever been, or had been in the last 70 80 years, I suggest, certainly since the. Depression. So the rural adjustment scheme, which, I guess, parliaments and politicians from time to time make great play of, can repeated. only ever be second-best to sound economic policies and policies which encourage indiand viduals to be able to take good care of themselves. I note that the speech given by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) talks about a regional component; it talks about flexibility; and it talks about the Commonwealth-State agree to ment. When I look at farm household support, I just want to emphasise flexibility. I know there are hangovers, if you like, precedI ing this current round of federal government and drought legislation where the household support is being held over people's heads. I can would just encourage the government to look occa- at any outstanding issues of household support. I hope that this legislation picks it up; I am not sure that it will. The point is made that people have to for the sale of their property or work case to place the farm on a firmer footing'. In some of these drought situations around the and country, quite frankly, the properties are unsaleable. I really emphasise to the government: please allow the flexibility that you talk about in your speech here tonight. The regional component of the rural adjustment scheme is one that we must handle with great care. On Saturday of this week, a committee set up by the South Australian Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Dale Baker, under the chairmanship of the Hon. Caroline Schaefer very poor of the Legislative CouncilMr Andrew-A good grain grower herself.",141
431,Mr W AKELIN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Absolutely. That committee will meet at Kimba on Saturday morning to look at the region of Eyre Peninsula. I am sure that we in this House would wish the well in its deliberations. The my reason I am cautioning great care upon the was government is that careless words create unnecessary headlines. Two or three months ago we saw headlines running in both the Adelaide Advertiser and a South Australian farm paper which talked about fairly signifior cant inducements to remove people from their Great farms. The wave of resentment, anger and frustration that went around Eyre Peninsula was something that I would not care to see I welcome the efforts of the Senate rural regional affairs committee in trying to - bring a greater sense of balance to this legislation. Here we are not just dealing with markets, rationalists and export income; we are dealing with people's lives. These people have come from a great tradition over many generations. They are under great pressure, and probably have not been under greater pressure since the Great Depression-and some would say it is even greater than that. I am sure that we would wish the committee under the chairmanship of Caroline Schaefer all the best in planning for the future and developing a vision for Eyre Peninsula. We hope that this legislation will give the appropriate umbrella so that people might see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. In the spirit of flexibility, which this legislation talks about, I encourage the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) in the other place to consider the application from that small section of Jervois county, under the district council area of Cleve, to look at the application with sympathy because I understand that the rainfall statistics are certainly within the guidelines of RASAC. Those people would very much appreciate an opportunity to participate in that program. To highlight my personal involvement in the industry, in the 12 months from January to December 1994 the rainfall I experienced on my own farm was two inches below anything that I had ever experienced and, I would suggest, this century. My area will not be able to participate in the program-and I am certainly not asking that it should be-but I mention the fact that I had rainfall of 350 points or just under 100 millimetres. If people understand agriculture, they will realise that that is not very much rain. Mr Andrew-That makes education pretty tough.",141
432,Mr W AKELIN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Yes, indeed. It is very difficult to give a regional approach, but I do welcome it because in 1988, when we were at a low ebb, it was impossible to get government of any kind to recognise a regional approach to these issues.",142
433,Mr REID,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) is an omnibus bill which amends several primary industry acts. The coalition sent it to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee because there was a fear that the government may use the rural adjustment scheme to interfere in land use without consulting the states and to force people out of farming in a regional restructure, against the wishes of the local community. As a result of that Senate committee's dissenting report, an amendment is required. The government has moved other amendments which now have to be considered. It is these other amendments I want to talk about because one of them is anti-Victorian. The government amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 are to allow the Commonwealth to reimburse the states for the costs incurred by the state rural adjustment scheme authorities in issuing drought exceptional circumstances certificates. Victoria cannot get these certificates because the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and RASAC have not visited the area, nor will they provide drought relief for north central Victoria, which is experiencing the absolute worse drought in its history. I understand that RASAC, the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee, will be visiting the area next Saturday under the chairmanship of Neil Inall. It will be met by the state Minister for Agriculture, Mr Bill MCGRATH, at Wycheproof, in the Mallee just north of Bendigo, and it will inspect the areas. The declaring of north central Victoria as a drought relief area under the exceptional circumstances provisions has been delayed and the government has provided drought relief to Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia but not to Victoria. I can tell you that this is an anti-Victoria stance. It has adopted a regional approach in terms of drought, but the whole region of north central Victoria is gripped by the most dreadful drought in its history. These exceptional circumstances certificates are used for the purposes of drought relief payments. My constituents in central Victoria cannot get these certificates because the Commonwealth government-the federal Labor govemmentwill.not declare the area a drought area. The bill also gives concessions under the Austudy assets test as evidence that farm enterprises are affected by drought-exceptional circumstances. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is certainly an exceptional drought. I do not know what circumstances they want, but people are buying water because they have no water in their dams, their properties are dust bowls, they losing their stock and they have been handfeeding sheep and cattle for months. I deplore the government's lack of action on this. I am pleased that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is at the table and I am disappointed that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) left the House after reading that glib second reading speech which made everything look rosy and wonderful in the country and which said that we are going to have this grand recovery. What recovery? These people have not even got water for their own domestic use. They have not got water for their stock. They have got the high costs of borrowing to handfeed all of their stock. I think the Minister for Justice is a pretty fair and honourable minister. If there is any sense of justice and equity in his soul, he should run across to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and tell him to get down to Victoria and have a look at what is going on there with the drought because it is in a shocking condition at the moment. I have had a great deal of correspondence from constituents in my area who are running out of water and are having to buy it at $80 a tank load. This is lasting no time at all because of the circumstances that they are going through-trying to feed stock and trying to keep them going. The Red Cross in north central Victoria has been supplementing the farmers with financial assistance to buy water, and the other welfare agencies have been providing food packs to them. They arereally in desperate trouble. On Saturday RASAC will inspect the Mallee at Wycheproof and work its way down through the Bendigo area. Bill MCGRATH, the state minister, has been very supportive. The state has provided financial assistance from its limited resources; but, without the Commonwealth coming in and declaring that area an area of extreme drought, they cannot get the benefit of Commonwealth support that is so urgently needed. I want to elaborate on what I believe are exceptional circumstances in north central Victoria. They are in the middle of a drought at this moment. The previous year they had a mouse plague, which wiped out most of the are grain crops, and the previous year was so wet that many of the crops produced very poor yields. As I indicated to the House, I have received a lot of correspondence on this. I have one letter from Raywood, which is just north of Bendigo, which says: Dear Mr Reid, I am just writing to see if you can do something for us, drought stricken farmers in this area-North Central Victoria Our main house dam is dry, so we are carting water, feeding sheep, hay and grain every day. Our neighbours are in the same situation. The paddocks are getting barer and barer. We are not eligible for Austudy allowance because of the asset test which makes us so cross. Only hope you will be able to present a case at Parliament next week and we will be able to get some assistance for keeping our farm going until the rain comes. Please do all you can for us. Yours sincerely Clare ... That is just typical of many of the farmers in my area. Another letter says: Dear Mr Reid, I'm writing to you as an attempt to get a message across to the people in parliament. I'd like to ask them to go without their income for 12 months but still have to pay bills, feed and clothe kids who are growing. My teenage son grew out of 3 pairs of school shoes last year and when he now takes a size 12 shoe you have to pay men's prices. I cry every time we have to kill our sheep. I'm sick to my boots when I have to help my husband clean out the green rotting stinking dams. I look out of our windows and the ground looks grey, like it's dead. . If we fight it's twice as bad as the fights are over money. I used to get $250 a week to feed my family and to buy clothes for them and any other needs that may arise. I now have to try and do the same on $100. I have had to go to work to try and make ends meet and that means my children are home by themse1vesaf'ter school. I feel I'm failing them as I'm not there to help them with their homework and other problems. I know Mr Keating could not give a fig about us but I hope someone will listen soon before it's too late. That is why I mentioned the Minister for Justice, who is at the table, because he has got feeling for these people. I would want him to take the message from north central Victoria that we are in very severe drought. People are having to buy water and handfeed stock. I can assure the minister that all these letters are genuine. They have got signatures, but I do not wish to embarrass those people. They are a proud people. They do not want to have to get on their hands and knees to beg. But I can assure the minister that things are extremely grim in that area. The summary of the bill and the explanation which the Assistant Treasurer gave tonight paint a glossy picture of all these wonderful things the government is doing and the support it is supposedly giving. That might have been given in parts of Queensland and New South Wales and in parts of the area of my colleague the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), but nothing at all has come from the Commonwealth to assist the people of north central Victoria. That is discrimination against the people in that area. They are feeling the effects of this drought, and there is no sign of a break. They are going into another season. They have to borrow yet more money to ensure that they can plant for next season. All the costs are up-front. They have to buy fuel, seed and superphosphate. They have to borrow the money. They have to make the decision now to borrow the money, to go to the banks to seek additional financial support, and put themselves further and further into debt. This bill is about the Farm Household Support Act 1992. It says it will do all these wonderful things at an expected cost to the Commonwealth of $240,000. That does not seem a lot of money to me. If some of my farming constituents could get their hands on $240,000, plus the certificate to get drought relief under the exceptional circumstances provisions, it would certainly help them greatly. I appeal to the minister at the table. I would have taken the opportunity to appeal to the Assistant Treasurer, because he has a role in this. It is time the Assistant Treasurer, the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy did something. It should not take until May. That is the time the government says it will take to get drought relief, even if it is approved by the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee. If they went down this weekend and had a look at the area and saw the condition it is in, surely they could make a decision within seven to 14 days-not let it run on until May. It is decision making time for these farmers now. They have to decide whether they will borrow that additional money and put in a crop for next year in the hope that they will have a decent season. I appeal to both ministers in this chamber to go to Senator Collins and get some action out of him, because it is absolutely desperate. Without the assistance of the Commonwealth, the state can only do a limited amount, and it is doing that to the best of its ability and financial resources. The Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, Bill MCGRATH, has been a very valuable ally to these farmers. He has been pushing and doing everything possible to assist them by providing whatever relief he can from the state's resources. It now requires the assistance of the Commonwealth. Without that financial assistance-a whole farming community, where there are third and fourth generation farmers, is talking about leaving the land-we could lose a whole generation of farmers, and that would be an absolute tragedy. They are all efficient farmers. They produce high quality products which go to export markets, but without the assistance of the Commonwealth and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy those people will pack up and leave the land in central Victoria.",142
434,Mr ANDREW,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Wakefield) (9.55 p.m.)As all other speakers have indicated, we are dealing tonight with government amendments in the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1994. Coalition speakers are prominent on the speakers list for this oill because we are proud that the coalition has been largely responsible for the amendments which have occurred in the Senate. When the original legislation came before the House, while the coalition welcomed much of it, we expressed concern about the lack of regional input into the rural adjustment scheme as it was to be amended by the legislation. In the Senate the coalition sought the referral of this legislation to a Senate committee, and it is to the credit particularly of coalition senators Crane and Panizza that the changes that we have before the House now were recommended by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The Senate committee of inquiry had its genesis in the enthusiasm the coalition had for greater cooperation between regional bodies and the government in the implementation of any form of rural assistance. Lest those introductory remarks seem a little too partisan, I should add that concerns about the way this legislation has been structured were not only expressed by the coalition. The Attorney-General's Department also said that it felt that the administrative arrangepayments, ments laid down in these legislative changes were not clear. The amendments that are being considered tonight, referred to this chamber by the Senate, call for greater consultation between the Commonwealth bodies, the state bodies and regional bodies. In the administration of the rural adjustment scheme and in the RAS act arrangements, there is enthusiasm now, as a result of this call for consultation, for cooperation between the regional bodies and the administrators of the RAS act and consultation with the state governments, as they administer this form of rural assistance. This level of consultation is entirely appropriate, and the coalition believes that it should never have been necessary for the coalition to seek these amendments in the first place because the need for this sort of consultation should have been apparent to the federal government. Land management, which is fundamentally what rural adjustment is all about and which gives people the opportunity to make changes in their farming lifestyle under the RASAC scheme, is a state issue. Had this legislation proceeded without the changes that the coalition and, more accurately, the Senate committee sought, then this state authority in land management would have been further unwittingly eroded by this Commonwealth act. Instead, we now have a situation where, thanks to these amendments, there will be consultation where the concerns that the Attorney-General's Department had expressed are now cleared up and the administrative arrangements that were once cloudy are now much more transparent and satisfactory from the point of view of both the government and the coalition. All speakers dealing with this legislation have emphasised that these changes to rural assistance deal with people in need. In fact, the amendments currently being considered by the House provide an opportunity for reimbursement to the state governments where drought exceptional circumstances certificates are issued to farmers in particular need. These drought exceptional circumstances certificates allow farmers who are in need and in drought declared areas to access both drought relief which they clearly need in order to put food on their tables, and, significantly, Austudy payments regardless of their assets. The member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has already made it perfectly plain, and has been quite unequivocal, that one of the major problems facing farmers in his area, in my area or in drought declared areas of Australia is their inability to access tertiary education for their teenaged children, principally because they do not have the income. They have the assets. Frequently these assets in drought declared areas cannot be sold. The assets prevent them accessing Austudy. Under the arrangements that are currently considered for drought exceptional circumstances certificates, it will be possible for them, in spite of their assets, to access Austudy. This recognises that their income is so low that, were those assets .in any form other than farm assets, they would have been able to access Austudy. The absurdity of the Austudy arrangements is that many farmers who have assets of over $1 million cannot access Austudy. If those assets were in a house in Double Bay or in a house in West Lakes in South Australia, they would have the capacity to access Austudy. It is a capacity which has been denied to them, unless they are eligible for drought exceptional circumstances certificates. Mr Bruce Scott-It is grossly unfair.",144
435,Mr ANDREW,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"--'-Itdoes seem to be grossly unfair. I recognise, as does the coalition, that the government appreciates the fact that farm assets are relatively unproductive and has doubled the asset level for farmers. In the circumstances in which much of Australia currently finds itself, as the member for Maranoa said, that does not allow a large number of farmers to access tertiary education for their children. Without that tertiary education, their children are doomed to a lesser standard of living. A part of my electorate is drought stricken, but it is not drought declared. I do not stand here tonight pleading that it should be drought declared, because the circumstances are not as dire as those outlined by the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). It is an illustration of just how capricious climatic conditions can be that within one hour of the city of Adelaide is country that is currently occupied by people who see this land as land that has a capacity to be subdivided to offer accommodation for commuters to Adelaide. That land is probably overinflated in value. A number of those farmers, because of the shortage of rain, are unable to make ends meet in this financial year. It is a very narrow strip of country. It probably starts about where the city of Gawler is and ends at about the town of Tarlee. This land runs through the centre of South Australia and is in my electorate. It is some of Australia's prime grain growing country and certainly is South Australia's prime grain growing country. It is just north of Adelaide. It is decidedly dry. The farmers are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. They will not qualify for drought assistance. As their representative, I do not think that I can stand here and realistically claim that they should qualify. I can claim that, had the government recognised just how unpredictable farming can be, it would have taken action to maintain the income equalisation deposits scheme that the Fraser government put in place and so allow these farmers to make preparations for years such as these. My farmers are not coming to me pleading for government intervention, but . it is obvious that their capacity to budget and to prepare for the downturn that they are experiencing now has been frustrated by the government's inability to provide the same sort of lED scheme as the Fraser government once had in place. As the member for Bendigo said, the amendment would allow those farmers who are, as my farmers are, in sufficiently difficult circumstances to qualify for the drought exceptional circumstances certificates to access Austudy. That amendment alone would cost the government a mere quarter of a million dollars, which is very little in terms of the total drought outlay and the total losses being faced by farmers who currently cannot make ends meet simply because there has been too little rain. In taking into consideration just what drought has done to Australia and how slow the government has been to respond, it is rather chastening that much of the initial work done to assist farmers was by volunteers like the CWAs across Australia and by public figures like prominent television personalities such as Ray Martin. What is little known is that in my state last week an initiative was launched by the premier of South Australia, Mr Dean Brown. In cooperation with the chairman of John Shearer Ltd, Andrew Gwinnett, Mr Brown launched a campaign to be known as 'Seeds of hope'. The South Australian government made available $10,000. It is hoped that through public funding this $10,000 will grow to allow the John Shearer organisation to administer a fund that will enable drought stricken farmers to get, without any cost to them at all, the seeds they need to sow this year's crop. I commend John Shearer for this initiative. They are offering all the administrative arrangements without charge. I also commend the Premier of South Australia for his preparedness to be identified with the program and to make $10,000 available as foundation funding. This will mean that farmers whose situation is so desperate that they'cannot afford the seed to sow this year's crop will have access to free seed and will be assured not only of a harvest his year but also of the opportunity to once again be proud and independent Australians who are able to look after their land without being dependent on handouts either of the charitable form or from governments. I think that deserves a mention and deserves commendation. As I deal with the legislation before the House and the changes that will occur drought stricken Australia, let me say that the report. government-I could say the parliament but I guess it is fairer to say the government-in making drought assistance available to Australian farmers has probably committed Australian taxpayers to some $270 million or $300 million. If we were generous we could say $400 million. That includes funding for rural councils and all other assistance, which is difficult to measure. That seems like a reasonable sum. When you consider that it takes only the smallest movement in interest rates to cost Australian farmers billions of dollars, you begin to see not only. how relatively insignificantthis total package is-I do not mean that in an ungracious way-but also how essential responsible, total economic management is. If farmers had a predictable economy they would be much better able to cope with the fluctuations in weather that characterise Australian farming. My plea once again is for the government to recognise the desperate situation of farmers. They need some predictable economic circumstances and the opportunity to access an effective lED scheme. They are anxious to be independent and proud Australians. A matter which has not been referred the debate tonight because the focus has tended to be entirely on the drought is that original bill-the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill-also included a change to the Australian tural Corporation Act 1987 and changes to the administration and meeting obligations of the Australian Dried Fruits Board. I mention this because what is currently widely mooted the dried fruits community and the grape wine community is the proposal advocated in the recently released draft report of the committee of inquiry into the wine and wine grape industry which suggested a change in the way in which the wine industry is taxed. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware---"":'I know the member for Mallee is well aware of the proposal that came out; it has an immediate impact on the dried fruit industry-that there is to be a change in the taxation on wine so that a volumetric tax is imposed. The three commissioners of inquiry into the wine grape in and wine industry came out with a divided One commissioner brought out a minority report advocating a sales tax of 32 per cent and a volumetric tax or excise of $4 a litre. The other two commissioners brought out a majority report advocating a sales tax of 10 per cent and a volumetric tax of $4 per litre of alcohol. I mention this in the closing stages of this debate because it is significant that the one person who advocated a minority report did so recognising that a volllJ.r..etric tax would impact most unfairly on what are called nonpremium varieties of grapes. The dried vine fruits industry, which is covered by a part of this bill, is the principal grower of what are called non-premium varieties. I refute the term 'non-premium' because it implies inferiority. That is not true at all. They are superior dried vine fruit varieties but are inferior in the eyes of winemakers; important, but inferior. The House needs to appreciate two things. Firstly, any form of volumetric tax, any form of excise, per litre of alcohol means that premium varieties put into, for example, a red wine at $22 a bottle, containing a certain amount of alcohol at $4 a litre, may result in an increase in the cost of that $22 bottle of, to in say, $4. But a cask made from the nonpremium varieties also has a similar amount the of alcohol in it and this would result in the price of a $5 cask increasing by $4. Clearly, that is a very inequitable way to go about Horticultaxing this industry. I raise this point because, if the government were to entertain any form of excise at all, it should look at what the change in excise did into the brandy industry. A graph of brandy production in Australia indicates that as excise rose across the graph brandy production fell. There is a real risk for the wine industry in the application of an excise and what it may do to the industry. But should such an excise be considered? It should not be considered unless there was an opportunity to relieve the excise on brandy and so allow some of the non-premium varieties to go back into the brandy industry because they would no longer be in demand in the wine industry. These are the very varieties that the dried fruit industry currently depends OA for its export market and it sees the brandy industry as a safety valve for that industry. I am, pleased to commend the government for the changes that it has made in adopting the. coalition's recommendations to el1sure there is greater consultation in the application of its drought assistance., Question resolved in the affirmative.

438,Mr MCLACHLAN,SERVICE MEDALS,"I have received a communication this evening from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch). That communication arrived in a sealed envelope addressed to me- Mr LM. MCLachlan AO MP, Suite RI07, telelift station 10-3. The minister has informed me that he is presenting medals to World War II diggers. He says: This public recognition of their service to the country is long overdue and it is particularly that it comes in the year of remembrance. I agree with that. He tells my that the ceremony will be held at the Keswick Barracks in Adelaide on 11 April. As I have been the recipient in recent weeks of a communication addressed to me and the subject of much criticism by those on the other side of the House, I would like to tell you what the third paragraph of the letter says. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel says: I sincerely apologise to you for the short notice associated with the presentation, but as approval for the awarding of your medal has only recently been received from the Queen, I am very keen to be able to present this to you as soon as possible. In other words, the minister is going to present a medal to me at Keswick on 11 April for my service in the Second World War. I raise this subject because I sat here today while the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) accused me of theft of documents and other things that turned up in my office. Tonight I have a communication from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, who says to me that he is going to present a medal to me. Mr Johns- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.

446,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION," Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, before I start, could I say how grateful I am to see how fresh and enthusiastic you are in the chair tonight after your exercise. It just goes to prove that you should get more of it! In speaking to the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1995, it is very important to define weapons of mass destruction. It is a term used to describe nuclear, biological and chemical weapons which are capable of resulting' in mass destruction of a population. Australia is a party to three international treaties concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which was ratified in Australia on 23 January 1973, is substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their DestructioJ;lJ which was ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977, is substantially implemented by the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976. A Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction was ratified on 6 May 1994, but has not yet come into force internationally. It will be substantially implemented by the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, which will come into force on a date to be proclaimed or upon the convention coming into force. I think it is very useful to let the parliament know just where we stand as far as our adherence to the treaty is concerned. I have before me a research paper published as late as March this year, entitled It 'Crunch Time for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'. In annex C, there are a few facts and figures about the NPT. The paper states that 173 countries are members of it and that Taiwan and Yugoslavia are not counted. It is a pity that recognition was not given to Taiwan in the United Nations, but the following 14 countries have not yet acceded to the treaty: Angola; Brazil; Chile; Comoros; Cuba; Djibouti; Federated States of Micronesia; India, which has a population of some 800 million; Israel, which is a small nation in the Middle East; Oman; Pakistan; Palau; United Arab Emirates; and Vanuatu. - t is important to recognise that those 14 countries have not yet acceded to the treaty. This legislation implements our adherence to the treaty and, in endorsing it this 'way, is fully responding to our fuIl obligations. I have also received some letters from Greenpeace. Annex D in the researchpaper has suggested a 25-year timetable for achieving 'complete nuclear disarmament. The point being made by Greenpeace is that this legislation does nothing to implement that _timetable. The concern is that, without that implementation, our legislation itself could be deficient and the treaty certainly could be. Greenpeace' s news release states: . Clearly, though, the Nuclear Weapons States have not kept their part of the ""bargain"". Since the NPT came into force in 1970, the arsenals of the Nuclear Weapons States have increased massively. 75,000 new nuclear weapons' have been deployed and hundreds of nuclear tests conducted. . A member of Non-Nuclear Weapon State signatories, such as Indonesia and Mexico, now want to strengthen the disarmament commitments in the NPT by introducing a timetable or set goals for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Their proposals would see the NPT extended for fixed periods, such as five years, with disarmament goals to be met within these periods. It goes very much back to the timetable within that. It does highlight a particular point on disarmament right across the world in that, as circumstances vary over time, we adopt one standard and then move on to another. Certainly, the big variance in this regard is the ending of the Cold War, the pulling down of the Berlin Wall and the fragmentation of the USSR into many smaller nations, Russia still being the most predominant. It allows a different set of circumstances. As I understand it, some of the 13 nations that previously were part of the USSR-I will not say all of them-now have access to nuclear weapons. Also, we know there is a problem in that, in the disarming of some of those nuclear weapons, they might be transferred to other countries which might be nonsignatories or signatories. The important point to make is that, as I understand it, the signing of a treaty does not necessarily commit a country to adhering to the principles of a treaty. Clause 7 sets out the constitutional basis of the bill. It relies on the following constitutional powers: the external affairs power (s51 (xxix)) to the extent that it gives effect to the Biological Weapons Convention, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Chemica! Weapons Convention, or to the extent that the matters are external to Australia or matters of international concern; the defence power (s51 (vi)); the corporations power (s51 (xx)); and the trade and commerce power (s51(i)). It is very important to note that it is the external affairs power of the constitution that enables us to adhere to our treaty commitments by virtue of this bill. It might seem very grand that 173 countries are members of the NPT but, of those 173 countries, how many have individually legislated-as Australia has-through their external affairs power to actually put this into force? I think it is very important that, while a lot of people see a treaty signed as being cast in concrete and having particular powers, it does not have the power until it is legislated in the government of the member country. While we are adhering to it, how many of these other countries that are signatories are yet to do it? My particular concern-and I think it would be the concern of everyone-is the manner in which the nuclear weapons of mass destruction in the former areas of Russia are being treated. I am particularly concerned because we know there are countries throughout the world that are very anxious to increase their nuclear weapons. I mentioned India, which is a non-signatory. There is also Iraq and a number of other countries, including North Korea, which was a crisis point last year. The Greenpeace document says that Indonesia and Mexico have a particular interest in this. I was fortunate to be selected by this parliament, along with the honourable member for Jagajaga(Mr Staples), to representthe Australian parliament at the 49th General Assembly. I was not involved in the discussions, but it gave me a lot of pleasure to be able to sit in on some of the discussions of the Western nations, of which Australia forms a bloc, where these matters were treated seriously. I suggest that Australia very strongly support the Indonesian and Mexican situation to ensure that a timetable is there. The protagonists of such a move were some of the present nuclear states. We mentioned five of the nuclear states. I believe that some of those were resistant to the lodging of a timetable. I agree with Greenpeacethat we need a definite timetable within the treaty and all countries to become partners to that obligation by legislating, as we have done here. As far as treaties are concerned, my experience with the United Nations is that you can sign treaties but they are not binding outside the UN. The UN has no power of enforcement. I think it is very important to realise that some countries-for example, Francewill sign and endorse all treaties. But France does 'not adhere to any of the treaties of the United Nations. Again I ask: to what extent has France legislated to make it enforceable on itself? On the other hand, the United Nations can give many examples of countries that will not sign treaties but will adhere to most of them. To put that in context, while we are legislating to bind Australia, its citizens and its corporations to this treaty, it does not rily mean that there is a grand world out there where the UN has an enforcement capacity. It does not. The only enforcement capacity comes from the inside. I have mentioned the Cold War. Just this year, the Public Works Committee was privileged to examine the Maralinga site with a view to approving work there to reduce the danger that still exists from plutonium-contaminated sand and other material. At the time it all happened, science was not even able to experiment with these devices, let alone treat the consequences of them. When you go out there now, you appreciate that somebody is trying to do something in a modern context with modern technology to ensure that the situation is controlled. I do not think we should look over our shoulder and cast all the blame on the Brits, the French, the Americans or anyone else who worked on this technology at that earlier time. For their part in the discussions held at the 49th assembly, I have to pay particular tribute to Richard Starr and the other members of the Australian team who came over from Geneva. They put their hearts and souls into it, working almost 24 hours a day while they were there to get an agreement on adherence to a timetable for the Mexican-Indonesian situation. I have to say that Australians are regarded almost as a neutral factor in a lot of the things that happen at the United Nations because, although we are attached to the Europeans, we are isolated in the Southern Hemisphere. Everything on which Australia takes a view is listened to. We are regarded as one of the arbitrators within the United Nations, getting agreement between different factions. In the discussions on weapons of mass destruction and in the agreements drawn up, Australia was a lively and well-briefed participant and our views were well regarded. The dangers posed to our modern society are very evident. I have already mentioned countries, such as North Korea, Iraq and former USSR states, that do not know what to do with their nuclear weapons. I also mention the more recent chemical weapons attacks on the Kurds in Iraq and the nerve gas that was released in the Japanese subway as necessa- examples of terrorist activity. One of the first lessons that the member for Jagajaga and I received at the United Nations mission was that, for all the work it does, the UN requires the almost unanimous approval of 184 nations in order to bring forward a convention. I regard it as the system of the lowest common denominator: you keep dropping your standards until you get agreement. It was also interesting to see that the UN is very lively now that the Republicans have the majority in the US Congress and are renewing the call for sovereign rights. That is something that is applicable to Australia. I have no problem with the use of the external affairs power in this instance, but the Americans are asking how far they can let their sovereignty go to organisations within the UN. While I was there it was suggested that America's share of the UN budget, which is currently 30 per cent, be dropped to 25 per cent. That was causing a lot of concern within United Nations circles. The World Trade Organisation and GATT are not creatures of the UN, but it is typical of the Americans' new claim to sovereignty that they have said they will enter into the new World Trade Organisation with this caveat: in 12 months time they will revisit the situation to ensure that what they have signed away will not affect their sovereign rights. That is a very important change in an era of change. This year sees the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. Out of the respect in which it is held by Australians, Richard Butler, the Australian mission head, will share in the celebrations. It appears to me that over those 50 years the UN has extended its activities quite considerably. Where it once had expertise in certain limited areas, it has since expanded its activities and its public service to the point where it is today a kind of jack of all trades and master of none. For example, while it has developed techniques of peacekeeping, its peacekeeping efforts are not coordinated; its peacekeeping does not flow the way it should. While the UN is held to be the authority on peacekeeping, it is not doing all that well in that respect. One of the major concerns of the UN-in fact, one of the world's major concerns-is the destructive capability of the landmines that have been sown in their millions throughout warring countries in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere. This poses a significant problem because in their collective entirety they could be regarded as a weapon of mass destruction. A question was asked about that this week during question time. It is something that should be given serious consideration because like the plutonium at Maralinga-which is there, which will stay there, and which will be a problem for the next 24,000 years of its half-life-these landmines will be active for many years to come. There is a need for the United Nations, working in consultation with its member nations, to come to an agreement on the supply of these weapons-aIl Western nations, even though they are members of the United Nations, are guilty in that respect-""-On the control of their proliferation, and on the way to fix the situation. My experience of the UN makes me feel that there is a need for major reconstruction and a major look at its activities in this its 50th year. I hope that will be the case. Australia is the voice of experience, and I believe we are held in respect by other member nations. Debate (on motion by Mr Chynoweth) adjourned.

447,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I bring to the attention of this chamber an extraordinary letter that I received today. I think it is very similar to one that my colleague the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) received. It is from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), who I notice is present in the chamber. Mr RonaldsQn-:-I've got one too.",152
448,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,My colleague the member for Ballarat says he has one too. Mr Ronaldson-It's extraordinary.,152
449,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It really is an extraordinary letter. This letters begins by saying that, as the minister, he is presenting medals to World War II diggers. He goes on to talk about the fact that he believes that public recognition for their service is long overdue. I would not question that at all-in fact, I would probably endorse it. He then goes on to talk about a presentation ceremony that will be held at the Victoria Barracks on Tuesday, 11 April. It talks about some of the arrangements that are to be made for that. But he then goes on to make an extraordinary statement. He says: I sincerely apologise for the short noticethe which is okay; maybe he had a reason for that. But he goes on to say: . . but as the approval for the awarding of your medalMr Ronaldson-Whose?",152
450,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mine. Mr Ronaldson-Your medal?,152
451,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, my medal. He continues: . . . has only recently been received from The Queen, I am very keen to be able to presentthis to you as soon as possible. I am very flattered about this. I think about it and I say, 'Hang on a minute. I was not even alive during World War II and I am going to get a medal for it.' I really have to say that this is quite extraordinary. Why is it that a minister of the Crown has written to me, has written to my colleague the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and has written to my colleague the member for Barker saying that we are going to get a medal for service during World War II? I have to say in all honesty that I cannot accept it because I was not even alive. This raises very serious points. This government seems to take great delight in criticising some members of the opposition for the fact that they have received information from people involved with the government and then has turned around and made very gross accusations because those people have actually opened the letters. I have opened this letter because it was addressed to me, just as my colleague the member for Barker opened some mail that was addressed to him. This is the extraordinary thing: he received some mail that was addressed to him and opened it, yet the government turned around and made some great fabrication that, because his mail was addressed to him and he opened it, he should be held in some sort of contempt of this parliament. Even though the government had ensured, through its own mechanisms, that this mail was sent to him and that he should open it, the government feels he should be held responsible for the fact that this was not meant to be directed to him. I make the point that this mail was directed very clearly to me. In fact, it was directed to my electorate office. It has today's date but has not been sent to my electorate-it has been sent straight to me in my Parliament House office-and, obviously, I have opened it. What is the difference between this mail being sent to my office in Hamilton but arriving at my office here in Canberra and the mail that was supposedly under the control of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner)? Apparently, he will not accept responsibility for the fact that the mail that was supposed to be directed to his office did not in fact arrive there. I raise a very serious question about the government seeming to have two standards. There was the mail that they found politically advantageous to them and there is the mail here which is a real embarrassment. It is a very real embarrassment because it was sent to a number of members of the opposition. That it has been sent to me offering me a medal for my service during World War II when I was not even alive shows that the government has made what can only be described as a complete mess-a complete stuff up. Since the minister is now present, he really has to give a very serious explanation as to how he has allowed this to happen and how this is different from the treatment that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has given my colleague. (Time expired) Service Medals  fence Science and Personnel) (l0.46 p.m.)-I am glad the opposition tried to have a bit of fun with this and, in an attempt to get the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) off his own hook, denigrate the very decent and rightful awarding to World War II diggers of long overdue medals-something that has bipartisan support in this place. Let me explain how this letter has come about. There are two typos in this letter. Mr MCLachlan-You messed it up.  in my office has made two typos in the second last paragraph of this letter. The paragraph reads: I sincerely apologise for the short notice associated with the presentation but as approval for the awarding of your meda\it should read 'the medal'has only recently been received from The Queenand there was great effort put in by the Governor General's staff and Buckingham Palace on this to facilitate the presentation of these medals by ANZAC DayI am very keen to be able to present this to you as soon as possible. Obviously the 'to you' should not be in there. This letter has gone out to all members and senators with those two minor mistakes. There is an addendum going out tomorrow. I want to make this very clear. We have done nothing since the CIDA report last year but rush this whole medals process through as quickly as we could. We did that for simple reasons. We made a pledge-with the support of the opposition-that we would attempt to do this before ANZAC Day, because some of the men and women who will be receiving these medals are in danger of dying before they get their medal. One fellow has cancelled a heart operation so he can turn up at one of these presentation days to get his medal for his long overdue recognition. It is very important to them. That is why we have moved with all haste to get this letter out. My staff has worked very hard on this, particularly the young lady involved in this. I will be putting out an addendum which will change the word 'your' to 'the'. I will also correct the letter so that it will not read 'present this to you' - the 'to you' will excluded. If you read the rest of the letter, you will see that what I am attempting to do here what the government has been attempting to do all along, with the cooperation of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the opposition, and that is to make the issue medals a bipartisan activity. Every member and senator in the relevant states is being invited by my office on the basis that this should be a bipartisan effort in the year remembrance to recognise the contribution these diggers. For you to get make a big show over two typos in something like this when we have done the right thing and tried to get the letter to your Parliament House offices before you go back to your tanker electoratesMrs Moylan-That's no excuse.  are two typographical mistakes. The letter opened was addressed to him. The case rests. Mr MCLachlan- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I did not open it.

Mr MCLachlan-You were talking about the letters back in January.",153
452,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The minister will resume his seat. Kirki Salvage  matter I wish to bring to the attention of the House concerns an act of extreme bravery and courage on the part of the members of the Kirki salvage operation, which ultimately saved Australians from a multimillion dollar oil spill clean up operation. It was an act of bravery above and beyond their normal duties that saved the coast of Western Australia from an environmental disaster, and one that has been recognised as being worthy of the Star be of Courage medal for conspicuous bravery. It is also an act of bravery that this government has seen fit to cash in on. This governis ment has actually taxed the money paid to these men as a reward for their bravery. On 28 July 1991 the Greek oil tanker Kirki broke up in heavy seas just 30 kilometres off the of coast of Western Australia near Jurien Bay. She carried a cargo of 82,000 tonnes of crude oil. Most members will be aware that this part of the coast has a worldwide significance as of a marine conservation area. The area around of the Ningaloo Reefhas been declared a marine up tonight and park to protect it. The bow of the Kirki had broken off and she had lost about 20,000 tonnes of her cargo. The decision was taken to tow the crippled out to sea and to transfer the remaining cargo to the 90,000 tonne Flying Clipper which would dock alongside her. A constituent of mine from Boyanup, Mr Kevin Hurley, was the man who made that spectacular leap he in huge seas-watched by millions of TV viewers-from the Tender Lady Kathleen to the Kirki. Mr Hurley carried a tow line which allowed the Kirki to be towed out to sea away from the coastline and further damage. The Kirki was so badly damaged that her cargo oil was spilling into the ocean. She was on fire and there was every likelihood that the ship would break up and the entire 82,000 tonnes would be washed up on WA beaches. Had my constituent not taken that leap onto the Kirki, the outcome would have been considerably worse. Mr Hurley's actions during that rescue operation went way beyond his normal day-today job. His Star of Cousensible rage medal is testimony to that. He would have been quite within his rights to say, 'This is too dangerous,' and no-one would have thought less of him. Naturally, when he received his reward of $28,000, Mr Hurley and his young family were delighted. They did not realise that this government would assess the $28,000 reward as income and him for it. The government had put its hand out for a share of the reward money. I took this matter up with the Australian Office on 15 February 1994. The Deputy Commissioner said: It is recognised that Mr Hurley made a significant contribution to the salvage operation. However, the payment he received is remuneration for personal services rendered and is assessable income in accordance with the Income Tax Assessment Act. I raised the matter with the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and was told there is no discretion to waive the tax assessed. The Assistant Treasurer told me: Mr Hurley is an employee of P&O Maritime Services and the payment of $28,373 is clearly incidental to that employment as it represents remuneration for services rendered on the Lady Kathleen, the vessel on which Mr Hurley was employed. I can assure the Assistant Treasurer and the House that Mr Hurley's response to that decision has been one of total outrage. Constituents have called my office and told me they simply cannot believe any government could stoop so low as to actually tax a man's bravery. The message this sends out from the government is quite plain. If you carry out some brave, courageous deed for the benefit of your fellow Australians, you can expect to be taxed on any reward money. Clearly, this government places a different value on these actions. of This government treats income as incomeeven if it is a reward for conspicuous bravery. It also puts into question the actions of our police officers, firemen and emergency services personnel, whose actions go above and heroic beyond their normal duties. The Assistant Treasurer has said in regard to this case that there is no discretion to waive the tax assessed. Clearly, there is only one course of action open to the government-to change the system so that the Assistant Treasurer can, at his discretion, waive the tax assessed. No-one is paid as part of his or her normal employment for acts of extreme bravery. Mr Hurley might well have said, 'My life is more important than the marine environment.' But he did not, and we tax should all be grateful to him. We should praise his actions and encourage others to put their fellow Australians first. We should not Taxation slap a tax on their bravery. Justice: Western Australia",154
453,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I am having problems with Mr John MCKechnie, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Western Australia. I noticed today in the West Australian a letter to the editor from Mr Robert Smith QC. The letter needs to be taken with the knowledge of Mr Robert Smith's background and his close past association with Mr MCKechnie. He headed his letter 'DPP independence at risk'. The truth is this: John MCKechnie and the DPP represent power without responsibility, power without limit and power that has corrupted. Mr Robert Smith suggests in his letter that I should have gone to the official corruption commission and let it handle this matter. That of course is, as Mr Robert Smith QC knows, an absolute joke. Mr John Porter sits on the official corruption commission. Had I gone there, my complaint simply would have been handed back to CIB, which would put it right back in the hands of Mr Les Ayton. Mr Ayton would have then called in Mr Trevor Porter, the son of John Porter-whom he called, I might add, to investigate claims by policemen that they were harassed over Mr MCKechnie's recent actions. You have here a closed loop which is impossible to break. Rather than attacking its independence, I propose to protect the independence of the DPP. To do this, - it is quite simple. All one has to do is· implement the policies that have been put in place by Mr Kennett in Victoria. I think that people on both sides of this House would agree that Mr Kennett is hardly a radical. Mr Kennett has put in a regime where, if he believes there is not significant evidence for the defence counsel, he sends his brief to an independent committee comprising two independent QCs and the Solicitor-General. They look at the evidence-they do not communicate with the lawyer at all-and go straight to the prosecutor and say, 'On investi- tive. gation, we don't think you have the evidence here to prosecute. We're not saying you can't prosecute, but if you prosecute be aware that it's against our advice and the cost to the states will be on your head.' I would go one further and say that where a prosecutor takes prosecutions, as Mr MCKechnie has, where people are put to great expense and, although they have eventually won, have been finally ruined the states should be liable for those costs. The West Australian had its usual sanctimonious editorial, and it too is simply out of touch with reality. It might suit it to have this comfortable alliance with the powers that be in the legal and police systems in Western Australia, but I tell the West Australian that no matter what it does its editor will say, 'The day of retribution is coming.' I believe that before Christmas I will show the shabby tactics and the absolute corruption of the DPP and the Deputy Commissioner of Police .. I will show their collusion beyond any doubt at all, not just beyond a reasonable doubt. I believe they will be swept away. I believe the government will eventually address this problem. The government will eventually be forced to put in some sort of check and balance on this DPP using, say, a body that has power unprecedented in the British legal system since the days of the Star Chamber. I have been overwhelmed with the support I have had from people and with the stories of hardship people have suffered. Some people have criticised me for naming the prosecutor's daughter, a girl of almost 18 years. What about a little remorse for the many much younger children who have been named, often Aboriginal, without any sort of criticism at all from the West Australian or from those other sanctimonious people who have been so critical of me in this issue? I say to this House: there was no other way I could have drawn this very serious matter to the attention of the state without making it clear that it was in relation to the prosecutor's daughter.

In effect, his procedure would not act as the registry but would simply that serving judges not be involved.

(2) Will he veto a price settlement that is below market expectations. (3) Has a large number of members of the public contacted him in writing or by telephone asking that action be taken to ensure that coal companies work together to get the best deal for Australia's largest export industry. (4) How many letters or other forms of correspondence has he received on the matter since May 1994 and what were his responses. Mr Beddall-The answer to the Honourable Member's question is as follows: (1) Coking coal supply/demand appears to be finely balanced. The negotiations with Japan for coking coal for JFY95 are prolonged· because of different perceptions held by sellers and the Japanese steel mills (JSM) about supply/demand. Due to technological change, the JSM requirement for hard coking coal is declining whereas the demand for the lower priced semi soft and pulverised coal injection coal (PCI) is rising.

Values in respect of properties and Health are therefore shown in total. Coking Coal Australia is facing increasing competition from Canada and China for sales of hard coking coal to Japan and from Indonesia, in particular, for lower quality coals. Market fundamentals support a price increase for JFY95. I have indicated publicly that restricting price increases for raw materials, including coal, will not improve the competitiveness of the Japanese steel mills-as Japanese price variations flow directly to Korean and Taiwanese steelmakers. I am also on record as saying that unless the price increases significantly there will be inadequate investment to meet future demand. Australian suppliers have adopted a firm stand in the negotiations. (2) It would be inappropriate to speculate on how I might react to a settlement that has not yet occurred. (3) Yes, a number of letters on this issue have been received. (4) Approximately 1100 forms of correspondence were received on this matter since May 1994. In general, the responses outlined the Commonwealth's view that a price controlling body would not be in the long-term best interests of the Australian coal industry, and that this issue along with others, were to be examined by an independent study for the Australian Coal Industry Council, a body which includes the union. The Coal Industry Council has now reached agreement on the Taylor proposals affecting the major areas of establishing market confidence, industrial relations and competitiveness, and market diversification. The agreement represents a substantial turning point in the relations within the industry. SBS Television Transmissions to Regional Western Australia (Question No. 1876)",168
464,Mr CAMERON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) Which regional areas of Western Australia do not receive SBS TV transmissions. (2) Will the Government fund SBS TV transmissions to all regional areas referred to in part (1); not, (a) which areas will be funded and (b) when will they be funded. (3) What is the (a) size of the potential SBS TV audience and (b) cost of extending SBS TV transmissions to each regional area referred to in part (1). (4) Which regions of Australia receive SBS TV transmissions. (5) What is the (a) estimated SBS TV audience and (b) cost of providing the service to each region referred to in part (4). Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no SBS television in Western Australiaoutside the Perth area (some communities close to Perth access the service via self help facilities, however, not in local time). Perth services are provided via a high power ""spot"" beam of the satellite transponder which serves south east Australia. (2) The Government will consider cost effective options for the provision of SBS television to rural and remote Western Australia, and the claims of other areas in Australia, in future Budgets. ,(3) (a) An estimated 290,000 people (based on the 1991 Census) in rural Western Australia are unable to access SBS services through self help or on a direct to home basis. (b) The provision of a zonal service on the Optus satellite that would provide the SBS television signal to all of Western Australia in correct local time is estimated to cost $2-3m per annum. The full cost ofterrestrial extensions varies from area to area and would be affected by such factors as topography, the size of the area to be covered and the quality and reliability of the signal required. Based on estimates for current extensions, the cost to provide the service to each television coverage area would range from about $1.5m to $3.5m in capital costs plus an annual operating cost of from $0.23m to $0.85m. (4) SBS television is received by about 75% of Australians including the following regions: Adelaide (SA); Ballarat (Vie); Bendigo (Vic); Brisbane/Gold Coast (Qld); Cairns (Qld); Canberra (ACT); Darling Downs (Qld); Darwin (NT); Hobart (Tas); Latrobe Valley (Vic); Melbourne (Vic); NewcastJe(NSW); North Eastern Tasmania (Tas); Perth (WA); Spencer Gulf North (SA); Sydney (NSW); Townsville (Qld); Wollongong (NSW) In: addition, the Wide Bay and Richmond/Tweed areas are scheduled to receive the service in 1995/96. Also, some communities outside the above areas have set up their own facilities to access SBS if television via satellite. Satellite coverage of the SBS television signal encompasses Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, parts of the Northern Territory and South Australia and Perth and surrounding districts. (5)(a) It is estimated that about 75% of Australians are able to receive SBS television via a Government provided transmission facility. (b) The National Transmission Agency (NTA) manages and operates facilities for the transmission of ABC and SBS. services. The NTA has advised that the cost of the operation and maintenance during 1993-94 of the transmission facilities for SBS television was, in excess of $9 J;llillion. The NTA has further advised that it does not hold historical data on the cost of the transmission facilities constructed for transmitting SBS television since 1980 when the service was inaugurated. In recent years, the cost of providing transmission facilities to make SBS television available to the public to areas included in the Government extension program has ranged widely-between about $1.7 million, where a main transmission facility alone was required to provide signal coverage, to over $3.0 million where one or more translators were needed in addition to provide adequate coverage throughout the designated area. In relation to current extensions, the estimated cost of providing SBS television transmission facilities to the Wide Bay area is $3.05m for capital and $0.60m for operation and mainteriance, and to the RichmondlTweed area $1.8,5m for capital and $0.29m for operation and maintenance. Australian Taxation Office, Cannington, WA: Fitness Centre (Question No. 1881)",186
465,Mr CONNOLLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: ' Does the Australian Taxation Office.in Cannington, WA; have a fitness centre; if so, (a) when was it established, (b) what did it cost, (c) what staffing and other costs are associated with it and (d) were tenders called for fitness and activities personnel for the centre; if so, what (i) are the full terms of the request for tender and (ii) is the budget for the contract.",186
466,Mr GEAR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The fitness Centre was established in September 1994. It began operation in February 1995 after the letting of the tender for the operation of the centre.· . (b) The equipment cost $35,000 and the installation cost $3,000. (c) There were minimal costs associated with tender processes. Ongoing liaison with the contractor will be performed by an ATO officer in the officer's personal time at no cost to the ATO. The Fitness Centre operates on a full cost recovery basis. Staff are charged for use of the Centre and any outlays such as initial equipment costs, maintenance and replacement equipment will be recouped through membership fees. The membership fees pay for the gym instructor. Modest electricity costs for lights and an extraction fan associated with operating the fitness centre will also be covered by the cost recovery approach. The fitness centre is located in the building basement which has always been included in the ATO lease agreement with the building owner. Therefore, use of this area does not represent an additional rental cost. (d) Tenders were called for fitness and activities personnel for the Centre in accordance with Public Sector Purchasing Guidelines and with ATO policy. (d)(i) A copy of the request for tender has been sent to the honourable member. Further copies are available from the Table Office. (d)(ii) The contractor (gym instructor) is paid a yearly fee of $7,020 for fitness activities services. The contract allows scope for the contractor to increase their retum based upon expanding the level of membership. These amounts will be recouped through the membership fees. Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (Question No. 1886) Mr Vaile asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 3 i January 1995: Is it a fact that, under amendments to section 90 of the National Health Act 1953, in demonstrating the meeting of a definite unmet public need to the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority pharmacists are. unable to include anticipated and existing need; if so, why.",187
467,Dr LAWRENCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Guidelines in relation to new approvals to dispense pharmaceutical benefits are specific in that no new pharmacy will be permitted to open within 5 kilometres of an existing pharmacy or within 5 kilometres of a site where a closure grant has previously been paid. If the distance is greater than 5 kilometres, an applicant must also demonstrate to the Authority that there is a definite unmet public need. The Pharmacy Restructuring Authority, when assessing these applications, does consider: 1. proven existing need; and 2. concrete evidence of short term anticipated need. 'Anticipated' need is measured on a short term bas\s only (approximately 6 months to allow for 'normal planning principles and time horizons'), and concrete evidence needs to support applications. The Pharmacy Restructuring Authority also uses its discretion, based on previous experience at the AAT and Federal Courts, when considering unmet public need and 'anticipated' need. However, 'community need' must not be confused with 'community want'.

Private Health Insurance Complaints (Question No. 1968)",188
473,Mr CONNOLLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 6 February 1995: Has her Department considered the development of a private health insurance health complaints unit; if so, (a) what consideration has been given, (b) what sums have been spent in connection with the consideration, (c) on what and with whom was each sum spent and (d) what were the results of the consideration.",191
474,Dr LAWRENCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) & (d) The Department of Human Services and Health has given active consideration to the development of a private health insurance complaints unit. As part of the Government's proposed private health insurance reforms, amendments to the National Health Act 1953 provide for the establishment of a Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner. The Commissioner's functions are intended to include answering enquiries, making recommendations and conciliating in complaints made by health insurance contributors, hospitals, private health insurance funds, doctors and the Minister, on issues such as a non-payment of claims, misleading information about health insur"" ance products and poor service from health insurance funds. (b) & (c) A consultant, Mr Robin Brown, was hired on 8 October 1994 to prepare an options paper for a complaints mechanism appropriate to the private health insurance industry. The consultant's fee for this paper was $4,000. The consultant also attended a meeting with representatives from consumer organisations, health funds and the Department as part of the reporting process at a cost of $300.

Safe Sex Guide Unit (Question No. 1974) Mr Bradford asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 6 February 1995: (1) Has her attention been drawn to medical opinion that anal intercourse is damaging to the rectum and likely to cause a number of diseases. (2) Did the Government sponsor a safe sex guide in the December 1994 issue of Cleo magazine which advocated and explained the practice of anal intercourse; if so, (a) how is the Government's sponsorship of the guide consistent with its HIV/AID strategy (b) what sum did the Government spend on the guide, (c) does she endorse the contents of the guide and (d) why did the Government fund the guide.",191
475,Dr LAWRENCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As Minister for Human Services and Health, I am well aware that there are risk factors associated with anal intercourse. Advising people who chose to engage in this behaviour of those risks was the purpose of the article. (2) The Government. commissioned Cleo to produce a Safe Sex Guide in the December 1994 issue of Cleo magazine. One of the articles in this guide explained the risks associated with anal sex. The article is not intended to advocate anal sex. Whilst explaining how to have anal sex safely, the article also makes it clear that if a person does not wish to have anal sex they should not do so. (a) The National HIV/AIDS Strategy has as its two goals elimination of the transmission of HIV and minimising the personal and social impact of HIV infection. The Strategy identifies women as a target group for education and prevention programs. It is imperative that health authorities provide frank and factual information, in a non-judgmental manner, to those people who have elected to become sexually active and are therefore most at risk of being infected with HIY and other sexually transmitted diseases. Recent Australian research has highlighted that one in five Australians are likely to have transmitted disease by the time they are twenty-one. (b) The breakdown is as follows: $200,OOO-Australian Consolidated Press, Cleo. $50,OOO-development,launch,anddistribution. (c) I endorse the Guide's approach to safe sex. Supporting the need to communicate with young adults in a way that is meaningful to them does not necessarily mean a personal endorsement of either the sexual behaviours discussed, or the style in which the articles are written. The sexual preferences and practices of consenting adults are their business. My concern is that people have appropriate information easily available to them so that, whatever their sexual practices, they engage in them in the safest way possible. The Guide provides this information. Under the arrangements with Australian Consolidated Press editorial control remained with Cleo. Cleo journalists wrote the articles in a style which they knew would be attractive to the target audience of young people between 18 and 35 years of age. An advisory committee consisting of appropriate experts was established by the Department to oversee the process. (d) The Department funded the Guide following recent research indicating that the majority of young people aged eighteen years and over are sexually active. Researchevidence further indicates that young people are engaging in a wide variety of sexual behaviours, including anal intercourse. It is essential therefore that these young people be presented with information that is factual and accessible. The guide is consistent with the promotion of safe sexual practices which has been a theme of all Australian Governments in recent years.

483,Mr CAMERON,SKILLSHARE,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 9 February 1995: (1) How many private hospital beds has Medicare purchased since 13 March 1993 to reduce hospital waiting lists. (2) What sum has been allocated to post-acute Not In The Labour Force and palliative care patients in private hospitals since (per cent) 13 March 1993. 5.3 (3) Has Medicare coverage been extended to 6.1 emergency and basic dental care for health care card holders since 13 March 1993. 2.9 3.1 Dr LAWRENCE - The answer to the honour3.2 able member's question is as follows: 11.4 (1) In December 1993, the Department of Human 5.7 Services and Health wrote to all private hospitals 5.2 and day surgeries inviting them to submit proposals to treat public patients waiting for elective surgery. 8.2 15.0 No proposals were submitted from Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. J oint Commonwealth-State selection committees met in March 1994 to review the proposals from New South Wales and Victoria. Subsequently, the NSW, Victorian and Tasmanian Health Departments informed the Commonwealth that they did not support the proposals submitted. Among the reasons for this lack of support were that: most prices quoted were not cost effective; the procedures proposed were not the key procedures for which patients were waiting; and Continued Program Assistance in some areas, medical staffin public hospitals (per cent) did not support the practice of transferring 27.4 patients from public waiting lists to private hospitals. 30.1 7,6 Consequently the program did not proceed in those States. 29.8 21.0 The one ACT proposal was not supported by the 37.6 medical profession, and did not proceed. 23.6 The program is being implemented in Queens19.1 land. The Commonwealth has approved $550,000 18.0 in 1994-95 for the provision of cardiac angiography 48.2 services at the John Flynn Hospital at Tugan, and for general surgery and orthopaedic services at the Gold Coast Surgicentre. Negotiations are proceeding with the Queens land State Government on a third project relating to cardiac surgery also at the John Flynn Hospital. The expected throughput for the first year is: at John Flynn-IOO cardiac angiography; 50 cardiac valve procedures; 100 coronary artery bypass grafts; and at the Gold Coast Surgicentre60 to 90 general surgical procedures; and 80 to 120 orthopaedic procedures. Under this initiative Queensland is to receive up to $7.38 million. (2) The Commonwealth does not provide funding direct to private hospitals though, of course, Medicare benefits are paid to patients in private hospitals for medical services. Before 1993-94 post acute and palliative care funding was provided by way of combined identified grants to the States and Territories under the Medicare Agreements. The State and Territory Governments are responsible for distribution of this funding to Area Health Services, individual hospitals, etc. Following a 1993 Election commitment to allocate $55 million over the four year period to 1996-97 specifically for palliative care services, the post acute and palliative care funding component of the MedicareAgreementwas divided nominally, with the approval of the States and Territories, into two separately identified post acute and palliative care components. This separation of the Medicare Agreement funding will continue until 1996-97. Funds allocated to the States and Territories for post acute services was of the order of $21.4 million in 1993-94. This figure is expected to increase to around $22.2 million in 1994-95. The objective of this funding is to promote public hospital efficiencies by the encouragement of post acute early discharge initiatives (eg home nursing services) as more cost effective alternatives to in-hospital care. It was never intended that post acute funding under the Medicare Agreements be directed to the private hospital industry. Whichever source the palliative care funding comes from (either under the MedicareAgreements or ""new"" money arising from the Election commitment), it is the responsibility of the States/Territories to allocate it within their jurisdictions. There is no direct Commonwealth funding of patients in private hospitals (or public hospitals). Under the Program, there is an emphasis on expansion or enhancement of networks of community based care as opposed to institution oriented services. However, institutions do receive funding to maintain ongoing services. Patients who have been treated in either private or public hospitals have access to services funded under the Program. Palliative Care Program funding to the States and Territories in 1993-94 amounted to $24.0 million and in 1994-95 will be $24.8. (3) The new Commonwealth Dental Health Program commenced on 1 January 1994. The Program provides improved access for Health Card holders and their adult dependants, and holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, to a package of basic dental services. State Dental Services have been contracted to provide the services on behalf of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will be providing a total of $278 million over the four years to 1996-97 for this purpose. Gambling: State Revenue (Question No. 2071) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: (1) Do the records of the Commonwealth Grants Commission show when each State first licensed and derived revenue from (a) lotteries, (b) casinos, (c) lotto-type games, (d) poker machines, (e) oncourse betting, (f) off-course betting and (g) other forms of gambling; if so, what was the year in each case for each State. (2) What proportion of each State's revenue was obtained from (a) lotteries, (b) casinos, (c) lottotype games, (d) poker machines, (e) on-course betting, (f) off-course betting and (g) other forms of gambling in (i) 1983-84 and (ii) 1993-94. Mr WiIlis-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A search of Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC) reports has provided much of the information sought. However the CGC reports do not contain any information before 1979-80 for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Early reports record that lotteries have been conducted in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania since at least 1940-41. Later reports show that: lotteries were conducted in Victoria from 14 July 1954; a Lotteries Commission was established in South Australia on 15 May 1967; lotteries were conducted in the Northern Territory in 1979-80; and the ACT did not receive revenue from lotteries operations until 1981-82. For on-course betting, early reports record that this type of betting was licensed in all States earlier than 1933-34. For the other types of gambling, licences have been issued in relatively recent times and the dates of licence issues up to 30 June 1994 are tabulated below. Other forms of gambling, such as bingo and soccer pools, have not been investigated.

Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs provide a cash supplementary payment to meet the additional cost of private rental housing for their clients. With the exception of persons aged under 25 years and living with their parents, Rent Assistance is available to all pensioners, allowees, beneficiaries and additional family payment recipients who pay rent above minimum threshold levels. It is provided at the rate of 75 cents per dollar of rent paid above these thresholds up to specific maximum rates of assistance. Rent thresholds and the maximum rates of assistance vary with family type and the presence and number of children. Rent Assistanceis indexed twice-yearly.

Ritalin (Question No. 2085) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: (1) Is the drug RITALIN being considered for inclusion in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; if not, why not. (2) Is it a fact that families whose children need to use the drug because they suffer from Attention DeficitDisorderpay $45 for 100 RITALIN tablets; if so, what assistance will the Government give those families.",208
484,Dr LAWRENCE,TOTAL,"-the answer to the honourable member'S question is as follows: (1) Ritalin is a brand of the drug methylphenidate hydrochloride. Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablet 10 mg was recommended for listing in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee at its meeting in August 1994. The Committee recommended that the drug be available as a pharmaceutical benefit for use in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, in accordance with State/Territory law. [Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a schedule 8 drug which requires the pharmacist to record the sale and forward the record to the relevant State Department of Health.] The advice of the Committee which accompanied the recommendation was that methylphenidate hydrochloride tablet 10 mg was of similar safety and efficacy to dexamphetaminesulfatetablet 5 mg (which is currently listed as a benefit for the same use with a dispensed price for 100 tablets of $12.14). Based on this advice, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority recommended an appropriate price for methylphenidate tablet 10 mg and my Department has been negotiating with the sponsor. To date, these negotiations have been unsuccessful. (2) The Commonwealth subsidises the cost of pharmaceuticals through the operations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. However, the National Health Act makes no provision for exceptions in individual cases and thus there is no direct subsidy for drugs which are not listed as benefits. Basedon the prices listed in the Pharmacy Guild price list, the dispensedprice for 100 Ritalin tablets for a private prescription would range between $55.63 and $67.91. The Commonwealth has no jurisdiction over prices charged at pharmacies for private prescriptions. Child Care Cash Rebate (Question No. 2106) Mr Hawker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: (1) How many persons have received the childcare cash rebate in the electoral division of Wannon. (2) How many of the persons referred to in part (1) were (a) fathers and (b) mothers. (3) How many registered applicants for the rebate reside in each postcode area in Wannon. (4) What total sum in rebates has been paid to persons in Wannon since the rebate was introduced. (5) What were the average (a) weekly, (b) fortnightly and (c) monthly (i) childcare costs of and (ii) rebates received by the persons referred to in part (4). (6) How many new claimants for rebates are received per (a) week, (b) fortnight and (c) month by Medicare offices in Wannon. (7) Which Medicare office in Wannon has received the (a) highest and (b) lowest number of claims. (8) How many applicants are registered at the office which received the (a) highest and (b) lowest number of claims.",211
485,Dr LAWRENCE,TOTAL,The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Geographic information about families claiming the Childcare Cash Rebate is recorded by postcode only. Information about Childcare Cash Rebate recipients in the electorate of Wannon is not readily available due to: (a) overlap of postcodes with federal electorate boundaries; and (b) unavailability of appropriate postcodeelectorate information for recent changes in the boundaries for the electorate of Wannon. To obtain the information sought would involve considerable research. I am not prepared to authorise the time and resources entailed in collecting this information. Vietnam Veterans (Question No. 2109),212
486,Mr CAMERON,TOTAL,"the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: Is he able to say how many persons who served as national servicemen in Vietnam are: (a) currently employed, (b) receiving the service pension and (c) receiving the totally and permanently incapacitated pension. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) No. My Department does not obtain information on the employment circumstances of Vietnam veterans unless it is necessary to establish a Vietnam veterans' entitlement to a Veterans' Affairs pension or other benefit. In general, my Department is not aware of the number of Vietnam veterans who are currently employed. (b) As at 10 March 1995, a total of 6,388 Vietnam veterans were receiving service pension. The number of these Vietnam veterans who served as national servicemen is unknown to my Department. However, the Departmental records show that of the 6,388 veterans at least 1,042 veterans served as national servicemen and 1,617 veterans did not serve as national servicemen. The status of the remaining 3,729 veterans cannot be identified on the data-base as the information on enlistment of a Vietnam veteran as a national serviceman is not relevant to service pension. (c) As at 10 March 1995, a total of 3,221 Vietnam veterans were receiving disability pension at the totally and permanently incapacitated rate of pension. Of this number, 723 veterans are known to have served as national servicemen while 1,862 did not serve as national servicemen. The status of the remaining 636 veterans is unknown. The enlistment information is not always required to be entered into the data-base. Enlistment as a national serviceman is only relevant if the person's period of enlistment extends beyond 7 December 1972.
