That and a similar letter are the only instances which have reached the department of fees having been definitely demanded by the Performing Rights Association. Inquiries are being made into these specific cases and others concerning which correspondence has reached me. If , after examination of the circumstances, the charges appear to the Government to be unreasonable, and if the parties are not able to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement, the Government will reconsider the whole matter. As I have pointed out on other occasions, this extremely difficult problem and will require careful consideration before action can be taken, owing to the international significance of the Copyright Act, and the effect that any action might have upon the rights of Australian authors, composers, and artists in foreign countries.

CASE OE ROBERTDENHOLM . FORMAL MOTION OF ADJOURNMENT.",13
23,Mr SPEAKER,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF," I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The case of Robert Denholm, formerly employed in Parliament House."" Five honourable members having risen in {heir places, Question proposed.",14
24,Dr MALONEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"Melbourne) [11.17]. - This being the last day that honourable members will have an opportunity of speaking in this chamber, and at the earnest request of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports Mathews), I shall endeavour as I did on my first appearance here 38 years ago, to . right a wrong. There has, in the case of Robert Denholm, been a tangle of legal and other opinion whch has been unjust to that unfortunate man. The history of the ease is briefly this-When the a wfu l epidemic of influenza was raging in Australia, an order was sent out that with every person must undergo the serum war treatment. The treatment was compulsory in respect of public servants who as were receiving wages, and I believe that even highly-paid officials were inoculated. t that time there was nothing to j u s t if y has the view that the serum treatment was an absolute cure. I do not kuow that medical men today believe the treatment be a cure, but that it may be a for m of precaution I am willin g to accept. of The following is a portion of this man's My injuries arose from the time. I was - inoculated under the compulsory vaccination against influenza, when all public servants were compelled to undergo such treatment. I was compelled to resume my duties at Parliament House three weeks after I left St. VinHospital, where I had been an inmate for six weeks, suffering from meningeal irritation and typhoid fever. There were no signs any after-effects from my illness, as I was examined by the hospital doctors on my discharge from the hospital, and also by the Government Medical Officer, Dr Douglas Stephens, before I was inoculated. I am making no attack on Dr Stephens, because I have heard a good deal in his favour from many of his patients; but I do not think that at that time he understood that this man had had a severe attack of typhoid complicated with brain irritation. Otherwise, I doubt whether he would have used the serum. Honourable members may wonder why I , as a medical man, take a conservative view of the treatment with serum, and I can only refer them to this episode. At one time in the treatment of disease in England bleeding was considered a cure for all ills. That it saved some lives I do not deny, but that it was the means of losing many lives I certainly affirm. In fact, Queen A' ictoria would never have come to the throne of England had it not been for the bleeding treatment received by Princess Charlotte, who was bearing an (Mr heir to the Crown. Baron Stockmar in his memoirs stated that he could not understand why a young and healthy woman performing a natural function should be bled, and bled to death. For every labour pain a pint of blood was taken, so that the woman and child were sacrificed to that then-acknowledged for m of treatment. The fact that Princess Charlotte was bled to death under that treatment is mentioned in Playfair's second volume on midwifery. T wish to show to honourable members that Eobert Denholm should never have had the serum passed into his arm. So alarming were the symptoms after the treatment that Dr Stephens himself did not repeat the injection. At that time, to completo the treatment, injections were given two or three times. Upon my advice, this man underwent a course of electrical massage. There is clear evidence that his present state of helplessness is the result of the injection of serum. H a d this man been in ordinary outside employment, he would have had a claim under the Workmen's Compensation Act ; but, unfortunately, Parliament House is not subject to its provisions. The Government might, during the recess, consider the advisability of bringing parliamentary affairs under that act, and also the Public Service. This man is in debt. I admit that he has had good treatment. He obtained admittance to the Home for Incurables at Heidelberg, which institution can be mentally likened to Dante's Inferno, above the entrance to which was inscribed ""Abandon hope all ye who enter here."" This man is in receipt of an invalid pension, but it is of little help to him. I hold in my hand a final report of the select committee on this case, and I thank ex-Senator de Largie for the great work that he did in this man's cause. The recommendation for a joint committee would have been accepted had not objection been taken under parliamentary rules by an honourable member who before he died expressed to me his heartfelt regret for his action. Any one who reads the report will see Kobert Denholm suffered. He afterwards received £50 which the Minister, in. his kindness of heart, granted; but I do not think that the Minister imposed the stringent conditions under which the money was given. Mentally, Denholm is very clear, and always has been. This is what he writesThe application for a compassionate allowance was sent to the Treasurer on 12th MaTch, 1925. Six months later, from information T received, I telephoned the Treasury Department. T was told that my case had been finalized, and the Joint House Department would pay me a compassionate allowance. A week later, 25th September, I got a friend to take me to interview the Secretary of the Joint House Department. Owing to the state of my health I wa« not able to go about by myself. I interviewed Mr U'Ren, the Secretary of the Joint Houst Department at 12.30 p.m. I asked him had ht a compassionate allowance that was to be paid to me. He replied that there was a compassionate allowance for me, but he had been too busy to see about it, and if I wanted it 1 would have to sign a deed of release. I told him I was ill, and in need of the money. Hp told .mo to call back later in the day. As 1 did not understand the deed of release, I asked him for a copy of the deed of release, but my request was refused. I interviewed Mr U'Ren again at 2.30 p.m. He told me to go to Mr. Broinowski's room and he would pay me. Mr. Broinowski put two papers before me to sign. I was too ill to read them or understand what was read to me. It was an effort for me to sign my name. After signing my name, Mr. Broinowski had not got the cheque to pay me. He sent for an officer of the Senate, Mr Barnett, and told him to take me across to the Treasury Department and see that I received the cheque. I received no notice from the Join! House Department about the deed of release other than what I have stated. Had I received notice, I would have got advice before I was compelled to sign. Had I known the signing of those papers would end my claims, I certainly would not have attached my name to them. Granted that the deed of release is a legal discharge, there still remains a moral claim, and if I did not, from the bottom of my heart, believe that to be so, I should not be speaking on the man's behalf on this, the last, day of the present sittings. Before I conclude I wish to make a public apology to a Parliamentary official whom I have greatly wronged; I allude to Mr . Broinowski, of another place. Every time he came into my presence I used to insult him by asking him what he hafl done with a certain two guineas. To mv deep regret, I did him a great wrong. how There is an official higher than he who took the two guineas, and I leave him with his conscience for his punishment. If he was wrong in taking the miserable two guineas, he was still more wrong in allowing a junior officer to be insulted unjustly by me. I leave him, with his increasing years on his shoulders, to reflect on those two wrongs, aud to settle with his conscience whether he acted rightly. When Denholm was employed in this House, he was an active man, and every one who came in - contact with hi m can testify to his activity and willingness. He was here for ten years, or thereabouts, and did whatever he was told. When a man, in a subordinate position like his is told by his superior officer to do something, he accepts his instructions almost like a soldier receiving a command on the battlefield; thus he underwent the treatment advised; and I say here, as in the presence of my Maker, that I believe the serum administered was the cause of his illness.",14
25,Mr BLAKELEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"Darling ) [ 1 1 . 5 ] support the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) in their efforts to obtain justice for Robert Denholm, who, for many years, was an attendant in this House. I have interested myself in the case, and, on many occasions, have accompanied those two honourable members when they have interviewed the Treasurer, and the ex-President of the Senate (Senator Givens). Denholm was an employee of the Joint House Committee, and, in 1914, in the course of his employment, met with an accident. Although, at a later period, he stated the nature of his accident, it was impossible to obtain proofs from the records of the Parliament of his absence from duty owing to the accident; but, in the opinion of Dr Kerr, the accident was a likely cause of his disability. In his report the doctor said It is hard to be sure of the right decision in this case, but, my opinion is, that in the absence of better knowledge of this disease, it is possible that the accident to the head and the meningeal irritation following later brought about in this case the condition of the spinal cord, known as syringomyelia, perhaps beginning with a small haemorrhage. Consequently, I felt that if it is at all sible after confirming the truth of the head injury as described by Mr Denholm, as I had only Mr Denholm's statement to go on, every consideration be given to the granting of a compassionate allowance in view of the fact that the alleged injury to the head was sustained when Mr Denholm was employed at Parliament House. Later, as the honourable member for Melbourne has stated, injections of serum were given, and immediately the man's disability became so severe that he had to relinquish his employment. Several honourable members, who knew him before and after his disability, have been tryin g for years to obtain justice for him. The negotiations reached the stage at which he was to receive a compassionate allow-mce of £50, but when he went to draw the allowance he was asked to sign certain papers. He states that he did not know that he was signing a final deed of release. When a man, in ordinary commercial practice, has made a claim and had it satisfied, documents are signed to close the matter; but, in this case, Denholm did not know that he was signing a final release. He asked for, and was re- I fused, a copy of the document. He was not in a condition to know what he was signing, and, unfortunately, the machinery of this Parliament was used to trick him in a way which was, in my opinion, to say the least, sharp practice. I do not blame the officer who, acting under in structions, protected the Government, but I do say that those who were responsible for using officers of the Parliament to do such things, indulged in very questionable practices.",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF, To what action does the honourable member refer?,16
27,Mr BLAKELEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"The action of some one in authority in instructing a subordinate officer of this Parliament to place the document before Denholm in circumstances that were not merely questionable, but unjustifiable. Two papers were placed before him for signing, and he was not allowed to have a copy of them. Thoso of us who have watched this man's in creasing disability, from the time when he was apparently quite well, u n t i l now, when he is an invalid, know quite well that he would not be in his present condition but for the unfortunate accident. posNo doubt the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), the honourable member for Herbert (Dr Not t ) , and the honourable member for Melbourne, with their medical knowledge, can speak with more authority on that aspect of the matter; but it is safe even for a layman to say that to expect an invalid to transact legal business while refusing him a copy of the documents he is required to sign, so that he may take them away and obtain advice on them, should not be condoned by this Parliament. The position now is that this Parliament holds a final deed of release from Denholm, who therefore has no legal claim.",16
28,Dr NOTT,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,What was the nature of the accident?,16
29,Mr BLAKELEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"D e n h o l m met with an accident in the dining-room, and sustained injuries to the head. He was taken to the hospital, and later developed meningeal irritation, from which he is now suffering. I am informed that his condition could be caused by an injury to the head. If , in the opinion of honourable members, there is even a possibility that his invalidity was caused, or contributed to, by the accident, the duty of this Parliament is clear; the deed of release ought not to absolve us from paying compensation, if compensation is due. I feel very strongly that if there is the slightest suspicion in the minds of honourable members that we owe a debt to this ex-employee, we should pay it. I ask the Treasurer and honourable members generally to deal sympathetically with this application.",16
30,Mr HUGHES,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"North Sydney) [11.14]. - I remember this young man when he was employed in this House. He was a mere youth, with his life opening out before him; he was bright, intelligent, and normal in every way, and seemed quite healthy. I have seen him at various times within the last twelve months, and have noticed that to all intents and purposes the gates of life have now been slammed against him. He is a shattered wreck. His condition resembles that of a shellshocked soldier; his case seems similar to one which was unhappily before our eyes for some years in this chamber. Denholm alleges that from robust and joyous health he has been brought to a state of death in life by reason of an inoculation he was obliged to undergo while employed by this House. Some ground for that belief is provided by the fact that he was given a sum of £50 by this Parliament. Like the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley), I am not skilled in medicine, but it is evident that in the minds of the President and Mr Speaker, or of the House Committee, or of whoever was responsible for the settlement of this matter, there was doubt as to whether the man's condition was not due to that treatment. I do not know what defence may be offered on behalf of the authorities concerned, and until we have heard the defence we cannot make any counter charge. It would be idle to say that inoculation does not, in some cases, completely wreck the lives of the persons inoculated. While it may prove salutary or defensive in 999 cases, it may kill the 1000th case. There is a duty upon us in this case, to compensate with money, so far as that is possible, the injury received by this officer. It would be idle to say that his condition arose spontaneously, fpr there must always be an anterior cause. Assuming that there is certain probable cause in this case, no sensible medical man would deny that the state of the man's health at the time that this cause afose is material to the consequences produced by the inoculation. Clearly Denholm's health was reduced below par by the inoculation. That, of course, is not always the result of inoculation. I have been inoculated several times. I was inoculated a couple of days ago, but I was able to make a speech here shortly afterwards. Please God I shall inoculate myself in the future and make more speeches. But that happy result does not follow in every instance. If I had to deal with this case I would put this man in the position of being sure at least of the ordinary comforts of life. It is true that he was only a humble attendant and not a. member of the Parliament; but, nevertheless, we met him every day and he was one of our number. To put it in another way, he was a private in an army in which we are officers. He was stricken down while doing his duty. Surely we are not obliged in such circumstances to examine with microscopic exactness into the precise causes of his trouble. Let us treat-'the case as human beings, and give the man something. We have been in occupation of these buildings for 26 years; let us on the eve of our departure do at least one just and generous act.",17
31,Dr NOTT,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"Herbert) [11.22] - I have been very interested in this case, which was brought under my notice in the first place by a circular; but I did not know until the Treasurer-stated.it by interjection that this unfortunate man was in the condition that is medically known as syringomyelia. I venture to suggest, and I think the Treasurer will agree with me, that the case has been fairly and amply put by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes). The honourable member for Darling said the man's neurotic condition was the consequence of an accident which he sustained through falling on his head, when several stitches had to be inserted in the wound. The honourable member for Melbourne $Dr Maloney) attributed his condition serum inoculation ",17
32,Dr MALONEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,When the patient not .fit to receive the inoculation.,18
33,Dr NOTT,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"I do not think that either of the reasons that I have mentioned buttress the case from the medical point of view. The man's condition, the ideology of which is imperfectly understood, cannot be attributed or explained by the serum inoculation; still I think, on the compassionate grounds advanced by the right honourable member for North Sydney, it is the obvious duty of Parliament to assist this man and free him from the need of relying upon individual and private charities to make his remaining days something more than an existence. I feel sure that I am doing the righ t thing in supporting the claim, although I could not support it on the medical suggestions that have been made. It would be unfair to allow the suggestion to go abroad that the serum injection to which this man was subjected had the damaging effect that haa been attributed to it . The anaphylactic effect of a serum injection cannot be compared with the untold benefits thaifc accrue from it . I support the claim purely on compassionate grounds.",18
34,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"Cowper-Trea surer) [11.25],-Undoubtedl y the case of this man deserves our deepest sympathy. The man's condition is incurable, and it must become worse as time goes on. In -..consideration of his condition he was awarded an invalid pension some years ago. The Government has considered the case sympathetically from the time when it was first brought under notice two or three years ago. I personally have very carefully looked into it to see whether there is any possible justification for the claim, that the man's condition is due to anything that occurred while he held his position as an officer of this Parliament. As the honourable member for Herbert (Dr Nott) has stated, the relationship, if there is any at all, is extraordinarily remote. Mr Denholm is only 34 years of age. He was employed here for a long time aa a temporary liftman and casual waiter. He sta.tes that 1914 he accidentally received a knock on the head from a plank, and had to have several stitches inserted in the wound. Unfortunately, there is no record of the accident, nor of his having received leave of absence at the time, though I have no doubt <that what he 'says is quite correct. to Five years later he was inoculated with influenza serum, and although he suffered was a rather severe re-action I do not think that it can be maintained that his present condition is due to the inoculation.",18
35,Mr HUGHES,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,W it h what serum was he inoculated ?,18
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"W it h influenza serum, which contained several antibodies. I do not think that it could be possibly established that his syringomyelia has anything to do with the influenza in oculation. It is true that inoculation might brine into existence a certain degree of meningitis, but it could not possibly cause syringomyelia.",18
37,Dr MALONEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,A continual series of symptoms has fallowed the inoculation through all these years.,18
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"W it h all due deference to the honourable member as a medical practitioner, I am of the opinion thatfhe inoculation could not possibly have caused this man's spinal condition. I have examined the case most carefully. The position is not quite as the honourable member for Melbourne put it . The officers of this House come under the provisions of the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act. As evidence of that, may I remind honourable members of the case of an unfortunate officer who was killed some years ago while running across to the Government Printing Office in the execution of his duty. His dependants were dealt with under the provisions of the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act.",18
39,Dr MALONEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,But that would not have been so if the man had not had an envelope in his hand at the time of the accident.,18
40,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"He was killed in the execution of his duty. It surely cannot be claimed that the Government is under any obligation to find medical treatment for all its employees, whether their condition is caused while they are doing their work or not. Medical attention can only be provided for officers who are suffering from circumstances which have arisen in . in the course of their employment. Otherwise the Government would have neverCnding responsibilities. When the matter was brought up we submitted it to the President of the Public Service Superannuation Board, who gave it careful consideration. The board made every effort to establish some ground on - which a definite claim could be based, but it failed to do so. The board reported that every effort had been made to obtain confirmation of the statements regarding the accident, and that it had endeavoured to discover if there was any possibility of the case being dealt with under the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act. As an act of grace the board recommended the payment of a compassionate allowance of £50, based on Mr Denholm's length of service, including his casual service as a waiter. payment was made on the definite understanding that there was no admission of liability on the part of the Government. I join issue with the honourable member for Darling, who suggested there was sharp practice on the part of the Joint House Committee in connection with the signing of the deed of release. I assure the House that the ordinary procedure was followed.",18
41,Mr COLEMAN,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,He would have to sign under duress.,19
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"Not at all. The honourable member for Darling suggested that Mr Denholm was ignorant of what took place. As a fact, the matter was fully explained to him, and, as the honourable member for Melbourne, remarked, his mind was very clear upon it. The question now arises whether the Government, which has already given him a permanent invalid pension, should also provide medical treatment. Mr G. FRANCIS - The honourable mem-, ber for Darling said that he desired to take the document away in order to obtain advice as to its meaning, but was not gations. allowed to do so. Is that true?",19
43,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"I am not clear on that point. Mr Speaker may know something about it, because the case was tack of typhoid? dealt with by the Joint House Committee. As the honourable member for Herbert has said, thei'e is no relation Denholm's service in this House and his present condition. It is entirely for House to determine whether it is to cept responsibility for his medical ment. Mr HUGII.ES - Does the Treasurer conpapers tend that inoculation could not have duced the condition?",19
44,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"It is most unwealth likely. Nothing is impossible, but it beyond the bounds of probability that service here had anything to do with it. Unfortunately, cases of this nature are not uncommon. Provision is made in the large medical institutions for the proper treatment of this condition by massage, &c, and that treatment is available to the community. Probably those institutions are the best places in which suitable treatment can be obtained. I suggest that the Commonwealth cannot make itself responsible for the permanent medical treatment of any of its employees, the cause The of whose illness has not been definitely traced to employment in the Commonwealth Service.

54,Mr SPEAKER,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF," This matter came under the acnotice of my predecessors, but a request treatwas made to the Joint House Committee recently which caused me to obtain the and investigate the history of the procase. I found it to be this:- A former lift attendant, who entered the CommonService in 1915, remained for is about six and a half years, and left in his 1921. He was inoculated some two or three years prior to leaving the Service. A f t e r he had left it , he claimed that, as a result of the inoculation, he had become ill . The matter was gone into full y by the then President of the Senate, and the circumstances of the inoculation were in vestigated. On the 13th of March, 1925, Senator Givens addressed a letter to the Department of the Treasury in which the following passage occurs:Some time after leaving the Service he developed some peculiar condition, which practically left his arm useless, and he claims that that condition was due to the inoculation against influenza. However, I have seen no medical evidence which would confirm that statement. The Joint House Committee made in quiry to ascertain if there was any relation between the officer's condition and his employment in the Service. Dr G. Stephens, an eminent medical man, declared that he could not affirm that the man's inju ry was due to inoculation. As however, the man's condition rendered him unfit for employment, Senator Givens, viewing sympathetically, recommended the Treasurer for early and favourable consideration. The case was looked into by the Treasurer. An additional statement was that the man's condition was due to an accident which had taken place at a very much earlier date. Inquiries were made of the parliamentary officers, and the following reference to it was found in the files, dated the 24tb June, 1925Mr Denholm further stated that, in 1914, while employed as a waiter at Parliament House, he accidentally knocked his head against a plank. Inquiries were immediately made, and on reference to the files showing the various occasions on which leave of absence had been granted, there was nothing to show that a report or complaint had ever been received, or temporary leave of absence applied for, in connection with any such accident in 1914. I have before me a record of the details submitted to the Treasurer. The particulars of sick leave granted to Denholm are as ""Four days, March, 1916 (gastritis); three days, April, 1916 catarrh); two weeks from 18th ber, 1918 (influenza); four weeks, December, 1918, and two weeks, 1919 (nature of illness not stated). Mr Speaker. minute bearing on this case, said to be an extract from Dr Kerr's report, is aa follows:It is hard to be sure of the right decision in this case, but my opinion is that, in the absence of better knowledge of this disease, it is possible that the accident to the head and the meningeal irritation following later brought aibout in this case the condition of the spinal cord known as syringomyelia, perhaps beginning with a small haemorrhage. There is nothing to confirm the statement that the accident occurred in the course of employment. I noticed that, in the petition presented today, no reference is made to the accident. The first question, therefore, is whether Mr Denholm suffered any in j u r y in the course of his employment. There is no definite evidence to show that the in j u r y resulted from the inoculation. I find that my predecessor reported to that effect to the Treasurer, and the compassionate allowance was made in the circumstances which the Treasurer has described. There are one or two comments I desire to make in connection with this case. The honourable the case member for Darling suggested, in the first it to instance, that there had been sharp practice on the part of the Joint House Committee. I think that he withdrew that expression; but he indicated that Mr . Denholm, as the latter said in his own petition, had been practically compelled to sign the deed of release or receive nothing. Mr Denholm stated in his petitionI was compelled to sign a deed of release, being told by the secretary of the Joint House Department, that if I did not sign the deed of release, I would not receive the money. I waa ill at the time, and in need of the money. I had no otlier option but to sign. The secretary of the Joint House Committee said that that was not correct. The document was sent on to be signed, and Mr Denholm was pleased to receive the money. There was no sharp practice, and no application was made for the document. What motive would that officer, in the ordinary course of his duty, have for acting as was alleged^ The practice on all occasions has been to deal follow:- with the officers in a sympathetic rather than in a stern manner. (bronchial Dr MALONEY - The report puts an enNovem- tirely different view of the case.",19
55,Mr SPEAKER,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"I am dealing with January, it sympathetically. An application was A made that we should give Denholm the position of lift attendant. In his own statement, he said, "" There is a general improvement in my condition. I am able to get about."" The matter of the compassionate allowance was concluded by my predecessors. When I took my present position, the deed had been signed, and the grant had been made. the files disclose, the most sympathetic thought appears to have been given to the case, and the opinion evidently was that, although no relation could be established between the man's condition and his previous employment, something might be done as an act of grace.' That has been done.",20
56,Dr MALONEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"Melbourne) [11.45J. - I am greatly disappointed with what I have heard, as I did expect that some sympathy would be expressed in this case. 1 asked the Treasurer whether he would give the serum in the case of a man who had a severe attack of typhoid complicated with symptoms of brain trouble. The honourable gentleman said that he would; but, although I have put the same question to dozens of the best medical men in Melbourne, and some in Sydney, none of them gave me a similar answer. The fact that Dr Stephens did not give a second injection shows clearly that he was alarmed at the symptoms. If I took the Treasurer on the hop in asking the question, I am sorry, because I think that, upon reflection, he will agree that I have been right in what I said.",21
57,Dr NOTT,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,Was this man supposed to be suffering from typhoid fever when he was given the injection for influenza?,21
58,Dr MALONEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,He had recovered from an attack of typhoid fever.,21
59,Dr NOTT,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,What was the interval between his recovery and the injection of the serum?,21
60,Dr MALONEY,ACCOMMODATION FOB MBMBBES OF,"The injection was made some three weeks from the time the man was carried out of the hospital after an attaclc of typhoid. ' I was not treating this man as a medical man. I sent bim for treatment to men better able to deal with his case. I ask honourable members in a spirit of justice to look through the evidence taken at the inquiry. They-ung man's mother made a sworn declaration that she had never said a word against him, although she was accused by a high official of another place with having sent him a letter in which she complained of the young man. That letter could not be produced. If we had a national system of insurance in force, appeals of this kind would be avoided. When men speak w t h feeling they sometimes say things which would be better lef t unsaid. If So far as I have said anything offensive to the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), I hope he will pardon me. I appeal to him now to make this man some allowance u n t i l the Government and the Parliament, in their wisdom, bring into operation a national system of insurance. I would cut my tongue out before I would make such a request if I thought that this man was a malingerer.",21

NA OFFICERS.",23
80,Dr EARLE PAGE,TRANSFERRED TAXATION,"On Wednesday, the 9 th of March, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) asked the following questions:1. Is it a fact that the services of several Federal Taxation officials who were transferred to the New South Wales Department of Taxation consequent on the amalgamation of the Federal and State Taxation Offices are to be dispensed with? 2. Does provision exist under the Income Tax Collection Act 1923 whereby these officers may receive compensation? 3. Should such provision not exist, is it in tended that such Act be amended in order that similar compensation be made to these officers as was given to officers previously retired under similar circumstances? 4. What principle will be observed, in the event of Federal Taxation officials now attached to the State Department being transferred to the Federal Service, in regard to their status and salary? I a m n o w in a p o s it i o n to f u r following replies:1. Yes, two officers. Mr W. A. Pert, clerk (salary, £505 per annum), services not required consequent upon the reduction in work. Miss P. M . Byrne, telephonist (salary, £178 per annum), services not required owing to installation of State Telephone Exchange, rendering the employment of Miss Byrne as telephonist unnecessary. 2. No. Under the 1923 Act compensation can be paid only to officers whose services are no longer required in consequence of economy rendered possible by the arrangements made under that Act for the collection by the States of Commonwealth income tax. The officers referred to are not being dispensed with in consequence of economy rendered l ossible under these arrangements. 3. No. The policy of the Government has been to provide for compensation on retirement only in cases where it has become necessary to dispense with the services of a large number of officers within a short period as the result of some heavy reduction in work consequent on some important change of Government policy. Wliere, in isolated cases, officers become excess, efforts are made to find suitable positions for them in some other branch of the Commonwealth Public Service, and efforts in that direction will be made in the cases of the officers referred to. 4. The Public Service Board will endeavour, wherever possible, to allot such officers to positions equivalent in classification to those previously occupied by them prior to transfer to the State Service, or to which, in the opinion of the Board, they might have attained, with salary (exclusive of allowances) at the rate they would have received had they not been transferred to the Service of the PAPERS.

81,Mr RODGERS,TRANSFERRED TAXATION,"In today's metropolitan press there appears a letter over the signature of Augustus Wolskel. This gentleman is manager of the Co-operative Phosphate Company, and in the course n is h the of his communication to the press he makes four detailed charges against myself. I do not propose to weary the House by going through those charges in detail. Mr Wolskel, of course, takes great exception to my saying that he was with the Co-operative Phosphate Company for eight years, and did not deliver the goods, because he manufactured no manure. Mr Wolskel took an interest in this phosphate company when he disposed of his own concern to the farmers, becoming general manager, and he has failed since to produce manure for the farmers.",24
82,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSFERRED TAXATION,Order I,25
83,Mr RODGERS,TRANSFERRED TAXATION,"Wit h those preliminary statements I shall deal with the charges made. Mr Wolskel, first of all, refers to "" Mr Eodgers' attack on the Phosphate Co-operative Company."" I made no attack on the company or its shareholders, and never at any time placed any impediment in its way. I challenge any one to deny that statement. I refer now to Mr Wolskel's fourth charge, which, after all, is the gravamen of the accusations he has made against me. He saysMr Rodgers' role as a champion of cheap superphosphate is interesting, in view of the fact that the now discredited sulphur duties were imposed during his tenm as Minister for Customs, and that he strenuously resisted their withdrawal. All I have to say is that the sulphur duties were not imposed during my time as Minister for Trade and Customs. They were included in the Massy Greene tariff brought down to this House when 1 was not in charge of the Trade and Customs Department. Deferred duties were proposed to come into operation on a date fixed. In the interval changes of office took place; Mr Massy Greene went to the Defence Department and I took charge of the Trade and Customs Department. In the ordinary course of events I signed the proclamation bringing the duties into force, but no representations were made to me on the subject hy anybody. Those are the facts, and they cannot be disputed. Mr Wolskel says that I strenuously resisted the withdrawal of the sulphur duties. In this connection I may say that a deputation, which was more in the nature of a demonstration, waited upon me on this subject. After hearing the representations of the deputation, I referred the whole case to the Tariff Board for reconsideration. The Tariff Board recommended that the duties be not withdrawn, and they have not been withdrawn; they have been merely suspended, and a bounty has been paid, but not on the recommendation of the board, which has consistently adhered to its original attitude. The letter continuedAt the same time, he supported the new duty on superphosphate. Everybody knows that that duty is inoperative. That statement is another portion of a deliberate fabrication to deceive the shareholders; but it does not deceive the country. Another statement is:The duties were replaced by a sulphur bounty, but no Australian sulphur has yet been produced. In that paragraph also subtle deceit takes the place of truth. The Government never pretended that sulphur could be produced in Australia. Sulphur is not a constituent of superphosphates, but sulphuric acid is, and the Commonwealth has paid over £170,000 in the form of bounty on locally-produced sulphuric acid. Statements of this character, made deliberately for the purpose of misleading the public and honest co-operators who have invested in the company, are unworthy of the person who made them. In my opinion, the time has arrived when a royal commission should be appointed to investigate the operations of this company, which has been holding the farmers' money for years.

Bill presented, and (on motion by Dr EARLE PAGE), read a first and second time. In committee: The billagreed Dr EARLE PAGE (Cowper-Trea surer) [12.15] - It is the custom each year to provide on the Estimates a vote ""Advance to the Treasurer."" This provision enables the Treasurer to make advances to the various Commonwealth Departments to meet expenditure not provided for in the ordinary divisions of of Defence, the Estimates. Particulars of such expenditure must afterwards be included Department, in a parliamentary appropriation. The Supplementary Estimates now submitted to members relate to the accounts of the year 1924-25. It is usual for such Estimates to be submitted after the annual report of the Auditor-General and the Treasurer's financial statement have been presented to Parliament. As the last Parliament closed shortly after the end of the financial year 1924-25, it was not possible for those documents to be laid on the table of the House before the new Parliament met in January, 1926. Commonwealth - The Pressure of business during the first period of this session was so great that there was no previous opportunity to bring forward Supplementary Estimates.

85,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Y a r r a ) [12.20] - The reasons given by the Treasurer for now discussing Supplementary mates for 1924-25 are sufficient. We should be discussing not those Estimates, but those for this year, 1925-26.

The Under the Auditor-General has submitted his report to Parliament for the year 1925-26, and it is now necessary to obtain approval of the Supplementary Estimates for that year in respect of expenditure made out of the vote ""Advance to the Treasurer."" The vote for Treasurer's EstiAdvance for 1925-26 was £1,500,000. really not The expenditure amounted to £511,059.

Copies of these documents have been circulated among members, and it is unnecessary to refer at length to the expenditure which is now submitted for the approval of Parliament.",27
89,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,Y a r r a ) [12.29] - We are now considering appropriations of an money that has already been expended. The control of finance has been taken out Suppleof the hands of Parliament.,27
90,Dr EARLE PAGE,SUPPLEMENTARY,"There can be no opportunity to discuss the Treasurer's reAdvance before it is expended, because the expenditure is unforeseen.",27
91,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"An opportunity should be given of checking the expenditure as soon as possible after it takes place. We are now discussing the expenditure of huge sums of money in 1924-25 and in 1925-26. Parliament has therefore not retained proper control of the public purse. Honourable members, whether free traders or protectionists, should have an opportunity to express their views on tariff schedules that are laid upon the table of the House. I am. . a strong believer in protection, and I consider that I should have an opportunity of discussing tariff schedules, with a view to improving them. All honourable members should have that right. I know that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), and other honourable members who share his views, will differ from me, for they protectionists, or, at least, such high protectionists as I but we on this side have the right to complain, because the adopted by the Government does not give us an opportunity to endeavour in this House to make the incidence of the tariff more protective. So, from every of view, the method is wrong. there was laid on the table a schedule imposing a duty on rice. I entirely agree with that duty; but there are other industries which are pressing claims that should be discussed. of those industries is a long one; they have been enumerated again and again during tariff discussions. Surely we are entitled to an opportunity of presenting claims on behalf of industries that are heing destroyed by foreign Yesterday, when the schedule for the duty on rice was placed on the table, I asked for progress to be reported, because it was not possible for me, on the spur of the moment, to discuss that schedule, or even to decide definitely whether the proposal was good or bad. I recognize that a tariff schedule must be placed on the table without notice being given of the intention to table it, so that it is impossible to obtain information about it in advance; but, the schedule having been placed on the table, the proper is to adjourn the discussion. aware, when I asked that progress be reported, that it was probable that we should not deal with the subject again this session, and other honourable members were well aware of that, too; but honourable members on this side were forced to accept the schedule or, by raising an objection to it, risk losing protection for an industry that is badly in need of it. If , knowing that it was the Government's intention that Parliament should rise this week, we had demanded time for discussion, we might have delayed the granting of protection to an industry that needs it at once. Although at all times I am ready to safeguard the rights of honourable members, I had to be practical and recognize that the alternative in this instance was to let the industry go unprotected. The protectionists in the House chose the less of ' two evils. acquiesced in the schedule being passed, Mr Scullin. are not not because we approved of the procedure, are not but because we recognized that the indusam; try needed protection. Last year a schedule was placed on the table imposing procedure duties that I support, extensions and additions of which I should probably be prepared to urge from this side of the House; but the opportunity to do so has point been denied to me. The earliest opporYesterday tunity we can have now will be in September next, and it may be denied to us even then.  urgent must know that no tariff schedule The list has yet been placed on the table of this Parliament and discussed immediately.",27
92,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I cannot agree that the Minister's statement is correct. Tariff . schedules have been placed on the table and have been discussed within a few competition. weeks. I can recall the tariff imposed when the late Mr Tudor was Minister for Trade and Customs. It was discussed almost immediately afterwards. It is true that no considerable amendment of the tariff can be discussed immediately, but there is a vast difference between discussing a thing immediately and allowing it to remain undiscussed for twelve months or more. In the history of this Parliament there has been every session a rush to reach recess, and we have consequently been denied opportunities for procedure proper discussion. The Treasurer has I was well said that in 1924-25 we were unfortunately rushed to an election. "" U n for tunately rushed! "" F r o m the Government's point of view, I should think that they were most fortunately rushed.",28
93,Dr EARLE PAGE,SUPPLEMENTARY,The honourable member and his party asked for it .,28
94,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Not at all. The in vitation came from persons outside, who were doing a few things that suited the book of the Government, who wanted a stunt election. The Treasurer's explanation does not excuse the Government for not allowing the tariff on that occasion to be discussed. That tariff was discussed months afterwards. What about the next year? The tariff was laid on the table in the dying days of the last session, and there is no reason why it should not have been tabled earlier. Why did the Parliament close in such a We hurry last year? The Treasurer has said that it was because of the referendum; but there was no need to rusb that referat endum. One of the greatest disservices rendered to those who seek an alteration of the Constitution was the rushing of that referendum. The procedure the electors no proper to hear the side of that could be put only from the public platform, and they were lef t at the mercy of the public press, which was unanibeen mously against the proposed alterations. In these conditions, the referendum was, from the beginning, doomed to failure. Many honourable warned the Government of what would happen. Really the Government rushed into recess because the Prime M in ister was leaving to attend the Imperial Conference, although it then had two alternatives. Parliament could been called together earlier in the year, or it could have continued sitting after the Prime Minister had left for Great B r it a in . This is surely not a Parliament! Surely it can continue to transact business while the Prime M in ister is abroad! The Minister for Trade  sufficient experience, and possesses enough ability to enable him to conduct a tariff debate in the absence Prime Minister. I pay him compliment of saying that he conducted the last tariff debate ably, and received earnest assistance from this side of House. ",28
95,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"We accept the comthe pliment, and he will receive the same support again to build up Australian in dustries. Nevertheless, we demand the opportunity to discuss the tariff. We want to express, with all the vigor have, the views we hold as to the need for building up Australian industries; but we are not given the opportunity to do that. I venture the opinion that if we had the opportunity, we could impress the Minister with the need for a tariff schedule for industries not now protected. I could mention an industry in connection with which I have introto duced deputations to the Minister-a industry which is, no doubt, within his knowledge. It may be out of existence before this Parliament meets at Canberra. Those engaged in it forward one of the best cases ever submitted for protection; but after we meet. Canberra it will be too late to protect an industry that has, in the meantime, gone out of existence. A striking thing happened in connection with the industry gave for manufacturing aluminium ware. Beopportunity fore it was established in this country, we had to pay enormous prices for aluthe case minium articles; but as soon as the local ware was on the market, prices dropped to less than a half. The Minister has furnished with the figures, and if the industry is crushed out of existence, for want of protection, this country will again be at the mercy of manufacturers members abroad, and prices will again rise. That industry is not protected, and I was in great hopes that during this session a - schedule would be tabled to give it a measure of protection. The timber industry also requires serious investigation, have and, I believe, adequate protection. Opportunities to discuss these matters are denied to us, and we are here now, within a few hours of the closing of this Parliaone-man ment, and shall not have an opportunity until the end of the year to deal with these urgent matters. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) said a few days ago that it was the duty of the Leader of the Opposition to preserve the privileges of members of Parliament. }.t is at least the obligation of the Leader of the of the Opposition to do what he can to the protect the privileges of members of the Opposition; but may I suggest to the honourable member for Perth, and to any the other honourable members who criticise the Government from that side of the House, that in their hands lies the means of shaping the Government's programme. Theirs is the responsibility, and theirs is opportunity to say what the Government shall do, when it shall do it , and how it shall do it . All we, on this side, can do is to stand up and criticize; we have not the numbers to force our views we on the House. I lodge this protest, not because I am in sympathy with the object of the free traders, who want to reduce duties, and not because I want to discourage the Minister from protecting industries. I recognize that the Minister is only one member of the Cabinet, and of his party, and if he finds that he is not allowed to provide an opportunity discuss the tariif, but must present n schedules as he has presented the schedule for the rice duty, I prefer him to do it in that way rather than not at all. At the same time, I protest that it ought to be done in a way that will protect the have put privileges of honourable members. I protest .against the delay in tabling the report of the Commissioner of Taxation. I asked the Treasurer the other day a question about the report, and he replied that it was being prepared. That report is usually laid on the table on the last day of the session. is the report of an officer who collects and controls more millions than any other department, except the Trade and Customs Department. He has of all the direct taxation imposed by the Commonwealth, and this report >s an account of his actions, and of the work of his department, for the year 1925-26. Honourable members are not being given a proper chance to discuss it . a previous occasion I had to protest that one of the Commissioner's reports w,as not presented for three years. Since then we have been presented with a report each year, usually on the last day of the session, and on one occasion within twenty minutes of the close of it . Before we can properly discuss the financial affairs of the country, we need the information that these reports contain respecting the collection, assessment, remission, and reduction of income and land taxation. The Treasurer tabled only the olher day an important report relating to taxation remissions, and we have not had an opportunity to discuss it. I make no charges against the Commissioner of Taxation; but I hold that as the custodians of the public purse we should have within a reasonable time the information .which he is required by statute to supply to us. The honourable member for (Mr Bowden) during question time this morn'ng raided thd subject of the salaries of the officers of Parliament. ture to say that practically every honorbut able member of the committee will agree with me that the parliamentary are not being fairly treated. the branch of the public service which creases m salary seems most diffident about making comto them. I was glad to have the assur- "" plaints, and I have not received any plaints from them; but we should tolerate the treatment that is being meted out to them. From the humblest cleaner it will be considered at once. and messenger to the highest official, parliamentary officers are rendering faithful service, and it is only because they are so attentive to their duties, and do their work so well, that the parliamorning mentary machine works smoothly. is not a. member of the Parliament ifr. Scullin. is not under a deep debt of gratitude to the officers of the Hansard staff. A claim for a revision of salaries was made on behalf of the officers twelve months ago, and no decision in respect to it has yet been announced. Six months ago a It definite promise was made by the President of the Senate (Senator Newlands) that the matter would receive attention, and several replies have been made since control then that it was being considered. Since the outbreak of the war the cost of livin g has risen by 74 peT cent., but the average increase in the salaries of our parliamentary officers has risen by only 25 per cent. Some officers, as a matter of fact, On have received only a 12 per cent, in crease. The increase in the pay of the general public service has averaged 70 per cent., so that even the public officers outside of Parliament have not received enough to cover completely the increased cost of living, but the parliamentary officers, who are nearest to us, and under our eyes practically every day, have been left in a shocking position. I make an appeal for something to be done for them at once. Some officers of this Parliament who have held their positions for 20 years are receiving less than £4 10s. a week. Honorable MEMBERS - Shame !",29
96,Mr SCULLTN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"It is a shame. Some of these men who will be transferred to Canberra, will 'actually have to incur debts in order to pay their way. That is a deplorable state of affairs. The transfer is a serious matter for the whole staff, from the bottom to the top, and the Parramatta officers are not receiving the consideration that should be given to them. It has been said that salaries will be adI venjusted after the removal to Canberra; why should the matter be delayed 1 Whatever allowance is made to officers in officers consequence of! their removal, should They are be quite apart from the in which are due v comance of Mr Speaker (Sir - Littleton not Groom) this morning that the matter will be given consideration. I trust that The our increases that are granted should be made us retrospective to the date of the claim.",30
97,Mr BOWDEN,SUPPLEMENTARY,Mr Speaker stated this that the matter was being conThere sidered only in connection with the who preparation of next year's Estimates.,30
98,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"That is quite wrong. The claim was made twelve months ago, and the increases should be retrospective. If private employers delay the hearing of claims before the Arbitration Court in the hope that they may save money, the judge takes care to frustrate them by making the new rates retrospective to the date of the claim. If we consider that that is a proper policy to apply to private employers, we should apply it to ourselves. It is easy to delay making awards, and then grant them only from the date on which a decision is reached; but it is not fair to .do it. I ask the Government to give every consideration to these claims. For many years the whole of the Commonwealth Government printing has been done in the Victorian Government Printing Office. I understand that we have paid half the expenses of the printing office; but it seems to me that, as a matter of grace, if not as a matter of justice, though, perhaps, the interests of both would be served, it would be a reasonable thing, now that the Commonwealth is about to sever its connection with the State Printing Office, for it to make a grant to the printing ofiice employees in recognition of their arduous work in our behalf. The employees there have often had to work from 5.30 p.m. till 4 a.m., and sometimes even for fourteen hours on end, to keep our work up to date. It would be a fitting thing for. the Government to make an inquiry and grant some monetary recognition to the men whom they consider deserve it.for their extra work. In conclusion, I feel constrained to urge again the fairness of giving immediate consideration to the claims that have been made on behalf of the parliamentary officers. I trust that, when this Parliament meets in its new home at Canberra, we shall change our methods considerably, and deal with our business in such a way that honourable members will be able to djgeuss it fully.",31
99,Mr BOWDEN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Parramatta) [12.54]. - I emphasize the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) respecting .the delay in tabling revised tariff schedules. I greatly regret that nothing is likely to be done in the near future to increase the timber duties. Some of the mills in New South Wales will probably have to cease operations before we shall be able to give consideration to this matter next September. I dislike the imposition of high duties, and am glad that we have constituted the Tariff Board to advise us in respect to the rate of duty which should be imposed on various commodities; but unfortunately, the board has been overwhelmed with work. It is highly desirable, in my opinion, that another member should be appointed to the board, and that the act should be amended to enable the commissioners to take evidence individually. The attitude that the Defence Department has adopted in meeting claims for compensation in respect of trainees who are killed in training operations is most unsatisfactory. The department, in cases where it is not proved that relatives are dependent on the trainees who lose their lives, makes a grant of only £15 towards funeral expenses. I am afraid that I must accept the responsibility for fixing that amount; though, on my own behalf, may I say that I increased it from £10? I now know that that figure is quite inadequate. The Navy Department has adopted the practice of making a grant of £50 in respect of the death of trainees on service, regardless of whether there are dependants; and that vote is not at all too large. It often happens that the family of the deceased trainee is not in a good financial position, and is sometimes seriously embarrassed in consequence of the expenses that must be incurred. I have in mind the death of a young man named Aitcheson, at the Liverpool camp last year. The father of the boy is a railway pensioner, and neither he nor his daughter could prove that there was any actual dependence upon the lad, who was in the last year of his apprenticeship. Both of them, however, were expecting to receive considerable help in the following year, when the youngman expected to begin work as a journeyman tradesman. Eventually the Military Department agreed to pay the whole of the funeral expenses of the boy, which amounted to about £30. I urge the Minister for Defence (Senator Glasgow) to make the practice in the Military Department uniform with that which is followed by the Navy Department. Our young men aro compelled to enter camp, and in the cases where death overtakes them in camp the least we can do is to ensure that their relatives shall not he financially embarrassed by the fact.",31

101,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Wimmera) [1.45] I rise to join in the protest made yesterday by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), and the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), against the procedure adopted by the Government in introducing tariff duties in the dying hours of the session. I do not propose to discuss the merits or demerits of duties, either on rice or on iron and steel; but protest against the highly irregular procedure that has been observed. On 12th August last the schedule of the iron and steel duties was laid before the House the very day before the Parliament rose for the year. The schedule dealt with highly important items, and provided for heavy increases of duty on iron and steel, including fencing wire, wire netting, barbed wire, and other articles of first importance to the farming community. I recognize that no notice can be given by the Government of the introduction of such schedules, and it is true, as the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) remarked this morning, that it is not usual to have them immediately adopted; but, as indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, at least some reasonable degree of decency should be observed in the matter. The iron and steel duties were brought down last year before the Tariff Board's inquiry into all phases of the industry had been completed. I believe that one copy of the board's report was in the hands of the Minister. The Leader of the Opposition saw it, but I did not, and have not yet seen it. Altliough a considerable time has elapsed since the schedule was presented, honourable members have not received the complete report of the board.  been tabled, because it has not been comtheir pletely deal,t with by the Government.",32
102,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,Was there not a that progress report? ,32
103,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"That makes the position all the more extraordinary. I worse than a crime. take it that the investigation has been completed, and the report is not yet issued; but honourable members are entitled to the reasons for the introduction of the schedule. There was a carefully prepared plan of campaign in the agitation for the iron and steel duties. For many months prior to their introduction there were half-page and full-page advertisements in the press, calling attention to the importance of the industry. Simultaneously, there was an application to the Tariff Board, and evidence was given by highly skilled accountants on behalf of the companies interested. Nobody can complain about that. Our letter boxes were filled with expensive and well-preI pared literature-no t pounds of it, but literally hundred-weights of it. What I do object to, however, is that when the honourable member for Perth and I asked for permission to discuss the proposed duties it was refused, and the House rose for the year. Now the present session is drawing to a close, and no opportunity has been given to us to debate that matter. I call attention to the manner in which tariff legislation influences the business community. The day after the presentation of the iron and steel duties there appeared a report in the Melbourne Herald stating that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's shares were in strong demand. The report showed that shares which, on the 31st of March were quoted at 26s. had, through successive stages, closed that evening at 32s. 4d. in an excited market.",32
104,Mr GULLETT,SUPPLEMENTARY,But were not those shares already 6s. above par?,32
105,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Yes . The Morning Post of the 14th August, the day after the House rose, announced that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company advised having sent a cablegram to its office in London, stating that its profits for the year ended 31st May amounted to £303,000,. after allowing £293,000 for depreciation. I do not suggest that the Commonwealth Government is in league with the large business concerns in a scheme to increase profits; but the introduction in the dying hours of the session of legislation has such a profound effect upon the financial and business world should not be tolerated.",32
106,Mr MANN,SUPPLEMENTARY,A blunder is sometimes ,32
107,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I am speaking of the procedure, and I protest against it. Legislation of this nature is based almost entirely on reports of the Tariff Board.",32
108,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY,Does the honourable member say that the board is bribed?,33
109,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,That is the honourable member's suggestion.,33
110,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY,The honourable member has hinted at it .,33
111,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I am hinting at nothing; but I protest against the insinuation that opponents of the iron and steel duties are unpatriotic Australians. I have gone into the outback country and opened up scrub land. I live in the Mallee at the present time, and rightly or wrongly I protest against the fiscal policy of this country, not because I wish to destroy a match factory at Richmond, or a boot factory at Collingwood, but because I wish to save the primary industries of Australia from destruction. of the Government in permitting i m portant legislation to be rushed through the Chamber should not be countenanced. We have no chance to debate the merits of these proposals. The iron and steel duties were introduced last year.  that now under consideration.",33
112,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Yes , in a similar manner, as the honourable member rightly reminds me. A f t e r we rise this evening, we may not have an opportunity before next September, and perhaps not even then, to discuss a tariff schedule introduced in this House in August, 1926. It is possible that it may not be considered before 1928. Surely the Government must admit that this procedure is very undesirable. Surely there is no motive behind its adoption. It is a part of the rush policy of the present Government. Members of the Government appear to think that if they want to have anything done they must rush it . If you want to win an election, rush it . If you want to win a referendum, rush it-bu t in that case the rush tactics did not come off. I have no wish to make a party issue of this matter, but we are all deeply interested in the Tariff Board's reports.  get them in time.",33
113,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"We should have them in proper time, and the Government should withhold legislation of this kind until honourable members have an opportunity of digesting the Tariff Board's reports. We are entitled to more evidence before these tariff proposals are brought into effect. Whether it is due to the in fluence of the Minister for Trade and Customs or not, I do not know; but the Prime Minister and other members of the Government seem to be under the honourable gentleman's thumb. If this is because the honourable member is determined to be an absolute dictator, then I must congratulate him upon having achieved his object; but, as his assumption of such a position is not good for the country, I protest against it .  Trade and Customs) [2.2] - As time passes, and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), during one of his infrequent visits to the House",33
114,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"The honourable gentleman must be hard up for argument.  matter which he has already referred to several times, I desire, as the Minister responsible for the Trade and Customs Department, to have a word or two to say. Listening to the honourable member, one might think that the Government, and I in particular, are adopting a course which was never previously followed.",33
115,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I said that the Government was following an undesirable course.  orable members that the 1902 tariff was introduced by Mr Kingston on the 8th October, 1901, and was not assented to until the 16th September, 1902.",33
116,Mr GULLETT,SUPPLEMENTARY,"But it was debated during the interval.  was not discussed for a number of months. The Tudor tariff of 1910-11 was promptly dealt with. The tariff resolution submitted in 1914 by Mr Tudor was never dealt with , and lapsed when the tariff of 1920 was introduced.",33
117,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"That was owing to the war. Why does not the honourable gentleman be fair?  laid on the table by Mr Massy Greene on the 24th March, 1920, was discussed towards the middle of the year 1921, and was passed in December of that year. The tariff schedule which I had the honour to introduce was laid on the table in September, 1925. At the time there was no had thought of a general election, but two or three weeks later a general election was decided upon, and the tariff schedule to which I refer was passed by this House in March of last year. There has been a number of instances in which tariff resolutions were laid on the table, and were not discussed for some considerable time afterwards. This practice is not without some benefit to the House as well as to the commercial community. I shall refer shortly to the specific matter about which the honourable member for Wimmera has complained. If he will look up the remarks I made in tabling the resolutions covering the iron and steel foreign duties in August last, he will find that the Tariff Board had reported certain things to the Government regarding the position of the whole industry, and that there was a threat from the continental steel trusts against the iron and steel industry of Australia, which demanded the most urgent action. I am proud to be able to say that, when these matters are discussed, figures will be submitted which will show that the imposition of these duties entirely checked the threatened assault on that basic industry. I said at the time of the introduction of that tariff schedule, and once or twice since, that the Government has not yet completed its consideration of the recommendations made with regard to the British side of that great basic industry. I say now, deliberately, that the Government has not yet finalized its policy with regard also to other items of the tariff. I am, however, very hopeful that in the not very distant f u ture we shall be able to submit up-to-date necessary tarilf legislation for the further protection of Australian secondary industries. In view of the precedents which can be quoted, I contend that the Government is pursuing a course which has the entire approval of a majority of the members of this House. Now I come to the question of profits, and the-shal l I saysubtle and sinister suggestion that the Broken Hill people engaged in the steel industry have done something they had no right to do?",33

120,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"-Le t the honourable gentleman give us his evidence. What branch of the company's business did make the profits?  the Government is ready, the whole of the information will be placed before honourable members to enable them to see what the actual position is, before these matters are decided. I would like to say a good deal more about the political inconsistencies of the honourable member for Wimmera.",34

This is the gentlen - man-and all credit to him for the action he took in this case-wh o sent an order to Thompson's for locomotive engines, agreeing to pay an extra price in order to secure that the engines should be manufactured in Australia. But it is useless for any member of this House to blow hot and cold on the fiscal controversy. I want to tell the honourable member that his constituents, the dried fruit-growers, have benefited to the extent of almost £250,000 yearly from the protection given to the dried fruits industry, and that the people of Australia without complaint are paying £20 per ton more than the industry can secure for the dried f r u it s it exports overseas. able member blows hot and cold on the fiscal issue, and while I have no objection to his supporting the dried f r u it s industry, he ought not, in fairness, to attack other industries.",34
124,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Maribyrnong) [2.13]. - I j o in in the protest against rush legislation, whether dealing with the tariff or any other matter, I wish to refer to the levy being made on local authorities and public bodies throughout the Commonwealth by a firm in Australia that controls the selling and performing rights of practically all the saleable music composed throughout the world during the last 50 years. all possible, the Attorney-General (Mr . Latham) should take action to check these people. There: 'must be over 10,000 public halls of entertainment controlled by authorities upon whom the Performing Rights Association levies tax. That is not in accordance with international copyright. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the employment of Italians on public works. As in the course of the next ten years this Parliament will have voted some £20,000,000 for the construction of roads in Australia, it should be vitally interested to know who are to receive payment for work done on those roads. The Croydon Progress Association, in conjunction with the Australian Workers Union, haa made a protest in regard to the employment of Italians on road work, and according to a report in the Aye of the 16th of M a r c h Mr J. MCPherson, secretary of Melbourne district branch of A.W.U., yesterday reported having interviewed a Britisher who complained that he had been rejected by the contractor in favour of an Italian. This man had informed him that when he asked the contractor for a job the contractor told him that if ho were wanted ho would be sent for. Ho was not sent for, though afterwards foreigners were engaged. The man who was thus treated had enlisted from Australia, and on his return from the war set up as a dairy farmer, but was forced to relinquish it on account of adverse conditions. Unable to get sufficient work to support his wife, he was sending her back to England, while he, disgusted at the treatment meted out to liim, was packing up his swag and going into the country to look for work. Mr MCPherson said this practice of giving preference to foreigners was growing to be a common occurrence. The moment a boatload of Jugo-Slavs, Italians, or Maltese arrived they were snapped up, in many instances, because they would work for less than The honor- award rates. Croydon, I believe, is in the constituency of the Prime Minister. In yesterday's Age appeared the following telegram from Rochester, which is in the constituency of the Premier of Victoria ROAD CONSTRUCTION. ITALIAN LABOURERS EMPLOYED. ROCHESTER, Tuesday - The Blue Metal Quarries Co., who secured the tender of the Country Roads Board to re-form seven miles of the main road between Echuca and Rochester, are employing all Italians on the job. The tender was about £12,000, and the wage sheet will be £600 a fortnight. Unless we take a determined stand against the wholesale admission of If at southern Europeans, there will be a big row in this country. These people are given employment as soon as they arrive. Mr G. FRANCIS - They are being encouraged by the Government of Queensland.",35
125,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Not at the present time. While native-born Australians and Britishers are tramping the roads in search of work, road contractors, who are probably spending Commonwealth money, are giving preference to Italians The time has arrived for Parliament to express its will in regard to this matter. Some time ago 99 per cent, of the Australian population was of British origin ; today the percentage is down to 97 per cent. Is this dilution of our population to continue? It is high time that this Parliament adopted some policy which would ensure that 98 per cent, of Australia's population shall be of British origin. I have nothing to say against any man on account of the country of his origin ; but by means of the tariff, wages boards, and Arbitration Courts, we have built un in this country standards of living and working conditions which must be preserved, and the Government should do everything possible to prevent foreigners being admitted and given preference of employment to the detriment of the sons of Australians, many of whom are farmers and orchardists.",35
126,Mr GULLETT,SUPPLEMENTARY,"He n t y ) [2.20] - In regard to a matter which has been mentioned today, I cannot remain silent and yet be true to the 70,000 electors I represent in this House. I add my emphatic protest to what has bei n already said against the irregular and growing practice of tabling schedules of n«w tariff duties in the last moments of a series of parliamentary sittings. procedure is tantamount to holding members of this House in the utmost contempt; through the Minister for Trade and Customs the Government is holding us much top cheaply. The new duties on rice will increase the cost of living of every household in Australia. Rice is an important foodstuff that goes into universal consumption; yet the Minister for Trade and Customs tabled an in crease of duty which will make this com modity more costly, and the duty immediately became operative without any explanation or justification of it having been offered to Parliament. The cost of living was thus increased by an arbitrary Ministerial action which I regard as entirely unjustifiable and unparliamentary. We had to submit to the same indignity-last year in connection with the new steel duties. The cost of what is a parent material in Australian industrial life was increased without the representatives of the people of the House' being consulted or allowed to express any opinion. My protectionist principles"" cannot be suspect, for, except cm two occasions, I voted with the M i nister in support of last year's list of new Customs imposts. But I have become somewhat wearied of ing the honourable gentleman testifying from his place in this House to the extraordinary .prosperity and increase of production and employment which have followed each new increase in the tariff. What is the true economic position ? In the great city of Melbourne the cost of living is already higher in any other city of the world, with two exceptions, and a further increase is in volved in the new rice duties which, without one word of explanation or discussion in Parliament, are now being collected. Despite all that the Minister has told us of the increased employment given by the fostered industries, the ratio of unemployment during the last four years has been higher than at any previous time in the history of this country, and it is almost twice as high as it was before the war. These facts are exceedingly serious, and should dissuade the Government from further increasing the j cost of living with, possibly, a further increase in the ratio of unemployment, without giving to this House an opportunity to express its opinion. This I sincerely associate myself with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Scullin) in the plea he made on behalf of the staff of this Parliament. I have been familiar with many of these officers almost from the inception of federation, and I have had from thetm nothing but courtesy, kindness, and valuable assistance. I hope that the time is near at hand when the parliamentary staffs will be removed from the direct and special control of Parliament, and will , like all other public servants, have their conditions of employment regulated by the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator.",36
127,Mr THOMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY,"New , England) [2.25] - So far as my knowledge goes, the Minister for Trade and Customs was totally wrong in saying that the majority of members of this chamber approve of his action in tabling new tariff duties, and not affording Parliament an opportunity to discuss them. As a member of the Country party, representing a purely r u r a l constituency, I strongly object to that practice, and I protest against the tremendous power that is being vested by the Government hear- and the Parliament in the Tariff Board. That body has becomethe most potent instrument for good or ill ever established in this country, and I do not think that honourable members realise the harm that it can do if it - is not properly curbed by Parliament. A few days aeo I susrerested that the time has arrived than for the tariff machinery to be overhauled. My own opinion is that the Tariff Board has become overloaded and unworkable. It consists of four members, three of whom represent the great secondary industries, and it is gradually assuming control, not only of the secondary industries, but also of the primary industries. In this way its scope. and power are being enormously increased, and it behoves Parliament to consider the effect of this development upon the economic life of the country. The board is probably doing its work in an able and conscientious way, but is unable to cope with the tremendous tasks entrusted to it by the Government. Practically every industry, secondary primary, is being investigated by the board with a view to giving some meaobjection sure of tariff protection or other foirn of assistance. That being so, it is not fair to place the primary industries at the mercy of the board. Many of the primary producers do not know where they stand, because their industries are being investigated by Tariff Board, and no reports are being placed before Parliament. In the tobacco industry, two or three hundred growers are awaiting the board's report, which we were told would be placed before Parliament during this session. It has been in the hands of the Minister since the 7th March, and he has told that he has had no opportunity to bring it before Cabinet for consideration. That means that it will not be premeet sented to Parliament before the end this year, and the industry will practicallv held up for twelve months. This is but one instance of the utter capacity of the board to carry the gigantic burdens which have been placed on its shoulders. I therefore suggest that the Government should, without delay, reconsider the constitution board with a view to the appointment of a separate authority to investigate the primary industries: If that the present delay in investigating industries and having their conditions considered by Parliament will be avoided. One matter that has received very little attention recently is the proposal of the Government to appoint a Constiphosphates tutional Select Committee. Newspaper references and replies by Ministers questions have indicated the definite tention of the Ministry to appoint Select Committee, of not more than fifteen members, to sit during recess, consider proposed amendments of the Constitution, and report to Parliament prior to the holding of a special coneffect, stitutional session. We have had announcement about a constitutional figures. session, although we were given to understand that one would be made during this session. The Parliament will now adjourn until almost the end of the year, and nothing will it be done. We have been told by the press that a difficulty has arisen respecting the representation of the various parties and upon the proposed constitutional select committee, and that, as the result of the made by the Labour party to the proportion of party members proposed to be allotted to that committee, it is not likely to be appointed. This will be a great disappointment to a large number of people who are watching with keen interest this novel proposal to get down to the tin-tacks, and to draw up some scheme for constitutional reform. The matter is of such vital consequence to the future of Australia that it would be absurd in the extreme for the Government to allow such a small difficulty to kill this promising proposal. As it is a non-party matter, the actual representation of the parties on us the committee is not of great concern, and I think that the Prime Minister would be acting reasonably if he tried to the wishes of the Labour party. I of am sure that any such action would meet be with the approval of most honourable members. Some honourable members have insuggested the appointment of a royal commission instead of a select committee; and, if the Government has any definite policy on this matter, it should make an early public announcement, so that the of the people may know that not only this Government, but also this Parliament, is sincere in its promise to tackle the quesis done tion of constitutional reform.",36
128,Mr RODGERS,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Wannon) [2.33.]-On Tuesday last, by moving the adjournment of the House, I brought before honourable members the variation of prices of superin Australia and New Zealand, and pointed out that the difference to in price for similar phosphate in the incurrent season was £1 5s. a ton. I had a occasion to be away from this chamber yesterday, and, on returning, I took the opportunity to read two statements, one by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and one by the trade. The trade stated, in that apparently I did not know the no facts. Well, no one has challenged my It is a question, not of facts, but of figures, and mine are unchallengeable. I have had them confirmed by cable from New Zealand, and I challenge the trade or any one else to refute them. Neither the Prime Minister nor the trade has done so, but both have referred to the trade war in New Zealand. If a trade war has started there, is it not obvious that there was a necessity for it; that the primary producers of New Zealand have revolted against the prices charged them? That was the casus belli, of which honourable members might well take notice. Meanwhile, our primary producers are paying 25s. a ton more for superphosphate than the primary producers of New Zealand, and to that extent are handicapped in the markets of the world. Our dairymen are today seeking an increase of the duty on butter, to protect themselves from the competition of the New Zealand dairymen, who are at a decided advantage, because they pay less for their superphosphates. I certainly expected from the Prime Minister something more than he has promised. I am sorry that he is not present in the chamber. I am not satisfied with his statement that an investigation of the position will be undertaken by Mr. Clive MCPherson, the newly-appointed Australian representative to the Phosphate Commission. I want a first class investigation of the superphosphate industry of Australia, from the hewing of the phosphate rock to the manufacture of superphosphates. want to know, on behalf of the Australian primary producer, if the rock is being hewn, put on board ship, and carried overseas on the most economical and scientific basis. A complete investigation should be made into the manufacturing process and method of distribution in Australia. I know Mr Clive MCPherson, and I have a personal regard for him. He is a first class man of the land. The Minister may be assumed to be a man of the land, too, but he would scarcely have the presumption to investigate a highly scientific industry, and to decide whether the process of manufacture was economical or even right. A primary producer is not competent to undertake this inquiry into one of the basic requirements of the man on the land. I can point to the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) who served with distinction an an agricultural chemist in . Western Australia, and to other honourable members with long experience of primary production, who could be appointed to a if r . Rodger*. royal commission to investigate this subject. I would have no objection to Mr. Clive MCPherson being a member of such a commission. He is new to his office, and he has yet to familiarize himself with the whole conditions of the Phosphate Commission.  business man.",37
129,Mr RODGERS,SUPPLEMENTARY,"He is an estimable man of the land, and as such is not capable of undertaking an investigation of this description. He must rely upon second-hand information. He has no technical knowledge, and therefore could not, after inquiry, present to the Government a report that would satisfy it that he had scientifically and intelligently examined the industry from every possible angle. The Government is primarily interested in this matter, because it is in partnership with the Governments of Great Britain and New Zealand in this great enterprise. The Government is primarily responsible for the supply of the raw material, and it cannot escape responsibility for the conditions of manufacture in Australia. It has put its hand to the task, and it must not place the industry entirely at the mercy of the trade. This subject is far too important for the Government, in the dying hours I of this session, to brush aside, in the hope that it will be forgotten. It will not be forgotten by me or by the primary producers of Australia. The supply of superphosphates is fundamental to Australian production. To satisfy the primary producers, the Government should appoint a strongly equipped royal commission to investigate the industry from beginning to end. Such an inquiry would probably bring about a cheaper and more liberal and satisfactory supply of superphosphates. Why should the primary producers be supplied with superphosphates on a hand-to-mouth basis? The Prime Minister the other day, in reply to my statement, said that there was an excessive demand for superphosphates, and that the price had consequently increased. My experience . is that the greater the output the lower the cost of production. That is the economic factor in all businesses. An increased output means reduced costs of production and distribution. The whole industry is in an unsatisfactory position, and I hope that the Government, even at this late hour, will consent to the appointment of a royal commission to investigate and report upon it .",38
130,Mr STEWART,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Wimmera) [ 2 . 4 2 ] - I wish to reply to observations made by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Pratten), who, I regret, is not in the chamber at the moment. I made a specific charge against the Government. 1 complained of the procedure adopted in presenting tariff schedules in the dying hours of the session, without permitting honourable members to have access to the reasons which actuated the Government in presenting them. I made no reference to the merits or demerits of high or low duties on iron, steel, or rice. Yet the Minister has seen fit to make a personal attack upon me. He made reference to my infrequent visits to this chamber; which presupposes that I am neglecting my duties as a representative of the people. That charge I emphatically resent. It ill becomes a Minister who, by the full and free acquiescence of honourable members, obtained four months' leave of absence only this morning. The Minister also referred to the action that I took when a member of the Bruce-Page Ministry in connection with a certain engine contract. What on earth has an engine contract, entered into years ago, got to do with the speech I made today complaining about the introduction of tariff schedules in the dying hours of the session 1 The Treasurer went to my constituency last week and referred to the same thing. Both those honourable gentlemen know that by virtue of my position at that time as a member of the Cabinet, I am unable to make the most effective of all replies to that charge; but I go so far as to say-for I shall not sit down under this kind of treatment-that as the Minister for Works at that time. I made a certain recommendation, and I challenge the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the Treasurer, to read it to the com- . mittee. I leave the matter at that. The Minister for Trade and Customs, in looking for something to allege against me, wandered to the field of dates, and waved most dramatically a document which-to use the phrase of the man in the street-wa s going to blow me "" kite high."" He read what he would ' lead honourable members to believe was unimpeachable evidence of my inconsistency. He said that a certain deputation introduced by me advocated a duty on dates, and when I asked him to read the speech that I made in introducing the deputation, he did not do so. All he has proved is that a certain deputation, which I introduced, made a request for a duty on dates. When the time comes I shall make my attitude clear on that matter, or on any other, but the honourable gentleman jumped right away from the point that I made. I admit that he was hard up for an argument, and had to draw half a dozen red herrings across the t r a i l ; but, allowing for all that, he might have been a little more decent in what he said. He spoke of a sum of £250,000 that had been handed to the dried-fruits industry in the form of protection, but he did not say that those engaged in the industry are paying a much larger sum than £250,000 in the increased cost of production resulting from the protection of secondary industries. He did not say that they were receiving Australian prices for one-fifth of their produce, and were paying Australian prices for 100 per cent, of their requirements. Although the protection of the industry has undoubtedly been responsible for its development, I challenge the honourable member-and he has plenty of secretaries to search the records for him - to point to one speech that I have made advocating duties or increased duties on dried fruits. What I have objected to is not the imposition of duties, for I am prepared to agree that in certain circumstances duties are permissible, but the continual increasing of duties. If the Government brought forward a proposal to remove all duties I should oppose it as vigorously as would the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins)'., or the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton). I assert that the enormous revenue now being derived from Customs duties is of no value to the primary producers, and I respectfully suggest that it is doing no good to the secondary industries. I wish to join with my honourable friend, the member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers), in protesting against the in crease in the price of superphosphate: and I join with him, also, in expressing the hope that the Prime Minister will grapple with this subject as one that calls for immediate action. Superphosphate is a vital necessity to the primary producer; ita use is increasing year by year. I hope that the representations of the honourable member will have the serious attention of the Government.",39

Ten days later the honourable member for it . Indi (Mr Cook) asked a somewhat similar but more technical question, prepared, he was good enough to in for m me, by technical officers associated with the in dustry. He received a reply which was framed, no doubt, by the technical advisers of the Minister, ,and included this statement:The addition of bicarbonate of soda to for neutralizing purposes in connection with manufacture of butter will not be regarded contravention of the regulation. Does the Minister still stand by that statement ? ",40
133,Mr RODGERS,SUPPLEMENTARY,"The Minister read only part of the Britis h health authoriin ties' regulation. I purpose to read the whole of the definition of ""preserva- "" tives "" Preservative means any substance which is viously reached. capahle of inhibiting, retarding, or assisting process of fermentation, acidification, or other decomposition of food, or of masking any the evidence of putrefaction, but does not clude common salt, saltpetre, sugar, acetic acid or vinegar, alcohol or potable spirits, hop extract, spices and essential oils used for flavouring purposes, or any substance to food by the process of curing known as smoking.

134,Mr RODGERS,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Then there is a positive conflict of opinion between the Minister, his technical advisers, and the technical experts of this country.

What were added previously high grade and first grade butters will become, before they reach the consumers in Great Britain , inferior butters. The Minister was once a dairyman, and no one ought to be more conscious than he of the crisis that now faces the industry. That crisis can be met only if the Government and its advisers produce before January next a positive formula that will enable the dairyman to manufacture and export butter without the use of preservatives, and to land it in a condition that will admit of its being sold as first class butter. I make no apology for taking up the time of the House with this matter. This is the last opportunity I shall have to speak on this subject before the export season opens. I wish to read a short extract from the report of the Dairymen's Conference, held in August, 1926""Australian manufacturers of butter will be in a serious position from January, 1928, when the use of preservative in butter exported to Great Britain will be prohibited,"" said Mr J. Proud, at the butter factory managers' confer Association on the Australian Dairy Council. '- Tho Victorian butter manufacturers are unanimously in favour of the use of boric acif'i, and will lie particularly hard hit. The whole industry will have to face a most critical periorl on account of the British Govern meat's action."" The President of the Association, Mr L. YV. Lucas, said that on the whole non-boric butter entered for the Association's competitions was a failure. A serious crisis faces au industry which is, even today, struggling for its existence. No other industry has been so hard hit by economic conditions, and I should like from the Government a definite and positive assurance tha* it has taken fundamental action, and will be able to make an announcement shortly as to whether butter can be satisfactorily exported without the use of preservatives. The Government must have realized the seriousness of the position, because it approached the British Government and obtained a postponement of the date of operation of the regulation. In a country so wide, and with a climate so varied as ours, the problems associated with the production and marketing of butter are extremely difficult of solution. may be certain localities where, on account of climate, soil, or herbage, butter can be made without preservatives and shipped successfully; but in a hot climate the butter business is surrounded with serious difficulties.

There The composition of the board is vital from the point of view of the Tasmanian producers, and they contend that they will not be fairly treated if they have only two representatives on it , for they export twice as many apples and pears as the producers in the other States. The board will have power to make regulations and, generally, to control the marketing of our f r u it overseas. Tasmanian apple-growers would not agree to the appointment to the board of men like the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) or Mr Smith, M . L . C , of Victoria, who appear to have a set against Australian f r u it . The following sentence appears in the last report of our High Commissioner in London: Tasmanian apples were clean and well packed, but the apples packed in these cases were of a very common type. I have yet to learn what is a "" common type "" of apple. Possibly the officers who advised the High Commissioner consider that the Codlin, Ribstone, Hollow Crown, Prince Alfred , and Alfriston are common apples. If so, I disagree with them. The High Commissioner's report also stated that thesie common apples were produced probablv from old trees. That shows how little the writer of the report knew about fruit-growing. trees grow f r u it which has better keeping qualities than the f r u it grown on new trees.",41

When I was recently in Tasmania I was told by many growers, who were keenly interested in the matter, that while they would prefer to have three Tasmanians on the board they regarded that, after all, as a matter of minor importance, and were prepared to accept two. At the outset of the board's operations there might be Old a slight doubt as to the attitude of the representatives of the various States; but soon the board would function very much as the board of directors of a company. During the last two years, the Dried Eruits Export Control Board has had. many discussions, and it has always come to unanimous decisions, although it is composed of four growers, and three commercial men, representing different States.

When the measure was brought forward before I was attending an important fixture in my electorate. The fruit-growers in the various States are not unanimously im favour of the Government's proposal, and I think that the Minister should be content with the boards of control that already exist. The Government has constructed machinery for a form of control that it may some day wish to abolish. Boards have been appointed to deal with the export of butter and dried fruits', and in New Zealand even meat export is controlled in that way. We had the sorry spectacle a week ago of the British butter market being thrown into a state of chaos through lack of judgment on the part of a board in New Zealand. Surely it will soon be realized that in a country like Australia we cannot control the world's markets by the formation of boards. While New Zealand was holding its butter the Danes were taking the best of the trade. Mr. SEABROOK - I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Wannon has been permitted to discuss the butter trade, while I was prevented from talking about apples.",42
148,The CHAIRMAN,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"The honourable member for Wannon was endeavouring to give reasons for his tion to the appointment of the board.

149,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,I have no objection to Tasmania conducting its own apple business; but I object to a control board.,43
150,Mr FENTON,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,Eve n when the growers ask for it?,43
151,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"The orchardists of Australia do not ask for it . Tasmania produces more apples than the other States, but the quality of the f r u it is not superior to that grown on the mainhind of Australia. I notice that the bill provides for a representative of Western Australia. No better apples are obtainable than those grown in that State, except, perhaps, those of Victoria.",43
152,Mr ATKINSON,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Wilmot) [ 3 . 2 7 ] support the amendment. More than half the apples exported from Australia are grown in Tasmania, and that State produces far more varieties than any other part of the Commonwealth. Experts have stated that Tasmania produces the best specimens of eating apples grown in the Commonwealth. I am in accord with that opinion ; but, after all, the most important consideration is the favourable judgment of the public of Great Britain . The Minister referred to the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, and suggested that the experience of that body showed that State differences were sunk. I point out that dried f r u it s are produced on the mainland, and the interests of the growers various mainland States are identical. But Tasmania grows different varieties of apples from those produced on the mainland, and if the other States, through their representatives on the board, placed an embargo on a number of varieties grown in Tasmania, that State would be injured in its export trade.",43
153,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Wannon) [3.32] - On further examination of the clause, I see that there are to be two represen tatives of Tasmania, one for Victoria, one for New South Wales and Queensland, and one each for .South Australia and Western Australia. An unequal representation of the States is provided for. The amendment of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) would give opposiTasmania three representatives and New South Wales and Queensland half a representative each. That is a glaring inequality of representation. I have examined the bill to see what provision s made for the election of representatives; but I do not see any. Are there to be nominations by the growers and a poll? ",43
154,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,Is every f r u it grower to be entitled to vote independently ?  ported this year or last season 100 cases of f r u it .,43
155,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,Who is to nominate the representatives ? ,43
156,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Will it , then, be - I competent for any fruit-grower to nominate himself? Is no special consideration to be given to organizations of f r u it growers? I see nothing in this clause to warrant me in supporting it. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 to 8 agreed to. Clause 9 (Fees and expenses).",43
157,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,Wannon) [3.35] Can the Minister give the committee some idea of the fees which are to be paid to the members of the board?  fees. I am not going to suggest to the board what it should do.,43
158,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Then we are asked in the to pass a bill without knowing what it wil l cost the taxpayers.  f r u it s will pay, and not the general taxpayers. Clause agreed to. Clauses 10 and 11 agreed to. Clause 12 (London agency of board).",43
159,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"""Wannon) [3.39] - It is customary in these bills providing for the control of the sale of primary produce to have provisions for the appointment of London agencies. I should like to have from the Minister a general statement of the experience he has had of the work of the London agencies of other boards which have been created. Howare we to know that the practice of appointing London agencies is working satisfactorily? A London agency takes Australian products out of the open market to sell them in a particular way, and we are entitled to know what has been the effect of this practice, and how the system of appointing London agencies of these boards has worked. Clause agreed to. Clause 13 agreed to. Clause 14(1.) For the purpose of enabling the board effectively to control the export and the sale and distribution after export of Australian fresh fruits, the Governor General may by proclamation prohibit the export from the Commonwealth of any fresh fruits except in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister subject to such condition's ancl restrictions as are prescribed after recommendation to the Minister by tilie board. (2.) This section shall not apply to the export of fresh fruits to any port 'between the Ninetieth ancl One hundred and eightieth degrees of Kast Longitude and North of the Thirtieth parallel of South Latitude.",44
160,Mr SEABROOK,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Eranklin) [3.42] In my opinion the passing of this clause will jeopardize the whole apple and pear industry. I m o v e That the following words be added to subclause 1- "" Provided that such licence shall not be required in the case of a bona fide purchaser in Australia for export abroad."" Buyers came from Great Britain to Australia and spend, a great deal of money here in the purchase of f r u it . This practice has been of great assistance to the industry, but this clause, if agreed to, will put an end to it . Conning from Tasmania, I may claim, to represent those in terested in 75 per cent, of the f r u it sent overseas. I have had meetings of growers in my own district, which were attended by the Minister for Markets and Migration when he was in Tasmania. He told the growers that the board would have power to divert a shipment of apples consigned to one port in Great Britain to any other port. ",44
161,Mr SEABROOK,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Firm s in London desire to be able to handle for themselves the f r u it which their buyers have purchased in Australia. If the board is given power to divert shipments of f r u it from, the ports to which they are consigned, many firms will not buy f r u it again in Australia. What would be the position of the wool growers today if. buyers did not come to Australia to buy wool ? The clause gives the board altogether too much power. The growers are to have the right to vote for representatives on the board, and I intend to go through my electorate and inform the growers that the bill is not what it was represented to them to be when the Minister for Markets and M i gration was in Hobart. I directed attention to this clause at meetings at which the Minister was present, and said that it would interfere with buyers sent from England to purchase f r u it in Australia. The Minister assured the meetings that it would not have that effect. I have since had a good deal of advice, and it seems that the board, under tihis bill, will have complete control of all the fruit s exported from Australia.",44
162,Mr HUGHES,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,Does the bill limit the Minister's responsibility for the action of the board 1,44
163,Mr SEABROOK,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,The London agencv of the board will have all power to deal with f r u it exported to England.,44
164,Mr HUGHES,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,Then we cannot review its action here?,44
165,Mr SEABROOK,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"That is so. The clause is a very arbitrary one. The object of my amendment is to protect the operations of buyers of f r u it in Australia for oversea firms, and to ensure that the firms to whom Australian f r u it is consigned will have control of it when it is landed in England.",44
166,Mr DUNCAN,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"HUGHES (Boothby) [3.45] - I have already indicated that I am opposed to the bill in its entirety. This clause, and clauses 19 and 20, are the vital features of the measure, and I propose to say a few words in support of the amendment. When speaking on the second reading, I quoted from the leading f r u it newspaper in support of my argument that this industry is not analogous to other industries which are already under control. That journal made it very clear that a system which may be good for one industry is not necessarilygood for another, and I expressed doubt whether the measure of success which has attended the control boards alreadv in operation has been sufficient to justify the extension of the principle to almost every form of primary produce. There are already three control boards in existence,' and the same principle is operated by the Meat Council. No claim to success has been made on behalf of the Meat Council, which, I understand, has gone into recess but has hopes of being reconstituted.  tween the Meat Council and the board proposed in this bill.",44
167,Mr DUNCAN,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"HUGHES - The analogy consists in the fact that both bodies are for the purpose of controlling export. I am opposed to the principle of prohibiting any producer from exporting his f r u it . The Government already has power to see that only sound f r u it of high quality is sent abroad, and iJiree years ago I joined the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) in protesting against the granting of a licence to 6xport bad fruit, from Tasmania. 'As we predicted then, detriment to the whole f r u it trade of Australia was caused by that and later shipments, and I object to a Government which has not exercised to the ful l the authority it already possesses, being given radical powers to regulate the export of apples and pears, regardless of the State of origin. I am prepared to go to a division on this clause in order to record my disapproval oF the whole principle embodied m the bill. According to sub-clause 2, no licence will be required for the export of f r u it to Asia. Why is a distinction made between Europe and Asia? Are we to assume that Asia will take anything we choose, to ship, and that bad f r u it sent there would not be as detrimental to Australian trade as would bad f r u it sent to Europe ?",45
168,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,That is a most unusual provision.,45
169,Mr DUNCAN,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"HUGHES - It does not seem either logical or consistent. The main purpose of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin is to retain the f.o.b. buyer. A great deal of the export trade-in some States 50 per cent, of it-is done through the f.o.b. buyer, who will not come into the Australian market to operate under the restrictions that are proposed in this bill. The position of the f.o.b. buyer of f r u it is different from that of the f.o.b. buyer of other primary products, and I suggest that the committee should bear that fact in mind. The bill provides that the buyer must first apply for a licence to export, which the board may or may not grant. Having been granted a licence, any contract for the shipment of the. f r u it abroad must be made by the board or in conformity with conditions approved by the board. If other control boards had been demonstrably successful, it would not necessarily be wise to extend the same system of control to fresh f r u it , but in any case the committee should not apply to the apple and pear industry, which is in need of all the assistance that can be given, a form of control which may make its position worse than it is at present.  ter for Markets and Migration) [3.53] The honourable member for Franklin stated that the provisions of this bill are different from what I said they would be when I spoke in Hobart. I have never made any attempt to misrepresent the purpose of the measure, and I stand by every word I uttered in Tasmania. The best answer to the statement that f.o.b. sales will not continue if this bill is enacted is that f.o.b. sales do continue in the butter industry, despite the existence of a similar provision in the Dairy Produce Export Control Ac t passed by this House some years ago.",45
170,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"But butter is different from f r u it .  tions of the two industries are analogous. The clause now before the committee is the vital part of the bill, and if the amendment were accepted we might as well throw the bill into the waste-paper basket, because it would be useless. The extent of the control to be exercised by the board under this and subsequent clauses would be set out in the conditions of the licence. The board would have no power to interfere with any business arrangements made by f.o.b. buyers, unless it included in the licence a. specific condition relating to such sales. It is inconceivable that members of the board, elected by the growers at a time when a huge majority are in favour of retaining the f.o.b. trade, would do something inimical to the growers' in terests, and break down a system in which they believe. The fact that the growers' representatives will operate the scheme is the best assurance that this clause will operate without detriment to the industry. 1 cannot accept the amendment.",45
171,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Wannon) [3.56] - This clause contaius a vital principle to which several honourable members object. Water this provision down as we may with control by a board and representation of growers, this is a provision to enable the prohibition of export. Complete power is to be given to a board not yet created, and the Minister says, "" Trust the board."" That is too clumsy a method of legislation. Some growers want this form of control. ",46
172,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,Ver y many do not.,46
173,Mr KILLEN,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,W as not the honourable member in favour of the same principle when embodied in the Higgins wool respecting scheme ?,46
174,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"I certainly was not. 1 was never in favour of giving to Sir Higgins and his board power to prohibit the export of Australian wool. I shall never compromise on the principle of freedom of export. The day may come when a Ministry not so sympathetic with the primary producer is in office, and, having established the principle of control, shall not be able to object if control exercised in the interests of the confundamental sumers. We are playing with Never since Australia has enjoyed selfof government has any Ministry sought to take from the people the right to export their produce to the markets of the world. The Minister has said that the real trol will lie with the board. For how the long can he guarantee the existence of board that he may help to create? Will succeeding governments be bound by provisions of this bill ? Cannot another form of control be substituted ?  selves can put an end to the board if so desire.",46
175,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"This bill establishes the principle of control, and a future government may take the authority from the growers, and constitute the Trades Hall representatives.",46
176,Mr HUGHES,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"If we are to prohibit the export of apples, why not apply the same principle to everything else?",46
177,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Yes . We started with the control of butter, and then applied the principle to dried fruits. Is this the last of these bills, or is it the policy the Government to go on u n t i l we have hobbled the free export of the primary products of Australia? I make no apology for taking up the time of the committee. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Markets and Migration know my views. I cannot compromise on the question of shackling the export trade of this country. This Government may safeguard the producers' interests, but the day will come when a Government of a different political creed will use these control boards for its own purposes, and this Government is showing it the way. I ask the Minister not to persevere with the bill, because there is a great deal of opposition to it in the country. I had the opportunity of examining the whole of the correspondence that took place in connection with the agitation last year the control of fresh fruits, and I was amaaed at the unanimous tone running through all the letters in opposiJohn tion to the proposal. Many growers have established their own overseas marketsspecial markets for special kinds of f r u it . They have established an export trade, and they have now to place their apples and pears in the hands of a board, the we members of which have not yet been is appointed. The Government is making a and vita l departure from the fire. principles that govern the export trade this nation. There is no pressing need for the bill, because the Australian apple crop is light, excepting in Tasmania. That State is sending apples to New conSouth Wales and Queensland, and today fresh f r u it market is excellent. I do a not propose to stop speaking so long as I l can protest against this bill. My obstructhe tion of its passage is justifiable.",46
178,Mr BRUCE,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,The honourable member is advantage of the fact that there they is little time at the Government's disposal.,46
179,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,The Prime Minister knows me well enough to understand that I shall not yield my point merely to conboard of venience the Government.,46
180,Mr SCULLIN,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,Why did not the honourable member speak on the second reading?,46
181,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"I was absent at the time. When I left, the second reading was not even on the notice-paper.",46
182,Mr BRUCE,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,The honourable member of must know that the Government could have_ passed this bill three days ago.,46
183,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"I cannot yield in my opposition to the principle of the bill. I believe that I am voicing the opinion of an overwhelming majority of the growers. Organization is necessary to the f r u it industry, but in no part of the machinery of the F r u it Oouncil will there be found Government or semi-Government control. The growers of all the States joined this great voluntary movement. The Customs Department, in an endeavour to up lift the industry, altered the regulations governing the grading of f r u it ; but there were at that time few inspectors in Australia capable of grading or examining f r u it for export, and even today the number is not sufficient. The council appointed additional inspectors, and I have no doubt that the Minister has done so. The f r u it growers will rigidly insist on the carrying out of the grading and inspection regulations.",47
184,Mr BRUCE,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,The honourable member is using the forms of Parliament to obstruct the passage of this measure.,47
185,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"I am neither using nor abusing the forms of Parliament. If t am exceeding my time, the Chairman of Committees will notify me to that effect. I have endeavoured to confine my remarks to the bill. I strongly object to its principle, and I believe that I am voicing the opinion of the majority of the growers. Mr G. FRANCIS - Then them have a voice under-this measure?",47
186,Mr RODGERS,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"Why should we ask this them to accept this legislation ? The passed growers know their business. This Pardate liament should keep as far away as r,osforce. sible from the trade and commerce of Australia. Through the Customs we have great power.",47
187,Mr BRUCE,FRESHFRUITS OVERSEAS,"May I make a last appeal to the honourable member. He knows that it is impossible for Parliament to sit tomorrow to continue this debate, and I going resolution. ask him to allow the committee to vote on this clause.",47

The joint Presidents of the Executive Committee of the Commonwealth Branch of tha Empire Parliamentary Association (Senator the Hon. John CBE. (President of the Senate), and the Hon. Sir Littleton Groom, KCMG., KC. (Speaker of the House of Representatives) presided. The gathering included members of the Overseas Delegations, members of the Gommonwealth of Australia Branch, the Federal Capilal Commission, and representatives of official and civic activities within the Federal Capital Territory. The Hon. Sir LITTLETON GROOM, opening the proceedings, said:My Lord, Members of the Visiting Delegations, ladies and gentlemen - On behalf of the members of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, we extend to you a very hearty welcome to our Federal City, and particularly to what is to be our future home. This is not the first occasion upon which a delegation from Ihe United Kingdom Branch has visited us, but we are honoured in this instance by the company of members of, not only the parent branch, but also branches throughout the whole of His Majesty's Dominions. We have met to witness a most interesting ceremony, and it is my privilege to perform the conventional duty of introducing the speakers who will participate in it. I have much pleasure in inviting the Rt. Hon. the Marquess of Salisbury CHAIR. to address you. He bears a name that is honoured in the annals of the British Empire, and we may ti-uthfully say that he has added lustre to it. The MARQUESS OF SALISBURY (Chairman of the Overseas Delegates) In responding, with no small amount of diffidence to. the invitation which you, Mr. Speaker, have so kindly extended to me, I think it fitting that, as a humble colleague of the Prime Minister of Great AT Britain, I should, at the outset, read a CAN- letter which he has addressed to me in regard to the present ceremony. He PRE- writes:"" On the occasion of the presenOF tation of the Speaker s Chair, and THE the Parliamentary Conference at Canberra, I would like you to convey to our colleagues in the Parliament of the Australian Commonwealth, and to the representatives of all other Parliaments of the Empire gathered together for the first meeting held in the new Federal Parliament House, Newlands, the best wishes of myself and my Government. I feel that this first meeting in the new IIousc is of a historic character, not only on account of the presentation of tha Chair, which will, I hope, be a symbol for all time of the goodwill of Members in the Parliament of Westminster for Members in the Parliament of the Australian Commonwealth, but because of the valuable interchange of views which should result from the informal discussions amongst members of all parties in all Parliaments. With every good wish, I remain, yours sincerely, (Sad.) .STANLEY BALDWIN."" For the moment I divest myself of the high honour of the chairmanship of the Empire Parliamentary Delegation which has been conferred upon me, and on behalf of the United Kingdom Branch of the Association offer to you, as representing the Parliament of the wealth of Australia, the Chair. In doing so, I feel my position, is somewhat singular. - is a Chair for the House of Representatives; but I am not a Representative. am a member of the Upper House, which sits in., shall I say, not a representative capacity, in the Old Land, and I am called upon to stand here on behalf of my co-delegates from the British of Commons, any one of whom would be better fitted than I to make this presentation. I can only plead, Sir, on my ownbehalf, that I have been in for no less than If i years, and that seventeen of those years were spent in the House of Commons itself. cumstances, therefore, my colleagues of the House of Commons will, forgive me. This is, indeed, a most notable occasionThis gift, to a modem Parliament, senting a community which has a great future, is from the House of Commons and the House of Lords, whose roots stretch back into the far distant Even the material of which the chair is composed speaks of some of the greatest moments of British History. will remind you of a glorious period in British history when a great hero of the sea added lustre to British you will be reminded by it also of an old building, representing in the highest degree the triumph of British art, which stands in the historic setting of Westminster, and has been the scene of many mighty events in our annals. chair, in its material, and in its signicance as a gift to the Parliament Commonwealth, is a personification our institutions in the Old Country, I may be allowed to say a word or two upon that subject. We are told that democracy is on its trial, and that representative institutions are no longer fitted for the age in tuhich we live. Mr Speaker, it is possible that representative tions as we know them Empire today, do not suit countries. After all they British conception. They accurate representation of the conception of government, and they fit us, and, may I say, our children, as the skin fits a human being. 'They have Common- grown with our growth; they have adapSpeaker's ted themselves to our successive exthat periences. They are English of the This English, British of the British, and I am never surprised when I hear that I foreigners cannot manage them. Indeed, they are a splendid example of the genius of our race-a living organism, changing, of course, but changing within certain limits which maintain their great tradiHouse tions. Much of the practice which governs them is unwritten. As every member of Parliament here, to whatever* branch of the legislature ha Parliament belongs, will recognize, it is not only the Standing Orders which govern us, but a great traditional practice. The whole is In the cir- subject to the influence and government of what is called the feeling of the House, perhaps, which is supreme, and, in its very essence, depends upon public opinion. It represents public opinion. Il is the embodiment of the opinion of the electors, and repre- the public opinion of the elected, 'and the principles for which it stands can be properly applied only in a spirit of loyalty to the institutions to which we belong, past. and of consideration for the minority. That' is the very essence of our Parliamentary institutions. Every Minister It in office remembers that some day he must be in Opposition, and every Leader in Opposition hopes that some day he arms, and will be in office. The consideration which those reflections import is responsible for the high courtesy which characterizes the proceedings in our Houses of Parliament. Everything in England-everything in Britain-everything in our great Since this self-governing dominions depends upon the majority and the influence of public of the opinion. Ministers are in office to repreof sent, not their own views, but those of their supporters, and the growing practice of which I have spoken, adapting itself to the needs, of ihe moment, is of intense value to a great community. It is not well to be too precise. There are always reserve powers in our Constitution which can be used when institupublic opinion demands them. I have in the tried to sketch, in a few words, what this other living organism-this all-powerful Parare a liament-is. I know it is governed someare an times by party spirit. Of that I am not British ashamed; I myself have always been a party man. But ranged alongside that party spirit there must be, if the institution is to succeed, a sense of deep responsibility, a determination to make the institution work, and a high regard for what the interests of Parliament and the country demand. If we work in that spirit, then the symbol, which in a moment I shall unveil before you, will stand for, all time as the embodiment of the ordered Government of a great people, and as an example to the rest of the world of what ijie political traditions and ad* ministrative genius of the British people can accomplish. I have here, Mr Speaker, a roll upon which are recorded the names of those luho have joined in making the present which I am about to unveil, and I hope it will be accepted by you, Sir, on behalf of the Parliament, as a record. I have only, in conclusion, to express my humble thanks for the kindly attention with which you have listened to me, and our profound appreciation of the welcomethe "" brotherly"" welcome, if I may use the phrase-which you have afforded us. I can assure you that, to the last days of our lives, we shall recollect with gratitude the kindness of the people and Parliament of Australia. The Marquess of Salisbury having unveiled the Chair, the Speaker of the House of Representatives (the Hon. Sir L ITTLET ON GROOM) then delivered the following address:My Lord and Members of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association - The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia accepts most gratefully and with pride the magnificent aift which you have presented. It will long be treasured by the people of Australia as one of their' most sacred historic possessions. It stands here as a connecting link between the great mother of Parliaments and the free Parliament of the great Commonwealth of Australia, as emblematic of Parliamentary Government, and of our Parliamentary institutions. If there is one gift for which civilizaton has to be thankful to our nation, it is the gift of a model of a free Parliamentary institution. The mother of Parliaments has presented that gift to all the great Dominions across the seas, and we here recognize that, in our legislature, we have a free people exercising its sovereign power through a well-known institution for the purpose of securing freedom, liberty, and justice amongst the citizens of the. Commonwealth. To-day, in your presence, we desire to express our grateful recognition of this great inheritance. 'This Chair also stands for the authority of Parliament, for its honour and for its dignity. Be assured that this presentation will inspire us all as members with the desire to worthily maintain the traditions of that great Parliament across the seas. We do not forget that in a Chair like this, for a long period of time, a line of illustrious men has presided over the destinies of the House of Compnons. They have preserved its sacred privileges, and secured freedom of speech and liberty to all its component members. 'Their precedents arc accepted as rulings, binding all throunh the British Empire, wherever Parliamentary institutions exist, and by preserving these precedents and, following them, we have been able to secure that full-matured deliberation of measures combined with freedom of discussion that is absolutely essential for the making of sound laws and the maintenance of a great nation. We are grateful to that line of speakers for their fine traditions, and this Chair will ever be a reminder to us for their grand work. It speaks also, from the historic associations connected, with it, of the great statesmen who have spoken and offered their views before such a chair in the mother of Parliaments. We in this land are ever grateful to those statesmen, great men of the past, who by their wisdom, judgment, and foresight have rendered it possible to build up the Empire on the stable foundations of self governing communities. We are not forgetful of our historic past. We know, as far as we are concerned in Australia, that the history of our people does not begin from the date of the occupation of this continent by the British. For the proper understanding of our very existence, and what rights and privileges we possess, we have to go back to that island across the seas. We study these rights and privileges and take pride in them, deriving inspiration from them for the building up of the Greater Britain across the seas. We gratefully acknowledge to you our indebtedness to our Motherland. When we gaze upon this Chair we shall be ever mindful of those traditions, and will be careful that Australia will derive from this Chair in this building fresh inspirations to enable us to follow in the steps of your great land. Not only with admiration shall we look upon this Chair, but with deep-rooted affection and goodwill. This is a unique ceremony. We are about to commence the enactment of national legislation in our own home here in Canberra, where, we hope, free from the dominating influence of any State to express the will of the Australian people, so that our laws may reflect the matured judgment of the whole of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia. are a new country facing new conditions, necessarily taking a new outlook upon things. We are adapting old principles to new conditions. Our eyes are still turned towards the seas regarding the history of our own race, hoping that, by the guidance of the wisdom and experience of statesmen of the past, we, too, may temper our actions in the future so that we may develop a greater nation here in the Commonwealth of Australia. rejoice that this is an occasion when all parts of His Majesty's Dominions are here to express their goodwill to us. We all are here in the spirit of unity. By the personal touch.we have been privileged to enjoy the grip of the hand of true feUowship. May we henceforth cherish the vision of that brotherhood, of the great commonwealth of nations, realizing our ideal, so that it may be an organization for the maintenance of the peace of the world, and the promotion of the material and spiritual welfare of all peoples. We thank you for this gift. It will be dear to us because it is from the hands of you whom we know to be members of each of the parties of the House of Commons, who have sent us some of their most capable representatives. We feel honoured by your visit, and I hope, Sir, when you return, vou will tell your colleagues in both Houses how truly grateful we are for this magnificent and historic gift, and that you will also convey to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom our apvreciation of the kind wishes conveyed in his most welcome letter. The Hon. EARLE PAGE Prime Minister) - On behalf people, the Parliament and the Government of Australia, I tender to the Members of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary. Association our thanks for the gift of this Speaker's Chair, ivhich is to grace the National Parliament in its own permanent home here in Canberra. We are deeply sensible of the honour which has been done us by the visit of the leader of the Delegation which is presenting this chair-a man who not only has rendered notable service to the Empire, but comes of a family whose distinguished services have been valuable to the nation for hundreds of years. The people of Australia very deeply appreciate this practical expresWe sion of interest, on the part of the British Parliament, in the establishment of the Federal Capital of Australia. Next year we are to have a further demonstration of that interest in this venture of ours when their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York will come to Australia to open the first sitting of the Parliament, in this its permanent home, just as 26 years before His Most Gracious Majesty the King opened the first session We of the Federal Parliament which was then housed in its temporary quarters in Melbourne. We feel that the establishment of this national capital will do much to promote an all-Australian sentiment. It will teach us to think more and more of Australia as a united whole, and also to foster a more intense Australian patriotism. We deeply appreciate this gift to the Australian Parliament from the mother of Parliaments-a gift to the future, as well as the present legislators of Australia. The Chair will be a fitting and abiding reminder of the loving bond of unity between - the British people and this Parliament, and, in fact, the Parliaments throughout the whole of the British 4 Empire. There is no doubt that the sentiment which binds the Empire is founSded largely on the kinship of blood, b'ut, to a very large extent, it is due also to the Parliamentary institutions throughout the Empire. These institutions, which sprang from the British people, whose emblem is really in the Chair you have presented to us, stand for the security of the people in all those (Acting matters that affect the liberty, freedom, of the and welfare of the nation. The material of which the Chair is constructed, quite apart from its beautiful workmanship, makes it of special interest to us. Part of its wood, we understand, has been drawn from Westminster, from the mother of Parliaments itself. It will be to us always a reminder of the wisdom of the statesmen of that great Parliament, and the eloquence of its orators. It will bring vividly to our recollection the illustrious Speakers who have presided over the House of Commons, and have there shown, as the nobie Marquess has said, how well Parliamentary institutions work in Englisli-speaking countries. Another part of the material of the Chair comes, we understand, from HMS. "" Victory,"" Lord Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar. Its wood is of special interest to us. The sight of British oak, drawn from that source, will not only remind us always of the steadfast character of the British people, in prosperity or adversity, bub also of the national victory of Trafalgar, as the outcome of which' the Empire has had undisputed supremacy of the seas for the last century and a quarter. That was really the factor which permitted the sound and safe development of the various colonies established by Britain throughout the world, permitted the growth of our nationhood, and made possible the formation of the great British commonwealth of nations, which is now becoming a most potent factor in the prosperity and progress of the world. We feel that a Chair, drawn from such sources, will afford inspiration to our statesmen, and assist us to build up gradually a tradition which will be not umuorthy of those with which the mother of Parliaments endowed us at the beginning of our national existence. I have much pleasure, Mr Speaker, m moving a very hearty vote of thanks to the United Kingdom Branch of ihe Empire Parliamentary Association for this_ gift to the Australian Parliament and to the Australian people.",47
190,Mr CHARLTON,THE EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY," I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion which has just been moved by the Hon. the Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page). It is true, as Mr Speaker said, that this is a unique occasion. It is unique not only because this is the first ceremony that has taken place in the new home of the Commonwealth Parliament, but also because we have gathered here in the Federal Territory more representatives of the Empire Parliaments than have ever before met in conference. I am very pleased thai we have the delegates with us, and thai they have been able personally to present to the Australian Parliament this beautiful Chair, which you, Sir, at present adorn. While listening to those who have preceded me it occurred to me that the description of the British Parliament, as the mother of Parliaments, is most apt. So far as our own Parliament is concerned, every time a difference of opinion arises on a question of procedure, it is debated upon both sides of the House, and then you, Mr Speaker, promptly quote May to us, and rule accordingly. That is the beginning and the end of the matter. The relationship of the several portions of the Empire may be likened to that of the members of a family with each other and with their mother. When a member of a family is about to set up a home for himself or herself, the mother will present him or her with some token of affection and goodwill. 'That gift, whatever it may be, is always regarded by the recipient as the most valuable in his or her home. Members of the Federal Parliament, and may I go further and say the people of Australia, will realise that this Chair, the gift of our Mother across the sea, indicates that, although thousands of miles separate us, she does not forget us in Australia. Nothing could have been presented to this Parliament which would better convey to us the goodwill of the members of the British Parliament. The gift of this replica of the Speaker's Chair in the House of Commons, by Members of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, will evoke the admiration of every Australian citizen. I hope that when the delegates return to their homes, after what we all trust will be a pleasant sojourn here, they will take with them a wider understanding of our problems in Australia, and that Ihe free and frank exchange of views will be followed by a solution of some of the difficulties that confront us. I would ash them also to carry bach to their colleagues, in the House of Commons, the appreciation and sincere thanhs of every Member of the Australian Parliament, and of the citizens of Australia for their magnificent gift.",52
191,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,THE EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY,"I going to ask those present to break away from Parliamentary tradition and to carry the motion in an extra-Parliamentary way. An additional advantage will accrue from that procedure in thai it will enable Australian citizens, who are not Members of Parliament, and who are with us today, to join in the adoption of the motion. The motion was carried by acclamation. The rendering of the National Anthem concluded the jn-oceedings. NA MEMORIAL BILL . Message recommending appropriation reported.

192,Mr BRUCE,VICTORIAN PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Elinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.20] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. In making this motion I desire to voice the appreciation of this Parliament, and, I believe, of the people of Australia, of the courtesy of the Government, the Parliament, and the people of Victoria, for having made this building available to the Commonwealth Parliament since the [42] commencement of federation. We shall have an opportunity, on another occasion, to acknowledge our obligation more fully, it being proposed to invite the members of the Parliament of Victoria to a banquet in this historic building before we am finally leave it for our new home at Canberra. But as we are now terminating our last meeting in Melbourne, the Government feels that, as good tenants, we should not only leave this building in good order, but should also do something to provide a memorial in it of the fact that, for the first 26 years of federation, the Commonwealth Parliament sat in these halls. The bill of which I have moved the second reading provides for an appropriation of £50,000 to meet the cost of such a memorial. Every member will, I think, agree to this proposal. This Parliament first met here when no man knew what would be the result of the experiment in government that was then being entered upon. To-day the people of Australia realise the great benefits of federation. Those who were the peoples of a number of separate colonies have been welded together into one great nation, which passed through the crucible of war and has proved itself worthy to enjoy the great destiny which we hope awaits it. The statutes which embody the great Australian ideals of today were initiated in this chamber, and came into existence during the years in which this Parliament has sat here. The briefest survey will show how much that period of political history means. The White Australia policy, which aims at the purity of our race and the preservation of the highest standards of social and economic and life, was first enunciated here, and was here carried into effect. Within these halls we have seen the fashioning of all the legislation on which today we pride ourselves; here we have established au Australian Navy, and an Australian system of defence. During the past quarter of a century Australia, from being almost a dependency of the British Crown, has become one of the great self-governing peoples which constitute the commonwealth of British nations. It is desirable, therefore, that there should be a permanent memorial of the period during which the Federal Parliament has sat here, to preserve the memory of this building's association with many historic events in the building of the Australian nation. We hope that the memory of the men who, is this place, began the work of federation and have now passed away, may be an inspiration to succeeding generations of legislators, both in the Eederal Parliament and those who will sit on these benches when this building reverts to the State.",53
193,Mr SCULLIN,VICTORIAN PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Y a r r a ) [4.25] - On behalf of the Opposition, I support the proposal to provide for a permanent memorial to mark our gratitude State of Victoria for having allowed us to occupy this building for the past 26 years.

We are meeting mittee. for the last time in this building, which has housed the Federal Parliament from the beginning. . The occasion can but be regarded with sadness, because, although, as members, we are not parting from each other, we are leaving forever a place which has become dear to us, so fondly momlber does memory cling even to inanimate Gregory, resigned. things which have been long familiar.

194,Mr MARR,VICTORIAN PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Parkes-Minister for - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This is a short bill - to amend section 124 of the Defence Act 1903-1918. The section deals with the particular matters which may be prescribed by regulations under the act. At present there is no power to control the erection of buildings with in certain areas near forts, nor is there power to prohibit the smoke nuisance from factories in the vicinity of forts during or immediately before It is most advisable that these matters should be subject to regulation.

195,Dr EARLE PAGE,SCIENCE AND INDUSTR Y,"Cowper-Trea surer) [ 4 . 3 2 ] - I move That in accordance with sub-section 3 of section 17B of the Science and Industry Besearch Act 1920-26, the undermentioned additional estimates of expenditure of the Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the year ending 30th June, 1927, be approved and passed :No. 1-Stoc k diseases and pests investigations (including cattletick dips and buffalo-fly) ... £1,750 No. 4-Horticultura l investigations (including citricultural and viticultural ... ... No. 5-Foo d preservation and cold storage investigations No. 14-Stat e committees, sundry investigations and miscellaneous expenditure ... ... Total investigations Section 17A of the Science and Industry Research Act appropriated for investigations an amount of £250,000, which was paid to a trust account termed the Science and Industry Investigation Trust Account, from which expenditure is made in connection with the various researches. Sub-section 3 of section 17B of the act provides that no money shall be expended from the trust account except in accordance with estimates of expenditure which have been passed by both Houses of the Parliament. Estimates already passed this financial year made provision for expenditure from the trust account amounting to £35,300 on investigations, but that provision has proved insufficient. The amounts already appropriated under these specific items are-No . 1, £5,400; No. 4, £4,000; No . 5, £1,500; No . 6, £600. From the nature of the work which the council is called upon to perform , it is impossible to foresee all the problems which may arise during the financial year, and the present motion is to grant authority for further expenditure on unexpected and urgent in vestigations. In particular no funds are available for the work of the State committees, the appointment of which is authorized under section 12A of the act. This motion does not seek to authorize the appropriation of further moneys from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, it merely authorizes the expenditure of certain funds which have already been set aside in the trust account. Under these circumstances it is unnecessary to introduce an additional appropriation bill, and the consent of the House to this expenditure is therefore being sought by means of the present motion.

We all, I am sure, are saddened by the knowledge that when we leave this Chamhere ber today we shall never again assemble here as the members of a Federal legisances, lature. By long association we have beregret. come attached to this building, which are about to hand back to the people Victoria, to be re-occupied by the Parliafirst ment of that State. When the Commonpolitical wealth Parliament first met in Melbourne association with them. in 1901 the opening speech on the Addresseducation in-Reply in this Chamber was delivered by the. late Mr W .

Sir Littleton Groom's father little realized that his own son. would be the occupant the Speaker's chair when the House of Representatives assembled in this chamber for the last time. It is an interesting incidence and a strange linking of two generations of a family that the first speech in this chamber was made by father, Mr Speaker, and that it will to you to utter the last words that will spoken here by a member of the Comtora; monwealth Parliament.",56
199,Mr WATKI NS,SCIENCE AND INDUSTR Y,"Newcastle) [5.24] As one of the two members of the Commonwealth Parliament which asmoments sembled here just upon 26 years ago, who have sat in all succeeding Parliaments and known the members of all the M i nistries that have governed Australia since inception of federation, I have been requested to offer a few remarks. In the earlier days of the Commonwealth, the and political fights were keener than they now are, and it is then that was laid the ground-work for the legislation that has been passed in more recent years. Although representing a constituency in another State, and having my home nearer Canberra than it is to Melbourne, I nevertheless say good-bye to this city - with a feeling of regret. In the past quarter of a century much of my time has perforce been spent in the capital of Victoria, but during my long sojourning I have formed many close friendships, and have made many acquaintfrom whom I part with the deepest And as it is with me, so I am we sure it is with all of us who come from of the other States. The members of the Commonwealth Parliament were giants, and I greatly prize my It provided an which I could not over-value, and whose lessons I shall, never forget. In those years this' Chamber was, as I said, the arena of strenuous political conflict, but it is pleasing to recall that as now, the tone of debate has been that maintained at a high level becoming a parliament. H a rd thrusts have been given and taken in the course of our discussions and disputes; but this honourable members, whatever their party high connexions, have forgotten their differI trust ences immediately they have passed standthrough the doors of the chamber, and, who though political opponents, have always personal friends. Our best thanks are due to the people of Victoria, to whom we are indebted through all these of years for the use of this magnificent building, and I hope that they will accept this expression of gratitude for their cogenerous hospitality and courtesy.",56
200,Mr BRENNAN,SCIENCE AND INDUSTR Y,"Batman) [5.26] - I your do not know that I have any special fall claim to address this Cliamber on the hisbe toric occasion of our last meeting in Vicbut as, in a certain sense-by the grace of the electors- a representative Australian, I take leave to say a few first words. I found myself alone a few ago in the room occupied by the members of my own party, and looking round the walls I saw portraits of members of that party past and present: those now with us and ex-colleagues and friends who have passed away in the service of their party and their country. that with more than a tinge of sorrow. Their day is done, and with a sense of gratitude to those who have gone before us, we leave the hall in which their names have been immortalized. Forgetting party differences, this occasion brings to memory the procession of great men who have rendered service to their country in this chamber. Although the circumstances of parliamentary life necessarily at times engender bitter thoughts expressed in bitter words, there is solace in the reflection that time enables us to estimate our fellows more justly in the retrospect than is possible in a closer view. Without being invidious, I think today of some of the great men of the past, some of whom all present knew in the flesh, and others of whom are known to us only by repute. In memory at least we can go back to days of Higinbotham, and down through the years to of Deakin and Barton, Higgins, and Isaacs, and without party rancour link them up with the representatives of my own party who here for the first time came into their own as spokesmen for the principles in which they believed and the ideals which they cherished. It is now, I think, over 30 years since, as a stripling, I was shown into the public gallery of this chamber. I came with bated breath, and looked down upon the legislators of that time. Standing at the table, and addressing members was the present honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), differing very little in appearance, and not at all in his adhesion to principles and the claims of humanity, from what he is today. We are reminded when we thus survey the past that, while life is a very transitory thing, the institutions with which those lives are intermingled are of a very permanent character. I sincerely hope that when the Victorian Parliament reassembles in this building it will keep alive the best traditions that were created by it when it met here before federation. I congratulate the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) - and those other honourable members whose association with this Parliament has been continuous throughout the period of Commonwealth endeavour. I hope their membership will long continue at what we might call another "" other place."" I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, I say upon the fact that, after a quarter of a century of parliamentary life, you are well in the flesh, and in the chair are upholding the honoured name which was referred to by the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson). I have no claim to speak in this chamber on this occasion other than that in my own small way, with manifold shortcomings, I have endeavoured to uphold those traditions to which I have referred. Politicians receive many hard knocks. No doubt, they enjoy compensating privileges, but I believe that very few people outside recognize how strenuous is parliamentary work, how great a toll it takes, and how great a d r a f t it is upon the vitality of the men who conscientiously do their duty. However, we can but do our best in our day and generation. Leaving this chamber with grateful recollections of those who have gone before us, the let our salutation be- "" Australia F e l i x ! "" come Long may she bear an honoured name, those wherever her councils may meet.",56
201,Dr MALONEY,SCIENCE AND INDUSTR Y,"Melbourne) [5.30] For the first time in my 38 years of parliamentary life passed within these walls, I have received a letter from the municipal council of Melbourne asking for my assistance. This is so unique in my experience that I propose to put the letter in Hansard, and will do my best, as requested, to fight against the combine that is unjustly controlling the amusements of the people throughout Australia. The letter I have received is as follows: Dear Sir, I am desired by the City Council to bring under your notice that a company has been formed in Australia whioh controls the selling and performing of practically all the saleable music which has been composed throughout the world during the past 50 years. This company has notified the council, and, I understand, other public bodies controlling halls, that licence fees must be paid in respect of such halls, otherwise the authorities controlling the halls will render themselves liable to prosecution for a breach of the Copyright Act if the performance of musical, literary, or dramatic works-the performing rights of whioh are held by the eompany-is allowed therein. It is considered by the council that the claims of the company in question are unreasonable; but, unfortunately, under the law at present existing, this eompany may have power to enforce most of its demands. The council considers that an act should be passed by the Federal Parliament to provide that the owner of a hall who hires or letB the same to any person shall not for the purposes of the Copyright Act 1912 be deemed to be permitting the use of the hall for his private profit unless in addition to the ordinary rental or charge he receives, or is entitled to receive, a consideration in money or otherwise by reason of the performance in the hall of any copyright work. I am, therefore, directed by the council to request you, as one of the city's parliamentary representatives, will endeavour to assist in securing the introduction of the desired legislation. When the proposal was made to vote £50,000 for the improvement of this building, I would, but for the occasion, have raised a protest against the Government leaving the splendid post office in Elizabeth-street unfinished. characterized the miserable attached to that fine building as at in can tied to the tail of a noble dog. I wish to endorse every remark of the speaker who so eloquently the references to the final meeting of the Parliament in this chamber, and those of my beloved friend, the honourable member for Newcastle, the only honourable member now present who was a member of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth. It is with feelings of regret that I speak on this subject. Thirty-eight years ago in this very month I came into this chamber, and picked out my seat directly to the Gillies and Deakin Ministry. was informed by the Clerk of the Parliament that only ex-Ministers were allowed to sit on that seat. I have lived to see that seat occupied by a galaxy of men, not one of whom had been an ex-Minister, and that was when the Labour party first formed the official Opposition, and occupied these benches. I have listened to the eloquence that fell from the lips of Judge Higinbotham, a Chief Justice who recognized the injustice done to the workers. When the so-called masters of that day would not meet the workers in conference, he felt the injustice so much that while the refusal continued he contributed a week to the funds for the support of the women and children of the strikers. For that humane act his name will be honouredby the workers for all time. remember how, as an entomologist a moth with a pin, he impaled with his power of debate the great Mr .Rogers, of the Colonial Office. Years later, I heard him deliver a speech full of eloquence, and feeling, in which acknowledged the resolution conveying to him the thanks of Parliament for his great work in consolidating and simplifying Dr Maloney. laws of Victoria. He also removed the words "" master and man "" replacing them with "" employer and employee."" I held in my arms the first Speaker of the Federal Parliament as he expired in the corner of this cham-' ber, and, within too short a time afterwards, stood in sorrow in the Queen's H all beside the lifeless form of a former Minister of the Crown (Mr Roberts), who had collapsed alongside the statue of Queen Victoria. Sir, I was not in this Parliament when your dear father was here; but memories of him have been told to me, by QueensI have land representatives especially, and I am annexe glad that you, whom I have known as always fair and just, and, above all, a most courteous man, are occupying a seat in the chamber to which he brought honour. introduced And 1 hope that when the time comes for you to vacate the Speaker's chair, you will be succeeded by another as worthy as yourself. Mr Charles MCDonald was the first Speaker in Australia to discard the traditional wig. As Speaker and as a man he was beloved by every member on either side, and I hope I may give no offence by confessing that many times I thought he was not just to me and my opposite party when he gave preference in his call I to members of the opposite party. But I know that he was animated always by a rigid sense of justice. I say of him and the other dear dead whom I have known and loved in this chamber, God rest them! I hope that when our turn comes to pass through the shadows, we shall be greeted on the other side by every one whom we have loved and lost in this life. Having represented the district in which I was born, either in the Victorian Parliament or the Federal Parliament, since March, 1889, I cannot but feel grief at leaving this building. But, being of a hopeful disposition, I believe I shall live to sec £10 on the statute-book of the Commonwealth Parliament the power of the electors expressed in the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. That is the only plank I that remains unfulfilled of the platform secures upon which I was elected in 1889. I have had a hard fight to get that principle accepted. It took a quarter of a century to induce the most powerful newspaper in dignity, Victoria, the Age, to adopt it , and I take he this opportunity to pay the tribute of a grateful heart to that journal for having done more than any other agency to imthe plant that great democratic principle in the mind of the Australian people. Second only to it , is Australia's greatest weekly newspaper, The Bulletin, which also has adopted the principle. The Australian Natives Association, the largest and most powerful friendly society in our continent, also has subscribed to it . Once to its eternal honour, the Nationalist party accepted the principle, but through some malign influence did not put it upon its platform. I wish I had the opportunity to physic the men who put that obstacle! in the path of a great reform. The eminent Gladstone and, later, Lord Salisbury, father of the nobleman who visited Australia recently, advocated the referendum. Nestling in the bosom of the Alps, Switzerland, the political genius of all nations, in whose parliament three languages are spoken, has the initiative, the referendum and recall in operation. W it h that love of freedom which is characteristic of all mountain peoples, the Swiss have embodied that triumph of democracy in their constitution. When people object that it cannot be adopted in Australia, because of our great distances, I have replied, "" The difficulty was much greater in the Federal Parliament of Switzerland, in which three languages are spoken, than in a country where the people from north to south and from east to west speak, write, and think in the same language."" If a line is drawn from north to south through the great TJnited States of America all the states on the left side of it , with one ception, have in operation in some form the initiative, referendum, and recall, and all but three of the eastern states can make the same proud boast. I wish that a splendid map of the TJnited States of America, published in the Age, could be shown in every school roam in Australia. My ears have drunk in the eloquence of Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of Australia. Those who care to refer to Hansard may read my eulogy of him at the time of his death. On that occasion I expressed my regret that when Sir Samuel Griffith, the first person in the history of the world to hold the position of Chief Justice of a continent, retired from the bench, the government of the day did not appoint Mr Justice Barton to the position, that he might thus fittingly complete one of the most illustrious careers in the history of Australia. Of the orators I have heard in this chamber, two stand out in my recollection, one was Willia m Shiels, whose speeches in Hansard will repay reading by any honourable member, and the other, and most eloquent of all, was Alfred Deakin. How often have I sat here and admired him. L if e is but a brief span; I hope that I may be spared to live a few more years, but whenever my call comes I trust that I may go as suddenly as did thp first Speaker of this chamber. Despite vhe heat and occasional bitterness of political strife, I have always given to every honourable member, regardless of the party to which he belonged, credit for honesty of purpose. Deep down in the heart of each of us is love of Australia and humanity, and each is trying with such capacity as the good God has given him, to make the world the better for his having lived.  though I am one of the comparatively new members of this chamber, I experience some of that reminiscent sentiment that must possess the older members to a more marked degree on the eve of leaving these legislative halls. When 38 years ago I first came to Melbourne, and saw James Patterson, George Turner, Alfred Deakin, and many of their contemporaries coming to this building, the most handsome in Australia, I scarcely realized what business they were about. As years passed one began to realise the importance of their work. When a person who has been entrusted with the ex- welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth, looks back upon the work of those men, he can appreciate what they did. We are leaving this place, and I feel certain regrets. I think, however, that we are going to our proper place. We owe a debt of appreciation to the people of Victoria for allowing us to be their guests for 26 years. I trust that when we transfer the Parliament to Canberra we shall there continue the labours that have for that long period been carried on here with benefit to the people of Australia and credit to those who conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth. We feel regret at leaving, a place that we have occupied for years, because we have felt the homeliness of the building even if the atmosphere of this chamber has not been so healthy as we should have liked. Nevertheless, our associations in this State have been all that could be desired, and we appreciate the hospitality that we have had in this great and handsome city of Melbourne.",57
202,Mr SCULLIN,SCIENCE AND INDUSTR Y,"Y a r r a ) [5.53] - Al though this is not the end of the session, it is really the end of the meetings in Melbourne of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and speaking on behalf of the Opposition, I wish, Mr Speaker, to express to you our appreciation of the way in which you have presided over our deliberations in this chamber since your election at the commencement of the present session. I do not think that any one will contradict me when I say that you have filled your position with credit, and have honourably carried on the traditions of your predecessors. You have been uniformly courteous and impartial, and no one could expect more consideration and help than you have shown to the members whose deliberations you control. The observance of the forms of the House, and the upholding of the dignity of this national parliament, require net only the services of a good Speaker, but also the co-operation of honourable members, and that co-operation is impossible when there is any sense of unfairness respecting the actions of the Speaker. We have confidence in you because of your impartiality, and even though occasionally we may not have thought your rulings to be correct, we have bowed to them without protest, knowing that you endeavour at all times to act with scrupulous fairness. I should like also to thank the clerk and officers of the House for the arduous work which they have done in our service. They have been unfailing in their attention to their duties, and because of that the wheels of parliament, have ru n smoothly. Of the Hansard staff, I would say that every member of it is a capable officer, and their reports have been done well, and more than well on many occasions. As for the other officials of tihe House, and the messengers, everything in their power has been done to make the tasks of members lighter. On behalf of this side of the House I thank them for their services. I trust that we shall meet you, Mr Speaker, the clerks at the table, the members of the Hansard staff, and the other officials, messengers, and attendants of this House at Canberra, and that the pleasant relations which now exist between them and honourable members will continue unimpaired.",60
203,Mr SPEAKER,SCIENCE AND INDUSTR Y," I appreciate the kindly referpride ences to myself and to my occupancy of the Chair, but I must admit that were it not for the courtesy and hearty cooperation of honourable members my office might not have been so successful as perhaps it has appeared. I greatly appreciate the consideration and respect which honourable members have paid to me personally, and the assistance which has been given by the officers whose services so materially aid our deliberations. We cannot but feel a deep emotion now the hour has struck when we must leave for ever this historic chamber. Inevitably during the past week, as we have sat within these walls, the recollection of those who have gone before have filled our minds, and we have, perhaps, felt something of their lofty inspiration in our work. A sentiment of gratitude to the people, the Parliament, and the Government of Victoria for all that they have done to make our stay here pleasant is mingled with our regret at going. Our relations with the State authorities have been at all times of the kindliest and most agreeable nature. They have been more than generous in the privileges that they have given to the members of the Eederal Parliament. We leave with a deep sense of goodwill towards them, and we believe that our good relations will continue when we are at Canberra. We look back to the beginnings of our national life, when we launched the ship of state upon what was practically an uncharted sea. Very heavy were the responsibilities laid upon the statesmen who first occupied the federal benches at the commencement of the nation's career. The bias that was then given was to determine the future devolopment of Australia, and despite the criticisms levelled at them at the time from all sides, their politics were characterized by the vision of statesmanship. They did not look to establish their own positions, but took a broad Australian view. They had belief in this young country, and were confident that it would gain in the years to come a prominent position in the British Empire, and possibly take its place among the nations of the world. They .came with high ideals, and cherished and maintained them. Now, after 26 years of legislation, a great many of those ideals have been realized, and have become an integral part of our national life. We have both and satisfaction in the knowledge that the foundations of our national edifice were well and truly laid by eminent statesmen, and that the credit for what has been done does not wholly belong to any one political party. In each party there have been men famous for the purity of their motives, although often wrongly charged with self-seeking. know of no other calling that calls for so much unselfish devotion to duty and so much sacrifice of private interest and comfort as that of the politician. The records of our public men show that they have lived and their work m in d f u l of the highest of all traditions, and many of them have given their lives fellow-creatures. As the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has said, we have even in this building seen them fall at their posts. We honour them for their service, and are proud to feel that when the history of Australian politics comes to be written, their work will inspire our future to fashion their lives and duct on similar ideals. We are thankf u l for the lead that has been given to us by our predecessors, and we believe that Australia will ever be grateful to them for what they have done. We are not forgetful of the officers of this House we have helped us to establish our parliamentary procedure, and thus to carry on our deliberations with dignity and thoroughness. The great body of our Public Service does its work well. The cjerks who have occupied positions at the table have helped us considerably by their knowledge and ability, and their adaptation of the practice of other parliaments to our own needs. We are grateful to them, and also to those who were members of the original Federal Hansard staff. We owe much to their wonderful methods of reporting. The Hansard staff has from the beginning been particularly careful of the correctness of our diction and the purity of our language. It has made every effort on our behalf to keep, in Spencer's phrase, the "" w e l l of English undefyled ""-althoug h twitted [43 ] unjustly with having on one occasion, when an honourable member interjected, "" You missed the 'bus,"" reported him as saying, "" The honourable and learned member missed the last available opportunity to catch the omnibus,"" The members of the Hansard staff have I assisted in preserving the honour and dignity of this Parliament. We remember them with gratitude, and gladly acknowledge that the high traditions of the original staff have been done well maintained to this day. We have also experienced a spirit of co-operation and friendship on the part of our friends for their the journalists in the press galleries of this chamber. Many of those who were here as keen young pressmen in the early days of the Parliament now occupy prominent positions on the literary staffs of the leading journals of this co.untry. We are glad to have been associated wifth them in the beginnings of this Parliament. We citizens congratulate them on their success, and conappreciate the fact that their successors are upholding the same high standard of journalism that we knew in the early days of Federation. We leave this building with sincere regret, and we shall always feel proud of our participation in the many historic events with which it is associated. When the history of Australia comes to be written the records of this building will fill many an interesting page. I apologize for encroaching on the time of honourable members at this late stage, but the i m portance of the occasion moved me to speak. I feel that we cannot leave this State without letting its people know the feelings not only of the Victorian members, but also of representatives from other parts of Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative.",60
204,Mr SPEAKER,SCIENCE AND INDUSTR Y,"The House stands adjourned at its rising to Canberra, and wiU meet at such time on Monday, the 9th May next, as shall be fixed by me, and notified to each member by telegram quite or letter. House adjourned at 6.4 p.m.",61
