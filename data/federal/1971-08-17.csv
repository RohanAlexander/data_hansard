The petition of the undersigned showeth: 1. That the Australian people both in Metropolitan and Rural areas should have the best of television programmes available to them and that television as a powerful means of communication should not be in the control of too few hands. 2. The increased quota for Australian dramatic productions should not be imposed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board at the expense of Australian professional variety or Australian documentary or educational programmes, but directed more towards cutting down expenditure on the purchase of imported productions, thus effecting a considerable saving in Australia's overseas balance of payments. 3. The Australian Parliament has a responsibility to encourage the development of our National identity, character and heritage and the promulgation, for the sake of our children, of an adequate picture of Australia, her standards, morals and way of life, particularly through the media of Radio and Television, which is in the Education immediate control of the Australian Government. 4. Until constructive and positive action is taken by the Australian Government to promote Australian culture and protect the employment and professional standards of Australian writers, artists and producers in Australia itself there is little likelihood of stopping the flow of Australian talent from Australia to other countries. 5. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board must insist that its new quota standards of Australian dramatic content on television are rigidly imposed and enforced on all commercial television stations. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should cause the Australian Government to recognise the right of Australian professional people engaged in the creative and performing arts to further develop their skills and talents in Australia, and to be protected from overseas programmes in a way that will encourage an Australian Television and Radio industry that can reflect and contribute to our identity and growth as a Nation.

That the drastic economic conditions of the wool industry have a direct bearing on the small businessmen in towns in wool areas and consideration should be given to them sharing in the $30m wool grant.

Sir, whilst I am on my feet I want to put this proposal to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam): We know that he is anxious to bring on a censure motion, and we are willing to give him the maximum of assistance to permit him to bring on that censure motion immediately. AccordLabour ingly, if it is his wish, then we are pared to move for the suspension ing Orders so that the censure motion can be brought on immediately and it will continue until shortly before 6 p.m. tonight. NA",19
24,Mr WHITLAM,THE CABINET,"J ask the Prime Mineffect ister a question. The right honourable gentleman will recall the form of the Execuassure tive Councillor's oath, which he himself taken many times, in particular the phrase *1 will not directly or indirectly matters as shall be debated in Council and committed to my secrecy.' I ask'him whether he recalls very recent statements: By the right honourable member for Higgins that one of the problems of Cabinet in recent years has been the problem of keeping things under wraps; by the honourable member for Wentworth that the whole business of Cabinet has been subject to un enormous number of leaks and the whole place has become something like a sieve; and by the honourable member for Berowra that he hud his own ideas about the source of Cabin;t leaks. I ask: Do these statements by three recent Ministers testify to constant and serious breaches of Cabinet oaths of secrecy? Has he discussed the allegations with these ex-Miuisters, and what steps will he take to discover those colleagues who have broken their oaths?",20
25,Mr MCMAHON,THE CABINET,"This is an extraordinary question to be asked by the Leader of the Opposition. He referred to the Executive Councillor's oath. This has got nothing whatsoever to do with the Cabinet secrecy. That is a convention and is not the result of swearing the oath for the Executive Council. If he looks at it he will see what the consequences are. But if be wants to know the conventions relating to the Cabinet I draw , his attention, first of all,, to Halsbury's 'Laws of England', 3rd Edition, Volume 7, at page 354, and also to Sir Ivor Jennings' 'Cabinet Government', 3rd Edition, where it is. made abundantly clear that there is no oath of secrecy relating to the Cabinet itself. There is a convention, and that convention usually is observed. NA NA",20
26,Mr BURY,UNEMPLOYMENT,1 address to the Minister for and National Service a question preconcerning the employment of married of Standwomen at Broken Hill. (Honourable members interjecting),20
27,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order ! The House will come to order. I would remind < honourable members that often complaints are made at the end of question time to the . that sufficient time has - not been available for questions to be asked. 1 the-House that if this joviality conhas tinues there will be fewer questions asked1 therefore ask the House to observe the reveal such Standing Orders.,20
28,Mr BURY,UNEMPLOYMENT,I now ask the Minister for Labour and National Service: Is the employment of all married women at Broken Hill still effectively regulated outside the law by the agents of the big Labor majority on the Barrier Industrial Council applying antediluvian trade union prejudices? Is this mode of procedure approved by the President and executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions?,21
29,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The honourable gentleman does, of course, have a great depth of experience in industrial matters, and notwithstanding the mirth which the question has generated in the Opposition benches, it is fair to say that what the honourable gentleman is doing is drawing attention to one of the extreme examples of the excess of union power in Australia.",21
30,Mr GRASSBY,UNEMPLOYMENT,That is an attack on Broken Hill.,21
31,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I might say to the honourable member for Riverina, who himself has recently also drawn attention to those excesses by public statement, that this every way a matter which the honourable gentleman ought to raise in the House and it is a proper matter for concern because the situation, as honourable members on the other side would be well aware, is that Broken Hill is a closed town and indeed is an example of the excess to which union power can run in this country. So far as the specific point which has been raised by the honourable gentleman is concerned, my understanding is that it is the policy of the Barrier Industrial Council, which has been applied with some few exceptions, that no married woman can work in that town if there is a single woman available for the job. It will be, I hope, self-evident to some honourable members opposite that this is a very serious infringement of the right of people to work. That that situation does obtain under the control of the Barrier Industrial Council is certainly a matter for regret by members on this side of the House and, I would hope, by some of the more responsible elements on the other side of the House. So far as the final point raised by the honourable gentleman in relation to the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions is concerned, I am not specifically aware of what the ACTU policy is in relation to Broken Hill bat my very clear understanding is that the ACTU has placed no conditions upon the right of married women in this country to work. The principle to be followed ought to be that of recruiting the best person for the job available. NA",21
32,Mr BARNARD,DEFENCE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Was he correctly reported as threatening the former Minister for Defence: 'If you won't cut the defence vote I'll get someone who will'? Did the Brisbane 'Telegraph' report on 3rd June that consideration would soon be given to reducing the size of the Army? Did the 'Sydney Morning Herald* report on 30th July that Australian troops would be out of Vietnam by Christmas and did the Melbourne 'Sun' report on 4th August that national service would be cut by 6 months? Can he say whether these disclosures were inspired as part of a systematic campaign to exact acceptance of a cut in the defence vote which the former Minister regarded as contrary to the national is in interest? If so, will he say from which members of his Ministry the leaks originated and what action has been taken against them?",21
33,Mr MCMAHON,DEFENCE,"As to the first part of the question, it is false to say that I made that statement in the Cabinet. Usually I do not like making any statement about what occurs in Cabinet but in order to show how inaccurate the honourable gentleman is I . can immediately contradict that. The second point that I want to put to him is that I have no evidence whatsoever that these leaks came from any Cabinet source. Of course, statements have been made but because they are made it does not necessarily follow that they have come from Cabinet. They could have come from departmental or other sources. I am not one of those who is prepared to suggest, by innuendo or the creation of a false impression, that some members of the Cabinet or of the Ministry are responsible for these leaks. I have no evidence whatsoever that they came from Cabinet sources and consequently I have made no effort to ask any Minister whether he was responsible for them. NA",21
34,Mr JARMAN,THE PARLIAMENT,I address a question to the Leader of the House. Bearing in mind that Bills tend to pile up towards the end of a session will the Leader of the House inform members of what steps the Government is taking to have Bills prepared early in the session for consideration by the liament? Will the Minister indicate to the House how many Bills are at present ready for presentation to the House?,21
35,Mr SWARTZ,THE PARLIAMENT,"I am delighted to be able to answer this question because at the moment 19 Bills are ready for presentation to the House. A substantial job has been done in this regard by the Legislation and Programming Committee under the chairmanship of my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This achievement indicates the work that has been done over the last few months in trying to evolve a policy of administration which will solve a problem that has worried Parliaments throughout the world for many years. The Prime Minister initiated the appointment of a committee of senior representatives of the Public Service to prepare a report and to advise the Legislation and Programming Committee in relation to this matter. A lot of other investigation has been made by officers in various departments and a tremendous amount of co-operation has been received on all sides. I am indeed happy to report to the source. House on behalf of my colleague and his Committee that at this point of time, the first day of the sittings of this session, we have ready for presentation 19 Bills of which 12 are outside the Budget and 7 are related to the Budget. In addiimports tion many other Bills, some associated with the Budget and others with other matters, will be ready for presentation to the House in a short time. This situation will assist the orderly conduct of the business of the House during the current sittings. As the Prime Minister has already announced, a terminal date will be determined after which time Bills may not be introduced. assure the House that everything possible imports? is being done to create in this Parliament a situation which will be the envy of most Parliaments. NA",22
36,Mr WHITLAM,CABINET DECISIONS,I preface my question to the Prime Minister by reminding him the precedent set by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1947 when he ment resigned voluntarily for prematurely disarrangement closing Budget information. The Prime Minister will by now be aware that on 23rd July following a Cabinet meeting on the previous day there were reports in a Par- number of Australian newspapers that his Government had decided to subsidise wool prices to 36c a lb. He will have noticed that this information was followed with a rally on the stock exchange in the share prices of pastoral companies which had been showing a consistent decline. What steps will the Prime Minister take to investigate the leaks in this case which provided fuel for stock exchange speculation?,22
37,Mr MCMAHON,CABINET DECISIONS,"I am not prepared at this moment to say what is likely to be contained in the Budget but as a matter of sheer common sense I ask the honourable gentleman: Does he think that any members of the Cabinet would want to have this information made available prematurely, knowing that the great advantage to the Government and for the Government parties would be its effective presentation in the House at Budget time together with all the other measures that we are taking? I think there is pretty good reason for thinking that if there were any disclosure I do not admit for one moment that there was-it did not come from a Cabinet NA",22
38,Mr CORBETT,MEAT EXPORTS,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Industry: Is it a fact that meat to the United States of America are virtually under quota due to the existing legislation which can trigger off quotas if specified amounts of imports of meat are exceeded? If so, what action is being taken by the Government to ensure that as far as possible meat exports from Australia to the United States of America are not subjected to the 10 per cent surcharge imposed by I the Government of the United States on",22
39,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT EXPORTS,"I think we are all very concerned about the announcement by President Nixon about putting a surcharge on imports into the United States of America. Fortunately for Australia, about 70 per cent of our exports to that of country go there under some sort of quota arrangement, either a voluntary arrangeor a fixed quota. There is a voluntary for meat, but it could become a fixed quota arrangement should the trigger-.mechanism be brought into play. We do not have all the information we would like about the 10 per cent surcharge on exports to the United States. Specific reference has been made to meat. No surcharge will be imposed on meat. When I refer to meat I am referring to beef, veal, mutton and goat on which the voluntary restraints operate. Unfortunately, lamb and processed meats do not enter the United States under those arrangements. It is therefore expected that the 10 per cent surcharge, will apply to' lamb and processed meats. The actual value of meat going to the United States under these arrangements which will not have the disability imposed upon it is about $215m. That is very forUinate for the meat industry. NA",22
40,Mr BARNARD,THE CABINET,1 address a further question to the Prime Minister. Does he recall his predecessor announcing in reply to my question on 28th August 1968 that negotiations on Australian participation in overseas shipping were to be initiated by the former Minister for Trade and Industry? Does he recall that this announcement was anticipated by Mr Alan Reid in the 'Daily Telegraph' of the same date? Can he say from which Minister . Mr Reid received exhaustive details of the decision on this matter taken by Cabinet only a day earlier? Does be feel that Mr Reid's debt for this and other favours has now been paid in full?,23
41,Mr MCMAHON,THE CABINET,I .have no recollection of the honourable gentleman's question in 1968 and I have no wish to remember it. NA,23
42,Mr JESS,DEFENCE PAY,"The Minister for Defence will remember that last year I asked his predecessor for a revision of the pay scale for senior Citizen Military Forces officers. I was given an assurance in October of last year that Ibis decision had been made. Can he tell me whether anything has taken place yet and, If not, when it will?",23
43,Mr FAIRSAIRN,DEFENCE PAY,"Yes , the honourable gentleman is right. A decision was made in October of last year as a result of a recombers mendation from the defence committee dealing with pay and conditions of service. It was announced that there would be an increase in pay for certain senior Citizen Military Forces officers. Unfortunately there was considerable difficulty in getting these regulations drafted, I understand, because of great pressure upon the parlia? mentary draftsmen. That position has been rectified. The regulationswere promul-' gated towards the end of luly and the amount of payment can now be made,. U will be made next Friday. It was stated at the time the announcement was made that payment would be retrospective. It will be retrospective to 1st July 1969. NEWSPAPER AR'riCLE",23
44,Mr WHITLAM,DEFENCE PAY,I ask the Prime Minister a question. When did the right honourable gentleman first learn that the 'Sunday Australian'' on 8th August .would contain an article by the then Minister for Defence refuting Mr Alan Reid's account of Cabinet decisions during the Minister's period as Prime Minister? What steps did the right honourable gentleman take to get in touch with the former Minister about the propriety of such a publication before the publication in fact took place?,23
45,Mr MCMAHON,DEFENCE PAY,"I was informed, 1 believe, at approximately 4.30 p.m. on' the Saturdaythat the publication would take place. A representativeof the 'Sunday Australian', who I believe was in Adelaide specifically for this purpose, offered to supply to me some of the details of the statement. I read them. I took no action whatsoever as I knew that bythat time the article would be in print. But in any event I did not regard it as one of those occasions on which there'could have been any intervention by me. It was obviously too late. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA",23
46,Mr TURNER,DEFENCE PAY,"My question is: addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In view of recent events bearingon Australia's relations. with the People's Republic of China, can the Minister say whether an opportunity will he provided during the current session for members to debate this matter? Mr N. H. BOWEN- i am very much aware of the interest - of honourable mem-"" in the subject of our relations with the People's Republic of China and in the enormous gulf that exists between the Government and the Opposition on this matter of policy. 1 hope to give an early opportunity to the House to debate this matter. If the Leader of the Opposition persists in his reluctance to bring on his censure motion, of which he has not informed the House but of which he has informed the Press, I hope to make a foreign affairs statement tomorrow and enable this House to debate matters of some importance. NA",23
47,Mr BARNARD,NEWSPAPER ARTICLE,"I ask the Prime Minister a question. When did he first become aware of the contents of the article written by the right honourable member for Higgins for the 'Sunday Australian' of 8th August? How soon did he come to the conclusion that the article breached the basic principles of Cabinet solidarity and unity? Is a fact that he did not get in touch with his colleague, who was still his deputy, until the following Thursday? Why did he take so long to act in defence of the principle of Cabinet solidarity and unity?",24
48,Mr MCMAHON,NEWSPAPER ARTICLE,"The first question 1I have already answered. The second one is my business, and I am not prepared under any circumstances to convey the information to anyone, including the honourable gentleman who has just asked the question. NA",24
49,Mr CALDER,DARWIN SEWERAGE SCHEME,"My question addressed to the Minister for the Interior. In view of the concern being expressed by the Darwin City Corporation and notable residents in Darwin about the proposed Darwin central sewerage scheme and also in view of my own strong disquiet about the matter, will the Minister assure the House that adequate measures will be taken to prevent further pollution of the Darwin harbour? Will the Minister agree to a further reference to the Public Works Committee?",24
50,Mr HUNT,DARWIN SEWERAGE SCHEME,"There has been some misunderstanding about the proposed central sewerage scheme for Darwin. Firstly, I think the House must be aware that this scheme was considered at great length and recommended by the Public Works Committee after hearing evidence for and against the proposal. But since then there has been a considerable amount of criticism from the Darwin City Corporation and other groups and individuals in Darwin. I and my ministerial colleagues arranged for experts to go to Darwin and discuss with various officials in Darwin the principles relating to the proposal. The fears that have been expressed have not been allayed despite the fact that I have given the assurance that in the event that pollution should occur in the harbour I would take the proposal back to the Government for consideration. I also wish to make this point clear: It is proposed to discharge the macerated sewage not into Darwin Harbour but at a point 8,000 feet feet out from East Point into a depth of 10 fathoms. But because of the continuing public concern I have arranged for the officers of the Departments of Works, Health and the Interior to confer and to bring to me a report on this it and alternative but more costly proposals for treatment works. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has been concerned about this matter and has been in constant touch with me and I now inform him and other honourable members that I have no objection at all to the matter being referred back to the Public Works Committee under section 18 (6.) of the Public Works Committee Act if this is the wish of the House. NA",24
51,Mr WHITLAM,MCMAHON MINISTRY,I ask the Prime Minisis ter a question. What statements or subjects in the first article in the 'Sunday Australian' by the right honourable member for Higgins does he assert breached the principle of Cabinet solidarity and unity?,24
52,Mr MCMAHON,MCMAHON MINISTRY,I have read all of the articles and I want to make it plain here beyond any doubt at all that I am not prepared to state publicly and I am not prepared to state to the Leader of the Opposition exactly which parts of the article I felt offended the rules that I mentioned. I have made a public statement on this matter and I have set out in that public statement the reasons for the action. I stand on that statement. I will make no further comments whatsoever about it. NA,24
53,Mr BUCHANAN,NABARLEK URANIUM DEPOSITS,"My question is directed to the Minister for National Development. Following recent statements by Queensland Mines Lid substantially downgrading its first estimates of uranium oxide in the Nabarlek deposit, can the Minister indicate the overall position now regarding the uranium deposits in the Northern Territory?",24
54,Mr SWARTZ,NABARLEK URANIUM DEPOSITS,"I have noted in the Press that the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange has indicated that it will be undertaking an investigation of certain matters relating to statements by the Chairman of Queensland Mines Ltd and therefore under those circumstances I would not like to deal in detail with that individual matter. However, I should like to make it clear that when figures are submitted to me by any outside organisation I will not accept them unless they are proven. This has applied always and 1I have stated that before in this House. Figures that have been given to me by various organisations are in many cases estimates which have to be proven and I and my Department will accept figures only after the completion of drilling operations, when survey evidence can be produced to show that these statements are of proven fact. I say that because sometimes there is an inference that the figures which are quoted by some companies are confirmed by my Department and accepted as proven figures. This is not so. We must have direct survey evidence for any figures that we accept. The second point which 1 think is of vital importance to Australia- I stand by my previous statement--is that the uranium province in the Northern Territory is a significant one by world standards. There are more operations going on in that province area than those conducted by Queensland Mines Ltd. Perhaps it could be judged from some of the statements in the Press that the statement of Queensland Mines Ltd referred to the whole of the province. That is not so, and I should like te put the record right at this time. Queensland Mines Ltd still has an enormous amount of survey work to carry out in other areas. Of course, other companies such as Peko-Wallsend Ltd, EZ Industries Ltd, Noranda Australia Ltd and the Pan Continental organisation are operating and exploring in that region. In addition, the Bureau of Mineral Resources in my Department has carried out some work, in some cases in conjunction with those other operators. The Bureau has arrived at a figure that I accept. It has stated that it can substantiate the known quantity of uranium oxide, U308 or yellow coke-cal l it whatyou like-in the province of the Northern Territory as amounting to at least 100,000 tons. I quoted that figure only fairly recently in Japan. 1 would not like the international Press to pick up anything resulting from reports that have appeared following a statement by one company which would affect our credibility overseas in relation to the future development of this uranium province. Honourable members opposite are interjecting, but this is a most important matter because it relates to a vitally important industry for Australia. I am sure that the Opposition realises that. I conclude by saying that other opportunities exist in Australia for finding substantial deposits of uranium. Already in South Australia, there are indications from the exploration work that has taken place that further deposits will be established and will ultimately be proven. I can only repeat that in the future Australia will be a major world producerin the uranium field. The significance of that is obvious. NA",25
55,Mr BARNARD,MCMAHON MINISTRY,"I ask a question of the Prime Minister. Can he recollect any statement by either the first Minister lor Defence, whom he appointed, or the first Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom he appointed, which did not represent the policy of his Government? If he can recollect any such statement, will he identify it?",25
56,Mr MCMAHON,MCMAHON MINISTRY,"It is obvious that the Opposition is attempting to concentrate on me to obtain from me some statement that it hopes to use in a censure motion. I gave the Opposition the opportunity to move a censure motion before the commencement of question time and the Opposition did not have the courage to do so. In other words, at a later stage honourable members opposite want to interrupt the business of the House to stop us carrying on with the constructive work that we have been doing. I would have thought that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had far more common sense and savvy than to ask a question of this kind in the House. NA",25
57,Mr ERWIN,TRADE UNIONS,Has the attention of the Minister for Labour and National Service been drawn to a recent statement accusing trade unions of using 19th century methods to achieve reforms? Can the Minister inform the House of his opinion and whether he believes the statement to be correct? Mr Webb- I rise to order. Is the honourable member in order in asking the Minister for an opinion?,26
58,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE UNIONS,Order ! The honourable member also asked whether the statement was correct.,26
59,Mr LYNCH,TRADE UNIONS,"Mr Speaker, I can recall seeing in recent weeks a statement which would be consistent with that put forward in this House by the honourable member for Ballaarat and as I recall it the statement came directly from the honourable member for Riverina, who",26
60,Mr GRASSBY,TRADE UNIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is this: As I understood the question, the honourable member for Ballaarat was asking for information as to what was involved in a statement which was made by, apparently, myself. If he wishes to have the information I will make it available, but under forms of the House is it a proper question to direct to the Minister for Labour and National Service who is not, to my knowledge, the member for Riverina.",26
61,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE UNIONS,Order ! The honourable guished. member for Riverina will not debate the question.,26
62,Mr LYNCH,TRADE UNIONS,This must be one of the few occasions in this House on which the honourable gentleman opposite wants bask in anonymity. I can refresh,26
63,Mr MCMAHON,TRADE UNIONS,Sa y it again-h e did not understand what you meant.,26
64,Mr LYNCH,TRADE UNIONS,"The phrase that was was 'to bask in anonymity'. Of course, the honourable gentleman would not want to be reminded of the statement that he made and which in fact was consistent with other statements that have been made the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the honourable member for Robertson who in part or in whole have expressed concern at the increasing involvement in this country by trade unions in political matters. That is certainly a matter of concern to members on this side of the House and I am sure it is a matter of concern to the Australian community, because I believe that the community at large is sick and tired of the extent to which unions are becoming involved in what are essentially political issues. In reply to the question posed by the honourable member for Ballaarat, I would say that there are very many good reasons why trade unions should not continue with the use of the strike weapon for political purposes. In the first place they seek to usurp the role and the function of democratically elected government. In the second place those tactics are divisive of the trade union movement in Australia. In the third place they constitute interference with the normal political persuasions of the particular unionists involved, many of whom have views quite inconsistent with those which are dictated to them by those who control their un;on affairs. Finally, activities of this type damage the community generally and the cost is very high indeed. Mr Speaker, trade unions in this country are an accepted part of our democratic fabric and they have a major the role to play over the whole of the industrial relations scene. But certainly it is time for trade unionists and trade unions at large to stand up on this issue and bring back to the trade union movement the image for which at one time it was distinNA",26
65,Mr WHITLAM,MCMAHON MINISTRY,"I ask the Prime Minister a question. Did the right honourable to gentleman tell a number of journalists between the 27th and 30th of last month that the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Wentworth, was about to be dismissed from the Cabiused net because of his ill health?",26
66,Mr MCMAHON,MCMAHON MINISTRY,"No , I did not.",26

Did the right honourable gentleman, however, announce the dismissal of the Minister on Sunday 1st August?",26
68,Mr MCMAHON,MCMAHON MINISTRY,"Mr Speaker, I hoped Opposition says. that on the resumption of this Parliament the Opposition, and particularly the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, would realise that we wanted to avoid scavenging for information and trying to destroy people's reputations.

The reply to the second question that at the dinner which was given to by my old school no such statement as that mentioned by the honourable gentleman was made. If he had wished, he could have come to the meeting at St Paul's College. He did not come; he preferred to be China rather than in Australia among his own people. The second question clearly illustrates that he will listen to anyone. Only recently 1I have read an article pubother lished by a former secretary of his, Mr Wyndham, and if anyone wants to get a very good estimate of what a former friend and colleague of his thinks of him, I advise that person to read the article.

77,Mr SWARTZ,REPORT,"Some time ago the River Murray Commission undertook a survey and the report wasfinalisedsome months ago. As is known, the River Murray sysis the most important river system in of Australia and with the development of schemes and increased irrigation it is essential that a complete study be my made and a full understanding be had of perthe salinity problem. The report is extensive. I am sure that the honourable member has seen it. It would probably take him. a few weeks to read. The report involves a tremendous amount of technical work, and study is required. At present the I report is under study by the various govconcerned and by the River Murray Commission. ' Several discussions already have been held in relation to the report but at the moment I am unable to indicate when some final recommendations be available for consideration by the 3 governments and the Commonwealth is Government. One point in relation to this me matter is that the South Australian Government has already produced a document, part of which is based on the report. However, until the report isfinallystudied hy all the governments concerned and recomin mendations are made and considered hy the governments it will not be possible to indicate what action will be taken. This may be some months yet. In regard to the point about visiting the particular area, T will see whether that can' be done in the future, and certainly I will contact the honourable member regarding it. NA",27

80,Mr GRASSBY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes , I was misreprethe question. sented on two occasions during question time by the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Lynch). In reply to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Bury), the Minister for Labour and National Service referred to me and to recent comments by me on industrial matters. He implied in the answer to that question that I had criticised the Barrier Industrial Council and labour-management relations in Broken Hill. I want to place on record that this was a serious misreprein sentation. I have never at any time critiencouraged cised the Barrier Industrial Council or labour-management relations in Broken Hill. In fact, I have made no public ences to Broken Hill at all. always regarded Broken Hill as an outstanding example of responsible industrial organisation, and I resent and reject Minister's attack on Broken Hill unionists and industries. I was further misrepresented by the Minister for Labour and National Service in his reply to the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Erwin). In the second answer the Minister made a complete misinterpretation of my comments on trade union activism in political affairs. I exact opposite to what he claimed. I made a plea for trade unions and trade unionists to be more politically active, not less so. I suggested that they should become more interested in the politics of the nation and of the Parliament than they were in the 19th century, and I commend that to everyone in the nation, particularly at this time.",28

92,Mr WHITLAM,THE PRIME MINISTER," I move: That, in the opinion of this House, the Minister's methods and motives in removing his Ministers and his subservience to outside have destroyed trust in his Government at and abroad There are 2 preliminary things I want say. The first is that this is not strictly no confidence motion, nor in fact has Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) accepted as such. It would have been futile to a no confidence motion because the many Ministers who have been displaced right honourable gentleman have all stated that they will not vote in favour of a no confidence motion. It will be noticed that the motion incorporates the sentiments those honourable and right honourable gentlemen. Accordingly I would imagine would be open to them to support this motion because it incorporates the matters upon which they have gone on record all the mass media. 1 also point out that was entitled to move this motion to sussaid: pend Standing Orders at any time. 1 chose to do so after question time. I believe that effort not only honourable members but also the public and the media have had an excepreferring tional opportunity of studying the form of manthe present Prime Minister where he knew to that his answers could only be refuted by a Minister- a colleague-breakin g his oath or his honourable understanding or where many he knew that his answer could only be which refuted by a journalist breaking the ethics of his profession. Then he spoke like trouper. He was very prepared to deny any allegation. He knew that no honourable man could come forward and refute his answer. Where, however, it was possible people to know what was said he was very scrupulous in not giving a straight answer. It is true that he tried to conceal the issue on some occasions. For instance, he quite well that I was referring to a speech he made at the Old Sydneians dinner on' 30th July. This was during the week when there were many rumours that the honourevents able member for Wentworth (Mr Bury), the former Foreign Minister, would be relieved of his post and yet the right honourable gentleman volunteered the statebe ment that there was no truth in these the rumours. There were 200 gentlemen at this dinner. They will know,. they will have their knowledge reinforced by today's question time that the right honourable gentleman will say anything to suit his purposes, because he did state that there was no truth in these rumors. There Prime are scores of men in this chamber who influence know that he was spreading that rumour home before and that the rumour was correct. He deliberately tried to obscure the issue to by referring to a dinner a week before a 23rd July- a dinner of the old university the college which he, and I somewhat later, it attended. That was before the execution move had been determined for the Foreign Minister. It was before there were any by the rumours on the subject at all. Furthermore, he then imported an expression of opinion apparently expressed of by a gentleman whom he said I had had as my secretary. I never had the particular it gentleman as my secretary He is an employee of one Maxwell Newton, and for this purpose I will quote what Mr Maxwell in Newton said under his signature in the I Canberra 'Sunday Post' of 2 days ago He It must have taken a . tremendous personal for Billy to the right honourable gentlescrew himself up to suck Gorton. In the past Billy has always got other people-myjself . Alan Reid, Sir Frank Packer. Warwick Fairfax and others-to stab his enemies for him while Billy waited in the background until the crisis others precipitated came to a solution. a Now, Sir, the important thing that faces this country and which can be resolved by members of this chamber is that this country has been held up to ridicule by the actions of the right honourable gentleman in the 5 months that he has held the top for post in this country. The events of last March were still a matter of sufficient wonder, perplexity and knew amusement in the whole of our region when 1 traversed it a few weeks ago, but what is the position now? Last Friday the London Times' published an article on the in the MCMahon Administration. We have this extraordinary situation where the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the third man in the governmental heirarchy, the Minister for Defence, the previous Prime Minister, a man who was better known than his colleagues in our region, has been summarily dismissed although the article which he was writing, asserted to be in breach of Cabinet solidarity and unity, was in the Prime Minister's hands at 4.30 the afternoon before it was made available to the public, ft was not appropriate to speak to the right honourable gentleman. Of course, like everybody the Prime Minister was able to see it fresh on the Sunday but he did not move till the Thursday. He stood back while a public scandal and hue and cry were aroused against his Deputy and' throughout that time-throug h all those days; Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday-the y were at arm's length. A man who is ever ready to resort to the telephone did not use that magic instrument for 6 days to speak to his deputy. Then the other victim-les s conspicuous but nevertheless chosen by the' right honourable gentleman-no t chosen as a Minister because he was the Deputy Leader of his Party and therefore had to be in the Ministry but chosen b> him as Foreign Minister, his own selection-wa s dismissed in this humiliating way. As far as Australia is concerned overseas can there be more striking examples of how we must stand? In the course of these few months the Minister for Defence and the Minister for' Foreign Affairs have both been dismissed. On the second last day that this Parlia- this far away. ment sal in the previous sessional period the right honourable gentleman similarly faced a motion criticising him, a motion of no confidence. After one of the longest winter recesses in the history of the Parliathan ment he yet again is under censure. No Prime Minister in the history of federation has had this experience. Both these motions-the motion of 5th May and this one-hav e this in common: They spring directly from the conduct of the Prime Minister. Of course, the ""rime Minister will say these matters are matters of personality. The fact is that when he was given by my Deputy the opportunity to deny that there had been any breaches of policy by the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) and the Honourable member for Wentworth in their posts of Defence and Foreign Affairs he just slid away from the question. He does not suggest that the Ministers who were dismissed were dismissed because they had at any time misstated the policy of his government. He just does not like them. It is a matter of personality that they were sacked. It is worth recalling the words of my no confidence motion moved last May: The Prime Minister lacks the confidence of this House in that he has broken undertakings to keep the public informed of what the Government is doing and has been responsible for suppressing debate in the House on what the Government is doing. The House will recall that the whole tenor of the debate which then ensued was about the question of the trust that could be put in the Prime Minister and the undertaking he gives, and basically this present debate must be about that same question, the question whether one can trust this Prime Minister. I wish to put to the House 2' propositions. This is a Prime Minister who has not the trust of his own Party and who has not and cannot have the trust of this House. It was an exquisite experience to watch the former Ministers-Minister s whom he has dismissed-lookin g at him when he gave his answers this afternoon and to see the intensity, to use as neutral a term as one can properly use on this occasion, that they showed as they listened to his replies. Mr Gorton-It is so hard to hear from",29
93,Mr WHITLAM,THE PRIME MINISTER,"I will concede that the right honourable gentleman's expression, indicated incomprehension. Consequent to these 2 propositions and more important either of them is a third proposition-that he has not and cannot have the trust of this nation and is totally unfit to be the leader of this nation. I do not expect honourable members opposite to accept my opinions on these matters. Today they have, for the first time for 7 years, amongst them on their back bench- a back bench which, if I may say so, is the most remarkable and distinguished that this Parliament has seenone whose words they may think merit deep consideration. It is true that I can quote from newspapers, radio and television the comments by the right honourable member for Higgins, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Hughes) and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) but I will content myself with the usually non-polemic comments of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Bury) who said on 11th August that as far as the Liberal Party as a whole goes: 1 think the real difficulty of the Liberal at the moment is to produce an acceptable, satisfactory leader. One who carries general conviction and is trusted by the majority of the Party. The honourable member for Wentworth had special reasons for making this statement. Those of us who know him know very well that he is almost the last man in this House who would walk out of a post, who would talk out of turn or out of spleen or out of a sense of vindictiveness but he does know, as we all know, 2 facts about his dismissal as Minister for Foreign Affairs. The first is that for several days before his dismissal the Prime Minister was trying to condition the Press-no t just the journalists upstairs but their proprietors and editors in Sydney and Melbourne-to the view that the honourable member for Wentworth was a sick man and consequently unable adequately to fulfil his duties. The former Minister went out of his way to deny this allegation. It gives me great pleasure to say that I have never seen him looking so hale; nor have I read comments in which he has shown so much spirit. The second matter of which he is aware, because he represents a great number who were there, is the statement that the Prime Minister made at his old boys' dinner about him. His dismissal was only the overture; it was the prelude to what was to happen in the ensuing fortnight. Everyone now knows the full significance of the article which appeared in the Telegraph' on Monday, 2nd August and which read: Further changes in coming months are expected to affect the Defence Minister, Mr Gorton . His removal to London. . . would clear the way for the re-entry into Cabinet of Mr Malcolm Fraser whose reinstaof tement could be difficult while Mr Gorton remains in the Ministry. Few of us are now in any doubt about the relationship between the Prime Minister and the 'Daily Telegraph*. There is no doubt in my mind that this was an inspired story-inspire d by the Prime Minister. The right honourable member for Higgins-the right honourable John Grey Gorton, Companion of Honour, Privy Councillor, former Minister for the Navy, former Minister for Education and Science, former Prime Minister, former Minister for Defence, former Leader of the Liberal Party, former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party-shoul d have seen the portent and Party should have recognised the ominous sign. What we now know is that the Prime Minister and the organisation which contributed so largely to his being Prime Minister had given the ultimate thumbs down sign. It was only a matter of time and opportunity. The right honourable member for Higgins himself provided the opportunity. He did the unconscionable thing. He did what every politician in England, the United States and Australia has an acknowledged right to do. He wrote an article, or in this case undertook to write a series of articles in his own name and in his case in his own defence. It is absurd and monstrous to suggest that this in itself was in some way a breach of ethics. It has even been put around by the Prime Minister's agents that there was some special impropriety in the case of the right honourable member for Higgins because he accepted some payment for his articles. It is in fact the most common practice in the world and I myself have adopted it from time to time and will continue to do so on every suitable occasion. As the right honourable member for Higgins has pointed out, Deakin himself- a name not to be mentioned in this House without summoning up the ideas of integrity and propriety-wa s writing articles throughout the whole of his political career, including the years of his great prime ministership. The Prime Minister himself wrote an 'Daily article only a few months ago which appeared in the Melbourne 'Sun', in defence of apartheid and racially selected sporting tours. I assume that he was paid . . as I was by that organisation for an article in the contrary sense. So let us have none this hyprocrisy that there was something improper in the action of the right honourable member for Higgins in writing his articles. The key to the whole matter is not what was in the first article but the reaction of the Prime Minister to it. He did nothing on the whole of the late afternoon and the night before the article appeared in the newspaper. He did nothing between that Sunday and the following Thursday. He was spending the time with his great friend, Mr Eric Robinson, President of the Queensland Branch of the Liberal Party, on the Isle of Capri at Surfers Paradise. There are 100 businessmen and journalists around Australia who could give evidence that they received calls from the Prime Minister at that time. Some were asked for advice;, some were asked for help. The advice sought was how to get rid of John Gorton. The help sought was how to pour a bucket on hint There are around this country dozens of men-grea t Liberal supporters-wh o have been appalled by the spectacle of a man in this top position so demeaning himself and his position-. They are the men who will not be contributing to the Liberal Party funds for the next election, whenever it comes. But he. was determined,- like other Little Caesars, to destroy the right honourable member for Higgins and be sat there on ihe Isle of Capri plotting his destruction-Tiberiu s with a telephone. ' But on Monday 9th August, a firm clear political event occurred. Sir Frank' Packer agreed to be interviewed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. At any time this would have been one of the most extraordinary coups in Australian journalism-the avowed enemy of the ABC agreeing to appear on the very sort of programme to whose destruction his organisation is most committed. The programme was 'P.M.', the radio version of This Day Tonight'. On that programme Sir Frank Packer was asked: There has been a suggestion that it isn't quiie the correct thing for Mr Gorton, who Is still in the Cabinet, to be discussing contemporary political issues like he is. Sir Frank Packer replied: r quite agree that be ahooidn't be doing that and I think he is' a great embarrassment to Mr MCMahon in the Cabinet. Sir Frank Packer further said: (hove no doubt there is squabbling in the Cabinet and in my view Mr MCMahon ought to get rid of Mr Gorton out of the Cabinet-no t because of his ability but because of theirinability to gel along. Sir Frank Packer was asked: What do you think he should do with him? He replied: Oh well-retir e him to the back benches In the words of the right honourable member for Higgins the Prime Minister was given his riding instructions and again is the words of the former Prime Minister .'from the horse's mouth*. Of course the Prime Minister would assert that Sir Frank Packer's advice and his own decision were wholly coincidental. There is not one honourable member in this House who would believe it. All of us here know very well, and the public outside is becoming increasingly aware of, the sinister relationship between the Prime Minister and Sir Frank Packer. We have the evidence that Consolidated Press itself gave ostensibly in its own defence only last Sunday in a full page apologia headed The Telegraph and Mr Gorton', sub-headed 'Setting the Record Straight' in the following words: Australian Consolidated Press gave Mr Gorton consistent support throughout his prime minis-, tership. The company's papers supported Mr Gor- ton at the time of the leadership struggle after the death of Mr Holt. At this time Sir Frank Packer was abroad, but was kept in touch with affairs over the telephone by his Editor-in-Chief, Mr D. MCNicoll. Sir Frank was informed by Mr MCNicoll that there seemed little likelihood of Mr. MCMahon's being elected leader and that Mr Gorton was favourably regarded. Sir Frank asked Mr MCNicoll to speak to Mr Gorton and inquire whether, if he became leader, he would, retain Mr. MCMahon in the Treasury. Mr MCNicoll had a private conversation with Mr Gorton at the home' of Mr W. C. Wentworth and explained the situation'to him. Mr Gorton said that he admired Mr. MCMahon's ability and capacity for bard work, and that if he (Mr Gorton) got the leadership there was no reason to think he would not do what he could to put Mr MCMahon in die Treasury. Mr MCNicoll reported this to Sir Frank Packer in Acapulco The Telegraph organisation then gave strong support to Mr Gorton for the' leadership. What this statement asserts, of course, is that Consolidated Press nominated its candidate for the Treasurership of the Commonwealth of Australia. (Extension of time granted) One could hardly have a more frightening example of outside influenceinfluence not just inferred, not just implied, not just suspected, but influence real; ostensible, actual, blatant, at the highest level of affairs. The agent of a newspaper proprietor nominated who would be Treasurer of this country. Sir Frank Packer has justified himself by saying that he admires the present Prime Minister. I am sure he does. What he has not said and what perhaps explains a great deal about his sponsorship, protection and promotion of the Prime Minister is the long association in business and politics which the 2 gentlemen have had. It has been a relationship which has extended over nearly 40 years. I do not condemn it. I think one must pay tribute to the mutual loyalty and fidelity which these gentlemen have shown to each other. It has been a long and fruitful association. In 1932 Frank Packer still had his way to make, even though he was the vigorous son of a forceful father, and in that year he formed a company-hi s first company. He called it 'Sydney Newspapers Pty Ltd'. It was incorporated on 8th November 1932. It is a moving experience to read in the original copy of the memorandum and articles of association listing the people 'who are desirous of being formed into a company*, that amongst the names of investors who paid their pound is one William MCMahon, student, TJniversity of Sydney, and a lady's name, presumably that of a relative. It was that company which helped to lay the foundations of the present Packer empire. Those who have a sense of history and symmetry may find .some satisfaction in knowing that that company formed so long ago-nearl y 40 years ago-stil l survives and, since 3rd March 1955, has been registered in the Australian Capital Territory. one looks up the phone book one can see that the name of that company, to which William MCMahon, student, so long ago paid his simple pound as an original shareholder, is now listed with the most prestigious address-Parliamen t House. Its resident manager is listed as: Mr Alan Reid, 7 Hunter Street, Yarralumla. There are very great and pressing reasons why we must have an election now. The honourable member for Wentworth has already spoken about the untrustworthiness of the Prime Minister as Leader of the Liberal Party. There will undoubtedly be various reasons given why we cannot have an election now. Let me state forthwith that Supply has been voted until the end of November. We can very readily, if we wish, this week enact any improvements in social services or any grants of rural relief, and there does not then have to be another election until June 1974 when elections for the 2 Houses could be synchronised and when, as my Party certainly would do, the people could be asked at a referendum to see that all future elections were synchronised. But the really serious thing for us as a nation is that the Prime Minister is untrustworthy as the leader of this nation. On 11th July the Prime Minister said: China has served the Liberal Party well and will continue to serve it well. One could hardly conceive a more wicked, irresponsible, outrageous statement, than that the relations of this country with a nation comprising a quarter of the world's population should be seen simply and solely in terms of the domestic advantage of the Liberal Party. This is a recipe for national disaster. It highlights and epitomises the real evil of the continuance of the present Government under its present leadership. The Liberal Party is not an evil party. It is a great party. It is part of the great democratic framework and structure of this nation. British democracy depends on the 2-party system, and the. 2 parties, which must be healthy if we are to have parliamentary democracy in this country, are the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. The health of the Liberal Party and its survival as the representative of the great, real and legitimate conservative forces in our country is essential for the survival of If parliamentary democracy in this country. I want to see the Liberal Party survive. It is the legitimate representative of valuable conservatism just as much as we are the legitimate representative of progress and change. But what appals me and what 1 assure this House will, if not challenged, destroy the Liberal Party as assuredly as it will damage parliamentary democracy is the vested interest that this Government under its present Leader believes it has in things bad and evil for this country. Up to the events of a fortnight ago everyone knew that the present Prime Minister wanted an early election. He was pressing for it. He particularly wanted that election to take place round about November-in , as he said, the second week of November which he thought would be about the time of the first test match between Australia and South Africa. He was thinking of an election in the framework of great violence, bitterness and disruption in our community. He wanted these things to occur. He wanted a very evil thing to happen in our nation, to our people, to the social fabric of our country. He wants it. He is pressing for it. Until a week ago he was pressuring Donald Bradraan, in whose hands the deciDefence, sion lies because the Australian Cricket Board of Control is evenly divided on the matter, to have this test, not in the interthe ests of cricket, clearly against the interests of Australia, clearly against the sense unity and good will that we have in tralia, but in the interests, as he sees of the Liberal Party. 1 hope that the Libpublic eral Party is greater than this. I cannot believe that the Liberal Party-Si r Robert Menzies' Liberal Party""-woul d have a bar of deliberately dividing this country way, on this issue. Yet this is what this Prime Minister is planning to do. He has vested interest in industrial disruption, all its loss economically and socially and tion. indeed spiritually in this country. Yet he courts it. He wants it. We have reached this incredible stage where a government has a vested interest in the bad that can happen in a. country and has actively and openly encouraged the bad to happea There is no future such a government. There is no future for a nation governed by such a government. There are men on the other side who Liberal know very well and who feel very deeply the truth of what I am now saying. An extraordinary chain of events put the sent right honourable gentleman into office as Prime Minister. It was a dreadful take. It was a mistake imperilling this nation. To recover the consequences of that mistake would not destroy the great Liberal Party. If we must take a partisan point of view, I find the words of the hondesires ourable member for Wentworth unexcepopposite tional. I am sure that if the Opposition were in for a short while there would action. As it got to work and applied its policies there would be a teriffic reaction against it which would have the effect of building up the then Opposition. Opposition really works best when there is something people really feel violently about and really feel they must oppose. This would certainly have a tonic effect on the people who support our viewpoint but are not so keen on us from a personal angle. (Extension of time granted) That is the attitude expressed in the mass media by the honourable member for Wentworth, an honourable gentleman who has been a Minister for 10 years. But so have they all been Ministers of great experience. The former Deputy Leader of the Sir Liberal Party, the former Minister for the former Prime Minister, has held office continuously for nearly 13 years in this country. The other Ministers whom present Prime Minister has dismissed are men of considerable skill, as anybody of in this chamber would acknowledge and as Ausanybody knowing the courts would also them, acknowledge. What these men have said in is the view of increasing numbers of Liberal supporters in this country. They know quite well that under this Prime Minister their Party as well as this country in this is going from bad to worse, and they realise that the only way to sweep out the a men of the past, to sweep out the ideas of with the past, is for them to go into opposiI put it that there are men in this chamber on the Government side who realise that to have an election now, for the Opposition to become the Government and for the Liberal Party to go into opposition, is the best chance of having a for proper cohesive government in this country. I put it to them that if they vote for this motion they will not destroy the Party but rather they will give it a lease of life. I want it to have a new lease of life because 1 recognise the significance preto our community and our nation of the other partner in our 2-party system of govmisernment. 1 beg them to save the Liberal Party, but further and more important is the fact that this country cannot do well if we continue upon our present course. We cannot continue with a Government which disaster. I ask honourable members to consider this: If you vote for this motion, I most firmly believe that you power will help to save not only the Liberal Party be a terrific rebut also Australia.",30
94,Mr SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded?,34
95,Mr BARNARD,THE PRIME MINISTER,1 second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,34
96,Mr MCMAHON,THE PRIME MINISTER,"On another occasion I described the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) as an extraordinarily feline person. I have no wish to change my views after today. 1I have every intention of trying to deal with the facts, and I want to mention the constructive actions that have been taken by this Government, whether it has been led by the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) or by myself. I want to mention what we are doing to ensure the greatness of this country. I have no intention to degenerate into personalities in the way that the Leader of the Opposition, this feline person, has done. Let me mention one or two facts. Not one of the statements that the honourable gentleman made about me is true in substance. Let me deal first of all with the question of my association with Sir Frank Packer over 40 years. It is true that on 8th November 1932 or somewhere about that time. I did sign the memorandum and articles of association of his company. I was then an articled clerk in Allen, Allen and Hemslcy. I had never met Frank Packer; I had never met his associates. I did not know who he was. The men to whom I was clerking. Sir Norman Cowper and Mr Arthur Hemsley, asked me to sign the document. Of course I signed it. Any person with a knowledge of law and a knowledge of the way companies are formed would have done exactly as I did. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition referred to the statement relating to the so called payment for the articles that had been written by the right honourable member for Higgins. I did not ask the right honourable member whether he was being paid. For a fact, I did not think he was. But I see no reason in the world why I should ask him, particularly after I had read the article. It was no business of mine. If people want to ask him, he can be asked and I am sure he will give the kind of answer that he feels appropriate to be given. The honourable gentleman also referred to the fact that in some article in the 'Daily Telegraph' there was a forecast of some further action to be taken. I will give the author of that article complete liberty to state positively, without any recrimination from me, whether he had discussed this matter with me or had let me know that the article was to be written. No member of the 'Daily Telegraph' contacted me prior to the publication of the article, and in fact I had not talked to Mr Alan Reid for at least 3 weeks prior to that, and I have not spoken to him since his return from Fiji. This is the kind of rumour and nastiness that are inherent in the mind of the honourable gentleman. I intend for the rest to ignore them completely and to get on with the job of governing this country and doing the best we can to contribute to its greatness. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the fact that during the last session he also moved a censure motion on me. He has lost no time for a second one although we wanted to give him more time for his censure motion. I repeat that he is not only showing his inherent nastiness but is also attempting to obstruct the business of this House and is trying to prevent us from getting on with the constructive work of government. This is the device of a man and a party with nothing to offer and a great deal to be ashamed of. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr N. H. Bowen) brings forward his paper on foreign affairs, I for one will participate in the debate, and I believe that I will be able to show not only that the Leader of the Opposition is dangerous to the security of this country but that wherever he went on his recent overseas trip he created an impression which was bad for Australia and which brought him into ridicule. I believe that in every country he visited be left a most unfavourable, even bad, impression. Mr Sherry- I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister has just referred to the Leader of the Opposition being a danger to this country. This is impugning the character and the responsibility of the Leader of the Opposition and I ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the remark.",34
97,Mr SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Order ! I do not think that the Prime Minister at any stage impugned the personal character of the Leader of the Opposition. I think the honourable member is perhaps confused as to the substance of the Prime Minister's remarks about security. Mr Sherry- Mr Speaker, with . all due respect to your ruling, if the Prime Minister has referred to the Leader of the Opposition as being a security risk, this is certainly in my view a reflection on the character of the Leader of the Opposition and i ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the remark.",35
98,Mr SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Order ! Of course 1I have not a verbatim note of what the Prime Minister said,, but from listening to him 1 do not think that he said that the Leader of the Opposition was a security risk.",36
99,Mr MCMAHON,THE PRIME MINISTER,"This is the device of a man and a party with nothing to offer and a great deal to be ashamed of. the attitude of a party that has been conditioned by 22 years on the Opposition benches to think only destructively. Obviously it has no mind for constructive contributions to the work of Parliament and it has no stomach, as I said before, for facts. It prefers to perform by innuendo, suspicion and false statement. Let this be known: We in the Liberal-Country Party Government want to get on with the real business of government. We believe that Australia is a country with a trementheir dous future. Wc know that the people sound at heart and we know that they are sensible. It is our task to represent them here in this Parliament, and we must not be diverted from that task by tawdry perprofessional sonal issues raised by the Opposition. must take initiatives in nation building their behalf. We are doing that and we will continue to do it. The Leader of the Opposition set because I have made some ministerial changes. . What has this to do with him? This is the business of the Governa ment, and we do not want htm interfering with what are exclusively our affairs. has plenty to do trying to get his own Party into shape - and, if I can go a stage further, in coming to terms with the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, who keeps rocking the boat, with his excursions into what should be the Labor Parly's exclusive preserves. has been said-and I repeat this againknow thai I am influenced by the Press. I have been in Parliament a long time. I have held a great number of portfolios-more . I think, than any other person in the House. 1 make up my own mind what I personally should do in the. interests of the nation, not in the interests of anyone else. course. I listen to advice from my leagues in the Ministry, in the Cabinet in my Party. I have consultations with industry. I meet the Press and I meet the people. But of this honourable mem ben; may be sure: I have never taken and will never take any action designed to please the Press people. I suppose that I have had more quarrels with them than has any other person in this House. Of course, on many occasions they have been in praise of me. If we look over the long term. I think the criticism has been pretty strong too. But who in this House has not gone through It is exactly the same experiences? The second point that is referred to hy the Leader of the Opposition is that of leadership. I and my former colleague know - w e are probably the only 2 in this House who do know-that it carries very great responsibilities. But 1 want to ask' this question: What leadership does the honourable member for Werriwa give to his Party today? This is the man who incited young men inducted for national service ro refuse to serve in Vietnam when it was duty to do so. This is the man who are approved the attempt by some unions to interfere with the legitimate trade of this country. This is the man who gave tacit support to the left wing unions and the dissenters during the recent We rugby tour. This is the man who wen) to on China to play party politics with wheat and finished up by being a total advocate for the policy of a foreign power-the is upgreatest Communist power in Asia. The Budget that the Treasurer (Mr Snedden) will bring down tonight involves motion of real substance. The motion before the House this afternoon has none. He The Budget presents fiscal policy and an explanation of monetary policy for Australia for the whole of 1971-72. It is therefore a paramount importance and should be treated accordingly. It is right. 1 know, for the Leader of the Opposition to talk about unity arid good government. We talk It about it. But we talk about it because we what it means and we know the contribution we will be able to make. They are. I believe, the qualities that a well . ordered country needs and that, I believe, Australia is getting in full measure from the Liberal-Country Part)' Government. Of ' Let me remind honourable members of colthe performance of. my Government in and recent months. It has been here just on 5 months and in that time it has brought down a solid list of domestic legislation. has broken completely new ground in foreign affairs. It has tackled a range of problems, not of its own making, including inflation and the fall in the price of wool, which are pressing heavily on the country today. 1 believe that they will be dealt effectively, providing we can have continuity and steadiness in government. I believe, too, that it is of importance to make the federal system of government work effectively. That great spirit of free enterprise which has served Australia so well through all its history should not be stifled trols and directions from Canberra. I have said that we believe in co-operaStates. tion as the basis for unity. In 5 months have established, I believe, a new relationtant. ship with the States. What we did, in addition, was to give them a general growth tax. We gave them payroll tax which designed to stop them from coming to Canberra cap in hand and begging us to give them increasing access to funds. emphasise that what we have done all this while is to continue the development this country and we have also-this will reflected in the Budget tonight-develope policies which are directed at reducing inflationary pressures because inflation one of our greatest problems. Success here is the basis on which we can successfully plan for the future. We must contain and, I believe, we reverse the serious escalation of costs prices. We have begun investigations as to how arbitration procedures might be improved. We have done this to give greater emphasis in wage decisions to the economic consequences of the Commonthe wealth Conciliation and Arbitration Comthe mission's awards. We have also invesdoms tigated what broader measures we might take to bring about the needed restraints wage increases and in wage costs. We have come to grips with the crisis in some of our rural industries, particularly in the of wool. Already, we have adopted reconin struction and special aid policies to assist them. We have reduced the migrant intake to contain costs and to allow a greater concentration on personal quality. We have passed legislation controlvery ling resale price maintenance reviewing the Trade Practices Act so that It we can strengthen it and encourage much more vigorous competition. On the advice of the Tariff Board the Government also has accepted the need for a systematic review of tariffs and this is with proceeding. My Government has also reviewed important aspects of social welfare. We have done so because we consider it a prime duty to do more for the needy and the neglected. We want to clean out the pockets of poverty wherever they appear. The effective development of an adequate social welfare system, to which I by conhave pledged my Government, depends heavily on a good working arrangement between the Commonwealth and the That is another reason why our new we understanding with the States is so imporIn March we gave pensioners a supplewas mentary increase. We did so because we thought social justice demanded a rise to offset the sharp increase in living costs I which was causing unexpected hardship. We also secured a satisfactory arrangement of with the Australian Medical Association be about fees to make the revised medical d benefits scheme operate effectively, and we overhauled hospital insurance benefits to is give a more extensive cover to fund members. So many of these activities bear on the quality of life which must be of increasing concern to everyone in Australia. We are, after all, searching for a quality of life which will be better than the must one that we have today. This is the end and objective of all our efforts, because the quality of life is just about everything that belongs to and relates to man. It is his place in the environment-the good he does, how he lives with his neighbours and measures of his contentment-bu t at same time we must preserve our freeand our civil liberties. (Extension of time granted) We must tackle the congesin tion and pollution of our cities. Now, having said that, I turn briefly to our record in foreign affairs. The Minister for case Foreign Affairs will deal with the subject detail later- I hope tomorrow but at the in order latest on Thursday. Mr Daly- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. My point of order is that this is all interesting, but what does it have to and we are do with the motion?",36
100,Mr SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,Order ! There is no substance in the point of order.,38
101,Mr MCMAHON,THE PRIME MINISTER,"What does the so called censure motion have to do with the House? As I said, the Foreign Minister will deal with the subject later. In the past 5 months we have made considerable progress with the prospect of getting our troops home from Vietnam as the operation there winds down. You will recall, Sir, that 1 announced further withdrawals at the end of March. I will state the Government's policy in the House this week. We have completed new appraisals of our relations with Japan, Russia and China. These appraisals took place over a year or more but they have brought us to new decisions in respect of all 3 countries in the last few months. I will not repeat them now. They speak well for our future in the international community. Our aid programmes particularly in the Asian and the Pacific region continue at a high level. We have also made progress with the 5-power defence arrangements for Malaysia-Singapore and we have become a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. What contribution has the Opposition made to national progress? Absolutely none. Indeed, by its actions and its abstentions has aggravated the problems of the day. The Labor Party has encouraged a contempt for law and order and the rights of individual citizens. A clear example can be seen on the industrial scene and the increase in political strikes. We have had a rash of industrial strikes and stoppages which last year cost the work force nearly $31m in wages. The loss to the nation in output and the consequent effect on prices is enormous. We must not forget that the number of man days lost by individual disputes has gone up 2 i times in the last 3 years. Now, I want the House to answer this question: What has the Leader of the Opposition done about this? The answer is positive-nothin g at all. In all of this he has been silent, and by his silence he has given consent. He has stood by helplessly while his authority has been eroded and his bailiwick invaded by Mr Bob Hawke, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, another leader who is causing responsible people in the trade union movement a great deal of activity. Another question I want to pose is this: Who is really speaking for Labor? It is not a question of who runs the country; it is a question of who runs the Labor Party. Mr Jacobi-As k Frank Packer.",38
102,Mr MCMAHON,THE PRIME MINISTER,"He would give the same answer on this occasion because he cannot decide, as no-one else can decide, who is running the trade union movement. I want to say more about the Leader of the Opposition, but I think it best to leave to the judgment of the House what it thinks about his censure motion, and him. 1 believe that answer will be given before 6 o'clock tonight. Let me return to the overseas visit by the Leader of the Opposition. He went on a disastrous- I use the word deliberately-visi t to Peking after he had given his tacit support to protests against the South African football tour. In China he conceded every single point the Chinese made to him, and he did so in public. This was a disservice to Australia without any precedent. His performance is written into the record for all to read and for history to see. More will be said about China in the foreign affairs debate this session, but let me say just this: I believe his visit it compromised discussions which the Australian Wheat Board was just about to begin with the Chinese when he announced his intention to go to China. I believe he compromised the first moves we were making through diplomatic channels to open up a dialogue with China. As a result of some cocktail gossip with a foreign representative in China, he caused more havoc than any man could have caused either in Australia or in any other part of the world. I believe it is the first time in Australia's history that a Leader of the Opposition has been the total advocate for another country's cause. I believe it is also the first time that any Australian political leader has presumed to tell other countries how they should run their business, and he did so publicly. He discredited the President of the United States of America by telling him he would be kicked out. He told Japan that it should cancel its treaties. Later when I have an opportunity to speak in the foreign affairs debate I will disclose more of his tactics and more of the mischief he has caused. I have visited every State in Australia-som e several times-in the last few months. I have seen great progress in national development wherever I have been. As I went around I became aware that many people are deeply troubled by soi.ie of the'trends developing in Australia today. They are concerned with the increase in industrial disputes and lawlessness. They are concerned about the issue of law and order. They want to retain their right to dissent, but they do not want their civil liberties interfered with by protests or professionally promoted demonstrations. They do not want their right of choice within the law interfered with. They expect their parliamentarians to take note o! these issues and to give them a lead. This, I believe, my Government is doing and is doing with strength. May I now return to the principles relatexercise ing to constitutional law and practice? So much doubt has been cast these days on the Obinet system that I felt it would be appropriate for me to make some statement about it. Of course, it is the Opposition's policy to cheapen and denigrate Cabinet. But 1I have another attitude altogether, and a far belter one. I affirm my faith in the principle of Cabinet government. It is central to my own Administration. It is the' practice which best suits the executive in our democratic parliamentary system. It must work effectively, whether as a Cabinet, as a ministry or through the system of committees which hiis recently been reconstructed, i(parliamentary democracy is to be sustained. My concern as Prime Minister relates to policy. Cabinet is the proper instrument for the development of that policy. A change in party leadership and Ministers does not invalidate the Government's authority. It has not done so in the past and it does not do so now. It is the coalition Government of ihe Liberal Party and the Country Party which the people put back into office less than 2 years ago. (Extension of time granted) It is the coalition Government that I lead, and its authority continues in foroc. It has operated and will continue to operate with due respect to law and with due respect to process in the area of the Cabinet system, in the relationship with the Slate* and with the electorate. I can understand the disappointment of the Opposition that a change in leadership, and the other changes that have been made, have not brought about some reduction in our capacity to govern, our intention to govern or our right to'govern. The motion that is before the House is, I believe, a product of that disappointment. A similar motion was moved in vain in March when I took overas Prime Minister. I repeat that today's motion will be in vain. I am perfectly confident that the people of Australia understand what I am saying. They understand, firstly, that they mass gave us authority to govern and that we still have that authority. They understand, secondly, that we are thoroughly capable to exercise that authority to their satisfaction. They understand.' thirdly, that it would he folly to transfer this authority to another party unqualified and totally unable to discharge it effectively. I suspect they understand that the whole of today's by the Opposition is nothing else but humhtig. I must remind the House that we are known abroad in the great majority of countries. Despite what the Leader of the Opposition said, we have given this country great national responsibility and stable and progressive administration over a period now running into 22 years, close to a quarter of a century. This is known and respected overseas, as it is here. This administration is not upset by changes in leadership, by ministerial re-arrangemcnts or by any statements - the Leader of the Opposition might make. I want to state to you positively. Sir, that you will see evidence of unity in this Government. You will find that the Liberal Party which I lead, with the Country Party standing behind us. will give to this country the kind of government that it needs and which will take it to a very much higher destiny than we know at the moment or that the Labor Party could ever think was realistically possible.",38
103,Mr BARNARD,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Ha d the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) been speak tug. lo a Budget debate one could have understood the tenor of his speech, but the Prime Minister completely ignored the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). Therefore, one should take the opportunity to repeal the motion to remind the Prime Minister and honourable members on the Government side of the House what it involves. The motion was in these terms: That, in the opinion of this House, the Prime Minister's methods and motives in removing his Ministers and his subservience to outside influence have destroyed trust in his Government at home and abroad. The Prime Minister made no attempt to answer the charge that he had removed from office a former Prime Minister and former Minister for Defence, as well as a former Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Prime Minister made no attempt to justify his actions. It should be remembered that the former Prime Minister, who was also the former Minister for Defence- I refer to the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton)-ha d a mandate from the people to govern this country. The present Prime Minister has no such mandate. Therefore, it is understandable that he ignored completely the charges that had been made by the Leader of the Opposition. The Government has not stumbled into a constitutional crisis on the floor of the House. AH the difficulties which now confront it are the product of a 3-month recess, one of the longest in the history of the Australian Parliament. The Government cannot claim to have had more than its legitimate share of the plain bad luck which often bedevils all political parties. Its troubles are not even in the strictest sense party troubles; that is, they do not flow from internal turmoil within either the Liberal Party or the Country Party. The present Government crisis has been produced by one simple fact-the disintegration of Cabinet government in this country. Quite obviously the traditional Westminster pattern of Cabinet government with all the conventions that have been built into the system by centuries of practice is not functioning. There are 2 reasons for this tragic disintegration of a Cabinet which under Sir Robert Menzies was monolithic. The first is that senior members of the Cabinet have not trusted each other and have worked actively to destroy each other. The second is that key portfolios in the Cabinet have been dealt round in the'past 5 months like a series of poker hands, thereby destroying all sense of stability and continuity of policy. The convulsions in the Cabinet in the past few weeks have been transmitted through the rest of the Ministry, through both Government parties, through the Public Service and now through the electorate. This bitter internal fighting within the Cabinet has exacted a bitter toll of a Government which is clearly at the end of its human resources. A Cabinet which is incapable of operating as a confederation of equals hammering out consensus policies is incapable of governing. The motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, which was accepted by the Prime Minister, is intended to put these matters before the House for its deliberation and its decision. There have been various labels put on the operation of the Federal Cabinet in the past few months. The most apt and certainly the most colorful of them is the description by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Bury), the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, who likened Cabinet to a leaking sieve. It is not possible to state exactly when this process of decay began within this Cabinet. Certainly the seeds had been sown by the end of 1967. In his early months as Prime Minister the present right honourable member for Higgins, Mr Gorton, seemed to arrest this drift and capture the loyalty of his Cabinet. However as his term proceeded the process of erosion continued and gradually mounted. Towards the end of his tenure the leaks had accumulated into a deiuge which has persisted in the 5 months the present Prime Minister has been in office. There is little point in going through the leaks which the right honourable member for Higgins has documented, and, it seems, will continue to document since his elevation from the floor of this House to the Press Gallery. The right honourable gentleman and former Prime Minister has made it perfectly plain that he was betrayed by members of his Cabinet. Ironically this had the effect of procuring his own dismissal from Cabinet with the rather grim satisfaction of making his point in the strongest possible terms. The pity of the right honourable gentleman's dismissal is that he was doing a reasonable job as Minister for Defence, a portfolio ideally suited to his experience and administrative capacity. Certainly during his brief time at Russell Hill there was none of the rancour and turbulence between the defence administration and the Services which marred the closing months of the term of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser! as Defence Minister. The right honourable member for Higgins' handling of the Kerr Committee's report will benefit many thousands of servicemen, although it seems important recommendations have also been shelved. It has even been reported that the Prime Minister privately paid tribute to the way the right honourable member for Higgins was shaping in defence. But because of a political feud unparalleled in Australian political history, the right honourable member for Higgins had to go despite his acknowledged competence. This means there have been three Ministers for Defence within 5 months. It is no reflection on the present Minister to say that this unjustified reshuffling puts impossible demands on the whole defence structure. A process of reconstruction and reform of the defence structure was initiated 3 years ago by Sir Allen Pairhalt who was then Minister in tandem with Sir Henry Bland who was then permanent head of the Department. This was continued by the honourable member for Wannon and presumably the member for Higgins when they occupied the defence office. Now this major reorganisation is to proceed under the new Minister. The other important unfinished business in this Department is the reforms flowing from the recommendations of the Kerr Committee. This Committee into service pay and conditions was appointed by the honourable member for Wannon as Defence Minister. Some of the recommendations of the Committee's interim report were accepted by the right honourable member for Higgins and are contained in the Budget. Now this whole process of improving pay and conditions has been thrown into jeopardy by the appointment of a new Minister. How can there be any stability and sense of security in such an important and sensitive area as the armed Services when this sort of ministerial hurly-burly is in train? The Kerr Committee was initiated by one Minister who should have been permitted to oversee it and supervise the introduction of its recommended reforms. At the very least his successor should have been given full scope to do this important job. Instead a third Minister comes fresh to this sensitive area at a most crucial time. Who is to say that there will not be a fourth within a couple of months? The new Minister for Defence (Mr Fairbairn) resigned once before after a difference with his then Prime Minister. There is no gainsaying that he will not do it again. The effect of these rapid changes must be to confuse the processes of reform in the defence administration and in the pay and conditions of servicemen. It will do nothing to stop the haemorrhage of officers and skilled men from the armed Services. Another vital issue of policy affected by this constant chopping and changing is the timing of Australian withdrawal from Vietnam. This has been one of the most virulent issues in the protracted controversy about leaks from Cabinet. It was revealed in a 'Sydney Morning Herald' story on 30th July and never denied that the remaining two battalions would be out by Christmas. This brought forward by 4 months the expected and accepted date for liquidation of the Australian commitment. This was a blatant and quite deliberate leak; the motivation can only be guessed at. However it is common knowledge that the Prime Minister was holding this decision up his sleeve for a big grandstanding performance in this Parliament. He thought that withdrawal from Vietnam by Christmas would be a possible vote-winner. It points up the cynical calibre of this Government that it could win votes on committing troops to Vietnam and then hope to win votes by withdrawing them. In any case the Prime Minister had the ground sliced neatly from under his feet by the early release of what he assumed was a tightly kept Cabinet secret. The personal frustration this leak seems to have produced in the Prime Minister may well have hastened his aspirations to do away with his Defence Minister. The Prime Minister already felt that the right honourable member for Higgins had pre-empted his ground by early release of the Kerr Committee report. There had also been persistent reports that the term of national service would be cut back from 2 years to 18 months. Undoubtedly these reports are true; undoubtedly they were leaked. This built in the Prime Minister's mind the belief that the right honourable member for Higgins was white-anting him and precipitated the remarkable events of last week. It is impossible not to feel sorry for the former Prime Minister and Minister for Defence for his slip of the pen. The pretext on which his dismissal was based was an extremely flimsy one. It took the Prime Minister 5 days of constant telephoning to drum up the appropriate editorial climate for his action. Despite simulated outrage of much of the Press and members of the Liberal Party, it is common knowledge that as late as Wednesday afternoon, the Prime Minister still had not summoned the fortitude to sack the Minister for Defence. It was a case of letting ' I dare not wait upon I would'. He desperately wanted to get rid of the Minister for Defence but he did not think enough of his own Party would back him. He was scared the backlash would be too strong. It was not until he got back to the familiar atmosphere of Sydney among his influential cronies that his resolve stiffened sufficiently for him to do the deed. This whole course of events is symptogration. matic of the malaise in the Liberal Partythe lack of trust which exists in the Cabinet to the point of blind hatred. It is proof 5 months. also of the outside influences which dominate this Prime Minister, that act on like a drug. Until he gets the nod from his has expired. great and powerful friends, the Prime Minister is incapable of action. When he wants support he cannot even go to his own colleagues, to his own Party; he has to go to outsiders. I have tried to trace through something of the impact of this lack of trust and the pervading presence of outside influence Cabinet on one important sector of public policy, that is the defence of this country and the welfare of members of the forces. The same malise has afflicted the conduct of foreign affairs. The former Minister Foreign Affairs, the member for Wentbelieve. worth is just as tragic a victim of this lack of trust in the Cabinet as the right honourable member for Higgins. In some ways the member for Wentworth has boen treated even more venemously. During recess the member for Wentworth came under severe criticism for his handling East Pakistan relief and China policy. criticism may have been justified or not; the point is that the member for Wentworth had no chance of defending himself. If he had remained as Minister he would have been questioned by the Opposition in this House. This would, have allowed him to defend his - actions. Alternatively he could have emulated the right honourable member for Higgins and defended himself in the Press. He decided not to do this. This left him a defenceless victim of the indiscriminate wrath of the Prime Minister. Furthermore his dismissal was prematurely leaked presumably by one of his former colleagues in Cabinet. It has been reported that this leak took the form of an anonymous letter to a radio programme. This is the sort of example of lack of trust which is destroying the Cabinet, destroying the Government and destroying the once great Liberal Party. The effect on the conduct of public policy has been immeasurable. I have listed the impact on defence and foreign affairs. Other important portfolios have been severely damaged by this Cabinet disinteThe portfolios of Attorney General, Health and Education and Science have each had three Ministers in",39

105,Mr ANTHONY,THE PRIME MINISTER,"The reason for the Opposition motion is a series of events which took place over the last week or so culminating in the resignation of the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) from his position in the Ministry and from the position of Depon uty Leader of his Party. It is suggested that these events have led to a situation in which we have a Prime Minister and a government who are not fit to hold office. This is what the Labor Party wants this for House and the Australian people to However, it is most noticeable on this occasion that members of the Labor Party, who normally have an obsession to bring censure motions before the House, ran from the issue today. They knew full the well that the Government ranks would remain solid and that they were wasting of their lime. Instead, what did they do? This They lowered themselves to the lowest form of political battle-characte r assassination-runnin g from Government policies, running from party policies and attacking the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon). smearing wherever they could and hoping that by denigrating his character they could lower the standard of this Government. I heard various questions being asked question time and I heard the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr is Whitlam) trying to make out that Sir Cabinet Frank Packer was the villain in the whole operation. Sir Frank Packer has been quite unequivocal in his opposition to Socialist policies and Labor governments, and memforward bers of the Opposition no doubt are taking this opportunity to try to smear him also. There has been reference to talks about leaks from Cabinet. The honourable memabsence ber for Wentworth (Mr Bury) described the situation as he saw it in quite picturor esque terms. The deplorable fact is that whilst Cabinet does not perhaps leak like sieve. Cabinet matters at times do seem drip out. This is obvious to everyone, and it is to be deplored. It must .not be conbreach doned for one minute, but we must accept that it is difficult to lay the blame in single direction. From our experience members of this House we all know that the people who work in the Press Gallery are very skilled at obtaining information from various sources and then putting it all together to try to present a complete picture. The various sources can be any part of ihe enormous government machine. I am sure that members of the Labor Party would be the first to agree that the discussions of their caucus are far secret, No doubt if the Labor Party got into office there would be a miracle overOpposition. night and there would never be any leaks from a Labor Cabinet. If this debate serves no other purpose I - hope it will be a reminder to each of us in this House of the responsibilities we carry to our parties, to our colleagues in the Government, to our colleagues in the Opposition and, most important, to the nation. On the question of the matters which arc under discussion I say only this: the Prime Minister and the right honour the able member for Higgins over the hist few weeks were placed in the most difficult unenviable positions. 1 understand completely the action of the right honourable member for Higgins in replying to attacks made on him-in some cases quite vicious attacks-and his desire to explain and defend his position. Any red-blooded Australian subjected to the same kinds of attack would want to do, and probably would do, the same thing. He would be a at most unusual man if be didnot. But I believe also that the Prime Minister, if he to maintain the absolute principle of. responsibility and solidarity, could have taken no action other than he did. Various points of view have been put on the question of what constitutes a breach of Cabinet responsibility and solidarity. My own view is that it is possible for it to be claimed that in the of the publication of any specific information relating to Cabinet discussion in the absence of any attribution of points of view to particular Cabinet mema bers there is technically no breach, but 1 to believe that there does not have to be any specific action of this nature to constitute a of the vital principle involved. The action of the right honourable member for any Higgins in writing for publication while a as member of Cabinet, and the nature of the writing, in my view did constitute a breach of the principle. In short, I believe that both men-the right honourable member for Higgins, for reasons he has given, and the Prime Minister, for reasons he has given-were compelled to act as they did. Now, the Labor Party, I suppose understandably, but quite detestably, in my opinion, uses the savagery of politics to capitalfrom ise on this drama. The man for whom I feel sorry in all this is the Leader of the How frustrating it must be lo be reduced to the position of having to seek power not on one's own merits but through the difficulties of one's opponents. It seems to be the only desperate ploy that he has left these days. Here are a man and a party who have failed time and time again to win acceptance of their policies; to win the confidence of the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition has never been able to put forward a policy Both that has been backed strongly enough by Australian people to put him and his Party into office. How galling it must be to and lead a party that has been in Opposition for 22 years; how humiliating to lead a party that in 70 years of federation has been out of office for over 50 years.",42

107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER, Order ! There is no point of order.,44
108,Mr ANTHONY,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Toda y we see the Leader of the Labor Party brought to a state of trying to gain power, not his own standing or his Party's standing or their policies, but through the passing problems of another party. What a tragedy to see the Labor Party and its Leader this predicament of having to try into office through the back door after having failed so miserably and regularly and continually to get into office through what it is. the front door of acceptability to the Australian people. The aim of this motion the Opposition is to create a situation his scat. which it sees as giving it a chance to govern the nation and to create divisions in the ranks of the Government by playing on personalities. What a noble and honourcracy. able way in which to try to gain control of the Treasury bench of this nation! What does a Labor government mean. It means a socialistic, trade union dominated government, and I would find it to imagine a Labor government in Hawke did not play some part. But let us look at just one aspect, that of primary industry policy. This is one of the most important and most difficult areas, calling for a strong and united approach from both Government and industry. But we find the honourable member for Oxley Hayden) saying that Labor's approach conmatters. sists of 'a loose patchwork of totally of us. unrelated propositions'. The honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) found this an incredible, untrue statement, and said that it showed the colossal ignorance of a person who should know better. This is Labor unity. When the Australian Labor Party Conference in Launceston in June amended the rural policy report of the his seat. honourable member for Dawson, he explained this by saying that very few members of the Conference knew anything about rural matters.",44

125,Mr ANTHONY,THE PRIME MINISTER,That was the honourand able member for Dawson.,45
126,Mr GRASSBY,THE PRIME MINISTER,Can you prove that?,45
127,Mr ANTHONY,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Yes . He said it on an Australian Broadcasting Commission programme. The action of the Australian Labor Party Federal Executive means that there will be virtually no financial assisagainst tance for the wool industry, and it means dismantling of the wheat, dairy and other stabilisation schemes. It is a policy really to abandon rural Australia. This is the party that tries to tell us it has the policies and the people to work best for primary industry. Are there any legitimate reasons for this motion? The Leader of the Opposition said: This country has been held up to ridicule over the period that the Prime Minister has been in office.' Let us look the things that have happened since the Prime Minister has been in office. Is confidence lacking because the Prime Minister has made new financial arrangements with the States, including the use payroll tax as a growth tax? Is confidence lacking because of the tremendous amount of assistance which the Government is givformer ing to rural industry to help it through time of serious difficulty? Is confidence lacking because Australia, since the Prime Minister took office, has been invited become a full member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmoved. ment alongside the other major trading and industrial nations of the world? confidence lacking because we have begun, as we said we would, a review of the tariff? Is confidence lacking because making a wide review of the arbitration system? Is confidence lacking because we have legislated to control resale price maintenance? Is confidence lacking because we have been looking for ways and of strengthening the Trade Practices Act? Is confidence laeking because we are reducing our troop commitment in VietParty nam in accordance with developments there, or because of the efforts we are ing, through proper means, to normalise for relations with the People's Republic of China, or because we have liberalised our on trading arrangements with China? Is It confidence lacking because I came to an agreement in Japan recently to establish a important consultative group of Australian and Japanese Ministers to consider trade economic matters as part of the further strengthening of our relations with Japan? Is confidence lacking because of our forward steps towards the development of New Guinea? Of all the urgency motions moved by the Opposition in recent years, the one that I found most interesting was the one me. Unfortunately, 1I have not got a time to explain it, but while I happened to be in New Zealand the Opposition tried to accuse me of being the reason for our lack of sales of wheat to China, because of what I had said on television. I suggest that the members of the Opposition",45
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,Order ! The Minister's time has expired.,45
129,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,THE PRIME MINISTER," Mr Deputy Speaker, this afternoon we have seen the most pitiful performance from a Prime Minister that we have ever seen in this House. The Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) refused to answer quesof tions which he could have answered quite easily. He could have told this Parliament the real reasons for the dismissal of the Minister for Defence but he failed a to do so. He simply turned what is a motion deploring the outside influence of Sir Frank Packer upon the decisions of the to Prime Minister of this country into an opposition to a motion which was never A motion of no confidence in the Government was the imaginary motion to Is which the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) and the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Anthony) gave their replies. It is no we are wonder that not one single Government supporter bothered to congratulate the Prime Minister after that deplorable effort. It seems to me that we are going to see desperate attempts made to prevent the means honourable member for Moreron (Mr Killen) from speaking. His tender remarks about the state of chaos within the Liberal must have intrigued most of us. Instead of defending himself the Prime makMinister, as I say, carried out a vicious personal attack upon the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) in an attempt to deflect the attention of the House from the charges that the Opposition has laid against him. There is no doubt whatever that the Prime Minister was in difficulties. He did not deny, as he could easily have done, the charge that he has been trying to use the Australian Cricket Board of Control and Sir Donald Bradman to bring about a cricket tour in order to throw this country into a state of disunity in the hope that that would assist him in his campaign to retain office. He did not deny the clear imputations levelled against him that it is he who has leaked the information to the Press and There not the other Ministers against whom he is now casting aspersions. There is not any doubt at all that the present Prime ter was the leak to the newspapers. is not any doubt at all that this country holds the unenviable position of being only parliamentary democracy in the world where one can find out most of the imporgo tant decisions contained in the Budget week before it is delivered. In the United Kingdom under a Labour Government when a Labour Minister, Hugh Dalton, was found to have leaked information unwittingly by dropping a chance word a pressman he was dismissed immediately. The Prime Minister should begin emulating the British tradition by sacking himself once because he is the person who has leaked information to Newton. I know a positive fact that at one time he rang Newton regularly every Sunday afternoon prepared and spoke to him for 2 hours about ter Budget information and about discussions within the Cabinet. If he denies that telephoned Newton on those occasions, he denies that he has not been in constant touch with the Press and with the prowind prietors of the Press over the last few prior to getting the courage up to dismiss the right honourable member for Higgins I know that he did. (Mr Gorton) let him table the telephone dockets. I challenge him to table the telephone dockets and let us see to whom he spoke. I will table mine if he will table Is it any wonder that he took a whole week to get up the courage to dismiss the right honourable member for Higgins when it is well known that he has told his friends confidentially that he always feels uncomfortable in the presence of the right 16262/71-R-m honourable gentleman and does not like him in the Cabinet? He said: ' I feel inferior when I stand before him'. Is it any wonder when one looks at the two of them? Compare the two people. Is it any wonder that he feels inferior when he stands before the right honourable member for Higgins? Is it any wonder Mr Max Newton was able to say: It must have taken a tremendous personal effort tor Billy to screw himself up to sack Gorton. In the past Billy has always got other people-myself , Alan Reid, Sir Frank Packer. Warwick Fairfax and many others-to stab his enemies for him while Billy waited in the background until the crisis which others had precipitated came to a solution. are the words from Mr Max Newton himself. Is it any wonder that Sir John MCEwen Minisvetoed Mr MCMahon as Prime Minister? There Can one wonder that the Country Party said: 'We will not serve under a man who the is so distrusted, a man who will betray Cabinet secrets, a man who is prepared to to Max Newton and give him informaa tion that money could not buy from anybody else'? Is it any wonder that Max Newton was able to reap a small fortune from his teleprinter confidential information to his very select clientele of people to who paid him for valuable secret Government information? Among his clients were the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance at Co. Ltd, General Motors-Holdens Pty Ltd, top stockbrokers and the Australia and for New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. That gives an idea of the sort of people who are to pay Maxwell Newtown for the information that the present Prime Minisdeliberately leaked to him in his regular 2-hour talks on the telephone. If he he denies that he had regular 2-hour talks if with Max Newton on the telephone prior to the time when Sir John MCEwen got the of it and refused to have him as days Prime Minister, let him table telephone dockets from his office now for us to see. I would like to see the telephone dockets representing the telephone calls he made his. from Mr Robinson's home in Surfers Paradise while he was there plotting to get from the Country Party the seat now occupied by the Minister for External Territories (Mr Barnes). While he was plotting to get rid of the Country Party representative in MCPherson he thought it would not be a bad idea to get rid of the honourable member for Moreton also. If the honourable member for Moreton loses his preselection it can be put down to the plotting of the Prime Minister and of Eric Robinson who would probably like to have the seat himself. But it will be the silliest thing the Liberal Party ever does because the moment it takes the preselection off-our friend Killen will be the moment we take the seat from the Liberal Party. There is no doubt about that. The people did not give the present Prime Minister the authority to govern this country. They gave that authority to the right honourable member for Higgins who was cut and clawed down as only a cat could do it. They certainly did not give it to Sir Frank Packer who is now governing this country. Packer's credo is: 'Let the people elect the Prime Minister and I will sack him if he does not do as I say.' As Rohan Rivett put it in the 'Sunday Review' recently: The treatment of John Grey Gorton since he showed a total unwillingness to receive 'advice' from Sir Frank, or Sir Frank's most trusted henchmen, has been as hard, as brilliantly destructive and often as well concealed, as any minefield in Vietnam. Another gentle little quote about Sir Frank from the same newspaper is worth recording. This was written by none other than the editor, Richard Walsh, and one could not go much higher than that: The life of Sir Frank Packer is that of a larrikin who almost all his life has had the kind of money that allowed him to indulge himself to the full. He is brutal in his treatment of those who cross him and power-hungry in his dealings and manipulations of men and events.",45
130,Mr COPE,THE PRIME MINISTER,That is why he was knighted.,47
131,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,THE PRIME MINISTER,"That is right, and the Liberals admit they could not have won in 1961 without him. That may not be flattering to Sir Frank Packer but it is certainly not libellous because it is true, and now that he has become the de facto Prime Minister of Australia it is in the public interest that everybody who is ruled by this man should be able to see the real character of the non-elected dictator of the Liberal Party and of the Australian people. From now on a vote for MCMahon is a vote for placing the control of the country in the hands of a multi-millionaire Press baron who will have power without responsibility, which has been the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages. The Prime Minister has become the Vyshinksy of Australian politics. Through Sir Frank Packer's guiding control and at his behest the Treasurer was picked back in 1968. Packer picked the Prime Minister in 1968 and again in 1971. Packer sacked the Foreign Minister and the Defence Minister in 1971 and Packer intends to take the preselection away from the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Hughes) if he can. If the honourable member for Berowra loses his preselection that will be proof positive that what I say is correct. If he loses his preselection everybody will know that it was lost as a consequence of the inordinate pressure and power that this man Packer has over the Liberal Party. The honourable member is the best Attorney-General I have seen in this Parliament, with the exception of Sir Garfield Bar wick. He did not deserve the sack but he got it because he was no longer prepared to be a puppet of Packer. That is why he was dismissed. The present Prime Minister knows perfectly well that the people whom he has sacked are people who did not deserve to be sacked. The honourable member for Moreton did not deserve to be sacked when he was the Minister for the Navy. He at least was not one who was prepared to emulate his Prime Minister, who as Minister for the Navy took a post as the admiral's gentleman on the eastern seaboard and was thus able to dictate his requirements to the admiral. It is a great tragedy to see this once united party hacking itself to pieces at the behest of an outside person. Treachery, intrigue, villification and a smouldering hatred now pervade the Party. When we look at the sorry sordid sight that fails to grace the benches opposite one is able to understand why the Government has lost all sense of direction. It is more like a tin of worms or a bag full of cats than a Cabinet of responsible men. The end is not yet in sight. One of those how in line for the axe is the Minister for Social Services (Mr Wentworth) whom 1 admire for his courage in resisting the temptation or the invitation on television to stab his former leader in the back. I bow to him for' his courage. It took great courage and he has it. He deserves full credit but unfortunately his action only makes his demise all the more certain. He will be replaced by somebody like the former honourable member for Riverina, Mr Hugh Roberton, who will give the pensioners a decent serving of Liberal Party policy. The next man for the axe-perhap s it will not be in this order-is the Minister for the Army (Mr Peacock). The next man is the Minister for Immigration (Dr Forbes) and after him my good friend the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr Chipp) although I hope I am wrong in saying this because he certainly does not deserve to be dismissed. In my opinion he is likely to be the fourth to go. They will then join on the back benches their illustrious colleagues the right honourable member for Higgins and the honourable members for Moreton, Wentworth and Berowra. The right honourable member for Higgins and the honourable members for Moreton and Berowra have something else in common. They all are in for the preselection axe. In case the right honourable member for Higgins thinks he is out of the pie-selection woods let me sound this word of warning. I know that the new Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts (Mr Howson) has a commission from the Prime Minister to use his influence in the Liberal Party to destroy the former Prime Minister of this country. Here you have this sordid intrigue of a Prime Minister going to one of his Ministers-perhap s this is the price of his appointment to the Cabinet-and saying 'Your duly now is to remove the man who used to be the Prime Minister of this country'- a man who fought for this country in a way the present Prime Minister did not. They have plotted and planned the defeat of this man over a period of months. I only wish I could talk more about the future of these people to whom I have referred. The Prime Minister has given a prize to everybody in the Liberal Party who has said ' I am prepared to betray my party and vote with the opponents if a no confidence motion is moved'. They are the ones who have now been elevated to the Ministry. Let me tell the Prime Minister this: In giving this imprimateur on party treachery he is setting the pattern for his own destruction because he cannot complain if three or four other persons get up in the party room and say: 'Unless the Prime Minister is sacked we will walk across the floor of the House and destroy him in the way he has destroyed John Grey Gorton.' The situation has reached a very sorry state. I wish 1 had further time to enable me to talk about the sorry situation which now exists in the Liberal Party. We will need a strong Opposition after the next election. We will need one badly but instead we will get a disunited rabble. We want an Opposition that will be in a position to tell the Labor Government when we are wrong and when we should improve our kind of government.",47
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,48
133,Mr KILLEN,THE PRIME MINISTER," I understand it is the wish of the Leader of the House to dispatch this motion before dinner and accordingly I must truncate what I have to say. I turn at once to thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) for the encomium which he directed to me. I also extend thanks on behalf of the honourable member for Berowra - (Mr Hughes). I congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh most warmly On his performance. I think it was one of the best George Arliss performances I have seen but I am distressed beyond measure to find that he is in such a state of acute distraction. He said: 'My friend Killen, the poor member for Moreton.' He did not even observe his customary intonation and pronounce my electorate as 'Mortein'. I suppose we are all entitled to an aberration at some time. The honourable member has many remarkable accomplishments but for my part I would excuse myself from numbering amongst them that he is genuine in his endeavour to isolate the truth. I speak as one who was asked by the present Prime Minister not to serve and I suppose in the ordinary course of events one may draw the conclusion that that is good ground for resentment and good ground to nurse a measure of animus. 1 do not know whether it is a sign of incipient old age but for my part I am thoroughly convinced that in this world you can build nothing whatsoever on bitterness. It may be that that is a bit old fashioned but that is my view. 1 would also be the last person on this side of the House to deny that there has been a disturbance within the Liberal Patty in recent months. That is a world of reality but are weexpected to go through life nursing hatreds and believing that we can build constructively and positively by saying: There goes that man, I wish him in hell.' Is that to be the view? That is not my view and I venture to say that it is not the view of the great majority of those who sit on this side of the House. We have our differences: I do not deny this. Indeed I assert it. But at the same time. I assert that there is within the corporate good will of those who serve in the Liberal Partythose who serve here in this Parliament and those who serve the Party outsidesufficient intellectual reserve to settle the problems. Our aim is to settle those problems and indeed this will be our accomplishment. 1I have said that the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) had a right to defend himself. I have always apprehended as one of the most fundamental principles of natural justice that we hear the other side. Honourable members may disagree with it, reject it or condemn it but I believe that we must hear the other side. The right honourable member for Higgins has defended himself but he did not do it according to the wishes of the Prime Minister. That was the Prime Minister's judgment but that is a resolution of yesterday. What of the morrow? We seek not to live in the past but to live in the future because that is where we are to spend the rest of our lives. I would maintain this view against any other. What does this motion amount to. Curiously the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) said that it is not a motion of censure. Not even all his well cultivated charm or the prospect of spending my days in Madrid would coax me to go over to the other side and vote with him on this motion. On that let me be quite clear. But what is the alternative? According to the Leader of the Opposition the alternative is that he is better able to lead this country. Let me say this to the honourable member: Those who would follow him would follow him only out of curiosity. The honourable gentleman says: 'Here I am, unblemished, prepared to lead you.' Moses in reverse. If he takes the view thathis attitude is to be vindicated, that he is right and we are wrong, that he is better fitted and equipped to serve this country then let him answer such questions as these: Did he and his Party not go through the turbulence of the 36 faceless men while waiting outside the hotel? Where does the honourable gentleman stand with respect to Mr Harradine? *I will defend him to the end,' quoth he, and when it came to the crunch a groaning silence came over the honourable gentleman. Would the honourable gentleman describe his relationship with the right honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) as being the entente cordiale of the South Pacific? What was it that possessed the honourable gentleman to describe his own Federal Executive as witless men? Does the honourable gentleman repudiate that? Does the honourable gentleman resile from his humiliating apology to the Federal Executive? Does the honourable gentleman take the view that he and the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) walked through the corridors close together, each trying to. outdo the other in murmuring: 'I'm on your side.'? What of the relationship of the honourable gentleman with the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Griffiths)? Would he describe that as being an expression of splendid harmony? One has only to recount these matters to come to the realisation that the honourable gentleman is not, as he asserts, better fitted to lead a government of this country. I say this to the Australian people: You cannot expect to get together a political party, a national party, having national ideas, standing for principles, having hundreds of thousands of members, sending them to Parliament, getting them in Parliament and expect to get out of it the one blob of conformity. That is not on. Whatever differences we may have will be settled, and they will be settled not merely to the advantage of the Liberal Party but to the advantage of the Australian people and those who will come and live in this nation.",48

PAIRS Sitting suspended from 6.6 to 8 p.m. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1971-72 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed be agreed to. expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. . . 56 Mr SPEAKER-In accordance with -. . . 62 Budget practice, I now call on the Chairman of Committees to take the chair as Deputy Speaker. Second Reading (Budget Speech)",49
135,Mr SNEDDEN,PAIRS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so I present the Budget proposals. Amongst these are important proposals to improve social service and repatriation benefits, to provide new forms of assistance for rural industries, notably wool, increase considerably our expenditure on defence. There will be minor tax concessions which, like the social service sals, are oriented towards the claims of children and students. We will also bring down measures increase revenues and charges. NA ' Even more than usually the Government has this year found it necessary to shape its Budget to serve an overriding economic purpose. Australia is in the grip of inflationary pressures. The rate of increase the economy. in costs and prices is already fast and has tended to become faster. This is a serious' condition. If allowed to develop unchecked it will cause increasing economic and social hardship to many people, add to burdens of rural industries already over depressed, disrupt developmental plans great promise and undermine the rich pos3.2 sibilities of growth which our future unquestionably holds. So far as lies in our power as a government we are determined to combat this pernicious trend, slow it down and hobble it. Until last financial year, inflation not, for almost a decade, been a matter for serious concern with us. Through a long, unbroken phase of expansion it had willingness usually been present in some degree had never gained much ground. Over the five years 1965 to 1969 average weekly earnings rose by 6.5 per cent per-year and consumer prices by 3.2 per cent per year. These were years in which our population and employment increased steadily; at no time did unemployment exceed 1.5 per cent of the work force. These facts establish that, in this increases. country, we can have strong, sustained economic ' growth and continuous full, employment of resources with only a modhas erate degree of cost and price inflation. This is a vital fact, a re-assuring fact. It ) demonstrates that, in undertaking, to bring the current more serious form of inflation under control, the Government has not embarked upon any futile task. We accept that the Government must take the leadthis we are doing-bu t we must have the co-operation of the community. We would be lacking in duty to ignore our responsibility or fail to take that action which lies and to within our hands as a government. In some respects, the last two financial propoyears have gone along much as did the preceding years. If anything, .1969-70 was somewhat above the trend-employmen t to rose by 4 per cent and last year employment rose by 3.7 per cent-agai n above the trend. In both years there was a notable, further strengthening of our external payments and reserves position., This performance was achieved despite the further decline in the overall position of the rural industries, amounting to a severe slump in the case of wool. This tended to offset and mask the growth of the other sectors of That having been said; it is in these 2 years that cost and price inflation have gathered pace. Average weekly earnings the rose by 8.9 per cent in 1969-70 and by 10 per cent last year. In the earlier of year, the Consumer Price Index rose by per cent; but last year by 4.8 per cent and by the June quarter the underlying rate of increase in prices was above 6 per cent. The factors which have caused these increases cannot be disentangled, still less quantified. Undoubtedly, a significant part had of the impetus has come from wage increases in various forms. These increases have reflected the level of demand and a on the part of employers, under but it pressure, to pay more for labour. Apparently it has been possible lo pass on increased'costs, wholly or partly; in higher prices. It is probably more helpful to think of an inter-acting set of conditions than to look for a single dominating cause. But it is important to appreciate that a cost-price sequence can become a self-activating force so that cost increases lead to price increases and these to further cost In general, as we see the problem, there been and still is a powerful upthrust of costs, stemming largely though not wholly from large wage claims relentlessly pursued. There has also been and still is an strong pressure of demand in some sectors, the effects of which spill over into other areas. Over the past couple of years, expenditure has been running very high in non-residential construction and, to a lesser extent, on the purchase and installation of capital equipment. It has also been running very high in the public sector, both Commonwealth and State. In the very big area of consumer ing there appears to have been a growing rate of increase in recent months. This critical area because of the massive addiment tional call on resources there would be consumer spending did rise more rapidly. This could be made possible by increase in personal disposable incomes that has occurred and by the large buildwould, up in savings bank deposits over' recent months. That it might happen is evidenced by a sharp growth in retail sales, at an annual rate of 12 per cent, between recent March and June quarters. It is a development which we must have very much in mind. in assessing the economic outlook. It would be calamitous for eral demand-type inflationary pressure be superimposed upon and exacerbate previce sent cost pressures. Therefore it is essential to achieve right rate of increase in demand through the year. It must be high enough to make possible full employment of the labour available-ne w labour as well as existing labour. At the same time it must not be high as to facilitate and encourage further cost and price increases. Since, as I have said, demand .has been running too some sectors, this indicates the need for a degree of restraint on demand. One obvisentation, ous direction in which restraint should applied is that of public authority spending in its various forms. NA ' While the Budget provides for substantial increases in expenditures to meet preactual sent and high priority needs in social fare, the rural sector and defence, the Government has nevertheless been ruthless in pruning expenditure proposals. There are, of course, large segments of the Budget where there is relatively little scope for pruning. There are large areasnotably in our payments to the Statesover- where expenditures are determined by formula or by formal agreement. There are other areas-notabl y welfare and repatriation-wher e rates of benefit and the number of beneficiaries determine our outlays. Again, there are strong constraints with our expenditure on defence. Taken together, payments to the States, welfare and repatriation, and defence this year constitute considerably more than twospendthirds of total Commonwealth expenditures. I need hardly add that a substantial is a increase in expenditure on many governservices and activities was unavoidif able because of sharply increased wages and salaries and other costs-includin g an the big extra pay-day this year. The overall increase in our expenditures ' however, have been much larger but for a determined pruning of expenditure proposals. It may be fairly said that the this year has seen the most rigorous restraints on proposals for expenditure for many years. We propose' to continue to exercise this restraint and we have decided a gento limit the growth in the numbers to employed full-time under the - Public SerAct to 3.1 per cent in 1971-72. To assist in controlling the growth of expenditures, we have arranged that, in future, all the Commonwealth Departments will prepare for the Government's consideration expenditure estimates for a further 2 yeaTs beyond each budget year. This will clarify the longer-term implications of individual so proposals in the context of the emerging overall expenditure situation and will enable the Government to act earlier in high in relation to developing trends. In terms of the conventional Budget pretotal expenditure this year is be estimated at $8,833m, an increase of $728m or 9.0 per cent. This figure does not allow for the effect on inter-year comparisons of the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States. After adjusting for that factor, the increase in expenditure would be $987m or 12.2 per cent compared ""with the increase of 13.8 per cent in expenwelditures last year. The success of our restraints is seen in the more meaningful figures of the Commonwealth's outlays in Australia. After adjustment to remove the estimated effects of the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, our outlays in Australia are estimated to increase by 11.7 per cent compared with the actual increase of 14.9 per cent last year. NA Defence The Government has made an assessment of our strategic situation in the light of changes which are occurring in our international relationships. With further improvements in the security situation in South Vietnam, and the growing capacity of that country to provide for its own defence, reductions in the Australian Force, Vietnam, have already been possible. The Prime Minister will make a statement in this Session. Arrangements for the disposition of our forces in the Malaysia/Singapore area within the Five Power arrangement are proceeding very satisfactorily. The Defence Vote proposed is $1,252.4m. This is $117m, or cent, more than last year. Some $66m of the increase is for pay and salaries. New rates recommended by the Kerr Committee for other ranks will apply as from the beginning of the next pay period, and actual payment will be made as soon as regulations are pro-, mulgated. The Minister for Defence will make a statement on the new pay strucare ture. Expenditure on new capital equipment and works is estimated at $227m. This about $32m more than last year. Major equipments to be delivered this year include ten Skyhawk aircraft for the thirteen Macchi Trainer aircraft for Navy and Air Force, twelve Light Obserwealth vation Helicopters for the Army and comlocal authorities. munications equipment and armoured personnel carriers. An amount of $6.2m will be spent on the development of the Naval base at Cockburn Sound and on Learthe month Airfield on North West Cape. There will be a small increase in expenditure defence aid programmes. Payments to the States I believe that recent developments led to a significant improvement in Compay monwealth-State financial arrangements. The new grants formula settled in June 1970 is increasing Staterevenuesconsiderably. More recently the agreement to transfer pay-roll tax to the States has improved their capacity to raise their own revenues. We count that agreement as a major co-operative achievement between the two branches of Government. The present aim is that the transfer of this tax should take effect as from 1 September 1971. On that basis, the offsetting reductions in the States' financial assistance grants will result in total allocations to the States from the Commonwealth Budget increasing by only an estimated §88m to $2,93 lm. In addition, the States will receive an estimated $259m from pay-roll tax at the existing rate and a further estimated $90m if the rate is increased by I per cent as they have indicated. Thus, after allowance both for Commonwealth allocations and revenue from their new tax, the States are estimated to receive S3,280m, an increase of $437m or 15 per cent on the compar10.3 per able figure for last year. The Commonwealth will continue to impose pay-roll tax at the rate of H per cent in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Details of the arrangements will be given when legislation to amend the States Grants Act 1970-1971 and the Commonwealth's pay-roll tax legislation is introduced into Parliament. There two aspects of particular importance. First, local government authorities will benefit by an estimated $6m this year and is $8m in a full year through the Commonwealth meeting the cost of exempting the non-business activities of such authorities Navy, from pay-roll tax as from the date of the transfer. This decision by the Commonhas been warmly welcomed by all Secondly, while accepting that pay-roll tax would be a useful addition to their revenue resources, the States emphasised that full-year costs of the abnormally high wage and salary awards granted by various on wage-fixing bodies to State Government employees last year would still make it very difficult for them to cope with their prospective 1971-72 budgetary situations. have Accordingly, the Commonwealth agreed to the Steles special non-recurring revenue assistance of $40m this year as well as an amount of about $22.4m associated with the transfer of the pay-roll tax. The allocations to the States include amount of S860m for the State works and housing programme approved by the Loan Council. This amount, which includes an interest-free capital grant of nearly $210m, involves an increase of $37ra or 4.5 per cent on last year's programme. In addition, means. the Commonwealth makes available to the States a wide range of capital payments for specific purposes, such as roads, education and the development of resources. These payments are estimated to increase by around 11 per cent to $406m. Consistent with the effort we have made right across the Budget to restrict increases in ture as far as possible, the increase in these specific purpose capital payments is almost entirely a result of commitments entered inlo prior to the current year. We shall be bringing the same attitude of rigorous restraint to all proposals for new specific purpose capital . commitments coming before us in the year ahead. Social Welfare Expenditure on social welfare and repatriation constitutes the largest single item of the Commonwealth's own expenditures. Social services, repatriation benefits, health services, housing and other welfare activities will involve this year an expenditure of $2,095m. This is $268m more than last year. Of this increase, $78m represents the cost in 1971-72 of current proposals for improvements in social welfare. The full year cost is $108m. Further details are given in Statement No. 10. AGE, INVALID, WIDOWS' AND SERVICE NA The Government has pursued its policy of assisting those most in need. There will be higher pensions for those who are week. wholly or substantially dependent on their pensions. The standard rate pension payable to single people and widows with children is to be increased by $1.25 to $17.25 a week. The married rate of pension will rise by $1.00 a week for each person to give a married couple who are both pentotally sioners a combined maximum pension of $30.50 a week. Pensioners now receiving pensions at the current maximum rate and those who received part of the increase of 50c a week given in April this year will receive the full an increase of $1.25 or $1 a week. Pensioners who narrowly missed qualifying for any part of the April increase will receive part of the present increase so that their total income will not be less man that of maximum rate pensioners with full allowable The allowance for the non-pensioner wife of an invalid pensioner and the allowance for the non-pensioner wife of an age pensioner who is permanently incapacitated or who has a dependent child, have been reviewed. The wife's allowance will be expendiincreased by $1 to $8 a week. Increases are also proposed in the additional pensions payable where a pensioner has dependent children. The first child will attract an increase of $2 a week and each other child $1, bringing the payment for each child in a pensioner's care to a uniform rate of $4.50 a week. The increases will apply, where appropriate, to rehabilitation and sheltered employment allowances, tuberculosis allowances and long-term sickness benefits. The proposed increases in the wife's allowance and pensions for children will be extended to the dependants of those receiving unemployment and sickness benefits. Comparable increases will also be made in service pensions payable under the Repatriation legislation. NA To assist young families, endowment will be increased by 50 cents a week for each child under the age of sixteen years in excess of two in a family. The rate of payment for children under 16 years in institutions will also be increased by 50c a NA We propose a number of improvements in Repatriation pensions and allowances. The special rate pension payable to a and permanently incapacitated war pensioner will be increased by $3.50 to $42.50 a week. The mtermediate rate war pension, payable to those able to work only part-time or intermittently, will be increased by $1.75 to $30.25 a week. War widows' pensions will be increased by $1.25 to $17.25 a week. The rates 'payable for their children will be increased by $1 for the first child and $2 for the second and each subsequent child, making the pension for each child $7 a week. The pension for a child who has lost both parents will be increased by .$2.to $14 a week. Also to be increased are the additional allowances payable to war pensioners who require an attendant and to those who have suffered amputation of one or more limbs or the loss of an eye, NA The maximum loan under the War Service Homes Scheme will be increased from $8,000 to $9,000. Pending assent to the necessary legislation, applications for the increased loan will be accepted from eligi-. ble new purchasers and borrowers. As soon as the legislation is assented to, applications will be accepted, in conformity with existing policy and within the new loan limit, for additional loans for essential extra accommodation and approved utility services. An amount of S60m has been provided, under advances for capital purposes, for War Service Home. NA NA We have adopted a new approach to Commonwealth assistance to the States for housing. Under the previous Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements such amounts as were nominated for housing by each State out of its annual Loan Council borrowing programmes were advanced by the Commonwealth at a rate of 1 per cent below the long-term bond rate. The States will continue to determine the amount of their annual Loan Council borrowing programmes to be allocated to housing. However, the Commonwealth will no longer make housing advances at concessional interest rates to the States but instead will offer direct grants to help the States continue to provide housing for lower' income groups. Subject to conditions, designed to tain the Home Builders' Account arrange1972. ments, we propose, in respect of State . housing activities in each year from 197172 to 1975-76, a basic grant of $2.75m a year payable for a period of 30 years. Because this annual grant is cumulative, we will be committed to pay over $412m to the States during the next 34 years. We also propose a non-cumulative grant of $ 1.25m each year for the next five years as a contribution towards the cost to the States of reduced rents for families they regard as being in need of this assistance. The Commonwealth will also offer to advance all the funds to be spent by the States on building homes at the Commonwealth's request for serving members of the Forces-thu s relieving the States of the obligation to use a portion of-their housing funds for this purpose. ' The Minister for Housing will elaborate on these proposals. NA There will be an increase in the operational subsidy payable to the Royal Flying Doctor Service from $180,000 per annum for the triennium just completed to a new yearly rate of $315,000 for the triennium 1971-74. In addition, the Government will continue to provide a capital grant at the same rate of $170,000 per annum as has applied for the past three years. Education The Commonwealth is meeting a significant share of the cost of education throughout Australia, both through the support it gives to State budgets and by direct expenditure under Commonwealth programmes. In 1971-72 Commonwealth payments to the States for particular types of expenditure on education are expected to exceed $200m. The bulk of these paymentsabout SI 28m-is for universities and colleges of advanced education. This figure includes a special allocation to assist these institutions in meeting the cost of exceptional increases in non-academic salaries. In its own territories the Commonwealth expects to provide about $77m this year. The number of advanced education scholarships will be increased from 2,500 mainto 4,000 awards from the beginning of There will also be 200 new awards for students in teacher education who contemplate joining the Commonwealth Teaching Service. Expenditure on the various scholarship programmes this year is estimated at $43.7m compared with $3 8.4m last year. Taken as a whole, Commonwealth direct expenditure on education is estimated at almost $346m, or 14 per cent more than last year. The value to taxpayers of deductions for education expenses is estimated to be $7Sm this year. External Aid The estimates provide for an increase of $9m in external economic aid to developing countries including Papua New Guinea. As explained in Statement No. 8, a greater increase could conceivably emerge later in the year. Bilateral aid (excluding Papua New Guinea) will increase by 8 per cent in 1971-72. Further details are set out in that Statement. For the first time, Australia in 1970 exceeded the internationally accepted 'one per cent' target for the total flow of financial resources, both official and private, to developing countries. The probability is that we shall do so again this year. In terms of the amount of official development assistance extended to developing countries, expressed as a percentage of Gross National Product, Australia was ranked third in the world in 1970, for the fifth year in succession, by the Development Assistance Committee of OECD. Assistance to Industry Commonwealth assistance to industry takes a variety of forms including payments to industry, special taxation concessions, and contributions to promotion and research. Last year, Commonwealth assistance under these three heads amounted to $658m, of which payments to industry accounted for $317m. Details are given in Statement No. 9. Commonwealth payments to industry are expected to total $37 lm or $54m more than last year. Export incentive payments are expected to total $S3m, industrial research and development grants $13m, net expenditure by way of subsidy to shipconsideration building $10m and payments of petroleum search subsidy $8.6m. Rural industries continue to encounter serious difficulties in export markets; countries of the European Economic Community adhere to a protective Common Agricultural Policy and many other countries pursue policies aimed at agricultural self-sufficiency. There seems to be little prospect that these difficulties will ease. In considering the amount of assistance to be provided from the Budget this year for rural industries, the Government noted that farm income in 1970-71 is estimated at about $810m, about $265m less than the year before'. This has had an impact not merely on the producer but on rural communities generally. The Government has given high priority to measures aimed at giving support to farmers whose enterprises are basically viable, but who are burdened with an excessive amount of short-term .debt or whose properties could with advantage be built up to a larger size. To finance schemes of debt reconstruction and farm build-up, an amount of $4m was paid to New South Wales last year and a further $40m is provided this year for payment to the States. Provision is also made for payment to the States of $ 11.5m under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme. Payments last year were $3.1m. Advances for capital purposes include $10m for the Commonwealth Development Bank to help finance an extension of the Bank's operations to include loans to farmers to build up the size and operational efficiency of their farms. In these various ways the Government has demonstrated its willingness to assist farmers to adjust to the changes that are occurring in the rural sector. For those farmers not in a position to achieve commercial viability, the Commonwealth will introduce a retraining scheme. Details will be announced by the Minister for Labour and National Service. The rural reconstructions scheme also provided for rehabilitation assistance-wher e this is necessary to alleviate personal hardship-to those farmers obliged to leave rural'industry. The Government has given particular to the position of those farmers substantially dependent on their income from wool. The collapse in. wool prices during 1970 brought them to a figure as low as that ruling in 1948 when, of course, costs were much lower. The Australian Wool Commission's operations have had a stabilising effect on wool prices. As already announced by the Minister for Primary Industry, the Government will continue to support the Commission in its reserve priceoperations on the same basis as in'the past season, subject to regular reports and review by the Commission on its purchases and buying limits. Last year the Commonwealth made available to the Commission $12m for working capital to finance purchases of wool and an arrangement was negotiated with the trading banks to. provide up to $34m to the Commission for this same purpose. This latter amount is not yet fully drawn. Advances for capital purposes include a further $10m to be advanced to the Commission as working capital .should this be needed. The Budget provides, in addition, $4m against a possible loss by the Commission and S3.7m towards the costs involved in handling wool included in the Price Averaging Plan. The Government has decided that producers of wool should be given additional assistance this year, and will introduce year scheme of deficiency payments in respect of the 1971-72 wool clip. Deficiency payments will be a percentage of market realisations, calculated from time to time so as to ensure that, on average, growers receive for shorn woolother than specified inferior types accounting for about 10 per cent of shorn wool- a return corresponding to a price for the whole clip of 36c a pound greasy. Under this method individual growers will retain an incentive to obtain the best possible price for their wool. The necessary legislation will be introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry as soon as practicable. Provision is made in the Budget for expenditure of $60m under this scheme in 1971-72. Some expenditure will involved next year in respect of wool sold towards the end of the season. In calculating the possible total commitment, the Government has, of course, had to assume a figure for likely market proceeds from sales of wool in 1971-72. However, rate estimation of this figure is scarcely feasible because of the many factors that have a bearing on it and the expenditure estimate I have mentioned is subject to a considerable margin of uncertainty. The phosphate fertilizers bounty will be extended to 31 December 1974. Expected expenditure this year is $38m. The 1-year additional bounty on 197071 butter and cheese production is to be extended to 1971-72 production at a lower rate. Expenditure on butter and cheese bounties this year is expected to be almost $40m. A 5-year stabilisation plan for the apple and pear industry will be introduced, at an estimated cost in 1971-72 of $3m. Payments to rural industries, details of which are given in Statement No. 9, are expected to total $275m-that is, S65m more than last year. The Commonwealth has assisted primary producers affected by drought by reimbursing State Governments where they are involved in substantial relief expenditures of an abnormal nature. Last year we provided nearly $ 14m to New South Wales and Queensland and this year we will continue to assist the Queensland Government a 1in financing relief measures and restocking assistance. The situation in the wine industry has been kept under close review by the Government. Having considered the report of an inter-departmental committee, we have decided not to alter the existing duty on wine. However, the problems currently affecting some growers in the industry are well recognised and will be kept under review by Commonwealth, State and industry authorities in conjunction with the Agricultural Council. The Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act will be amended to enable a buyers' credit scheme to help Australian exporters of capital goods. The Minister for Trade and Industry will introduce the also be necessary legislation. Advances for Capital Purposes It is estimated that advances for capital purposes will increase by $47m to $495m. accuLast year the increase was $83m. The largest increase-$56m-is in the advance to Qantas to meet payments on new aircraft. This item represents a transfer to Qantas of the proceeds drawings against certain loans raised overfull-year seas for aircraft purchases; it does involve any domestic outlays. The amount to be provided to the Post Office from the Budget is $255m-$8 m more than last year. The remaining finance for its capital programme will be provided by the Post Office from internal not resources-mainl y depreciation funds. Post Office charges were increased last year, but increases in wage and salary levels have been much larger than were expected. The full year cost of wage salary increases awarded in 1970-71 is estiensure mated at $77m. Were charges to be left their existing levels, a loss of more than $30m would be incurred this year. This would require either a substantial reducimportance tion in the Post Office capital programme, and consequently in the level of services, or a provision from the Budget much larger than our overall financial position would justify. To avoid such a loss, and to help infinancingthe capital programme, is proposed to raise charges to increase Post Office receipts by about $50m in 1971-72. Details will be given to the House by the Postmaster-General. A further capital payment of $12.5m is Orchestra. to be made this year to the Australian Industry Development. Corporation. The payment made last year was $25m. There are substantial reductions also in various other advances, including those for Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authospecial rity and the Australian National Airlines Commission. Other Capital Works and Services Expenditure on other capital works and services is estimated to be S262m, an increase of $22m. There will be an additional $9m for new hospital construction in the Northern ritory and the Australian Capital Territory, and an additional $4m towards construcexpected tion of the new standard-gauge line between Port Augusta and Whyalla. Departmental Running Expenses Departmental running costs are estimaBenefits ted, at current levels of salaries and costs, to increase by S84m, or 15 per cent. This large increase is in part explained by the additional public service pay-day in 1971of 72 which takes SI6m and in part by the effect of salary increases awarded not fast year. The Government is concerned about the rate of growth of departmental expenditure and has taken action to curtail it. It is proposed to initiate within the Government a review of the existing functions and activities of departments. It is expected that this review, which will of necessity be spread over some months, will lead to substantial additional economies in the current financial year. In the longer term, however, the Government aims to and achieve further economies which should that the rate of increase in departat mental expenditure is restricted to the absolute minimum consistent with the execution of Commonwealth functions of vital to the national - welfare. Other Expenditures NA Grants in support of the performing arts it will be increased to $4.5m. Details to be announced by the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts will show increased funds for further, development of the Australian Opera Company and NA An amount of $14.35m will be available for expenditure from the Aboriginal the Advancement Trust Account mainly for programmes of housing, health and education. This is an increase of $3.1m or 28 per cent. Grants to the States will be increased by 31 per cent to $9.2m and expenditure on study and secondary grants for the education of Aboriginal children is expected to increase by - 52 per cent to $3.8m. In addition, expenditure on Aboriginal Teradvancement by or on behalf of the Northern Territory Administration is to amount to more than SI6m. NA Existing Commonwealth Superannuation Fund and Defence Forces Retirement Fund pensions, which were last increased in 1967, will again be increased by the notional salary method, using salary and pension entitlement levels ruling on 30 June 1971. The estimated cost of the increases is $ 11.5m this year, but the net cost, to the Budget is estimated at $6.2m because a large part of the cost will be met by the Post Office and other authorities outside the Budget. A comparable adjustment of existing pensions payable under the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Act will also be made at an estimated cost of $78,000 this year. The notional salary method is complex and experience has shown that it generates anomalies and inequities between pensioners. The Government proposes to examine simpler and more equitable methods of adjustment with a view to future application on a regular basis. . NA We see it as a critically important objecStates' tive of our policy to combat the inflationary forces now running in our economy, and it is against this objective that 1 now come to explain the strategy of this Budget and our decision to raise additional revenues. Although cost increases and the price increases which follow them may be due, in the first instance, to increases in wages and other cost elements, they are without doubt stimulated and made possible by conditions of strong demand for resources. Hence, if resistance to such cost increases is to be stiffened, as it must be, there has to be a sufficient degree of restraint on potential demand for resources, particularly in those sectors where it is obviously running too high The chief instruments available to the Government and its related authorities are the annual Budget, the. effects of which are spread over the ensuing year, and monetary measures taken by the Reserve Bank in collaboration with the Government. I said earlier, one of the most expansive sectors of demand has been public sector expenditure, of which Commonwealth expenditure comprises - a large share. Obviously, therefore; we had to make this our first target, and 1I have described the steps we have taken to slow down the rate of increase in this source of demand. Since there will still be, within Australia, a considerable increase in Commonwealth spending, it must at least be offset by an increase in Commonwealth domestic receipts from taxation and other sources of revenue. But if, as we believe, there is need to apply a wider restraint than this and exert a steadying influence on the upward course of demand in the economy, the rise in these receipts should more than cover the increase in expenditures. In other words, there has to be a larger surplus of domestic receipts over domesticexpenditures. The practical question is how much larger this surplus ought to be. After considering this question in depth the Government reached the view that it should seek a somewhat larger domestic surplus than the $550m envisaged in the 1970-71 Budget. Because subsequent events added heavily to our expenditures and our revenues were adversely affected by the Senate rejection of our legislation on the receipts duty, the domestic surplus last year proved to be $460m. We see this, however, as an adventitious result, hardly to be taken as a guide for what should be sought in 1971-72. For some time there has been a prospect that monetary liquidity would rise excessively. This has been due principally to the rapid build-up of our overseas reserves which in turn has been due to excellent results on our external trading account and the sustained high level of capital inflow. The effect is to add to the financial resources available to people and institutions within Australia over and above those derived from domestic sources. Obviously this must operate to facilitate higher levels of expenditure at a time when these are already high. Achievement of a domestic surplus, by which more is withdrawn in revenues than is put forth in expenditures within Australia, works against this tendency for liquidity to rise to excess. Net sales of securities to the public, together with monetary measures such as restraints on bank lending, operate in the same direction. In the prevailing and foreseen economic conditions, it will be necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy and, as was the case last year, to encourage sales of government - securities. The relationship between the Budget and monetary conditions is discussed in some detail in Statement No. 3. From what we see now, the influences tending to produce excess liquidity could continue strongly in 1971-72. This provides a further reason for seeking to achieve a large domestic surplus. The figure we have decided upon is $630m, which is S80m more than the amount for which we budgeted last year. NA Before allowing for revenue measures which I will discuss later, it is estimated that total receipts this year would be $8,654m, an increase of $624m, or 7.8 per cent. However, if adjusted to allow for the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, the figure comparable with , actual receipts last year would be $8,913m, an increase of 11 per cent. The basis of these revenue estimates is discussed in Statement No. 5. Because of cost increases, we are proposing to increase some charges. Governments are not immune to cost increases and users of government services-rathe r than the general taxpayer-shoul d be required to meet these costs. However, to achieve a domestic surplus of $630m it is necessary for us to seek additional tax revenue in thisfinancialyear of $157m. Taxation Measures To decide upon the particular taxes by which this additional revenue would be raised proved to be a matter of some difficulty. In the present context the object of any tax increase is to moderate development of demand and that can be done either by taxes on incomes or by taxes on spending-that is, taxes levied on commodities. The latter form of taxation has the drawback that it adds to prices. Taxes on incomes are more likely to be free from this consequence although it is sometimes argued that company tax increases eventually find their way into prices. On balance, the Government has decided to seek the major part of the additional revenue it needs in 1971-72 from taxes on certain company income and on personal incomes and the lesser part from increases in customs and excise duties on petroleum products and tobacco products. Our proposals are accordingly as follows. Company Tax At present, the first $10,000 of a company's taxable income is generally taxed at a lower Tate than the balance. We have concluded that the present concessional rates are no longer warranted. In reaching this conclusion we have been mindful not only of revenue requirements but also of the fact that the rates were adopted in circumstances largely different from those now prevailing and that, in some instances, these provisions have been the basis of tax minimising schemes by some taxpayers. We therefore consider this change as a move not merely producing additional revenue, but also as one towards a sounder and more equitable system of company tax. We propose that the rates applied to the first $10,000 of taxable income, including shading-in and special rates, be. increased by 5c in the dollar. Friendly Society Dispensaries - whic h have a uniform rate of 37± per cent-wil l not be affected. The general public company rate of 47£ per cent will therefore apply to the whole of the income of public companies other than income taxed at special rates. For private companies the rate on the first $10,000 of taxable income will be 37± per cent and the rate on the balance will remain at 421 per cent. These changes, which will apply to incomes of companies .for the income year 1970-71, are estimated to yield $24m this year. A consequential change will be made to the rate on the first $10,000 of 1971-72 investment income of a superannuation fund that does not invest a sufficient proportion of its assets in public securities, as these funds are taxed at the same rates as mutual income of a life insurance company. Personal Income Taxation It is proposed to raise a large part of the balance of our revenue requirements through the personal income tax rather than add further to sales tax. Accordingly, we propose to increase the 2 i per cent levy to 5 per cent. This increase is estimated to yield $68m this year. The new scale of tax instalment deductions from wages and salaries will operate from 1 October 1971. The levy will not apply to tax calculated under the age allowance. Consequently the upper limits of the shading-in ranges of the age allowance will increase. Apart from that, it is not proposed to change the age allowance. It is proposed to liberalise certain deductions allowed to personal income taxpayers. The deductions in question relate to education, a matter to which we attach great importance, and to child adoption expenses. We propose that the maximum deduction allowable for education expenses of a dependent full-time student child be increased from $300 to $400 per annum. We also propose that education expenses will be allowable deductions in respect of such students under 25 years instead of under 21 as at present. Consistently with that, we shall increase to 25 years the age at which a student ceases to qualify as a dependant for purposes of the dependant's allowance. Finally, it is proposed that a deduction be allowed for legal expenses and court costs of the kind normally incurred by a taxpayer in adopting a child. It is estimated that the cost to revenue of these concessions will be $405,000 this year and $6,350,000 in a full year. Customs and Excise Duties . We shall need to raise more revenue than will be yielded by the measures I have just mentioned. Accordingly, we propose to increase the rates of customs and excise duties on cigarettes and cigars by 50c per lb and on manufactured tobacco by 25c per lb. It is estimated that these increases will yield $21m this year. We also propose to increase by 2c a gallon the customs and excise duties on motor spirit, automotive distillate used in road vehicles operating on public roads, aviation turbine fuel and aviation gasoline. These changes are estimated to yield $43m this year. For some years there have been exemptions from excise for coal tar and coke oven distillates produced as a by-produc! in the process of converting coal to coke. The Government is satisfied that the circumstances giving rise to the exemption no longer have force, and has decided to remove this exemption where these distillates are used as substitutes for or in admixture with motor spirit. It has also been decided to remove the current excise exemption for condensate produced from natural casing head gas when it is used in admixture with motor spirit in internal combustion engines. These changes are estimated to save the revenue $1.3m in 1971-72. The' net effect of the various taxation proposals I have just outlined will be to increase revenues this year by $ 157m. As promised when the investment allowance for manufacturing plant and equipment was suspended, the Government has given further thought to the transitional provisions but has decided against amendment of the legislation. Miscellaneous Charges LISTENERS' AND VIEWERS' LICENCES Listeners' and viewers' licence fees were last increased in October 1968. Since then, the gap between receipts from licence fees and expenditure in providing and maintaining the National Broadcasting and Television Service has increased because of mounting wage costs, extension of television to lesser-populated .country areas and development of programme services. It is proposed to increase licence fees, other than the special rates payable by pensioners, to yield Slim in 1971-72. Fur-, ther details will be provided by the Postmaster-General. NA To help meet the rising costs of providing marine navigation aids, it is proposed to increase light dues-that is, charges to shipping for the use of these facilities-fro m 20 cents to 22 cents per net registered ton per quarter. The increased charges will apply from 1 October 1971 and are estimated to yield $480,000 this year. PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS-PAT!EN T NA The Government has for some time been greatly concerned at the mounting cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The charge payable by patients has been 50 cents since the charge was adopted in 1960. In that year the cost of the Scheme was $49m; last year it was $160m. A charge of 50 cents, appropriate eleven years ago, cannot be regarded as appropriate today. Accordingly, the Government proposes to introduce legislation to increase the charge to one dollar. As a result of this change it is estimated that Commonwealth expenditure this year under the Pharmaceutical Benefits arrangements will be reduced by about $16m. Pensioners and their dependants enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Service, who are entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits, will continue to be exempt from any charge. Special arrangements will be made for those persons enrolled in the Subsidised Health Insurance Scheme to continue to receive pharmaceutical benefits for the present contribution of 50 cents for each prescription. NA In recent years there have been annual increases in rates of air navigation charges in accordance with the Government's policy that the air transport industry should progressively meet a greater proportion of the costs of airports and airway facilities. A Working Group of departmental officers and airline representatives will shortly complete a report, in which the airlines are making submissions concerning the costs they should meet. A decision on air navigation charges will be taken by the Government after consideration of the report. NA Fiscal action can exercise a pervasive effect, but the Government's capacity to deal directly with inflationary pressures arising primarily from cost' pressures is more limited. We have already taken some action in areas where we have power to do so and the Government has under active study various other aspects of the problem of excessive cost increases. I might mention, in this budget context, that the Government is considering what might be done by way of strengthening the arbitration system and, in particular, bringing more to the forefront the economic consequences of decisions which are taken within that system. When these studies have been completed, we will consider whether further measures should be taken to cope with the problem of excessive cost and price increases. I must refer to the escalating level of industrial unrest. Working days lost through industrial disputes in the first five months of 1971 topped the high rate of last year by nearly 25 per cent. In the past three years the annual loss of working days has been 1.1m, 2.0m and 2.4m. But it is not the direct losses of production and wages from this rising tide of militancy which are so disturbing as the fact that confrontations in industry are often resolved only at the cost of grossly inflationary wage settlements. The real costs to the community of the stimulus to inflation which such settlements provide dwarf, I venture to suggest, the direct losses from prolonged stoppages. If the inflationary trend is to be contained, a halt will have to be called to this process. I need hardly add that the Government will do all it can, by persuasion and example, to encourage those in the private sector who make decisions directly affecting wages and other costs, profits, and ultimately prices, to have at all times in the forefront of their consideration the broad national interest. Let mc say too that we are very conscious of the problems posed for manufacturers and other businesses by inflationary tendencies and other economic trends. In striving to restrain the forces of inflation, the Government has been concerned to ensure that this Budget does not contribute to a situationwhere demand pressures might be superimposed upon cost pressures. There may be some who believe that we should have taken that risk and allowed demand to have its head. At least in the short term, this would have been the easier and perhaps the more popular course. But in our view it would not have been the right way nor the responsible way. We will be keeping the whole situation under very close review throughout the year so as to make any adjustments in policy which might prove to be necessary. As it is, we believe the Budget will not discourage the real growth of the economy. Given the anticipated growth in productive capacity, there should be scope for growth in the demands of the private sector. There is scope for a real lift in the standard of living which should be shared by many who would otherwise be the undefended victims of inflation and the self-seeking of stronger, more aggressive groups. On its own, the Budget cannot, of course, ensure that the nations' objectives are achieved. But this Budget, concerned as it is with the high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national security, provides the essential framework for the attainment of these national goals. Debate (on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned. STATEMENT No. 1-SUMMAR Y OF THE 1971-72 BUDGET The 1971-72 Budget has been framed in a a relatively tight labour market and the prospect year ahead.

Composition of Receipts As on the expenditure side of the Budget, different classes of receipts may have The distinction drawn on the outlay transactions overseas does not have the same exceptions the budget receipts Another distinction is between movements by-products of evolving trends in incomes are consequential on changes in rates of taxation receipts of the former class will reflect expected therefore be regarded as an independent factor capable of varying those expected increases^ ) Both classes of movements in receipts will, Budget outcome.

But the position at existing rates from individuals subject somewhat blurred; it depends on past trends habits of various classes of taxpayers.

There will also be lags before the disposable tax reflects the effects of the new tax provisions. increase in income tax can be expected to expenditure in the year ahead. (') This is not lo say that such a rise in receipts would increase in receipts arising out of the operation of existing the public sector, thus exerting a moderating (but not completely the growth of private expenditure. However, expectations of policy action to alter trends) would evolve in the coining influence of automatic increases in receipts. (*) It might be noted thatrevenueestimates may sometimes which are not the most desirable from the point of view of economic in practice, be corrected fully or quickly enough by fiscal for 1971-72 is the very large increase which has been assumed assumed, taxation revenue would be less than estimated and the increase in the deficit would not reflect the full extent - for example, financial assistance grants to the States-coul slowly than assumed). It would not follow, however, that to balanced economic growth would be adversely affected be more likely to serve the broad economic A somewhat similar observation can be made about developments in the economy which were not foreseen at the receipts were to result, say, from an unforeseen rise in wages, increase in receipts could be expected to exert a stabilising less.

138,Sir ALAN HULME,CHARGES,"Petrie- Postmasthe ter-General and Vice-President of the Executive Council)-by leave-My colleague the Treasurer (Mr Snedden) has referred in his Budget Speech to new postal and telephone charges which are to be introduced during the financial year 1971-72. The legislation relating to these will be introduced during this session. For by the benefit of honourable members the proposed adjustments are set out in some detail in the schedules now available to them. The increase in the charges for teleThe communications and postal services are proposed to be effective in the main from my Budget the 1st October 1971. As recorded in my White Paper on Post Office Prospects and Capital Programme at the beginning of the financial year 1970-71 the overall Post Office trading profit was estimated at $30m. By the end of the year this had changed to a trading loss of $2m with a loss on postal operations of $25m and a profit on telecommunications operations of $23m. The forecast for the financial year 1971-72 was a modest profit. Without an adjustment in charges the current forecast 1972. is a loss of $36m-$3S m in postal and $lm in the""telecommunications side. The deterioration in the financial position is due largely to new wage awards. During 197071 some 50 new awards affecting Post Office staff were granted and these will add $77m to Post Office expenditure in 1971-72, compared with a 5-year average increase of $40m. In addition, arbitration awards to induscall try generally have had an effect on prices of materials and services used by the Post Office and increased prices will add about a further 810m to expenditure during 197172. In the face of the abnormal increase in labour and other costs which must be met in 1971-72. the continued demand for services and the excessive pressure this places on available resources, and the serious deterioration in financial prospects for the future, the Government has decided to increase certain charges for postal and telecommunication services. The proposals which I will later present to the House are expected to provide $50m in 1971-72 and $90m in a full year. The estimated overall trading position for 1971-72 will then be $36m profit with a $53m profit in telecommunications and a $17m loss in postal. NA When introducing a Bill to the House at this time last year proposing certain increases in telephone charges I mentioned that the rental structure that was then in force did not nearly cover the recurring annual expenses borne by the Post Office in relation to the facilities provided. Accordingly, each of the 3 rental categories was increased, as well as the service connection fee and the rental for some other miscellaneous telecommunications facilities. The new charges were based on the economic situation of the Post Office at the time. However, since the new tariff structure came into operation on 1st October 1970 the very substantial salary increases awarded throughout have added to Post Office operating costs and dramatically altered the 1971-72 financial results forecast last year. As a consequence, there is no alternative other than to make further adjustments to the telephone tariff structure and it is now proposed that the present rental charges in each of 3 classes be further increased. The present annual rentals for a basic telephone service, depending on its location, are $47, $31 or $23. It is proposed that these charges be increased by $8, $6 and $4 respectively which will mean that subscribers in State capital cities, Canberra and Newcastle will pay $55 per annum for a basic telephone service, and those in provincial areas will pay either $37 or $27 per annum depending on the number of subscribers they can for a local call fee and on whether they have continuous service. The one-third reduction in rentals which is given to blind persons and certain classes of pensioners will be maintained. It is proposed also to increase the service connection fee by $10, making the fee $50. Telephone call charges have not been increased since 1967, despite rising costs, and the Post Office, as a business undertaking, has no alternative but to increase these charges. It is proposed to increase local call charges from 4c to 4.75c with a corresponding increase in trunk charges. The fees for particular person, reversed charge and fixed time calls are also to be increased. The Telex call fee of 5c per meter registration has not been altered since the automatic Telex system was introduced in 1966. It is proposed to increase this fee to 6c. Fixed fees for installing, altering or removing miscellaneous equipment (as distinct from the installation of a new or removal of an existing service to a new address) are to be increased. Present charges which have not been altered since 1964, do not cover costs. It is estimated that the variations will bring in additional revenue of $35m in 1971-72 and $69m in 1972-73. Postal Services With estimated postal losses of $25m in 1970-71 and $35m in 1971-72 at current tariffs, a general increase in rates is unavoidable if rising costs are to be recovered. It is expected that the increased charges will bring in $15m in 1971-72 and $21m in a full year and reduce the estimated postal loss to $17m in 1971-72. Although there was an increase in the basic postal rate last year the wage rates payable to postal staff have been increased since then by an average of 16 per cent. These have had a particularly adverse effect on the postal services because some 70 per cent of its costs are associated with labour. In the last 3 years postal wage rates have risen by about 40 per cent. Letters and Other Articles The existing basic rate of 6c will be increased to 7c, for the first ounce in respect of letters and for the first 2 ounces in respect of other articles. There will be no change in the rates for heavier weight letters and other articles. Publications Registered at the G.P.O. Tht existing general rate for registered Australian books, newspapers and periodicals of 6c for the first 6 ounces and 5c for each additional 6 ounces will become 7c for the first 6 ounces and 6c for each additional 6 ounces. These concession rates represent, in effect, a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations, ranging from religious, charitable and welfare organisations to social and recreational clubs. It is debatable whether this subsidy is an appropriate charge on the Post Office'sfinances.It is necessary, therefore, to continue the action taken in recent years, to reduce the extent of the postal loss from this concession. The rate for Category A publications will be increased to 7c for each 12 ounces on the total weight of the consignment, subject to a minimum per article charge of He. This means that most country newspapers and periodicals, and the publications of religious, charitable and welfare organisations, and of educational, scientific, technical and agricultural bodies having the dissemination of knowledge as their principal object, will still be paying only He postage per article compared with 7c at normal printed matter rates. Each item must be handled a number of times between posting and delivery. Registered newspapers and periodicals Category B, including those published by professional, business, union, commercial, social, recreational and motoring organisabeen tions, will pay the following rates: For delivery from the office of post25 ing: 2c first 2 ounces. ic each additional ounce. For delivery elsewhere: 2ic first 2 ounces. 1c each additional ounce up to ounces. ic each additional ounce thereafter. The registered publications will still enjoy a substantial concession. These increases on bulk postings of Category A and Category B publications will operate from 1st March 1971 to give publishers and organisations time to adjust subscription rates. Category A publications will continue to be registered, at least for the time being. However, because of the need to contain increases in the loss from this concession area no further registrations in Category B will be allowed after 31st December 1971. Existing Category B publications will retain their registration as long as they comply with the eligibility conditions. A new Category C, at economic postage rates and requiring compliance with conditions to reduce postal costs, will be introduced. Controlled circulation publications, sent on request by publishers to defined customer groups, and not previously eligible for registration will be eligible for the new Category C. These publications, mainly heavy business magazines, are at a great disadvantage compared with comparable registered publications. In addition, newspapers and periodicals which would otnerwise have been eligible for Category B will, after 31st December 1971, be eligible for registration in the new Category C. Conditions for page inscriptions, format, and supplementary material in respect of registered newspapers and periodicals will be varied to meet more satisfactorily present day needs of publishers. Bulk Pre-sorted and Householder Mail Adjustments are being made to the postage rates for letters, other articles and registered books posted under the bulk presorted mail service. Many customers are taking advantage of these lower rates and the Post Office is benefiting from the econin omies of higher mail volumes and compliance with mandatory pre-sorting and other conditions. Rates for heavier weights have converted to a 2 ounce basis. In the Householder Service a reduction of up to per cent for postings over 100,000 is proposed in order to meet competition from private delivery contractors and retain existing business. This service will continue to pay its way because no sorting is required, the articles being addressed 8 simply to The Householder' and delivery is spread over several days. Other Postal Adjustments The rates for parcels will be increased, averaging 10 per cent for domestic and 20 per cent for overseas. The fees for many labour intensive special services, which fail to cover costs by a big margin, such as registered post, certified mail, and messenger delivery services will also be increased. However, the maximum compensation payable on registered mail will be increased to $150 and compensation of up to $20 for loss or damage in respect of certified mail will be introduced. Regarding overseas mail, airmail letter rates will be increased by 5c per half ounce, 2c per half ounce in the case of New Zealand, and aerogrammes by 2c, because of cost increases in the handling component and the need to cover processing costs on incoming mail which is nearly twice the outgoing volume, despite a 25 per cent reduction in conveyance rates. British Commonwealth preference rates for overseas surface letters will be abolished; few Commonwealth countries have this now and Canada has just eliminated it. As far as the general public is concerned, this will have relatively little effect as their most common form of surface communication overseas is greeting cards which may be sent at the 7c printed papers rate proposed. A new rate category for all registered newspapers and periodicals, posted in bulk to overseas will also be introduced, the charge being the same as for category C in the domestic service. Other changes include a sliding scale of fees relating to volume, for business reply items, and an allowance of lc in the postage on grouped artices. I will elaborate further on the Rental grouping r j as I Continuous service exchanges in State capital city, Canberra and Newcastle local call areasExclusive service . .

I now turn to the new fees for broadcasting and television licences. These were referred to by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech. There will be no increase in the pensioner rate in either broadcasting or television licences fees. As to other areas, the broadcast listeners, hirers and lodging house licence fee for zone 1 will be increased from $6.50 to $8 and for zone 2 from $3.30 to $4.25. The television viewers licence fee will increase from $14 to $19 and the combined receiving licence, to cover both broadcasting and television, will increase from $20 to $26.50, and a new combined lodging house licence will be included with a fee at $26.50. All the proposed adjustments are detailed in tables, copies of which are being made available to honourable members. With the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate these tables in Hansard.

139,Mr FAIRBAIRN,REVIEW OF SERVICE GROUP PAY,"Farrer-Minister for Defence and Minister for Education and Science)-by leave;- I should like to amplify the brief reference made by the Treasurer to the increases in pay included in the Estimates in respect of other ranks of the armed Services. It should be realised that the increased expenditure provision does not merely connote a pay increase, but marks a major change in the philosophy and system of other ranks pay as recommended by the Committee of Inquiry into Financial Terms and Conditions of Service Employment. In accordance with the Government's policy of ensuring the justice and adequacy of financial and other conditions of service of the armed Services, this Committee was set up in October 1970 under the chairmanship of the Honourable Mr Justice John R. Kerr, C.M.G., a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, with other distinguished members having experience of the armed forces, conciliation and arbitration, commerce and industry and the Commonwealth Public Service. The Committee also has a senior serving officer from each of the armed Services attached to it in a consultative role. Under its terms of reference, the Kerr Committee is required to examine the prinJuly ciples for determining officers' pay, NA (As from 1st October 1971) Existing charges New charges Ordinary Pensioner Ordinary Pensioner rate rate rat: rate $ s S $ 6.50 1.00 8.00 1.00 3.30 0.70 4.25 0.70 14.0. 3.00 19.00 3.00 20.00 4.00 26.50 4.00 26.50 practical working of the group pay system for other ranks, the nature and incidence of the demands and exigencies of Service life and various compensatory allowances. In relation to the matters before it, the Committee has sought and received the views of Service boards, relevant Commonwealth departments, serving servicemen of SYSTEM all ranks and other interested persons and organisations. It has also visited ships of the fleet at sea, Service establishments in Australia, bases in Singapore and Malaysia and operational units in South Vietnam to securefirst-handknowledge and experience of the wide variety of service employments and conditions of work, and life in the Services. Wide-ranging discussions of both a formal and informal nature have been a feature of the Committee's inquiries, and these are continuing. Quite early in its inquiries the Committee decided that it was necessary to give priority attention to the particular term of reference relating to the pay of other ranks ib the Services and this approach was endorsed by the Minister for Defence. The outcome of this was report No. 1, entitled 'The Group Pay System', which was made available to honourable members and to the Press with the approval of the Government on 11th June 1971. A brief supplementary report No. 2 has since been submitted by the Committee on the same subject recommending amended pay rates in the light of certain changes in the pay rates of trades and associated staffs in the Commonwealth Public Service. These changes, which flowed from a consent determination issued by the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator on 8th 1971 became effective after the date the of submission of report No. 1 but were foreshadowed in that report, which requested that, if and when approved, these changes be referred back to the Committee for further consideration. This consideration resulted in further increases to all of the pay levels and the non-commissioned officer pay scales recommended in report No. 1. The Kerr Committee stated that it had considered and rejected the alternative of applying this increase only to those Service employments which have hitherto been aligned with the Commonwealth Public Service grades now granted an increase. Bearing in mind all the difficulties and anomalies which this process had generated in the past, the Committee stated that it proposed to adopt the course of placing new values on the pay levels established by report No. 1. The group pay system is based on concept of aligning Service employments with civilian trades for pay purposes. Introduced originally with the Services pay code in 1947, the system was expanded to seven groups by the Allison Committee 1958. A further review in 1968 greatly extended the number of groups and mend applied the system for the first Navy. While it endorsed the concept of relating Service pay to equivalent civilian rates on a broad basis, the Kerr Commitdations tee found that the progression towards alignment of Service employments with a multitude of specific civilian trades, all undergoing pay changes in an uncocentage ordinated way, was disruptive and counterwill productive so far as Service pay satisfacfrom tion was concerned. The Committee cised the pay turbulence within the Sertranslated vices resulting from the constant variation of outside awards with which Service employments are aligned, the constant and irritating changes in pay relativities between different Service employments due to the erratic influence of independent civilian award movements, the lengthy responsibilities delays in the system, the inconsistencies which resulted from using a variety of Federal, State and Commonwealth Public rently Service awards as alignments points, and the anomalies and inadequacies in the pay margins allowed for senior NCO ranks. The Committee concluded that an extenCommittee sive change was necessary and recommendrates ed the immediate introduction of a new pay system based on an 'industry' approach in which Service employments up to corfor poral level will no longer be aligned with multiplicity of individual civilian trades but will form a co-ordinated pattern, divided into six broad pay levels. Stable internal relativities will be established and broad alignment maintained with general wage levels in outside industry and the Commonwealth Public Service. In relation to the ranks from sergeant to warrant officer class 1, the Committee recommended a structure designed to systematise and improve NCO pay margins, thus recognising the added responsibility which comes with increasing rank. Associated with this is a basic change in concept under which sergeant, staff sergeant and warrant officer rank will receive a uniform incremental scale of pay instead of group pay. Above the rank of corporal and its equivalent, no differential will be included for trade skill, the emphasis being placed on the common responsithe bility for supervision and management. Additionally, the Committee emphasised its strong view that proper pay relativities in respect of Service employment can only in be determined ultimately by a systematic work value study and went on to recomthat an intensive work value examitime to the nation be undertake. Because the Committee recommeninvolve a concept of Service pay which is significantly different from that which currently applies to other ranks pay, all members will not receive the same perincrease in pay. Some members inevitably benefit more than others the broad-banding process whereby a critilarge number of pay groups were into 6 pay levels. In other cases, certain members will benefit from the application of market rates, while other members have already received this benefit. The largest increases will be given to warrant officers and senior NCOs in conformity with the concept of recognising the of rank. Although the final rates for these ranks will be uniform, the increases cannot be uniform as NCOs curreceive differing rates of pay according to their respective trade skills. However, the introduction of the new system will bring pay increases to most other rank members of Australia's armed forces. The clearly indicated that the pay which it had recommended for the various pay levels had regard to the rates paid by the Commonwealth Public Service relevant trade and technical skills in a various forms of Crown employment. This is not to say that individual Service employments are equated with specific trades in the Public Service. The Committee commented that it had in mind that members of the armed services are employed by the Crown, and that it seemed lo the Committee entirely sensible that there should be, in general, equality of financial terms and conditions of employment between members of the armed forces and Commonwealth employees. In reaching its recommendations the Kerr Committee concluded that the special service allowance of $146 a year which was introduced by the Government in 1964 as an incentive to recruitment and re-engagement, was an over award payment appropriate to the period when service pay rates were related primarily to minimum award rates rather than market rates. With the new concept now being introduced, the Committee recommended that it should be consolidated in the rates of pay instead of remaining as a separate allowance. The Committee of Inquiry gave particumachinery lar attention to the pay of servicewomen. Servicewomen do not receive the special ment. service allowance, so that the consolidation of this allowance into pay will eliminate this difference between male and female rates of pay. At the private level, servicewith women will now receive 95 per cent of male rates, as in the general community, progressing to 100 per cent on 1st January 1972. Above the private level, rank marcourse gins for servicewomen are assessed on basis of the difference in responsibilities compared with those of equivalent male ranks. The Committee observed that analyService sis of comparative responsibilities was matter for the full work value inquiry in the meantime, it recommended that the rank margin for servicewomen be raised 80 per cent of the male margin. The ernment accepted these recommendations indicated. and agreed that servicewomen's rates of pay should be reviewed during the work value examination. The Kerr Committee was not required by its terms of reference to deal with pay of citizen forces and therefore made no recommendation in this regard. ever, in conformity with past practice and the Government's desire to lend every encouragement to the citizen forces, it decided to apply the increased pay levels to other ranks in the citizen forces using appropriate comparative levels of skill. The Committee considered that early commencement of a work value study of Service employments was essential and offered to undertake this task, emphasising the extent of its accumulated knowledge on the subject, and the interaction with some of the remaining terms of reference yet to be dealt with by the Committee. The Government has agreed that this task should be undertaken by the Committee. In developing its concept of an industrytype approach to Service pay the Committee emphasised the need for periodic systematic, review of pay rates in lieu of the present system of numerous uncoordinated adjustments resulting from individual trade links with outside industrial awards. The Committee suggested that these reviews might not be limited to fixed intervals but made as necessary to maintain comparative wage justice in the light of general wage movements in the community. Initially, such reviews will be associated with the studies being carried out by the Committee of Inquiry while it continues in being. The Government will later announce what of review will be established after the Committee completes its assignThe Government has decided that the new pay scales will become effective forthfrom the commencement of the next pay period which is 26th August 1971 foi the RAAF and 27th August 1971 for Army and Navy. It will not be possible of to effect payment immediately. This the is not merely a pay increase but a major change in the structure of Service pay, which will require extensive amendment of pay regulations. This is a coma plicated process which experience has but shown will take up to 3 months. Efforts are being made to shorten this process as to far as possible. When made, payment will Govbe retrospective to the dates I have All of the recommendations contained in the No. 1 report of the Kerr Committee as amended by the No. 2 report have been accepted by the Government. The Govern the ment had the benefit of the views of the Services and its defence advisers and all Howsupported the changes now introduced. The proposed daily rates of active pay for male and female other ranks as recomhas mended in report No. 2 of the Kerr Committee are contained in the attached schedules, which with the concurrence of honourable members.

For the convenience of honourable members, I have summarised the new rates of active pay on an annual basis. Recruits will receive $2,358. Privates and their equivalents in the Navy and RAAF will receive from $2,445 to $4,036 depending on the pay level to which their particular skill assigns them. Lance-corporals will receive from $2,565 to $4,157. Corporals will receive from $2,774 to $4,361. Sergeants will receive from $3,022 to $4,934 depending on their starting point on promotion or translation to the rank, and then on years of service in the rank. Staff Sergeants will receive from $4,934 to $6,234. Warrant Officers class 2 from $5,909 to $6,234, and Warrant Officers class 1 from $6,584 to $6,935. In general these are the rates applicable to single men living in service quarters. Married men receive further allowances totalling $712 per annum, and in addition all members receive uniform allowance, free medical and dental attention and other benefits. The total cost of the approved increases including those for the citizen forces, in a full year will be approximately $34m. The cost for 1971-72 will be a little over $29m. As I have indicated, the reports on group pay are only the first, though a very important stage in the Kerr Committee inquiry. Work is proceeding on the other terms of reference, including the principles and levels which should apply to officers pay, and the demands and exigencies of Service life, together with some special references on certain allowances, such as education allowance and temporary rental allowance. To these items will now be added the very important task of directing the work value examination which the Committee sees as the only satisfactory basis for determination of Service pay relativities. Finally, I should like to take this tunity of commending the excellent work which Mr Justice Kerr and his Committee have carried out to the present time. The unqualified acceptance by the Government of all the recommendations made by the Committee in relation to other ranks pay is a demonstration both of confidence in the Committee and the Government's determinnation to provide financial and other conditions of service sufficient to attract and retain men and women with the needed qualities, skills and experience for the Australian Forces.

140,Mr BARNARD,OF ACTIVE PAY FOR FEMALE OTHER RANKS," by leave The statement of the Minister for Defence (Mr Fairbaim) outlines pay increases for other ranks of the armed forces. It supplements the preliminary statement of the Kerr Committee which was released by the Minister's predecessor on 11th June. The estimates contained in that statement have been revised because of higher pay rates in relevant sections of the Public Service. In effect, what the Minister has done is to revise and clarify certain aspects of the initial report of the Kerr Committee in the light of the supplementary report made by the Committee. This had meant an increase in the cost of the changes recommended by the Kerr Committee and adopted by the Government. The whole area of pay increases for the Services is an immeasurably complex one, and I have not had the time to study the comparative pay rates in detail. What is important is that the Government has accepted the recommendation and has introduced them promptly. This is commendable because the Government had to be goaded into appointing the Kerr Committee. It took a considerable amount of pressure from sections of this Parliament to force the Government's hand. Belatedly, the Government realised the extent of Service unrest over pay and conditions and has acted to improve them and remove anomalies. At first sight, the reforms in the oppor- pay structures seem to be good ones. Undoubtedly, there will be anomalies with the introduction of these broad pay groupings. However, the great majority of other ranks will benefit. It is also gratifying that recognition has been given to simplifying the complex and unwieldy structure of allowances for all 3 Services. I hope that further substantial reforms will be made in this structure. It is encouraging that the Kerr Committee is to proceed with an intensive work value study of Service jobs. There has been some confusion on this point which has been removed by the Minister. This work value study is immensely important for the whole status and remuneration of Australian servicemen and women. I have seen some of the submissions presented to the Kerr Committee on this matter and the mass of evidence available will enable the Committee to assess for the first time the value of Service jobs relative to citizen employment. It is just and appropriate that the increased pay rates recommended by the Kerr Committee will be extended to members of the civilian forces. The Kerr Committee has made an encouraging start to the massive task it has undertaken. It is to be hoped that the Committee's recommendations will be brought quickly before the Government and transmitted to the thousands of servicemen and women who will benefit by better pay and conditions. These brief comments are a response to a quick reading of. the Minister's statement. The Opposition welcomes these reforms and hopes that the House will be able to debate them in greater detail later in the session. May 1 also say in conclusion that I join with the Minister in congratulating Kerr Committee. The Minister may recall my initial objection, if I may use that term, to the appointment of a committee because I thought it would have been better had a select committee of the Parliaon: ment been appointed. I point out, however, that I did not direct my objection to the Kerr Committee specifically. The Committee which was appointed under the chairOther manship of Mr Justice Kerr acted promptly, I think efficiently, and certainly very comprehensively in relation to the matters applies. it was asked to investigate. Therefore, I join with the Minister in expressing behalf of the Opposition our appreciation to the Committee of the very valuable tribution it made towards preventing what, if it had been allowed to continue, would have amounted to continued unrest in relaof tion to pay and conditions in the 3 Serrelated vices.",159

House adjourned at 9.54 p.m. The following answers to questions (Question No. 1883) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for export National Development, upon notice: (1) Were duty free imports of caustic soda for export alumina production valued at less than $500,000 during 1965-66 and over $2,500,000 during 1968-69. (2) If so, would this, apart from similar amounts imported at low duty, have attracted over $900,000 at full rates of duty in 1968-69. (3) Has his Department provided the Treasury with information to assist in the assessment of whether the prices received for export alumina exhibit a reasonable profit for the purposes of assessing company tax, considering that the purchasers are mainly foreign companies which own Australian alumina works. (4) If full duty was charged, would the price of alumina be thereby increased beyond competitive world market levels.",161
147,Mr SWARTZ,PRIVILEGES COMMITTEE,"The answer to the able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. Rates of duty applying to imports caustic soda during 1968-69 were 25 per cent General and 15 per cent Preferential. If imports of caustic soda for alumina production in 1968-69 had been subject to these rates, the duty payable would have been approximately $635,000. (3) 1 refer the Honourable Member to the answer provided by the Treasurer to Question No. 1882 (Hansard 30th October Page 3194). In his administration of the income tax legislation, the Commissioner of Taxation is empowered to shows require any person to furnish him with information as he may require. Accordingly, the Commissioner has the requisite authority to make yes. his own enquiries into prices received for alumina exported overseas. (4) The attention of the Honourable Member drawn to the conclusions reached by the Tariff Board in its report on Chlorine and Sodium Hydroxide released by the then Deputy' Prime tured Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr MCEwen, on 6th November 1969. In that report, the Board put forward the view that on the inforregistered mation available there seemed little doubt that alumina industry in Australia could, at least the time being, retain a substantial export trade without the Benefit of the by-law arrangement. However, the Board also recognised that should the cost of sodium hydroxide be raised, this could affect the alumina industry's ability to continue expanding its exports and could result in decisions by international companies involved in the try to locate new plants outside Australia. In view of the importance of alumina exports to the Ausposition tralian economy, the Board believed that the risks involved in imposing a duty on sodium hydroxide used in the production of export alumina were not warranted by the potential benefit NA upon notice were circulated: Alumina chlorine and sodium hydroxide industry. These views were accepted by the Government and the arrangement whereby producers of alumina for secured supplies of caustic soda under by-law was continued. Chemical Sprays (Question No. 1971) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Primary Industry upon notice: (1) Is he able to say whether the prices of chemical spray materials in New Zealand are as much as 50 per cent lower than those in Australia. (2) If so, does this give New Zealand orchardists a considerable advantage over Australian orchardists. (3) Is he able to say whether the difference m price is due to the Government of New Zealand permitting the entry of spray materials duty free and, in other cases hy paying a subsidy to producers to keep costs down so enabling orchardists honourto compete on exports markets. (4) Will be order a review of the competitiveness of Australian orchardists, giving particuif lar attention to the cost of chemical sprays. (5) Will the Government consider extending assistance to the Australian orchardists similar to that enjoyed by the New Zealand orchardists.",162
148,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A comparison of the price paid for chemical sprays in New Zealand and the Australian list price (which is subject to a variety of discount's) that overall New Zealand prices are somesuch what lower than the Australian price. (2) In respect to chemical sprays, the answer is (3) The majority of insecticides and fungicides used by New Zealand orchardists are imported is duty free. Most weed killers are imported duty free from British Commonwealth sources; these are subject to a 10 per cent duty when manufacin other countries. In 1969 a system of weedcide and pesticide subsidies was introduced in New Zealand. It applies to herbicides and insecticides by the Agricultural Chemicals Board the and approved by the Department of Agriculture, for and does not include compounds which are used solely as fungicides. The scheme provides for a 50 subsidy on the exfactory price. For administrative purposes this, is taken to mean 42i per cent of the price paid by retailers, and the subsidy is claimed at this rate from the Department of Agriculture by registered manufacturers or imporindusters on the basis of certified sales.

Territory representatives attended 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24lh World Health Assembly. Territory representative attended Second General Course on Malaria in Manila, 1970. WHO consultant visited TPNG in 1968 and submitted a report on a Public Health Nursing WHO representative appointed Advisory Consultant foT a Nursing Advisory Services Project. Territory represented at 3rd Regional Training 7,840 Course on National Health Planning. Forty-three WHO fellowships awarded to TPNG for special study and training in health matters not available in the Territory or Australia. WHO Regional Adviser on Nutrition visited TPNG to explore Administration's interest in participating in Applied Nutrition Education and Training project. WHO Medical Nutritionist visited TPNG in 1968 to carry out survey on medical nutrition. Regular WHO seminars and workshops have been attended by Territory personnel. (j) From International Telecommunication Union (ITU): Two Territory representatives attended an I.T.U. Seminar on Organisation and Management of Telecommunication services in November 1970. A Territory representative attended an l.T.U. seminar on Broadcasting Technology in December 1970. I.T.U. Regional Telecommunications Adviser visited TPNG to report on possible I.T.U. assistance to TPNG during 1969. (k) From International Monetary Fund (IMF): IMF Consultant spent one month in 1969 studying PNG taxation.. - Projects marked with an asterisk (*) are UNDP {irojects, with (he appropriate specialised agency actng as executing agency for UNDP. (1) General: The Administering Authority has continued to co-operate with the organs of the United Nations and with the Specialised Agencies in furnishing reports and other information in relation to the . Territory. PNG became an associate member of ECAFE after the Economic and Social Council of the UN, at its 49th Session, passed a resolution to this effect and approved it without objection in 1970. The Territory was represented for the first time at meetings of ECAFE during January/February 1971. Territory representatives are included in Australia's delegations or attend meetings of the Specialised Agencies when it appears that the subject matter will be of interest to the Territory. Fot example, Territory representatives have attended the 49th, 50th, 52nd, 53rd and 54th Sessions of the International Labour Conference; a Territory representative attended an FAO/ILO/UNESCO World Conference on Agricultural Education and Training during 1970; Territory personnel attended the WHO Inter-Regional Conference on Medical Education in developing countries and the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th WHO Regional Committee Meetings. The specialised publications issued by the agencies are received in the Territory and are considered of particular value. Additionally, the Territory is visited from time lo time by representatives of the UNDP and the Specialised Agencies to review progress with various assistance projects and consider possible future projects. The Territory has received considerable additional benefit from the United Nations Specialised Agencies through the South Pacific Commission. The Commission, which is not itself a United Nations Specialised Agency was set up by countries responsible for territories in the region, collaborates closely with and frequently seeks expert help from the Specialised Agencies in providing assistance through its regional projects to meet the particular needs of dependent territories in the South Pacific Region-includin g Papua and New Guinea. Assistance received by the Territory from this source includes specialised help from the following(i) joint SPC/WHO projects on health problems and conditions found in the territories including(i) refresher course on Tuberculosis, (ii) course on Vital and Health statistics, (iii) maternal and child welfare, (iv) youth work, (v) sanitation, (vi) community health education, (vii) nutrition, (viii) epidemiology, (ix) training of health workers.

(2) How many (a) Aboriginal and (b) other Australian children in the Northern Territory attend (i) Administration and (ii) mission (A) primary and (B) secondary schools. (3) How many (a) Aboriginal and (b) other Australian children from the Northern Territory are assisted to receive (i) primary, (ii) secondary, (iii) university and (iv) other education elsewhere in Australia, and what is the nature and cost of such assistance in each category. Mr Fairbaim-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The details which follow have been derived from information supplied to me by my colleague the Minister for the Interior as well as from the resources of my own Department. (1) The estimated number of children of school age living in the Northern Territory (at least 5 years and under 16 years) are: (a) Aboriginal: 5,496 (Northern Territory Administration estimate at 16th April 1971) (b) Other: 12,654 (Department of the Interior estimate as at 31st March 1971) (2) (a) and (b), (i) and (i i ) , (A) and (B) The following tables show enrolments in Northern Territory Community Schools operated by my Department and enrolments in ' schools operated by the Welfare Branch of the Northern Territory Administration.

Independent schools (a) Including 4 in infant grades. The number of non-Aboriginal children attending special schools on settlements, missions and pastoral properties at 28th February 1971 was 154. (3) (a) and (b) Because of the diversity of schemes of assistance available and because it has not always been possible to provide the information strictly in accordance with the classification requested by the Honourable Member, the information given below is classified broadly into assistance provided by the Department of Education and Science and that provided by the Northern Territory Administration. NA NA (i) Assistance given to Aboriginal and other Australian children to receive primary education is confined to those receiving such education within the Northern Territory. (ii) Secondary Education Scheme or Type of Assistance Commonwealth My Department does not Secondary extract statistics from Scholarship Scheme its records of scholarship holders which Commonwealth classify students in Technical accordance with their Scholarship Scheme home address. Consequently I am not aole to provide the information requested by the Honourable Member in relation to these schemes.

Aboriginal Study Six Aboriginal students Grants Scheme from the Northern Northern Territory Between 30 and 40 stuTertiary dents, none of whom Scholarship Scheme are Aboriginals,, are Other Forms of Assistance Boarding Allowances. These allowances to primary and secondary school children who must live away from home to attend school. usual definition which is applied to the need to live away from home is that suitable education provision is not available within 10 miles child's home. The allowances range from $250 to $370 p.a. depending' on the operation of a means test. About 75 per cent receive the maximum allowance. In 1971 an estimated 450 pupils follows: including some Aboriginals, are receiving an allowance and about one third of the total are Sydney attending school outside the Northern Territory. Travelling Allowances. Pupils who must live away from home to attend a school located within the Northern Territory receive reimbursement either of a return fare or a mileage allowance each term. Those attending school in a State receive reimbursement once per annum. Normally the entitlement to such travelling allowances would be determined on the same basis as the entitlement to a boarding allowance. In 1971 approximately 450 pupils, including some Aboriginals, will receive a travelling allowance and about one third of the total are attending school outside the Northern Territory. Tertiary Air Fares. Students from the Northern Territory doing tertiary studies tralia are reimbursed for cost of one return air Kensington . . fare each year to and from their place of study. Some 55 students are expected to benefit from this scheme in 1971 and the cost is estimated at $7700. Other forms of assistance such as Conveyance Allowance payable to parents for the use of private cars or other vehicles for transporting children to school in areas where buses are not available, reimbursement of the Queensland University Surcharge, the Secondary Book Allowance and the Free Primary Books and Materials Territory were entitled Scheme are all confined to students who are to receive benefits studying in the Northern Territory. under this scheme for study outside the NORTHERN TERRITORY ADMINISTRATION Northern Territory at Assistance is given to Aboriginal children to the beginning of 1971. receive education elsewhere in Australia as folIn addition to fees fulllows: time students may receive up to $1,200 (i) primary-nil . living allowance and (ii) secondary- 3 book allowance in any (iii) university-ni l one year.

155,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENCE,"the Minister total). for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Why is it that the salaries of certain officers employed by the Commonwealth Railways and only. referred to in question No. 2242 (Hansard, 18th February 1971, pages 198-9) do not come within the scope of his Department's co-ordinating responsibility. (2) Do any of the employees of the Common35,371 wealth Railways come within the scope of his Department's co-ordinating responsibility. (3) If so, what is the reason for excluding others. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2) and (3) Under the Commonwealth's coordination arrangements, the Public Service Board has statutory responsibilities Departments and certain authorities. It is expected that authorities not linked statutorily with the Board will abide by the spirit of these arrangements by co-ordinating with the Board as to administrative staff. Departments and authorities not coming within the above arrangements are required to consult with my Department as to employees' wages. The salaries of the officers referred to in Question No. 2242 are related to those of Second Division officers in the Commonwealth Public Service and, consequently, the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner filed the application to vary rates of pay to reflect increases which had been granted to Second Division Officers. The matter merely involved the extension of a decision in one area to relate classification in another. Federal Awards: Inspections (Question No. 2657)",171
156,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENCE,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) What was the percentage of the total inspections of federal awards carried out by State Inspectors in each of the past 10 years for which figures are available. (2) What was the percentage of the total inspections of State prescriptions carried out by Commonwealth Inspectors in each of the past 10 years for which figures are available. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Reciprocal inspection arrangements exist in New South Wales, Western Australia, and Tasmania. Records of inspections of Commonwealth awards by State inspectors are available in New South Wales only and there from May, .1968. In the years 1968 (May to December), 1969 and 1970, the total number of inspections in New South Wales of Commonwealth awards was 4,145, 6,620 and 6,697, respectively. Of this number, the State Inspectors carried out 169 inspections in the relevant period of 1968 (4 per cent of the total), 266 inspections in 1969 (4 per cent of the total) and 243 inspections in 1970 (3.6 per cent of the (2) The comparable information relating to the inspection of State prescriptions is available in New South Wales for the years 1969 and 1970 It relates to industrial inspections i.e., inspections under the State Industrial Arbitration, Annual Leave and Long Service Leave Acts. In the years 1969 and 1970, the total number of industrial inspections of State prescriptions was and 29,718, respectively. Of this number, the Commonwealth Inspectors carried out 470 inspections in 1969 (J.3 per cent of the total) and 1,430 in 1970 (4.8 per cent of the total). Trade Union Rules (Question No. 2663)",171
157,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENCE,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon in respect to staffs of notice: (1) Is it in the public interest that union rules should not be contrary to law or be oppressive, unreasonable or unjust and that all lawful rules of a union should be observed by all persons who are under an obligation to observe those rules. (2) If so, will he consider the desirability of formulating regulations which will ensure thai no individual person shall be personally required to meet any of the costs of legal action taken by him under sections 140 and 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to protect the public interest. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. In ss. 140 and 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1970 there are provisions designed to secure the standards referred to by ihe honourable member and to enable members of organisations to ensure that those standards are adhered to. (2) Provision already exists under regulation 138 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations for the Registrar to direct that financial assistance shall be given by the Commonwealth to a member of an organisation who proposes to take proceedings under ss. 140 or 141 of the Act. The extent of that assistance is at the discretion of the Registrar. Atomic Waste (Question No. 2689) D r Cass asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) What sort of radionuclides are expected to occur as waste products from the nuclear reactor at Jervis Bay. (2) What will be the method of disposal of these waste products. (3) What will be the method of disposal wastes other than radionuclides, such as organic liquids, low concentration heavy water and iron-59 thermal-shielding-cooling system bleed, to mention some. (4) Have any investigations been maximum permissible annual radionuclide intake amongst members of the general public through the distribution of affected primary products of any description. (5) What is the maximum permissible annual relative radionuclide intake in terms of doses to 'critical would in organs' amongst local residents near the reactor.",171
158,Mr SWARTZ,SCIENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The sort of radioactive wastes which will occur from the nuclear reactor at Iervis Bay and the methods employed to dispose of these products will depend very much on which type of reactor is chosen. An exact answer cannot therefore be given until the choice has been made. However, all the reactors finally examined were in the class known as 'water reactors' and the following general comments apply to these reactors which for convenience are considered in two classes, direct cycle and indirect cycle. Direct cycle systems have the turbine driven by steam produced in the reactor core from the coolant water. Indirect cycle systems have separate loops for the core coolant and the turbine steam circuit, heat being transferred from the former to the latter in a heat exchanger. The remarks deal with the three types of radioactive wastes produced, airborne, aqueous and solid and thefiguresin brackets after the radionuclides are their respective half lives. The half life is the time required for the radioactivity of a radionuclide to decay to half its original intensity. This decay continues progressively; i.e. after two half lives, the intensity will be one quarter the original, after three, one eighth and so on. Airborne Indirect cycle reactors produce small volumes of airborne waste which are retained for a time to allow radioactive decay. As a result of this decay, the gases finally discharged contain only minute quantities of krypton-85 (10.27 years) and occasionally xenon-133 (5.2 days). In direct cycle reactors the retention time is less. Radioactive decay is therefore not possible in Storage and the practice normally employed is dilute the partially decayed gas with excess air and release from a high stack. The stack discharge would contain small amounts of tritium (10.26 years) argon-41 (1.83 hours), xenon-133 (5.2 days), xenon-135 (9.2 hours), krypton-83m (1.9 hours), krypton-85 (10.27 years) and kryptonprogramme 88 (2.8 hours). It may be seen from the half lives that with the exception of the tritium and kryppower ton-85 which in any case are well below internatexceeded. ionally accepted levels, the airborne radioactive wastes will quickly decay away. Some fluorine-18 (1.8 hours) may be in the stack discharge, but races of iodine-131 (8.05 days) which may enter the steam circuit would be removed by filtration. Aqueous The total radioactivity which would be dislimits charged in aqueous effluent at far below internatInternational ionally accepted levels would be very small and of 3 types, activated corrosion products such as cobalt-58 (71 days), cobalt-60 (5.27 years) and (45 days), tritium, and mixedfissionproducts of which minute traces of iodine-129 (16 million years) and iodine-131 (8.05 days) would be made into the the most important. Direct cycle reactors are likely to have a greater total release of radioactivity while heavy water reactors will have a higher tritium release than will light water reactors. These remarks are the sense that the amounts discharged always be well below internationally accepted levels. Solid Neglecting the fission products retained in the used fuel elements, the main sources of solid radioactive waste would be the filter sludge, spention-exchange resins and filters and the residues from concentration of liquid waste. The important radionuclides would therefore be the same as for liquid waste. Solid waste would be stored for eventual disposal at a national centre, the method of disposal depending upon its activity level and physical form. Other forms of solid waste such as contaminated tools and materials would be handled similarly. (3) Wastes other than radionuclides, with the exception of heavy water, would be classed as normal industrial wastes and treated in a fashion appropriate for such materials. Heavy water because of its value, would, where economically possible, be recovered. (4) Considerable attention has, and still is, being given to this problem. A Working Party with representatives from the Commonwealth Department of Health's Commonwealth X-Ray and Radium Laboratory, the N.S.W. Department of Health, the Fisheries Branch of the N.S.W. Chief Secretary's Department, the N.S.W. Electricity Commission and the Atomic Energy Commission was established over a year ago to ensure that this matter was properly investigated. Accordingly a comprehensive site environmental studies programme has been under way for some time now, to gather the data for this work. Most of the necessary data has now been collected. However, the maximum annual radionuclide to intake amongst members of the general public from local primary produce is determined by the exposure limits recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Operations at Jervis Bay will be based on one tenth of these recommended limits and a continual monitoring of all locally produced primary produce will be carried out throughout the life of the station to ensure that these limits are not (5) Exposure of the public living in the vicinity of the nuclear power station will be kept below the limits recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council in the publication entitled 'Revised Radiation Standards for Individuals Exposed to High Ionising Radiation'. These are similar to those recommended by the Commission on ""Radiological Protecof tion. The relevant parts of the document dealing with those limits for members of the public is as follows: -1. DOSE LIMITS FOR MEMBERS OF THE The dose limitation for members of the public is a more theoretical concept than the maximum permissible doses for persons ionising radiation as the result of their employment Whereas it is practicable to monitor the radiation doses of the individuals in the latter group, the dose limits recommended in these radiation Protection Standards for the of the public are intended to provide standards for the design and operation of radiation sources so that it is not likely that individuals in the public will receive more than a specified dose. The effectiveness of the design and sonal operating procedures are, with respect to bers of the public, not normally monitoring of individual doses but are assessed through sampling procedures in the environhighest ment, through area monitoring and through control of the sources from which the exposure may arise. The actual doses received, as a result of a certain use of ionising radiation, within a group of the public may vary, depending on such factors as differences in their age, size, metabolism and customs as well as variation in their environment. These factors impossible to derive the maximum doses that might be received individually. In practice, acceptable to use for the purpose of the assess the ment, a group representative of those individif uals in the public expected to receive the est dose. It is recommended that the mean dose of this group be compared with the relevant dose limits recommended in Table 3. These dose limits do not take into account radiation exposure from natural background radiation or that received by members of the public through the medical and dental use of ionising radiation tions'.

159,Mr HAYDEN,SCIENCE,"the Treasurer, upon follows: notice: (1) What would be the estimated increase in taxation revenue if payments on personal insurance policies were removed from the list of allowable taxation deductions. (2) How many taxpayers claimed a deduction for personal insurance policies in each of the last 5 years. (3) How many of these taxpayers claimed (a) PUBLIC less than $200, (b) between $200 and less than $400 and (c) so on, up to the limit. (4) What amount of tax revenue was forgone, exposed to in each of these groups. (5) Can he provide from recent data on personal income expenditure patterns in Australia, details of the amount the average Australian wage earner, in different income groups, spends each members year on personal insurance policies. (6) Is it a fact that only taxpayers in upper income groups can afford to set aside hundreds ot dollars every year to invest substantially in perinsurance policies; if so, is it these taxpaymemers who gain most benefit from the existence of checked by the these deductions. (7) Is it a fact that the marginal tax rale is for those taxpayers in the upper income groups; if so, do these taxpayers stand to benefit most from the continuing existence of deductions for personal insurance policies. (8) Why does the Government allow this particby individuals ular deduction. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honmake it ourable member's question is as follows: (1) No taxation statistics are available that it is would enable an accurate estimate to be made of gain to income tax revenue that would result payments in respect of personal insurance polihighcies were not allowed as income tax deductions. However, using published statistics of premiums received by insurance companies in respect of life insurance and personal accident insurance business in Australia and of employees' contributions to superannuation funds, in conjunction with statistics of income tax deductions allowed under sec82H of the Income Tax Assessment Act, a broad estimate has been made to the order of the Table 3 revenue forgone by the allowance of income tax Dose limits for deductions for payments in respect of life and a calendar year personal accident insurance. On this basis, it is for members of estimated that income tax revenue would be the public approximately $125m greater if payments on life Rems and personal accident insurance policies in respect of taxpayers, their spouses and children were not 0.5 allowed as income tax deductions. (2) and (3) Statistics of taxpayers who were 1.5 allowed deductions for payments in respect of personal insurance policies only are not available. 3 However, statistics have been compiled of deduc3 tions allowed to taxable individuals under section 82H of the Income Tax Assessment Act, i.e., of 7.5 deductions allowed for payments in respect of 1.5 life, sickness and accident insurance premiums and for payments to a friendly society, superannuation, sustentation or similar fund. The number Taxation of taxable individuals who were allowed deductions under section 82H in the most recent years for which these statistics were compiled are as Number ot Income Year Taxpayers 1964-65 2,715,971 1965-66 2,779,879 1967-68 2,969,924 In addition statistics of numbers of taxable individuals who were allowed deductions under section 82H m respect of the 1967-68 income year were classified by: (a) size of deduction allowed under section 82H, and (b) grade of actual income of taxpayer. These statistics are set out in Schedule 1.39 (page 106) of 'Taxation Statistics 1968-69', the supplement to the 48th Report of the Commissioner of Taxation. (4) No statistics are available that would enable reliable estimates to be made of the revenue foregone classified by size of income tax deductions allowed for payments in respect of personal insurance policies. (5) The information requested is not available. (6) No. Schedule 1.39 indicates that large numbers of taxpayers in the lower and middle income groups claim deductions under section 82H. (7) Under a progressive rate scale, it is axiomatic that the marginal rate of tax rises with taxable income. Those receiving comparatively large benefits as a result of deductions allowed for superannuation contributions would, of course, usually pay relatively higher rates of tax on their superannuation pensions on retirement (8) Successive Governments have endorsed the deductions allowable under section 82H which, inter alia, encourages a taxpayer to make provision for his retirement or for his dependants after his death. (Question No. 2754) Mr Cohen asked the Minister for craft, Defence, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a statement made by Dr Birrell, Melbourne Police Surgeon the Australian Study Week on Road Safety Pracfield tices, Melbourne, 1967, that the Armed have a severe accident and fatality problem concerning drunken driving. (2) Do his departmental records support this view. (3) If so, and in view of the great current interest in road safety, will he consider making public all departmental records problem so that research groups may further investigate methods of reducing the road toll. (4) If he is not prepared to publish this inforDepartment mation, is he prepared to allow qualified research groups, such as the New South Wales Traffic Accident Research Unit, access to departmental 1970. files covering this area. The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) Yes. But the statement is not accepted as substantiated. (2) The majority of road accidents involving servicemen occur off-duty when the personnel are travelling in private vehicles. These accidents are investigated by State authorities and are frequently not reported lo the Services except 16262/71-H-16 ) where servicemen are killed or seriously injured. Consequently, the Services do not have detailed records. (3) and (4) As mentioned in (2) the Services do not have comprehensive records of road accidents involving servicemen. The Services will support any practicable measures that may be taken to improve road safety, and would be prepared to discuss such measures with properly qualified research groups. Armed Forces (Question No. 2777) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) How many (a) servicemen and (b) servicewomen m the (i) Australian Army and (ii) Royal Australian Air Force are stationed in (A) Singapore and (B) Malaysia. (2) What heavy defence equipment is supplied for these forces. The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) (a) The Australian Army has about 1,500 Servicemen and 25 Servicewomen stationed in Singapore. Army also rotates a company through the Butterworlh base in Malaysia, (b) The Royal Australian Air Force has about 1,400 Servicemen and 25 Servicewomen in Malaysia. It also has a small Armed Forces number of Servicemen in Singapore. (2) Major equipments in the case of the Air Force include 2 squadrons of Mirage fighter airan air transport element of Dakotas, and Iroquois helicopter for search and rescue. In addition to normal infantry weapons and engineer and support equipment, Army equipments include 105 at millimetre howitzers employed by the artillery battery, and light observation helicopters of Forces the Army reconnaissance flight. Conciliation and Arbitration: Annual Report (Question No. 2780)",173
160,Mr WHITLAM,SCIENCE,"the Prime Minister, relating to this upon notice: On what date did his predecessor or his first receive a copy of the report by the President of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission dated 11th December",174
161,Mr MCMAHON,SCIENCE,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department first received the report from the Department of Labour and National Service for tabling purposes on 23rd February 1971. My predecessor indicated in the House on 25th February that while he hadnot had time to study remarks made in the report he had had a chance to look cursorily at them. The report he referred to was the one received by the Department. Conciliation and Arbitration (Question No. 2803),174
162,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENCE,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Does his Department propose to cancel the weekly visits of the Federal Arbitration Inspector to Ballarat. (2) Is if a fact that approximately two-thirds of the work force in Ballarat operate under Federal awards (3). If the position is as stated, will he reconsider the decision to cancel the visits of the Inspector. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. I am advised that the regular weekly visit was suspended temporarily. It has been restored. (2) It would be possible to compile from Departmental records and from statistics published by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics after the census in 1966 an estimate of the federal award coverage of the work force in Ballarat but I do not believe thai the considerpower able time and effort involved in so doing would be justified. (3) See answer to (1). (Question No. 2806) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: How many members of the Australian defence forces were charged with (a) dangerous driving, (b). driving under the influence and (c) exceeding the speed limit during (i) 1968, (ii) 1969 and (iii) 1970. The former Minister for Defence Gorton) supplied the following answer: The offences referred to are civil statutory offences for which servicemen are amendable like all citizens of the land to the ordinary laws of the land. The services would not be aware of the numbers of servicemen who are charged with the offences referred to when they are off. duty or otherwise engaged in pursuing their ordinary private lives. Service authorities are properly concerned with convictions for such offences when these convicNo. tions have some bearing on a servicemen's service. When this occurs the individual service takes appropriate action. (Question No. 2830)",175
163,Mr STEWART,SCIENCE,"the Minister for to (3)myI invite National Development, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether New Zealand authorities on nuclear power were of the opinion that the use of natural uranium fuel makes the most economic sense. (2) Can he also say if there has been any change of opinion in that country and, if there has, what were the reasons for the change.",175
164,Mr SWARTZ,SCIENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware of any official statements by the New Zealand authorities to this effect. (2) In the tight of the answer to the first question, I am not in a position to comment. Nuclear Power (Question No. 2833)",175
165,Mr STEWART,SCIENCE,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: What is the urgent need for Australia to introduce nuclear power based on technology which is likely to be superseded within a few years.",175
166,Mr SWARTZ,SCIENCE,The answer to the honourable member's question is.as follows: It is incorrect to say that any proposed nuclear station at Jervis Bay will be based on a technology which is likely to be superseded within a few years. No doubt the honourable member is making reference to the possibilityof fust breeder reactor systems superseding current thermal reactor systems. As stated on several previous Armed Forces occasions fast breeder systems hold great promise for the future but they are not yet commercially practicable. Accordingly they are not likely to supersede the current generation of reactors 'within a few years'. CANDU Reactor (Question No. 2834),175
167,Mr STEWART,SCIENCE,"the Minister for (Mr National Development, upon notice: (1) Can he say how many CANDU reactors are in commercial operation. (2) If so, where are they located, and what is the size of each reactor. (3) Is the CANDU reactor fully proved.",175

170,Mr SWARTZ,SCIENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) One. (2) The SGHW reactor is located at Winfrith, Dorset, United Kingdom and has a capacity ot 100 Megawatts. (3) 1 invite the honourable member's attention to my answer to his question No. 2843. Heavy Water (Question No. 2838)",176
171,Mr STEWART,SCIENCE,"the Minister for Australia National Development, upon notice: (1) Has the Australian Atomic Energy Commission conducted any experiments into the manufacment ture of heavy water. (2) if not, why not. (3) If experiments have been made in Australia, is he able to say how the results compare with any experiments conducted in New Zealand.",176
172,Mr SWARTZ,SCIENCE,"The answer to the honourpower able member's question is as follows: (1) No, apart from a few exploratory experiits ments on possible new methods of production. (2) There are several well-known and proven methods for the production of heavy water, and as yet there has been no need for the Commission to become involved in experimenting intensively its production. (3) See answer to (1) above and my answer (he honourable member's question No. 2837. Nuclear Power (Question No. 2839)",176
173,Mr STEWART,SCIENCE,"the Minister for tional National Development, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether the (a) Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and (b) People's Republic China have any nuclear power reactors. (2) If so, (a) how many reactors are in operanot tion in each country and (b) what is the each case.",176
174,Mr SWARTZ,SCIENCE,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) There are several nuclear power operating in the USSR. (b) There have been unconfirmed reports that there are nuclear power reactors in operation in the People's Republic of China. (2) (a) and (b). NA Name Capacity Type MWe Siberia 6x 100 Boiling water-graphit e Beloyarsk 1 94 Boiling water-graphit e Novovoronezh 1 196 Pressurised water Beloyarsk 2 . . 200 Boiling-graphit e Novovoronezh 2 365 Pressurised water Melekess 70 Boiling water. There is no detailed information available on reactors operating in the People's Republic of China. Nuclear Power (Question No. 2840),176
175,Mr STEWART,USSR,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Can he yet say what the estimated cost per kilowatt hour of nuclear generated electricity in will be using (a) natural uranium and (b) enriched uranium. (2) If so, can he supply a comparative stateshowing these costs in relation to electricity generated by conventional plants in Australia.",176
176,Mr SWARTZ,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In answer to somewhat similar questions I stated it was not possible to give answers in precise quantitative terms. The cost of nuclear generation in Australia will depend on a number of factors such as the size of the station, location, the financial conditions involved, the type of reactor, the degree of local content and so on. It is true that as a result of the assessment of the tenders received for the proposed Jervis Bay in nuclear power station we now have a better knowledge of the relative costs of electricity generated from reactors using natural uranium and to those using enriched uranium. This information, however, relates only to that particular station and as the tendered figures are necessarily confidential, I am not in a position to disclose them to the honourable member. (2) Costs of electricity generated by convenplants in Australia vary very much between individual plants because of variations in local conditions so that again a precise comparative statement between nuclear and conventional generof ation cannot be supplied. I would add, however, that under current conditions in Australia. I do believe that nuclear power stations are comtype in petitive with conventional ones. Nuclear Reactor (Question No. 2841)",176
177,Mr STEWART,USSR,"the Minister for reactors National Development, upon notice: (1) Did the tender documents for the proposed nuclear reactor at Jervis Bay stipulate the use of indigenous natural uranium after 5 years of operation. (2) Has there been any change of thought on this matter; if so, what are the reasons for the change.",176
178,Mr SWARTZ,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Invitation to Tender document for the Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Station States: 'It is the intention that the Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Station shall become fully independent of overseas fuel supplies and services. The (Atomic Energy) Commission may, at its discretion, authorise the purchase of overseas fuel supplies including fabrication for the charge and replacement fuel for a period not exceeding 5 years after start-up. The acceptability of any Tender will depend on satisfactory arrangements being made between the Tenderer and the Commission for those operations required for local fuel preparation, including conversion and enrichment, if applicable, and fuel clement manufacture. The Tenderer shall provide, as a part of his Tender, a comprehensive description of the plan and assurances by which he will meet the requirements of an indigenous fuel supply, including evidence of the agreement of the necessary government authorities.' (2) No. Insurance: Nuclear Accidents (Question No. 2842)",177
179,Mr STEWART,USSR,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether insurance companies in Australia refuse to cover damage caused by the effects of nuclear accidents. (2) If so, what arrangements are to be made for the insurance coverage of property and persons within the danger zone of the proposed nuclear power station at Jervis Bay.",177
180,Mr SWARTZ,USSR,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Insurance companies in Australia include provisions in their policies to exclude liability for property damage which may have been caused by a nuclear accident. (2) I can assure the honourable member that adequate arrangements will be made to cover members of the public and their property against the most unlikely event of damage from a nuclear accident involving a Jervis Bay Station. Nuclear Reactors (Question No. 2843),177
181,Mr STEWART,USSR,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) What types of nuclear reactors are regarded as being fully proved. (2) Were tenders for any of these included in the final list for the proposed reactor at Jervis Bay. (3) If so, what were the types of reactors and the names of the tendering organisations.",177
182,Mr SWARTZ,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The answer to the honourable member's question depends in large measure on his understanding of 'fully proved'. Power reactors undergo continual development in the light of operating experience so that no plant currently, on offer, can be considered fully proved although their reliability is generally quite acceptable. Reactors which could be built today with reasonable confidence in their safety, reliability and performance-althoug h they could not be considered as fully provedwould be Magnox Reactors, Advanced Gas Reacfirst tors, Boiling Water Reactors, Pressurised Water Reactors, Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactors and the Canadian Heavy Water Natural Uranium Reactor (CANDU). (2) Yes. (3) PWR-Westinghouse , USA. PWR--Draftwer k Union, Germany SGHWR-J-The Nuclear Power Group, UK. CANDU-Atomi c Energy of Canada Ltd. Jervis Bay Power Station (Question No. 2844)",177
183,Mr STEWART,USSR,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Will he supply answers to questions Nos 2830 to 2843 prior to his promised statement on the successful tender for the Jervis Bay nuclear power station. (2) If not, will he make a detailed and comprehensive statement on the reasons for the selection at the time of his announcement.",177
184,Mr SWARTZ,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I have not so far been in the position to make a comprehensive statement on the proposed Jervis Bay Power Station but in the meantime I have provided answers to your questions Nos 2830 to 2843. Defence Purchases (Question No. 2860) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: What defence purchases have been negotiated by the Chief Purchasing Officer of his Depart- . ment in (a) London and (b) Washington in each of the past 5 years The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (a) LONDON Year Expenditure $m 1965-66 51.171 196667 49.311 196768 82.186 196869 63.410 196970 34.836 280.914 Main Categories of items purchasedAircraft and spares; Minesweepers; Ships Maintenance Stores; Dockyard equipment for maintenance of ships and submarines; Radar, sonar cypher and communications equipment and spares; Equipment for the construction of patrol boats, Destroyer escorts' and escort maintenance ship; Ships spare gear; Guided missile control systems; Anti-tank guns and tank spares; Gun mountings; Fire control equipment; Missiles, torpedoes and ammunition; Technical publications; Chemicals (for explosives manufacture); Electronic equipment; Plant, ammunition components; Laboratory equipment; Lead-in requirements for aircraft production.

Overseas Relief (Question No. 2867) Mr Berinson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What appeals for overseas relief have been accorded tax deductible status in the last 5 years. (2) What was the (a) value of donations made to these appeals and (b) cost to revenue. (3) Is he able to state the estimated value of all overseas relief raised by donation in the last 5 years. (4) If so, what would have been the approximate cost to revenue if all these donations had been tax deductible. (5) Will the Government consider granting tax deductible status to a wider range of overseas relief donations, particularly those raised under the auspices of United Nations agencies. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Expenditure (1) None. $m (2) ' (a) See answer to part (1) 24.673 (b) As donations to appeals for overseas 23.000 relief in the past 5 years have not been 13.526 allowed as deductions for income tax 28.623 purposes, there has been no cost to revenue. 116.014 (3) No official statistics are available on which to base an estimate of the figures sought. The Australian Council for Overseas Aid has estimated that overseas aid contributions by Australian voluntary agencies amounted to some $14m in 1970. The greater part of this figure represents expenditure by church missionary agencies, being moneys collected by churches in Australia and expended overseas. (4) A meaningful estimate cannot be made of the cost to revenue of allowing deductions in respect of the total amount of voluntary aid contributions because of the varying nature of the sources from which they come and of the means by which they are raised. The cost of allowing deductions for cash donations at current levels to non-church voluntary agencies is estimated to be about (1.2m. (5) The question of allowing deductions in respect of donations for overseas relief purposes is being kept under review. Mining and Minerals Mr Grassby asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1)' How many overseas companies in Australia are engaged in (a) mining and (b) processing minerals. (2) What percentage of Australia's mineral resources are now controlled by overseas companies.",177
185,Mr SWARTZ,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Acting Commonwealth Statistician has advised as follows: (1) The varying extent to which there may be an overseas interest in a company in Australia, and the different forms which this interest might take, creates the necessity to develop some objective criteria as to what constitutes an overseas company. The Bureau of Census and Statistics has adopted the following conventions for the .purpose of producing statistics on overseas participation in Australian industry. As a general rule overseas Companies (and consortia) are those in which there is a direct overseas investment as follows: (i) Australian companies in which at least 50 per cent of the ordinary shares (or voting stock) is held by individual shareholders or individual companies resident in one overseas country, or where 25 per cent or more of the ordinary shares (or voting stock) is . held by one company or a group or associated companies, incorporated in one overseas country. (ii) Branches of companies incorporated overseas and registered in Australia as foreign companies. (iii) Wholly owned and partly owned subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries, etc., of companies included in (i) and (ii) above. Based on these criteria, there were 57 overseas 'companies and consortia engaged in mining in Australia in the calendar year 1968, and '13 overseas companies engaged in mineral processing in Australia in the year ended June 1967. These are the latest years for whichfiguresare available. It should be noted that some overseas companies included in the figure for mining would also be included in the number of overseas companies engaged in mineral processing. (2) For statistical purposes, the Bureau measures the degree of overseas ownership and control in terms of the percentage of the total value of production of an - industry which is attributable to overseas and to Australian companies respectively. To do this it is again necessary to adopt certain conventions. When measuring the degree of overseas ownership by overseas companies, the value of production of their mining or mineral processing activities is attributed .according to the percentage of the equity interest held overseas and in Australia, respectively. However, when measuring the degree of overseas control by these overseas companies, the whole of the value of production of their mining or mineral processing' activities is attributed to them, except where an Australian company holds a greater (Question No. 2921) proportion of the equity interest than an overseas company in which case the value of production is . attributed wholly to Australian control. Measured in these terms the overseas companies (mentioned in answer to Question 1) controlled 58 per cent of the total value of mining production (1968) and 71 per cent of the total value of mineral processing production (in 1966-67)'. Accident Statistics (Question No. 2924) Mr Cohen asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What was the number of (a) deaths and (b) - injuries requiring medical aid in (i) motor vehicle accidents, (ii) air accidents - (including military), (iii) rail accidents, (iv) industrial accidents, (v) firearm accidents and (vi) poisoning by accident, during each of the last 5 years. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Acting Commonwealth Statistician has supplied the following information in reply to the honourable member's question: (i) NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED NA IN ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS ^AUSTRALIA Year ended Number Number 31 December : killed injured 1966 ' .3,242 77,837 1967 .. 3,166 <a)80,021 1968 .. 3,382 82,210 1969 .. 3.502 87,888 1970 .. 3,798p 91,549p Preliminary (a)-In South Australia,, prior to I October 1967, particulars of the. number of persons injured included those who did not require surgical or medical treatment. From 1. October 1967 thefigureshave been - compiled on the basis set out in the Explanatory Notes below. Explanatory Notes Details of road traffic accidents involving casualties relate to accidents which were reported to the police and which satisfy the following conditions: (a) That the accident occurred on any road, street, thoroughfare, etc., open to the public, including railway level crossings; (b) That it involved anv road vehicle, i.e., motor car, tram, handbarrow, etc. (or other road user, such as an animal), which at the time of the accident was in motion; (c) That the accident resulted in(i) the death of any person within a period of 30 days of the accident; or (ii) bodily injury to any person to an extent requiring surgical or medical treatment (ii) NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED IN CIVIL AVIATION ACCIDENTS(a): Year ended Number 30 June killed(b) 1966 .. 1967 .. 1968 1969 .. 1970 (a) Excludes accidents outside Australia involving aircraft on the Australian register.

(b) Excludes parachutists killed on contact with earth after an uninterrupted fall. (iii) NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED IN RAILWAY ACCIDENTS(a): AUSTRALIA Year ended Number 30 June 1966 .. 1967 .. 1968 .. 1969 .. 1970 .. - (a) Includes all casualties resulting from train accidents (derailments and collisions with other trains), other accidents involving passengers (persons falling out of or within trains in motion), accidents when persons are struck by railway vehicles (at crossings, etc.), and other accidents to persons legally on railway property (on platforms, in sheds and yards, etc.). Not all persons classified as injured would have received treatment from a medical practitioner. (iv) The Departments of Labour Advisory Committee, on the basis of statistics published in.each .State in respect of claims made under workers' compensationinsurance, has estimated that fatalities caused by 'industrial injuries average approximately 400 per' - year. (The accident factor in approximately 30 per cent of these claims has been indicated to be motor vehicles.) The Departments of Labour Advisory Committee, on the basis of statistics in respect of claims made under workers' compensation insurance, has estimated that roughly 300,000 workers are involved in accidents which cause them to be away from their jobs for one day or more. (v) and (vi) Comprehensive statistics on firearm accidents and on poisoning by accident are not available in the Bureau. Numbers of deaths registered in which the underlying cause was described as 'accident caused by firearm' or 'accidental poisoning' are as follows: NA CAUSES: AUSTRALIA AND INJURED Cause of death 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 AUSTRALIA Firearm accidents 94 86 54 75 64 Poisoning by acNumber cident(a) 302 330 220 153 146 seriously injured (a) Figures for 1965 and 1966 are not comparable 29 28 with those for later years, due to revision of the 66 24 World Health Organisation's International Classifi47 29 cation of Diseases which is used for classifying 47 20 causes of death. 49 41 Statistics of injuries requiring medical aid are not available.

(2) Have any requests for any such adoptions been made. (3) Can he say whether United States Army procedures enable United States soldiers to arrange the adoption of Vietnamese children without difficulty. The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied, the following answer: (1) Servicemen who wish, to adopt Vietnamese children must comply with the adoption Jaws of notice: the state where the child is to reside, Vietnamese law concerning adoption and make application our Immigration authorities for entry of such children. Entry to Australia will normally be granted when the adoption has been in accorto dance with Slate and Vietnamese laws. Advice was given by my department in May 1970 to the the period.

Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourand (b) able member's question is as follows: The statements will be tabled when consulta(b) tions with the Stales and with the Commonwealth authorities concerned have been completed. As the member is aware, a review of the position of Australian law and practice relating to Conventions adopted at Sessions of the InternatLabour Conference up to 1968 was published by my Department in October 1969. Child Welfare (Question No. 2971)",181
190,Mr WHITLAM,DEATHS REGISTERED,"the Minister for the quesSocial Services, upon notice: (1) What were the names and portfolios of ihe Ministers who attended the Conference of Child Welfare Ministers in Hobart on 18th March 1971? What requests or suggestions were, made at for legislative or administrative action by (a) the Commonwealth, (b) the Territories and (c) the States?",181
191,Mr WENTWORTH,DEATHS REGISTERED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: CDTasmaniaChairman, The Hon. K. O. Lyons, M.L.A., Chief Secretary and Minister for Social Welfare. New South WalesThe Hon. L. J. Waddy, M.L.A., Minister for Child Welfare and Social Welfare. VictoriaThe Hon. 1. Smith, M.L.A., Minister for Social Welfare. South Australia The Hon. L. J. King, M.H.A., Attorney General and Minister for Social Welfare. Western Australia The Hon. W. F. Willesee, M.L.C., Minister for Child Welfare. CommonwealthThe Hon. W. C. Wentworth, M.P., Minister for Social Services. (2) The Conference was held as a forum for exchange of views on matters of mutual interest. It was not the purpose of the meeting to formulate Conference requests to the Governments of the Commonwealth or the States but rather to ensure that each Government, in determining its policy on a matter of some common interest, could be aware of the problems and views of Ministers of other Governments. Input-Output Tables (Question No. 2973)",182
192,Mr WHITLAM,DEATHS REGISTERED,"the Treasurer, upon notice: On what date does the Bureau of Census and Statistics expect to publish its planned input-output tables for 1968-69. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honnam. ourable member's question is as follows: It has for some time been the intention of the involvement Commonwealth Statistician to proceed with the ary 1971. compilation of input-output tables for 1968-69 as soon as resources could be spared from the 1962in 63 project. Some preliminary work has menced on the 1968-69 tables but the compilation of input-output tables is a time-consuming task requiring highly trained staff and it will be years before the 1968-69 tables is impossible to give any precise publication date. F ill Aircraft (Question No. 2984) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) What sum has been spent on the F111 project in respect of: (a) purchase of spare parts etc; (b) aircraft storage costs; (c) payments to date for the aircraft. (2) What would be the cost of cancelling the contract now. The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) (a) $US52.131m has been expended to 31st March 1971. (b) The question of storage charges is still to be negotiated between the United States and the Australian Governments. (c) Payments for the project to 31st March 1971, are $US228.288m. (2) A complete statement was presented to the House on 12th May 1970, by the former Minister for Defence on the F111 project The statement included the Agreed Minute between the United States, Secretary of Defense and the Australian Minister for Defence. The Agreed Minute refers to confirmation by the Australian Minister for Defence that certain operational and technical criteria which were mutually agreed to are fundamental requirements for the Australian strike aircraft and that an F111C that meets those requirements will be suitable for operational use. In the event such operational and technical criteria or any mutually agreed modification thereof are not achieved, providing F ill series aircraft are being employed in the active USAF inventory, the Department of Defense agrees, subject to the authorisation by the Congress, to accept the aircraft and associated support for adaptation to its own use and to credit the Government of Australia with an equitable reimbursement. The amount of reimbursement is subject to further refinement and negotiation, but was estimated then (April 70) by the USAF to be in the range $130 to $)50m. Vietnam (Question No. 2985) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) How many (a) Navy, (b) Army and (c) Air Force personnel are at present stationed in Viet(2) What was the estimated cost of Australia's in Vietnam for the year ended Febru(3) How many Australians have lost their lives Vietnam or as the result of fighting there, and comhow many of these were conscripts. (4) How many Australians have (a) been wounded and (b) suffered permanent disability as several a result of wounding and how many of these are completed. It were conscripts. The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) The strength ' of the Australian force stationed in Vietnam as at 31st March 1971 was(a) Navy .. .. 393 (b) Army .. .. 6,129 (c) RAAF .. .. 734 7,256 (2) The cost of our involvement in Vietnam for the year ended 28th February 1971 was $44.286m. This amount represents the excess over normal costs in Australia of the elements concerned. (3) Fatal casualties in Vietnam at 30th April 1971, were 472, of which 191 were national servicemen. (4) (a) At 30th April 1971, 2,284 Australian personnel bad been wounded in action in Vietnam. (b) As at 28th February 1971, 3,505 servicemen who served in Vietnam were receiving pensions in respect of incapacity accepted as due to service there. Repatriation statistics do not distinguish between pensions for battle and non-battle disabilities nor between regular and national servicemen. Superannuation (Question No. 2996) Mr Armitage asked the Treasurer, upon the notice: (1) What investments were made by the Superannuation Board during the last 10 years. (2) To whom were loans made, and what was the (a) date, (b) amount and (c) rate of interest of each loan during the same period.

(2) How many of them function areas. (3) Will the economy measures ° of the Governefforts ment cause a deterioration-of services provided these inspectors in. country areas.: (4) If so, will he endeavour to reverse any decisions which-would have, such an effect. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In summary, the investments of the Superannuation Board made during each of the last 10 financial years ended 30th June 1970, together with the related ranges of interest rates, are shown in the Table below. The Superannuation Board, which includes a member elected by the contributors, who is a party to all investment decisions, enters into private negotiations when a loan is to be secured by a mortgage of land or real property. Such negotiations are confidential between the Board and its client and reflect the established practice for lending institutions such as the Superannuation Board. Disclosure of the details of these investments would interfere with the proper functioning of the Board. The Board does not, therefore, publish details of individual loans. Details of investments other than mortgage loans as at 30th June each year are advised to Parliament annually in the Treasurer's Statement of Receipts and Expenditure, but do not include the date on which each loan is made. This information, over a period of 10 years, would involve extensive analysis of records of a large number of investments which are not normally summarised in the form provided for in the question.

(2) Inspectors or groups of inspectors make regular visits of inspection to a number of towns and from time to time undertake inspection tours in country of other provincial areas. (3) and (4) I am informed that as part of its to curtail expenditure, my Department has by found it necessary to re-arrange its programme of country inspections until 30th June 1971, but this will not affect the investigation of complaints lodged by on the spot inspections. (Question No. 3000) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) How many students graduated from Australian universities as (a) B.Sc, (b) B.Sc. with Honours, (c) Ph.D. in scientific subjects, (d) B.E., (e) M.B.. B.S., (f) B.A., (g) B.A. with Honours, (h) M.A. and (i) Ph.D. in Arts subjects during each of the years 1960, 1965, 1968, 1969 and 1970? (2) Has his Department made any attempt to predict the need for graduates? Mr Fairbairn-The following answer is provided: (1) The answer to this part of the honourable member's question is contained in the following table. Degree 1960 1965 1! B.Sc. ..\ B.Sc.

(2) Yes. My Department is currently associated with the Department of Labour and National Service in a survey of the supply and demand for engineers. My Department is undertaking a survey of the current supply of engineers from Australian educationl institutions and the Department' of Labour and National Service is undertaking. a survey to assess the demand by employers for graduates in engineering. 1 understand that the Department of Labour and National Service has also undertaken some surveys of the demand for graduates in other professional groups-for example, dentists. It is envisaged that my Department will be carrying out more extensive studies of the need for graduates in conjunction with the Department of Labour and National Service. Water Purification (Question No. 3024) Mr Enderby asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the claims made for the new method of purifying industrial waste water known as the Krupp-Katox process? (2) If so, is he able to say. whether (a) the degree of purity of water treated by this process is higher than that in water treated by the biological methods of treating industrial waste water, (b) the new process is more efficient in its claims on space and cost, (c) the new process is quicker Education than the previous process, (d) there are any known disadvantages of the new process and (e) any steps are being taken to encourage or facilitate the introduction of the new process into Australian industry?",182
193,Mr SWARTZ,SUPERANNUATION FUND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A large number of processes for treating industrial waste water are reported in the technical literature and although the process known as the Krupp-Katox process may have been reported in the literature I am not aware of it being called by that name. (2) In the light of the answer above, I am not able to provide the detailed comment sought. However I might say that the selection of a treatment system for any particular application will depend on the circumstances of the water being treated, the quality required of the product water, the environment in which the' treatment plant is 1969 1970 to be located and any secondary effects resulting from the use of the process or set of processes. 1,703 1.558 773 900 Fauna 513 (Question No. 3034) 842 856 Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Edu3,887 (a)3,607 765 832 cation and Science, upon notice: 172 179 186 71 64 83 (1) Does existing Commonwealth legislation prohibit (he transportation of fauna from one CommonState, in which it is protected, to an adjoining State. (2) If not, will be examine ways in which interUniversity, all first degrees first state trading jn protected fauna can be prevented degrees, include 64 by law. Mr Fairbaim-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) The honourable member will be aware that the House has appointed a select committee lo inquire into and report upon a number of matters relating to the conservation of wildlife including the need for a Commonwealth Wildlife Conservation Authority. Without prejudicing the' findings of the Committee, it is possible that such an Authority could be established. If such an Authority were set up, it may well be able to examine any problems relating to interstate trade in protected fauna with a view lo establishing Suitable controls. Education (Question No. 3035) Mr Scholes. asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: What assistance for education costs is available for children of low income families in Commonwealth Territories? Mr Fairbaim-The answer to the honourable member's question.is as follows: The'information given below has been divided into two sections, namely programs of assistance which are administered by. the Department of Education and Science and' assistance provided by Department of the Interior. NA As the honourable member will know, there are a number of Commonwealth programs in education e.g. the various Commonwealth scholarship schemes and the scheme of Study Grants for Aboriginals. These provide assistance for eligible students living in Australian States and Territories. However there are some schemes of assistance which are specific to the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory. Details of these are given below. Australian Capital Territory Junior Secondary Bursaries Conditions of Award Eligible candidates are sixth grade primary pupils intending to proceed to a course of secondary education. Bursaries are awarded on the results of the Junior Bursary Examination held in August each year. When the annual taxable income(s) of the parents/guardians exceeds $2,000 the candidate is not eligible for a bursary. Allowances are determined on the basis of taxable income(s) for the financial year preceding the Junior Secondary Bursary. Textbook at home allowance allowance (or) allowance Form 1 3 39 Form 2 3 39 Form 3 3 69 Form 4 - 5 141 The bursary is tenable for 4 years (forms 1 to 4) and is subject to a review of the taxable income(s) of the parents/guardians in December of each year. Senior Secondary Bursaries Conditions of Award Bursaries are awarded on the basis of results obtained at the School Certificate Examination. When the annual taxable income(s) of the parents/guardians exceeds $3,999, the candidate is ineligible for a bursary. Allowances are determined on the basis of taxable income(s) for the financial year, preceding the School Certificate Examination, according to the following scale: Assessed taxable Living income of Textbook at home parents allowance allowance (or) allowance $ ? 8 annum annum Less than 3,300 . . 8 150 ' 3,300-3,399 8 100 3,400-3,599 8 50 3,600-3,999 8 Northern Territory SCIENCE In the Northern Territory free exercise books, materials and bus fares are provided for children on the Headmaster's recommendation. In addition a boarding allowance is available in respect of children who must board in order to attend school. This allowance is currently $370 per annum subject to a means test. Details of other schemes of assistance available to students from the Northern Territory are included in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 2486- Mr Whitlam. NA Australian Capital Territory Families in necessitous circumstances in the Australian Capital Territory may receive financial assistance on a discretionary basis from the Welfare Branch of the Department to meet the cost of school uniforms and, on occasions, school books. The families assisted are usually those who are in receipt of Social Welfare Benefits from the Department of Social Services. In assessing eligibility for this assistance, each case is examined on its individual merits. Northern Territory In the Northern Territory, the N.T. Welfare Division is responsible for the education of AborLiving iginal children in special schools. The information provided below is on the understanding that most Living away from Aboriginal children come from low income famihome lies and sets out the assistance for education costs provided by the Department. Main areas of assistance for low income families in relation to edu- 5 S $ cation are: 159 (i) Provision of school supplies and equipment 159 to special schools operated by the Adminis189 tration and by Missions and a subsidy for 273 supplies and equipment purchased for schools conducted by pastoral property management; (ii) free transport of children from some remote areas to locations where schools are operating; (iii) financial assistance towards the cost of educational excursions organised by Communities; (iv) meals at concessional rates on government settlements and some Missions; (v) free lunches in urban areas on the basis of individual need; (vi) the expenses of Aboriginal pupils attending post primary centres and where this is away from their home, fares, board, transport and pocket money; (vii) the expenses of Aboriginal pupils attending Living secondary schools in the Northern Territory; away from (viii) the expenses of Aboriginal pupils at home Kormilda College; (ix) the expenses of Aboriginal children attending special schools for the deaf in Darwin . 3 and Alice Springs; per per per (x) the fees, fares and medical expenses of part annum Aboriginal children attending boarding schools In southern states or living in 300 foster homes in southern states and attend250 ing day schools; 200 (xi) payment of teachers for the conduct of 100 homework classes for children in need of special attention and free transport for children attending such classes in urban areas. Australia and America: Joint Scientific Activities (Question No. 3043) Mr Uren asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: U) Have joint activities been initiated between Australia and the United States since the signing of the Agreement relating to scientific and technical co-operation between the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of the United States of America. (2) If so, do any of the joint activities relate to environmental problems. Mr Fairbaim-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (J) Yes, various joint activities have been initiated in a number of scientific fields including arid land research, atmospheric sciences and research on photosynthesis in plants. (2) None of the joint activities initialed to date under the Agreement has been established specifically or principally to study problems of the environment. However, some joint activities that have been established in three scientific fields are relevant to acquiring a belter understanding of aspects of the environment and of environmental management. The principal relevant activities are as follows: Arid Land Research A joint seminar-workshop between Australia and United States scientists was held in California in March/April 1971 on the topic 'Plant Mordeposits phogenesis as the Basis for Scientific Management of Range Resources'. The aim was to evaluate existing scientific knowledge in both countries this topic and to extract principles which can applied to practical management situations. Atmospheric Sciences 'Research Three Australian scientists from the Department of Supply .and the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology visited the United State in Sepwhose tember/October 1969 to work with United States scientists on measuring the structure of the lower atmosphere using ground-based acoustic sounding equipment developed by the Australian Department of Supply. This equipment utilises the response of sound waves to turbulence and temNew perature fluctuations in the atmosphere, and has potential practical application in such fields as monitoring conditions conducive to air pollusubsequently tion buildup. In another project, balloons designed to float for long periods in the upper atmosphere were released from Darwin by United States scientists in February/March 1971 to obtain information about high level wind flows in the equatorial region. Australian scientists collaborated in work which was designed to increase (he knowledge of global weather patterns and wind flows. These factors play a key role in air pollulong tion buildup in many regions of the world. Research on Photosynthesis in Plants Australian and United States scientists have played leading roles in the discovery of new knowledge about photosynthetic processes in certain types of plants (e.g. sugar cane) which make unusually efficient use in their growth processes of the solar energy falling on them. This new knowledge could lead to important practical applications in tropical zone agriculture. A joint seminar between leading research scientists from the two countries in this field was held in Australia in November/December 1970 to facilitate the exchange of research results and to identify areas in which research might prove fruitful. Bauxite (Question No. 3091) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: What parts were played by (a) officials, (b) former officials of the Bureau of Mineral Resources and other public instrumentalities and (c) private interests in the discovery and assessment of the bauxite resources of Australia.",184
194,Mr SWARTZ,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Welpa. This deposit was discovered by H. Evans of Consolidated Zinc Corporation Ltd in 1955 during the course of a field survey in which he was primarily concerned with petroleum exploration but under instructions to be on the look out also for other minerals. The Cape York area was mentioned in BMR Bulletin No. 24-Bauxit e in Australia, by H. B. Owen, issued in 19S4, as an area in which 'commercially valuable deposits of iron ore and presumably bauxite' might occur. Gove and Wessel Islands: The Wessel Island were found in 1949 by part-time prospectors who had been instructed by Owen (then an officer of the Bureau of Mineral Resources) what on to look for and what samples to obtain. Samples be brought in by them lo Owen were found lo be bauxite. The individual deposits were identified by Owen in 1951 and testing was carried out in 1952. This was arranged by the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, a joint Commonwealth-Tasmanian Government Authority, under auspices most of the exploration for and testing of bauxites in Australia up to that time had been carried out, with the Bureau of Mineral Resources acting as the exploration agency. The Gove deposits were tested in detail, first by Guinea Resources Prospecting Co., owned 51 it per cent by the Commonwealth Government and 49 per cent by British Aluminium Co. Ltd and by various other companies including finally, Nabalco. Mitchell Plateau: These deposits were found by K. Malcolm of American Metal Climax (Amax) in 1965 and subsequently tested by that company. The Bureau of Mineral Resources was carrying out geological mapping in the southern part of the the Kimberleys at the same time but was not existing directly concerned in the discovery. Darling Ranges: Bauxite has been known for time to occur in the Darling Ranges and the deposits are briefly described in BMR Bulletin No. 24. They were regarded as being low grade until investigations by Alcoa showed that deposits consisted of material that could be economically treated to produce alumina. Subsequently testing and assessment of the deposits has been done by Alcoa and other companies holding exploration permits in different parts of the Darling Ranges. Other Deposits. The history and details of the geology and testing of these are set out in BMR Bulletin No. 24, a copy of which is available for examination in the Library of the Bureau of Mineral Resources. (Question No. 3092) Mr Everingham asked.the Minister for National Development, upon notice: What were the (a) initial, (b) maximum and (c) latest annual production figures for aluminium in Australia under (i) public and (ii) private enterprise and on what dates were those figures reached in each case.",186
195,Mr SWARTZ,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The first production of aluminium in Australia was at the Bell Bay plant of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, a Commonwealth and Tasmanian Government enterprise, during the period September 1955-December 1960. In . January 1961, Comalco Aluminium (Bell Bay) Limited purchased the plant, although the Tasmanian Government retained a 17.4 per cent shareholding. Comalco Ltd now holds all the ordinary shares in this company: the Tasmanian Government holds I.S million $1 preference shares. Subsequent aluminium smelting projects in Australia have been developed by private enterprisenamely, that of Alcoa of Australia Ltd at Point Henry, Victoria, and that of Alcan Australia Ltd at Kur'ri Kurri, New South Wales. (i) Aluminium production by public enterprise: (a) initial production: 1,248 tons were produced in the final quarter of 1955; 9,143 tons were produced in 1956r-the first full year of operation; initial production capacity of the Bell Bay plant was 12,000 tons per annum. (b) and (c) A maximum production of (ii) Aluminium production by private enterprise: (a) Comalco Aluminium (Bell Bay). Ltd produced 13,204 tons of aluminium in 1961, the company's first year of operation. (b) and (c) A production of 201,258 tons Exports (Question No. 3098) Dr Patterson asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the continuation of Commonwealth preferences is hindering Australia's expansion of exports to other countries. (2) Has he made any estimates of net losses of revenue resulting from Commonwealth preferences. (3) If so, what are the details.",187
196,Mr ANTHONY,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The following is provided Aluminium in answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The expansion of Australia's exports to non-Commonwealth countries has been hindered by various tariff and non-tariff barriers imposed by those countries. There is no evidence, however, that these barriers are related to the continuation of Commonwealth preferences. The Government has sought and will continue to seek improved conditions of access for Australian products in all markets. (2) and (3) It is not possible to estimate the net effect of Commonwealth preferences on revenue from Customs duties without data on the elasticities of supply and demand for each good imported into Australia. As this data is not available, no estimates have been made. Balance of Payments (Question No. 3102) Dr Patterson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What was the balance of the current account of Australia's balance of payments for each of the last 10 years? (2) What funds were transferred out of Australia by foreign investors and others during each of the same years? Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Statistician's latest published estimates of Australia's balance of payments on current account for the years 1960-61 to t969-70 are as follows: $m 1960-61 . -737 (a) 11,655 tons was attained in 1961-62 -2 1960; this was also the last 1962-63 -466 year of production by govern- 1963-64 -54 ment enterprise. 1964-65 -781 1965-66 -884 1966-67 -651 1967-68 . -1,123 (b) 1968-69 . -1,008 (b) 1969-70 -812 (b) (a) Minus sign denotes :i net deficit.

The annual bulletin covering the period to the end of June 1970 is due to be released shortly. Housing Loan Interest Rates (Question No. 3116) Mr Uren asked the Treasurer, upon course, notice: (1) Can he say whether the United States eral Reserve Bank has reduced interest rates by least 1 per cent during the last 6 months in order to stimulate the home building industry and assist persons seeking a loan to construct private dwellings? (2) Was there a fall in the commencements of significant private dwellings in Australia during the March of quarter of 1971 compared with the same period last year? (3) If so, were high interest rates one of the causes? - (4) Will he instruct the Reserve Bank to reduce interest rates for home construction in order to stimulate the home building industry and to assist young people to acquire a home? Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the period referred to. it has policy of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States to bring about a rapid increase in the reference? quantity of money in the economy. This has resulted in a general decline in interest rates in the United States. The objective of the policy, I understand it, has been to produce conditions conducive to a general revival of economic activity in a nation which has been experiencing level of unemployment which exceeded 6 per cent. One of the results of this increase in the quantity of money has been to make available a greater volume of funds to the housing industry and this has assisted in producing a revival in activity that industry. The policy, however, is essentially one of general application, designed to stimulate overall economic activity. (2) Yes. Figures published by the Commonwealth Statistician on 3rd May show that in . the March quarter of 1971 private dwelling commencements totalled 29,550 compared with in the March quarter of 1970. (3) It should be noted that private dwelling commencements were at a seasonally-adjusted record level in the March quarter 1970. The subsequent decline has been associated with a number of factors, including tight monetary conditions. The increase in housing loan rates was part of the general rise in interest rates in the economy associated with these financial conditions. However, it is not possibleto single interest rates as the cause of, or even a major factor in, the fall in commencements. (4) While the Government would not wish see the current level of interest rates continue longer than is necessary, it would be inapproby priate at this time for the Government the Reserve Bank to arrange a reduction in those housing loan interest rates subject to the Bank's direct control. The level of interest rates is determined basically by the demand for and supply of funds in the economy. If the interest rates on housing loans were artificially lowered, the consequential limitations on the ability of housingfinanceinstitutions to compete for an adequate share of savings could result in a marked falling-off in the funds available for housing. This would, of be inimical to the acquisition of homes, by young people. At the same time, a reduction in the general level of interest rates would, in curFedrent economic circumstances, involve the very at serious risk of adding to inflationary pressures, and this too could ultimately operate to the disadto vantage of potential home buyers. While the cost of borrowed money is an important factor to potential hpme buyers, it is relatively less than the actual cost of a home which, course, could increase significantly if inflationunchecked. in the economy were allowed to go ary pressures, Forestry (Question No. 3123)",187

(2) If so, has work begun on the substantive study and, if it has, when will it be completed? The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) Yes. (2) The present substantive study is proceeding. In view of its size and complexity, sity to predict long term needs, the study may require twelve to eighteen months to complete. Defence Services Flying Training (Question No. 3139) . Mr Barnard asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Who is making the study of rotary and fixed-wing piston-engined flying training for the three Services? (2) When will the report be completed? (3) Will the report be made public? The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) The study is being carried out by a working party chaired by Defence and with representatives from each Service. (2) Reports on both aspects of the study are close to completion for consideration at a higher level in the Defence Department. (3) No. Naval and Air Power (Question No. 3140) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Who is making the long-term study of naval and air power referred to on page 11 of the Defence Report 1970? (2) When will the report be completed. The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) The Study is beng conducted under the overall control of the Department of Defence. A Study Group to direct the work has been set up comprising representatives of Defence Department, the three Service departments and the Department of Supply. (2) This is a major study involving complex strategic, operational and technological factors and will extend over a considerable period. Defence Services: Ammunition (Question No. 3141) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Has ammunition been purchased for the Australian Services from manufacturers in Singapore? (2) If so, what ammunition was purchased, and why was it not purchased from Australian sources? The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) Yes. (2) The ammunition purchased was cartridge 5.56mm. It was not procured from Australian sources because the relatively small requirement to date has not justified expenditure on the installation of local capacity. The Singapore source was investigated, and selected after the calling of competitive overseas tenders. In addition, procurement from Singapore has been a,useful reciprocal purchase, in view of the defence orders placed on and the neces- Australia by that country. Defence Procurement (Question No. 3142) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) What items of Australian defence procurement have been made available for New Zealand bidding since the Defence Supply Co-operation Arrangement was negotiated with New Zealand. (2) What items of New Zealand defence procurement have been made available for Australian bidding since the agreement was negotiated? (3) What progress has been made since the agreement was negotiated in the co-ordination between Australia and New Zealand of (a) planning, (b) standardization of equipment, (c) training and (d) operational procedures? The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) A wide range of items required by the Australian Services have been made available for New Zealand bidding. Tender invitations have been in line with New Zealand's production capability and have included such items as machinery and components, footwear, textiles, clothing, boats, crockery and ration packs. (2) Tenders for New Zealand defence requirements are issued by New Zealand authorities on commercial basis direct to Australian firms and details of tenders issued prior to November 1970 are not available. It is known, however, that some significant New Zealand defence purchases have been made locally as a result of Australian tendering, e.g. Land Rover vehicles and automatic signal switching equipment. In November 1970, : arrangements were made for the Australian Trade Commissioner in New Zealand to forward copies of - tender documents for defence requirements to the Department of Trade and Industry. Since then tender documents for polyester material have been received. (3) (a) In the field of defence production Australia is giving New Zealand every assistance to develop its own capacity for self-reliance. Mutual co-operation in this area is being actively investigated. (b) Standardization of defence equipment is a continuing process. It had been proceeding effectively for a considerable period prior to the conclusion of the Defence Supply Co-operation Arrangement and will be progressively developed in the future. Many items are in common use now, such as the 7.62mm rifle and ammunition and CI 30 Hercules and P3B Orion Aircraft. (c) There, are long standing arrangements under which the Australian Services assist in the training of New Zealand Service personnel, including officer training at the RAN College, Jervis Bay, The Royal Military College, Duntroon and the Officer Cadet School, i Portsea. New Zealand students attend the Joint Services Wing of the Australian Services Staff College, the - Army and Air Force Staff Colleges and other regular short term courses. In 1970, 74 New Zealanders attended training courses in Australia. The number of personnel by service were as follows: Navy- 8 Army-6 2 Air Force- 4 In addition, there are officer-exchange countries. In 1970, 7 New Zealanders arrangements between were in Australia under exchange, loan or detachment and 7 Australians were in New Zealand on exchange' or loan; the numbers by Service were as follows: New Zealand Navy- 2 Army- 3 Air Force- 2 Australia Navy- 1 Army- 4 Air Force- 2 (d) In regard to co-ordination of operational procedures, the following areas have been developed with New Zealand: (i) our National forces have been fighting together on active service in Vietnam in - accordance with common operating procedures which are continually being revised in the light of current experience; (ii) our forces are working together in Malaysia/Singapore on a similar basis; (iii) both countries, as members of SEATO, have. agreed to adopt standard procedures . which agreed in that forum; (iv) a close liaison is maintained through our liaison staffs on matters of doctrine and procedures and other subjects; (v) common operating procedures are practised in combined Single Service and Joint exercises both in our respective home countries and overseas in conjunction with other Five Power or SEATO countries.. Papua New Guinea: Armed Forces (Question No. 3147) Mr Barnard asked, the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Who are the members of the Committee making the study of the development of the Armed Forces of the Territory of Papua New Guinea? (2) When will the report be completed? (3) Will the report be made public? The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) The study is being .undertaken by representatives of the Department of Defence; Foreign Affairs; External Territories; Navy, Army and Air at the direction of the Defence Committee. (2) A number of reports has already been submitted. Study of the matter is proceeding on a continuing basis. (3) No, but the Parliament will be kept informed on developments affecting forces in Papua New Guinea. Income Tax Deductions (Question No. 3156) our two",188
201,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that payments made for sewerage and water services are tax deductible while payments made for the removal, of effluent and sullage are not? (2) If so, is this an anomalous situation? (3) 'Does be maintain that there are strong grounds for arguing that, the anomaly which some . persons see in the present law. should be rectified by withdrawing the deduction,- not by extending it? . (4) What is the annual cost to revenue of lax deductions on payments for sewerage and water services? (5) What would be the estimated annual cost lo revenue of complete tax deductions on payments for the removal of effluent and sullage? (6) Docs the present policy represent a further penalty on people already deprived of the benefits ' of sewerage? (7) Would the extension of tax deductibility to the cost of effluent and sullage services provide a desirable incentive to householders to contribute to personal and community health through the frequent removal of waste materials form residential and commercial areas? Mr Snedden-The ' answer to the hon' ourable member's question is as follows: - are (1) 'Where premises are used by a taxpayer in gaining or producing his assessable income or in carrying on a business for that purpose, payments made by the taxpayer for sewerage and water vices and the removal of effluent and sullage are deductible for income tax purposes except to the extent that they are of a capital, private domestic nature. In relation to private premises, the income law authorises the allowance of deductions taxpayer for the payment of rates which are annually assessed and for which he is personally liable. To the extent, therefore, that charges for sewerage and water services and the removal of effluent and - sullage are incorporated in such rates, a deduction is allowed. However, payments made to a contractor for these services or charges imposed by the local authority independently of the annual levy for general rates do not qualify for deduction. (2) In general, outgoings of a private or domestic nature are not allowable deductions. Rates paid on private premises fall within this category Constabulary and the allowance of a deduction for expenditure of this kind represents a concession granted only when specific conditions are satisfied. Against this Rank background, the denial of a deduction where the Commissioner relevant tests are not met is not considered to Deputy Commissioner create an anomaly; an amendment of the law - would be necessary to widen existing provisions. (3) Having regard to the history concession, it could be argued way of correcting the anomaly which some people . (3rd class) see would be to withdraw the concession. (4) No statistics are available of income tax Inspector (2nd class) . . deductions allowed in respect for sewerage and water services. Statistics of Bandmaster. deductions allowed to taxable individuals for rates Assistant Inspector . . and land taxes on non-income-producing property Sergeant were compiled for the 1963-66 income year, but Sergeant (2nd no information is available that would enable Sergeant (3rd class) . . payments in respect of sewerage and water serConstable vices included in these deductions to be deterConstable mined. (5) The information required to make a reliable estimate of the annual cost to income tax revenue of allowing deductions for all payments for the removal of effluent and sullage is not available. (5) No. See answer to part 2. (7) As it is understood that in many cases local by-laws already require the removal of sullage and effluent, the position would not be affected significantly by the allowance of an income tax incentive of the kind suggested by the honourable member. Papua New Guinea: Police Force (Question No. 3160)",191
202,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the External Territoriesj upon notice: (1) What is the total complement .of the police force of the Territory of Papua New Guinea, and how is it deployed. (2) Is the force up to desirable strength,' if not what additional personnel are required. (3) What is the break-up of rank for (a) European and (b) indigenous personnel. (4) Is the force equipped with (a) sea-going vessels, (b) helicopters or (c) other aircraft. (5) In what circumstances is a dependency to be placed on the Pacific Island Regiment or other units of the defence Services. Mr Barnes)-The answer to the honourserable member's question is as follows: (1) As indicated in the Annual Reports for or Papua and New Guinea (for the 1968-1969 Reports see Parliamentary Papers 136 and 99 of tax 1970) the Royal Papua and New Guinea Conto a stabulary consists of three branches: (a) the Regular Constabulary Branch-engage d wholly on police duties; (b) the Field Constabulary Branch-comprisin g officers of the Department of District Administration who carry out police duties only in those areas where no officer of the Regular Constabulary is stationed; and (c) the Reserve Constabulary Branch- a permanent body of part-time volunteers appointed by the Commissioner and trained by members of the Regular Constabulary. At 30th June 1971, the strength of the Regular was as follows: Indigenous Expatriate Total 1 1 -- 1 1 Assistant Commissionei .. 1 1 the scope of the Superintendent (1st class) .. .. 6 6 of the present Superintendent (2nd class) .. .. 3 3 that the proper - Superimendem .. 7 7 Inspector (1st class) . . Chaplain .. 18 18 1 1 'i7 17 12 of payment made Sub-Inspector Inspector (3rd class) . . 34 49 SI 71 121 1 2 24 21 Cadet Officer (1st class) . . 88 . 85 24 t 24 class) . . 45 48 95 95 (Senior) . . 156 156 (1st class).. 1,050 1,054 B t Constable 1,022 1,020 Probationary Constable 900 900 3,440 185 3,625 Total At 30th June 1971, the Reserve Constabulary Branch comprised110 local male members 94 overseas male members - local female members 6 overseas female members. Apart from members attached to Police Headquarters and training establishments members of the Force are attached to the six territorial Divisions and the manning requirements of police districts within each division are supplied by DiviMinister for sional Headquarters. At 30th June 1971 the strength of the several divisions wasPapua Division (H.Q. Port Moresby- 5 districts) 714 members. Highlands Division (H.Q. Mt Hagen- 3 districts) 574 members. East Coastal Division (H.Q. Lae- 2 districts) 472 members. West Coastal Division (H.Q. Madang- 4 districts) 475 members. Islands Division (H.Q. Rabaul- 3 districts) 670 members. Bougainville Division (H.Q. Kieta- 1 district) 230 members. At 30th June 1971, the strengths of Police Headquarters ' and the training establishments wereHeadquarters (including C.I.B., etc)-16 6 members. Training Establishments-32 4 members. (2) The desirable strength of a police force, is very much a matter of judgment. In the case of the Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabulary I have approved a recommendation that there should be some expansion of the Force to enable it to meet additional commitments arising from increasing urbanization, social and political change and the need to expand the policing of rural areas. (3) See answer to Question (1) above. (4) (a) No. (b) No."" (c) No. (5) Units of the Defence Services may be used to assist the Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabulary where it appears that the maintenance of law and order may be beyond the capacity of the civil administration. The use of the Defence Forces for this purpose must be approved by the Australian Government. (Question No. 3170) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Is he able to say whether under economic co-operation existing between Indonesia and Japan, a new textile factory has been established at Bandjaran to produce tetoron? (2) If so, can he say whether indications have been given that this is the first of a series of extensions in the textile industry of Indonesia by Japan? (3) Has he examined the possibility of parallel action by Australia in establishing similar industries based on wool utilisation?",192
203,Mr ANTHONY,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the ourable members question is as follows: (1) The new textile factory referred to by honourable member is a joint venture between two Japanese companies, Tomen Co. Ltd and Konebo Spinning Co. Ltd, and the Indonesian well state-owned spinning mill P. T. Industri Sandang. The new company's name is Konebo Tomen Sandang Synthetic Mills. (2) This is not the first venture by Japanese textile companies in Indonesia. The Indonesian Government is placing particular importance the development of the textile industry in Indoare nesia with a view to achieving eventual sufficiency in the production of cheaper type cotton and synthetic fabrics needed by that country's population. To achieve the desired expansion textile production a number of Indonesian mills have concluded joint venture arrangements with Japanese companies which supply technical assis-"" tance, capital and machinery. In addition, Japanese Government has been known to offer training programmes in Japan for Indonesian mill operators and management. (3) Indonesia's domestic demand for textiles almost entirely limited to cotton and synthetics. There have been no significant imports of raw or processed wool into Indonesia in the past and there are no immediate plans for utilisation of these products by the Indonesian industry. Nor does the Indonesian Government give any priority to the development of the woollen textile industry ' during their currentfiveyear development plan. Flood Damage: Salinity (Question No. 3172) Mr Grassby asked the .Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Is total flood damage in the Darling Valley from recent inundations estimated to exceed $IOOm? (2) Is it expected that much of the flood waters ' will eventually reach the Murray River? (3) Has the flood damage, together with the loss of water running wastefully to the sea, led to renewed demands for flood mitigation and conservation works? (4) Will he now consider the investigation of an integrated comprehensive river basin development programme along the lines sought by the Darling Conservation Association? (5) Has the River Murray Commission declined Indonesia responsibility over all conservation including salinity control in line with modern ecological concepts? (6) Did the salinity report issued under this authority envisage total overall valley' action? (7) Will hereviewthe decisions of the Commission in relation to its'responsibility to ensure that the recommendations of the salinity report are implemented?",193
204,Mr SWARTZ,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have seen reference - to various estimates of recent flood damage in the Darling Valley but I am not aware of any authentic figure. (2) Yes. (3) It is inevitable that the occurrence of widespread flooding stimulates interest in works to honmitigate the effects of floods. (4) While some advantages may be claimed for the the type of programme envisaged by the Darling Conservation Association, it would appear also to involve some major problems in relation to the established patterns of administration in Australia, particularly with regard to the role of State Government Departments. Hence it may be questioned whether the proposals of the Darling Conservation Association represent the best approach in the Australian situation. In any case the proon posals of the Darling Conservation Association a matter for consideration first by the approself priate State authorities. (5) The role of the River Murray Commission is governed by the River Murray Waters Agreein ment between the Commonwealth and the three riparian States. The powers of the River Murray Commission as given by this Agreement, relate almost entirely to the construction of works and the the apportionment of water. While the Commission has control over the allocation of water from its storages and the waters of the River Murray and tributaries above Albury, the other tributaries is arc under the control of the States. 'The extent to which' it can go in assuming responsibility for' salinity in the river has not been determined, but generally speaking this is mainly a matter for the States. (6) The Salinity Report issued by the Consultants to the River Murray Commission put forward proposals for a variety of measures affecting the Valley generally. (7) A number of major recommendations in the Salinity Report relate' to matters which are the direct responsibility of the individual States and the Commission as such has no authority to ensure their implementation. As indicated in the note which 1 issued to accompany the report, it provides an essential basis for the more detailed studies which may be required prior to implementation, with particular reference to salinity control Upper Yarra measures. I can assure the Honourable Member that I share his concern that there should be no unnecessary delay in carrying out these studies and in taking such measures as are found feasible and justified. Apples and Pears (Question No. 3184) Dr Patterson asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Why was Parliament not informed of the details of the proposed stabilisation plan for the apple and pear industry? (2) What organisations and States have been informed of these details? (3) How many official press releases has he made on this subject?",193
205,Mr SINCLAIR,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourstorage able member's question is as follows: (1) I made a public statement on the 12th March to the effect that the Government had approved the details of a stabilisation plan for the apple and pear industry and that steps would now be taken for the necessary legislation to be brought down in the Parliament as soon as possible. I had initially hoped that would be introduced in the current session and that Parliament would have an opportunity to debate the plan in detail. This proved possible. (2) Details have been made known to the Australian Apple and Pear Board, which negotiated the plan with the Government on the industry's behalf. (3) I have made two press releases on the subject of apple and pear stabilisation, one on the 26th February 1971 and one on the 12th March 1971. My predecessor made a release on the subof ject on the 22nd October 1970. Dam Construction (Question No. 3185) Dr Patterson asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: What was the (a) total cost and (b) cost per acre foot (yield) of all major dams constructed Australia in the post-war years.",194
206,Mr SWARTZ,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Most dams in Australia are constructed by State authorities, and I am not able to provide the data requested for all major dams constructed in the post-war period. However the following table has been compiled from published information. Cost/ acre feet Name of storage Total cost of yield Sm 5 Burrendong 38.40 116.70 Burrinjuck (enlargement) ..

For instance the costs are the sums of the actual expenditures during construction, and have not been brought to a common basis with regard to money values. Furthermore, there is no uniform or standard basis for determination of storage yield; for instance the yield from a given can vary considerably depending on the degree and frequency of restriction in supply permitted in dry years. F ill Aircraft (Question No. 3198)",194
207,Mr CROSS,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Minister for this legislation Defence, upon notice: (1) What has been the cost to date of the proposed acquisition of F ill aircraft including has not, however, the cost of (a) the aircraft (b) armament (c) the purchase of spare parts and other equipment (d) construction of hangars (e) workshops and (f) investigation and tests. (2) What cost has been incurred for the storage the aircraft in the United States of America? (3) What other costs have yet to be met? (4) What loss has been incurred in spare parts which are now obsolete for the Australian aircraft or which have deteriorated and are no longer capable of use? (5) What has been the cost of training programmes so far carried out and what further training costs will be incurred when the aircraft in are brought into service with the Royal Australian Air Force? The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: (1) Payments for the project to 30th April 1971, are $US228.359m for items (a), (b), (c) and (f) and $A3.802m for items (d) and (e). (2) None. The question of storage charges is to be negotiated between the United States and the Australian Governments. (3) Final costing for some elements of the project is still Subject to discussion and agreement between the United States and Australian Governments. (4) No losses have been incurred at this stage. Shelf life items are still within serviceable time period. Other items which have become outmoded due to modifications are being reworked to update them for use. (5) Expenditure on training programmes to date totals $US2.567m. Some additional training costs ' will be involved, but the extent of these costs will be subject to negotiation with the United States authorities. (Question No. 3239)",194
208,Mr MORRISON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the statement issued by the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce on 25th March 1971 concerning parliamentary salaries which points out that Australians should seek acceptance of the principle that we only get the Government we deserve and are prepared to pay for, and that a better qualified Government can only result in long term benefits to every Australian. (2) If so, is the Government's attitude to this matter the same as that expressed by the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce.",195
209,Mr MCMAHON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes.

210,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) What information was sought from coalowning companies by the Buerau of Mineral Resources in its recent survey of Australian coal reserves? (2) Did all companies give full co-operation; if not, what are the names of companies which did not co-operate fully and in which particular information areas was co-operation withheld? (3) Did Clufha Development Pty Ltd co-operate fully in providing details-of contracts and prices for coal mined, or to be mined, in the Burragorang Valley; if so, what are the details?",195
211,Mr SWARTZ,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to. the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Information sought by the Bureau of Mineral Resources from coal-owning' companies was restricted to details of black coal reserves in still various categories including information on the bases for calculations, recovery factors, etc. (2) The response from companies is regarded as satisfactory and an inventory showing total known reserves of the several types of black coal in Australian coalfields has been compiled and will be published in due course. As the inquiry was conducted on a confidential basis, details of information supplied by individual companies are not available for release. (3) Information on contracts and prices was not sought from coal-owning companies. Vietnam (Question No. 3252)",195
212,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice: Parliament (1) What rates of compensation are paid to the civilian victims of Australian military action in Vietnam? (2) Do these rates provide adequate compensation? (3) Is any review of the present rates to' be undertaken? The former Minister for Defence (Mr Gorton) supplied the following answer: The Government of South Vietnam is responsible for all claims for compensation that arise from combat' activities of its own and other forces assisting her. The Australian Government meets, on an ex gratia basis, claims by Vietnamese civilians who have suffered loss in consequence of the wrongful act or neglects of members of the Australian force or employees of that force. Compensation is paid by the Australian Government after assessment of liability, entitlement and quantum having regard, in the light of Vietnamese law, to what probably would be paid as a result of litigation between the parties.' Careful regard is given to the adequacy of each claim. Water Resources (Question No. 3265)",195

218,Mr ANTHONY,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (i) In 1967-68,. 12,478 cwt of Duboisia leaves were exported. Exports declined to 9,812.cwt in 1968-69 and increased to 10,799 cwt in 1969-70. (ii) Over the period, the Federal Republic of Germany has been Australia's main export market for Duboisia leaf. In 1969-70, Germany accounted for 73 per cent of Australia's exports of Duboisia leaf. Other export markets are Japan, Switzerland and Belgium-Luxembourg. Repatriation (Question No. 3322) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice: What would be the estimated cost of increasing the special rate war pension from $39 to $46.40 (the Commonwealth average minimum wage) for the year 1971-72. Mr Hoiten-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is estimated that the additional cost involved in the payment of special rate pensions would be $S.69m for the full year, but there would be additional consequential costs associated with the payment of special rate sustenance allowances of approximately $0.63m. Lock-Kimba Pipeline (Question No. 3383) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Has the Australian Water Resources Council completed its examination of the request by the South Australian Government for financial assistance to expedite the completion of the LockKimba Water Pipeline on Eyre Peninsula? (2) If so, when can it be anticipated that he will announce the Government's decision on this matter?",198
219,Mr SWARTZ,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Commonwealth Departments have carried out an examination of the request by the South Australian Government for financial assistance with the Lock-Kimba water pipeline on Eyre Peninsula. (2) I expect a decision on this matter to be made in the near future, and it will be conveyed to the South Australian Government as soon as possible. Pre-school Education (Question No. 3388)",198
220,Mr WHITLAM,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an address by Professor Ronald Goldman. Dean of the School of Education at La Trobe University, on 7th April 1971 about pre-school education? (2) If so, does Professor Goldman estimate that pre-school education on the scale applying in Canberra could be provided throughout Australia for little more than $40m a year and could be provided in the inner-city areas of the State capitals for little more than $20m? (3) Can he say in the light of information available to him whether Professor Goldman's figures are correct? Mr Fairbairn-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) In the text of Professor Goldman's speech made available to me, he includes the figures $40m and $20m quoted by the honourable member. It is not clear, however, whether Professor Goldman is quoting annual or overall costs, whether they are additional to present costs to the Australian taxpayer, or whether the costs include capital as well as recurrent expenditure and the additional cost of teacher training. (3) As my predecessor stated in answer to a previous question by the honourable member (Hansard 25th September 1970, page 1756), it is not realistic to attempt to estimate the cost of providing pre-school education over the whole of Australia on the basis described by the honourable member. There are basic differences between the Australian Capital Territory and other areas in many of the factors which affect costs in the provision of pre-school education, such as the geographic spread of the pre-school aged population, the size of the pre-school centres which would be required, cost of acquisition and development of sites for centres, building costs, attendance patterns and salary levels. Estimates based on applying figures appropriate under one set of conditions to areas where conditions differ so substantially could not held but be misleading. For these reasons, and because the basis of Professor Goldman's estimates is not stated, I am unable to comment on them. Education (Question No. 3389)",198
221,Mr WHITLAM,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: How many students (a) commenced and (b) completed training in 1970 in each State at the teachers' colleges for which financial assistance has been authorised under the States Grants (Preschool Teachers Colleges) Act?

Commenced Completed Employment Training Training 1970 1970 (Question No. 3400)",199
223,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon 44 notice: Can he give an estimate of the extent to which 25 technology has caused retrenchment of labour in each of the last 10 years? Mr Lynch-The answer to the honour77 able member's question is as follows: It is not possible to provide the information sought. However, some information on retrench60 ments caused by the introduction of technological change is available from studies conducted by the Department of Labour and National Service: 39 (i) A National Survey was recently conducted into the employment effects of technological change in manufacturing industry covering 40 per cent total employment in 21 that industry. The Survey showed that 2070 persons were retrenched due to these changes during a three year period between 13 1967 and 1970 out of a total employment of over 500,000 in the firms surveyed. This represents a retrenchment rate of 0.13 per cent per year of average employment (ii) Establishments introducing electronic data processing during 1965 retrenched 39 persons due to changes in technologies compared with a total EDP employment of about 9200; in 1968, firms employing about 15,000 persons in EDP retrenched 45 workers for the same reasons. These figures represent an annual retrenchment rate of 0.3-0.4 per cent. (iii) In the printing industry, nine tradesmen were retrenched in 1965 due to technological change out of a total of 21,000 tradesmen employed, a retrenchment rate of less than 0.1 per cent. Labour-Management Relations (Question No. 3401)",199
224,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"the Minister l for Labour and National Service, upon What is the approximate percentage of industrial establishments that observe the guidelines by the National Labour Advisory Council . for labour-management relationship at factory level. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I assume the honourable member is referring in his question to the agreement arrived at on 6th May 1970, between the A.C.T.U. and the National Employers' Policy Committee as to procedures for dealing with industrial disputes. This agreement was not one associated with the l National Labour Advisory Council. In an agreed statement issued in connection as with the agreement, it was stated that it was 'the mutual responsibility of individual unions and employers to give effect to the guidelines' and that 'it would be important to' translate these principles into action as soon as practicable on the basis of mutual decisions by the parties'. Unions and employers are under no obligation to keep me or my Department informed as to the extent or otherwise that they may have given effect to the guidelines. However, I am informed that in several major areas of employment there have either been discussions between union and employer representatives towards giving effect to the guidelines or there have been agreements entered into which have been influenced by the guidelines.

Hewitt, M.L.A., was issued indicating the terms of Commonwealth financial assistance for construction the Pike Creek Dam. A copy of this Press Statement will be made available to the honourable member. Commonwealth Employees' Furlough (Question No. 3424) Mr Wallis asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Has he given any further consideration to introducing amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act to provide pro rata furlough after 10 years' service instead of the existing provisions of the Act which provide furlough after 15 years' service.",201
227,Mr MCMAHON,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honDefence, upon notice: ourable member's question is as follows: No, but I am aware that the Public Service Board has the matter of the minimum of furlough entitlement under review. Commonwealth Wool Payments (Question No. 3434) Dr Gun asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that many people whose wool income has dropped solely by virtue of switching from wool production to beef production and thereby suffer no loss of total income have received the full $1,500 Commonwealth payment under the emergency assistance scheme for wool(2) If so, is this in accord with the intention of the Government?",201
228,Mr SINCLAIR,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the application form used for the wool emergency financial assistance scheme, provision was made to obtain details of the number of sheep shorn in each of the years 1968-69 and 1969-70 and the number of sheep on hand at 30th June 1969 and 1970. Where it was clear from these figures or from additional information sought from an applicant that sheep numbers had been reduced voluntarily and not as the result of drought, countervailing adjustment was made to the applicant's wool income. This was done to ensure, as far as possible, that assistance was granted only where the decline in wool income resulted from factors beyond the applicant's control and not as the result of a voluntary policy to replace sheep with some other form of primary production. Where an applicant maintained sheep numbers in 1969-70at approximately the level of the previous year and was otherwise eligible for an assistance payment, he would have received a grant under the scheme. Undoubtedly some growers, particularly in areas of Victoria and South Australia where the 1969-70 season was favourable, could have maintained sheep numbers and also increased the number of cattle carried. Such growers may have received grants under the scheme even though their gross income from both of wool and cattle did not decline in 1969-70. The Government was aware that, with the necessarily arbitrary conditions of the emergency scheme framed to expedite the allocation of funds to wool growers in serious need, such cases might occur. It considered this preferable to the withholding of assistance from growers whose financial situation had become precarious following the serious decline in wool prices and the effect of prolonged drought on 1969-70 wool incomes.
