CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. CHRISTMAS ADJOURNMENT-TARIFF - ' EXTRA SITTING DAY.  Minister intend that we shall adjourn for the Christmas holidays? And for how long is the adjournment to be?",14
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The inquiry is rather early. I hope that we shall have dealt with the Tariff at least a week before Christinas, and shall then be able to adjourn over the month of January, re-assembling as early in February as honourable members, after considering the question between then and now, may feel convenient.",14
2,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Does not the ' Prime Minister think that, at the present rate of progress, it will probably be nearer Chrismas twelve months than next Christmas when we have finished with the Tariff? Have not the Government considered some method for expediting the work?",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Government have considered several proposals for expediting business. The honourable member has been no sinner in the matter of 'making long speeches, but he had the long discipline of the Tariff Commission.

Norris lent me, for your information, a copy of the latest edition of Food and the Principles of Dietetics, by Hutchinson, who is regarded as the leading authority of the world on this subject. On page 460, the author summarizes the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence obtained by analyses, & c , as to the disadvantages and injurious results following upon the use of the proprietary foods for infants then before the public. On pages 461-5 is given the compo-. sition of infants' foods as disclosed by fresh examinations by the author, together with a "" General description and remarks,"" by the author upon the analyses. On page 535 and following pages, the author treats upon "" Artificial and Pre-digested Foods and Artificial Feeding,"" and shows that "" invalids' "" foods are only of use as additions to ordinary food, provided they make up any deficiency in the ordinary food. Dr Norris states that the public are victimized to a large extent by certain invalids' foods, and also by certain infants' foods.

The above the standard fixed under the Victorian Pure Foods Act, and Dr Norris states that the leading makers of these foods in Europe are makarrangements to conform to that standard. I may' mention that under the Victorian Pure Foods Act of 1905 the following regulation as to infants' food has been made oilmen's by the Board of Public HealthDefinition - Infants ' food is food described sold as an article of food specially suitable for - infants of twelve months of age or under. Standard - Infants' foods shall contain no fibre, no preservative substance, and no mineral substance insoluble in acid; and, unless described or sold specifically as' food suitable only for infants over the. age of six months, Dr shall, when prepared as directed by any accompanying label, contain no starch, and shall contain the essential constituents of, and conform approximately in proportional composition to normal mother's milk. That is the report from Dr Norris.",16

I quite admit that there is a' great deal in statement made by the honourable member amendmentin reference to the prohibition of these foods, or to having them more clearly de- ""ralandTariff),on fined than they have been. We cannot do everything at once. The Minister of Trade and Customs tells me that jn view of what has taken place-and the persistency of some honourable members has had a good Commission. deal to do with it, perhaps, though it been the intention of the Government to act since last year- a measure will be upon the table in about, 'or perhaps less per cent.,"" be inserted-put than, a week, and then the matter can be mittee divided. dealt with. There is no necessity to exempt these foods at the present time. We propose an increase of duty, which certainly will not do any harm, and may do a great deal of good by preventing the wholesale importation which is now taking place. I think that it would be unwise to exempt all these foods. I have no statement in Brown, Tilley writing on the subject, but I know that Dr Brown, Thomas Norris has said also that they are not Cook, Joseph equivalent to the ordinary milk that we Edwards, can produce in Australia, and therefore it Hedges, W.

I remember distinctly that he and his confreres rushed over to Sydney during the recent State elections, and begged the people there to withhold their judgment until the Tariff - was through, undertaking on their part to vote down these duties on groceries in any way that might be open, to them.",18
38,Mr WATSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"That statement does not happen to be true, but it is near enough, I suppose.",18
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"But here they are voting for 20 per cent, duties without the slightest compunction, and apparently without the slightest reference to the solid promises made by them to the people of New South Wales.",18
40,Mr WATSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,I think that the honourable member might stick to facts occasionally. It would be rather interesting if he did.,18
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT OF MAI L,I fancy I have heard that from the honourable member before.,18
42,Mr WATSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,South Sydney) [3.34] I venture to say that the honourable member has not heard me say a word to the effect of the statement he has made to the Committee concerning me.,18
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT OF MAI L,It is substantially correct.,18
44,Mr WATSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,I made speech.,18
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT OF MAI L,I referred to the honourable member's followers also.,18

I have"" PAIRS. already told the Committee what I am prepared to do with regard to the Tariff, and I intend to stand by what I have said absolutely. I made a speech declaring my intentions at least a fortnight before the New South Wales State elections.. I aro not going any further than I then said. We intend to endeavour to get in free all the infants' foods that are approved. That is a reasonable condition. If the honourable member were anxious to do .a' fair thing by the Tariff, he would be prepared to agree to an arrangement on that basis, rather than take up an extreme position in support of which there is not the slightest hope of securing a vote from the Committee. Amendment negatived. Item algreed to. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE.) proposed - That the following new item be inserted"" 89A. Infants' Food as prescribed by Departmental by-laws, free on and after 6th November, 1007.""",18
47,Mr WILKS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Dalley) [3.35] - I should like to inquire how the Minister expects the Department to carry out the conditions required by his amendment. The Department of Trade and Customs cannot reasonably be expected to discharge all the duties that are sought to be thrown upon it. I believe that it is the intention of the Minister to introduce a Pure Foods Bill,. Surely this is a matter which can be dealt with under such a measure more effectively than under the Tariff. The particular duty proposed will not affect my vote on the question. I am well aware that a. considerable quantity of the foods at present put upon the market ought to be prohibited. They are simply chemical productions, and not foods in the true sense of the word. Mr Beale's report does not go exhaustively into this matter, but states that he has information at hand with regard to foods the publication of which will be beneficial to the Commonwealth. If Mr Beale intends to publish the results of his investigations, the Minister would be well advised in letting the no such matter stand over for a while. Whether these so'-called foods are locally made or imported, they should not be permitted to go into consumption if they are pernicious,. It appears to me that the Customs authorities are not sufficiently armed with means to carry out this - provision effectively. Too much is being placed on the shoulders of the Customs officers. It has to be remem,bered that they have not the. machinery of a Health Department at their compelled mand, and, if we take the course proposed, the Minister may not be able to fall back upon the Health Departments of the States",18
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Trea surer) [3.39] - I hope that honourable members opposite will not object to the amendment. The Bill to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Dalley can prohibit certain of these importations, and if the amendment is adopted, then the foods to which it refers cheap cannot be allowed in free. Hitherto the greatest Customs authorities have been in the habit of consulting, and will continue to consult, the officers of the Board of Health of various States. At present there is Commonwealth Board of Health, and I to am not sure that there will be one under the Quarantine Bill ; and, therefore, this health authorities. matter is likely to remain within the diction of the Boards of Health of the States. In Victoria, for instance, Dr Norris, the Chairman of the Board of Health, is anxious to assist; and the same may be said of the Board of Health in New South Wales. We shall be just in way into use. the same position as though we had our own Board of Health, though, of course, there must be some head authority.",19
49,Mr WILKS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,Is it intended to introduce a Pure Foods Bill ?,19
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I do not think it is intended to introduce a Bill under that name. In any case, a Bill passed the Federal Parliament can only affect ports. The honourable member for Dalley knows that many questions have been asked on this subject by the honourable member for Barrier, who is anxious that the Act passed last year shall be carried into effect. Under that Act, it is provided that all imported foods shall bear upon their coverings information as to the terials of which they are composed; and I think that any future legislation may go further and give the power of prohibition. and Such new legislation, howe'ver, will not be if leftwill called a Pure Foods Bill, but will be on the lines of the legislation which has already been carried.",19
51,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Yarra) [3.42] - I think that the proposal of the Treasurer will meet the case. If brands of food are mitted free under departmental by-law, we may be sure that people will not be slow take advantage of the fact, and that effect will be better than that of sion of. the duty. People who are comto buy such food will regard their free admission as a guarantee of purity.",19
52,Mr WILKS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"But impure, foods will be admitted at a. duty of 15 per cent.",19
53,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Such foods ought, in - my opinion, to be prohibited.",19
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Parramatta) [3-43]-- f wish I could think that human credulity is such as the honourable member imagines. Our experience of human not nature is that if goods of the kind be people will run all sorts of risks in using them. There would be the difficulty in the world in persuading some.people that certain infants' foods are impure, notwithstanding what Mr. the Beale or the Customs medical authority no .may say. I do not think that we' ought tinker about a matter of this sort, which is certainly one for regulation by the It ""would not appear juristhat by the proposal before us we should add 'to the precautions that ought to be .taken, or that the difference of 15 per cent, will materially affect the consumption. If an article is cheap, and, therefore, free, it will continue to find its  tation of impure foods?",19
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I think such foods ought to be prohibited, but there are ways, other than by means of a Tariff, of ascertaining what is .pure and what is by not. I can understand the Customs Deimpartment deciding as to values for duty purposes, but the responsibility of deciding what are pure foods involves a function which a Customs laboratory could not perform and which, as the Treasurer has admitted, must be performed by the States. Why not leave the matter to the States? Why not leave the States to pass maPure Foods Bills and perform the proper policing in this connection? The proposal appears to me to be dividing responsibility, I am afraid the result will be that the work not be so well done as it would to one authority.",19
56,Mr WILKS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Dalley) [3.46] - An ' interjection by the honourable member for Barrier compels me again to address the Committee. The honourable member said adthat I had already voted to place a duty of 15 per cent, on impure articles of food; to and I desire to explain that that vote had the nothing to do with infants' foods, but a remismerely with ordinary groceries.",19
57,Mr SINCLAIR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,Has the Treasurer any objection to including invalids' foods?,20
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,I do not think that the inclusion of invalids' foods is necessary. Anything may be invalids' food.,20
59,Mr JOHNSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Lang) [3.49] - 1 suggest the advisability of including invalids' food. A number of preparations for invalids are quite as important as are infants' foods, though differing materially in their composition, and . ought also to be placed on the free list. There are often prescribed for invalids foods which would not be safe for infants. I move That the amendment be amended by inserting the words "" and invalids'"" after the word "" infants'.""",20
60,Mr BOWDEN,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Nepean) [3.50] - In valids' foods ought to be included in the proposed new item. The Government will be safeguarded by their power to define the foods by regulation. By that means they can so limit the exemption as not to include the injurious articles which have been mentioned. Benger's foods are used for invalids as well as for infants. I suppose that some invalids in Australia are practically living on foods of that kind'at present. It would be a serious matter to exclude, or even put a duty on, what are really invalids' foods. They should be obtainable as cheaply as..possible. I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lang.",20
61,Mr KNOX,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Koovong) [3.52] - It is not quite a legitimate use of the Tariff to endeavour by it to secure the purity of foods. For - that purpose other legislation is desirable and necessary. If we include invalids' foods in the proposed new item, it will be very difficult to define where it begins and where it ends. Benger's food is used both for infants and invalids, and therefore would necessarily be included in the Minister's proposal. Those honourable members who are asking for the inclusion of invalids' foods are already accomplishing a great deal by the Minister's proposal, inasmuch as many children's foods can be, and are, used for invalids. The Minister has made a reasonable concession, and it is not desirable to press the amendment.

A few weeks ago we made provision in the Bounties Bill to grant a bounty on the growing of rice hi Australia. This item can only be a revenue-producing one until an appreciable quantity of ""rice is grown in - the ComVnonwealth. That is not the case, at present. I object to revenue being collected upon an article of this description to a large portion of our population. I voted in favour of the Bounties Bill under a misapprehension. The Government led me to believe that the proposal to grant a bounty upon the production of rice was a bond fide one, and I understood that it was submitted in lieu of a protective duty. But it now appears that, Having induced Parliament to agree to the Bounties Bill, they wish to impose a duty upon rice which cannot have a protective incidence, and which will be merely revenue producing. To raise about ,£80,000 annually from rice, which is an article of diet amongst the poorer classes of the community, is utterly indefensible. Many of those who are not able to get other articles of food can obtain rice and milk:",20

Under any circumstances, I am nof responsible to him as to how I vote upon rice or any other item; I am responsible only to my constituents. I do not favour the raising of revenue through the Customs House. I prefer a direct tax of any description to an indirect tax, which must have the effect of very largely increasing the price of goods. Seeing that rice is an article of daily' diet with a large number of our people, and that we have already authorized the payment of a bounty to encourage its production, we should at least wait until the period covered by the bounty has expired before imposing a duty upon the commodity.",21
69,Mr WILKS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Dalley) [4.5] - I intend to support the honourable member for Cook. - We have now practically dealt with the whole of the food supplies of the people, and we are in a position to afford them relief only upon the few articles which await consideration. Seeing that the Tariff in its present form imposes very stiff burdens upon the masses, I am compelled to vote in favour of placing as many of the remaining items as possible upon the free list.

71,Mr WILKS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Seeing that there are 100 lbs. in a central, the duty approximates more closely to Jd. per lb. than it does to £d. per lb. By the time that the importer has passed on the burden to the retailer, and the retailer to the consumer, it will certainlv spell more than Jd. per lb. As has already been pointed out, rice is .a commodity which is used by the poorest section of the community. The desire of those who favour the adoption of a protective policy in respect of rice has already been met by the action of this Parliament in authorizing the payment of a bounty upon the production of that article. I do not consider that an industry which requires to employ the cheapest labour procurable, in order to make it profitable, is a desirable one to establish in Australia: We have already levied heavy imposts upon the food supplies of the people, and in view of this fact I am prepared to extend to the masses as much relief as possible' on the remaining items in this division.",21
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.8] - The honourable member for Cook has apparently overlooked the fact that the bulk, or a large quantity, of the - rice imported into the Commonwealth is used for starch making. A proposal has been made by certain starch makers that starch should be free of Excise duty, and, to counteract the resulting loss of Excise revenue, that an import duty be imposed oh rice for the manufacture of starch. No rate of import duty is suggested, but it could not be less than that on uncleaned rice, namely, 3s. 4d. per' central. If this were agreed to, and the import duty on rice for starch making were fixed at 3s. 4d. per central, there would be a loss of revenue °f ^ > 7 ° II 8 J based upon 1906 returns,' and assuming tha* all the starchis made from rice. Thus :-Revenu e from Excise of i d . per lb. on starch, 1906, .£27,709. Actual weight of starch on which this Excise waspaid, 6,650,160 lbs. Weight of rice required to produce, that quan4ity of starch, assuming that the starch produced is 70 per cent, of the rice used, 9,500,229 lbs. Import duty on 9,500,229 lbs. at 3s. 4d. per central, £ 1 5 , 8 3 3 . Loss of revenue, ,£11,876. The import of rice last year was 490,669 centals, valued at £ 2 4 8 , 6 0 3 ; rice, uncleaned, 264,198 centals, valued at £ 1 1 7 , 9 1 0 . The import of rice for the manufacture of starch was, from India, 930 centals, and from the Straits Settlements, 4,899 centals; ai total of 5,829 centals, valued at £ 2 , 2 1 2 . Of rice, n.e.i., principally cleaned, the total import was ' 79>5 2 centals, valued at £-128,481. I 2 2 wish in this matter to carry out what is really the recommendation of the Tariff .Commission, as there is very little difference between the duties recommended by both sections of that Commission. this and other reasons, . I hope that the honourable member will not press his amendment. He should recognise, also, that ' the Excise duty on starch .will have to be dealt with. out that the Excise duty on starch made from rice is i d . per I b . ; and we propose that, if made from materials grown in the Commonwealth, it shall be free of Excise duty. I do not wish to delay matters, and I should be glad if the Committee would come to a vote on this item as soon as possible. - Mr WATSON (South Sydney) [4.12]. - - I do not think that we are justified in voting for as high a duty on rice as that proposed under the old Tariff. purely a revenue duty, and will continue to be so unless the attempt to encourage the rice-growing industry by way of a bounty is successful. Its success is a matter on which I am at present withholding judgment;' but, even if the industry should prove to be successful, it is not likely to be attended by any important results for a considerable time to come. Speaiking for myself, I object to revenue duties as such where they can be avoided. I have no big objection, however, to duties on narcotics and stimulants. As one who smokes and drinks a little, I am prepared to pay a little extra for luxuries of that description. I feel that raising duties under a protective Tariff on articles the manufacture of which we - wish to encourage in - Australia, we must in a large number of cases inevitably increase the cost to the consumer for a time at any rate. "" The new industries can only be brought into existence gradually, and, of course, in the meantime, the price of the imported article must go up. When we are imposing that burden on the consumer I do not think we are justified in adding to it by imposing high revenue duties as well. I think that honourable members generally, and especially protectionist members, should take action to prevent even the maintenance of the present comparatively high duty, on this item. As bread is likely to be dear for some time, to come owing to the comparative failure of the wheat crop, there is an additional reason why the duty on rice' should be reduced to some extent, in order that al substitute for wheat may be available at a low cost. I am prepared to support the amendment of the Honourable member for Cook.",21
73,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Yarra) [4.15] - I inFor formed the Minister a few days ago of my intention to move in connection' with this item that the duty on rice used for the manufacture of starch should be maintained, and that the Excise duty on starch I point should be remitted. I have here a letter from Messrs. Lewis and Whitty, starch manufacturers, Avho put the case in this way. They sayThe Government proposals as to Excise on starch, are as follows :(rt) Made from rice, per lb., i d . 1 (4) Made from materials grown in the Commonwealth, free. The result of (a) is that the starch mill is really a. bond under supervision by the Customs ofncials, and the Excise' is payable on starch, leaving it at the rate levied, i d . per lb. The mill being thus a bond, the Customs officials It is will, we are informed, not permit the manufacture of starch from materials grown in the Commonwealth, .such as wheat, maize, or potatoes, as the yield would, they think, in a mill where starch is also manufactured from rice, be difficult to trace, and possibly loss to the revenue would result. There would be no difficulty where the manufacturers have two mills, as they could make starch from rice in one mill, and from materials grown in the 'Commonmealth in the other. Where the manufacturer has only one mill, the factory is practically a bond, and he is compelled to pay Excise on his starch whether made fro m imported' rice or from materials grown in the Commonwealth. In . this way, .the small man, who has only one mill, is penalized. Messrs. Lewis and Whitty go on to sayIn our case, as we have only one mill (though we understand that other manufacturers have two which they could utilize, one for rice starch and one for other classes), and as the manufacture of starch is essential for many purposes, we would be prevented from manufacturing starch from materials grown in the Commonwealth unless we erected a new mill at a cost of many thousands of pounds, which the industry does not warrant. To get over this difficulty and assure full payment to the revenue, we would ask that a duty be levied payable on rice for starch purposes, before it is converted into starch, equivalent to the amount of the Excise, duty. They ask really for an alteration in the rice. method of levying the duty. to say- The Departmental rccresentatives fix 68 cent, as the starch yield of a ton of rice; fore the duty would be a fraction less £ 6 /S. per ton, equal to the Excise of i d . per lb., or, say, 6s. 4d. per cwt I believe that the rice used in the manufacture of starch is that included in the Tariff as ""rice n.e.i.,"" and dutiable at 6s. per central, so that under their proposal they would have to pay slightly more on rice they use than they have to pay under existing circumstances. I trust that the Minister will accept the alteration I have suggested, in order that the small manufacturers of starch may be placed on equal terms with those who have more than one starch mill. Under this proposal, once the rice was imported and destroyed for the purpose of starch-making, there would be no further trouble; whilst under the existing system, the Excise officers are compelled to be present at the factory during the whole of the time the starch mill is working, and the factory is practically a Customs bond.",22
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,I should like to be quite clear as to what the honourable member's suggestion is.,23
75,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"In the first place, the manufacturers of starch should pay duty on rice for the manufacture of starch just as duty is paid on it when imported for any other purpose. The Minister, Or, at any rate, his officers, have this information. I trust, therefore, that he will agree to my suggestion. If he does so, it will not place the Department in a worse position than it is in today.",23
76,Mr FOWLER,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Perth) [4.22] - The Tariff Commission obtained very little evidence on the subject of rice, and, therefore, the section wi.h which I was identified felt itself unable to recommend any alteration of the old duty upon uncleaned"" rice. Now that the matter has come before Parliament, I shall vote to make the duty on rice as low as possible, if I cannot get this article placed on the free list. It has been said that rice is used chiefly by - theChinese. If that be so, the white inhabitants of Australia will do well to ta.ke a leaf out of their book, and' use it more largely. So far as children are"" concerned, rice cooked with milk is the finest food in the world.",23
77,Mr MATHEWS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,Ric e is not so good a food as is oatmeal. I have had enough of They go on Mr FOWLER - The difference between the proposed duty on uncleaned riceper 3s. 4d. per central-and on rice n.e.i -6s . thereper cen'tfal-give s an unreasonably large than protection to a very simple industry.,23
78,Mr HUTCHISON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"If the operation of cleaning rice is a simple one, is not that good reason for doing the work here?",23
79,Mr FOWLER,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I ' think not. The work cannot employ any labour to speak of, and the difference to which I have referred will go mostly, info the pockets of the employers who undertake the cleaning within the Commonwealth, while the general - public will, probably, have to use rice of a poorer quality than they have hitherto been in the habit of using. Since I have lived in Victoria, attending the meetings of this Parliament, my household has found it very difficult to obtain rice as good as that which we used to get in Western Australia, and I speak with some knowledge of the article, as, in the early days of the gold-fields there rice and condensed milk was a very popular food. In my opinion, the general inferiority of the rice now used is due to the Tariff, the Western Australian duty having been much lower than the Commonwealth duty. It would 'be of advantage to the general public to make these duties as low as possible, and the revenue would not suffer materially if we made a smaller difference between the rates 'on cleaned and uncleaned rice. In .my opinion, the finer qualities of rice are imported cleaned, and it is only right that the preparation of this commodity should take place in the country of origin. How absurd it would be if tea were sent here in a half-prepared state. . Mr Foster - So it is. All the bulk teas are put through a Cleaning process, and hundredweights of dirt are removed.",23
80,Mr FOWLER,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I think that the honourable member is mistaken. Of course, there must be a certain amount of dust in tea. The rates for cleaned and uncleaned rice are altogether out of proportion to their respective values.",23

It would not be defensible at the present time on a purely revenue basis. honourable member for Perth has urged that it would be far better to allow rice to come in free from.other countries. It must be iri the recollection of honourable members who have been reading the newspapers that a large - importation of lime-coated rice has taken place. Surely no one would be prepared to allow lime-coated rice to come in as cleaned rice.",24
87,Mr THOMAS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,Would not the Commerce Act deal with that?,25
88,Mr FISHER,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"It would. I am merely answering the argument which has been advanced in favour of making the article duty free. In view of the State Health Acts, and Pure Foods Acts, and also in view of our policy of new protection, which I hope will be enacted during this Parliament, it is only fair that we should do everything that is possible to encourage the production and manufacture of every kind of article. Besides being the means of assisting the fanner to grow rice, this duty will enable our manufacturers to clean imported rice. That undoubtedly follows. I take it that if the duty be removed, the local industry of rice cleaning will disappear.",25
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,Absolutely .,25
90,Mr FISHER,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Whils t much might be said regarding what has transpired in nexion with the cleaning and production rice in Australia, I think that under Wages Boards and the new protection fair and reasonable conditions of labour and remuneration will be assured to the eming ployes in this and other industries. Before deciding, to abolish the duty we ought at least to allow time for the bounty after on rice to operate. If , after a year then ready for use. or two, it . be found that not being locally produced, it will open to Parliament to place it on the free list.; - but since there is hope of its being produced in Australia. I trust that 'the .Committee will support . the Government proposal.",25

He urges the Comthe mittee „r.Q support the duty .on the .undermarket. standing that if within the next few years we have not a very considerable production of rice in Australia we should be able to place this item on the free list. The honourable member knows perfectly well that there will be little chance of re-opening the Tariff, more particularly to deal with only one item, during the next three years. The Sir WILLIAM LYNE - If the Tariff is seriously reduced the honourable member will see what chance there is.",25
92,Mr JOHNSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I shall always hail with delight an opportunity to vote for a reduction of the Tariff. I intend to vote for the amendment, and should like to know why the Government have raised the duty beyond the rate proposed by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. Even the honourable member for South Sydney, who is astaunch protectionist, said he would not care if the duty were removed. Apparently he does not attach very much importance to its retention. There are certainly less than twenty hands employed in the rice cleaning - industry in Australia. The invoice prices of rice f.o.b. are as f o l low:-No . 1 uncleaned, Japan, £ 1 4 . 17s. 4d. per to n ; Straits Settlements, £ 8 7s. 6d. per ton; No. 1, cleaned, Japan, £ 1 7 per ton; Straits Settlements, £ 1 0 5s. per ton. The Australian rice cleaners import these varieties in about equal quantities and mix them for sale. They sell the cleaned product as the best dressed rice. Rice sold in the local market during the last few years has deteriorated. The differential duty is equal tb 2s. 8d. per central, or about £ 3 per ton in favour of the rice cleaners. Surely that is an enormous conconcession. In Law's Grocers' Manual, a of recognised authority, the process of rice our cleaning is described as followsRough rice is called "" paddy,"" but before cominto the retailers' hands it is softened and husked in a mill : a sort of mortar, studded in . side with metal, to prevent the pestle crushing the grain while rubbing off the skin or husk, which operation it is quickly dried, and is rice is It will be seen that this is a very simple be operation. Practically the whole expense entailed is the cost of the mill. The total cost of manufacture certainly does not exceed J £ I per ton. The whole process consists of the employment of a man to feed a machine and to take away from it the sacks as. they are filled with the cleaned is product. Twenty men could supply double requirements of the whole Australian Rice was dressed in Victoria before the honourable member for Mernda or any one else asked for a protective duty. Apparently the duty was imposed in response fo al request by a certain individual inter- Customs. ested in the trade in Victoria, and the only result of the duty has been to create a monopoly, the whole business really being in the hands of three firms. The operation of the duty has resulted in an inferior kind of rice being foisted upon the Australian market. In the circumstances I see no reason why the amendment .that' the item be placed on the free list should not be agreed to. In the event of its rejection I shall move that the duty be reduced to 2s. per central.",25
93,Mr FOSTER,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"New England) [4-48] I shall heartily support a proposal to impose a duty on prepared rice. Unlike the honourable member for Perth, I think that we cannot have too much supervision over articles - introduced from countries such as tliose from which rice is imported. The honourable member said that tea comes in free of duty and ready for use. happen to know that some of the large firms-Edwards and Company, for instance-hav e machines for the purpose of cleaning a quantity of the tea which they sell. It is during the packing and shipping that the dirt gets into these commodities. The argument of the honourable member for Perth in regard to rice seems to me rather absurd. Rice that is imported in the husk is protected against dirt to some extent. If the cleansing done here, we shall have a guarantee that we are getting rice, and not something with Chinese, Japanese, or Hindoo mud upon it . - Honourable members should also give attention to the fact that when these articles are packed in Australia we encourage the manufacture of such goods as .tins and packets. If we impose a high duty on cleaned rice we shall achieve our purpose in that respect.",26
94,Mr JH CATTS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,Ric e is always imported in bags.,26
95,Mr FOSTER,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Groun d rice is sometimes tinned. I shall not support the amendment of the honourable member for Cook, because, on account of the source from which rice comes, I think there ought to be a little duty upon it . But I shall vote for a reduction of the duty on uncleaned rice.",26
96,Mr THOMAS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Barrier) t4-53j-- I am quite prepared to vote to allow uncleaned rice to come in free. I look upon this as [196]- 2 absolutely a revenue-producing item. It is one in which the Treasurer is interested rather fthan the Minister of Trade and I shall vote against increasing the duties on any items that I regard as principally revenue-producing. If I thought there was any chance in the immediate future of rice being produced in Australia, I should be prepared to vote for a duty even on uncleaned rice, but the very fact that the Government proposed a, bounty on rice shows that they do not think there is much likelihood of its being grown in Australia: Sir WILLIAM .LYNE - Oh , yes.",26
97,Mr THOMAS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"If the bounty is not sufficient I shall be prepared to support the Government in giving a higher one. I should even be prepared to double, treble, or quadruple the bounty if the Government made a proposal to that effect. It is all very well for the honourable member, for Wide Bay to say, But 1 "" Give the duty a trial for a few years, and then, if we find that rice is. not being produced in Australia, we can reduce it ; "" but we have had a duty for a number of years, and not a single cwt. of rice has been produced in Australia.",26

99,Mr THOMAS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I was in favour of it , though I forget whether I was present when is the division took place. I shall not hesitate to vote against this or any other item which is merely revenue-producing. I trust that ricewill be admitted free. It is a very good food. It enters not only into the homes of the poor, but is also consumed by the well-to-do.

112,Mr WILSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Corangamite) [5.32] - This item is one of very great importance to the dairying industry. The duty under the old Tariff was 12s. 6d. per ton or 15 per cent, as oilmen's stores, and under that duty our producers of salt were able to carry on their industry profitably in the manufacture of all classes of salt commonly used. In these circumstances there is no necessity to further tax the dairying industry.",29
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,The honourable member is dealing with the wrong item.,29
114,Mr WILSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,I think this item includes the salt used in the dairying industry-brow n or dark-red rock.,30
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"No , that is dealt with in item 96B.",30

117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Trea surer) [5.34] - If the honourable member desires to carry out the view which he has expressed he has chosen the wrong item for his amendment.

123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I have just' inquired, and I find that the salt referred to by the honourable member for Corangamite is-included in item 96B, "" Salt-N.e.i. , including pink rock.""  ther he will be prepared to recommit the item if it is subsequently discovered that the salt used in the dairying industry is imported under item No. '95?",30
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Yes , I can safely promise to do so.",30
125,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"North Sydney) [5.37] - I should like to know the reason for the altered form of the duty on this item, and its probable effect. The Government are in this case substituting an ad valorem duty for a duty at afixed rate per ton. So far as I can gather, the alteration will not make any great difference in the amount of the duty to be paid, and that being so, I think it is undesirable to substitute an ad valorem duty for a fixed duty on an article that is always sold by weight, when in such case it is"" much easier to check a fixed duty.",30
126,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PAYMENT OF MAI L,A good deal of salt was imported under this heading as oilmen's stores.,30
127,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"The duty under the old Tariff was 12s. 6d. per tori, or 15 per cent, as oilmen's stores. When we have a specified line in> the Tariff referring to salt, I do not see how the article could be legally classified as oilmen's stores. It would only be salt in bottles that was so classified. I think it would be' preferable to have a fixed duty on this item, and I should like to have some information on the subject and some reason 'given for the proposed change in the form of the duty.",30
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Trea surer) [5.39] - The information supplied to me is that there is practically no alteration in the amount of the duty, and that no exception can be taken to the proposal on that account,",30
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT OF MAI L,Why is the form altered ?,30
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,For departmental reasons.,30
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT OF MAI L,What are the reasons ?,30
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I think that the departmental reason-that in this form, as likely to lead to fewer disputes, it would be much easier to collect the duty-is a very good reason. I have had great experience of the work of the Customs Department, and nearly all the trouble in that Department arises in defining the item under which a particular article imported should be included. The change is proposed for greater convenience in administration.",30
133,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"North Sydne 5"") [S-4°]--The Minister's explanation is not satisfactory.",30
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,This is also recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission.,30
135,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"To my mind, a fixed duty is infinitely better than an ad valorem duty, and the ""Minister has admitted that in this case the fixed rate suggested is practically equivalent to the. ad .valoremrate. charged. at. a. fixed rate, I think .that .should'not make-an exception in this case."" - Mr .

There is one paragraph in the finding of the free-trade section of the Commission which I recom.mend to the attention of honourable members. It reads:The total cost of production, including harvesting and all charges, is nearly covered by the present duty. Freight, present duty, and other transit charges on imported salt, vary from 75 to 130 per cent, on the f.o.b. value, while the present duty alone is equal to more than, 50 'per cent, of the shipping value of the best coarse salt, which is used for curing purposes. The conclusion arrived at was as followsFinally, the evidence clearly proves that the salt industry in Australia has greatly expanded under the operation of the - Commonwealth Tariff, and that it has been more profitable than previously to the manufacturers, although consumers have in some States contributed through enhanced prices to this prosperity. The reference to the enhanced prices means that there has been an arrangement by which the trade of the States has been apportioned. If honourable members wish to accentuate that state of things they have only to vote for the Government proposal. On the other hand, if they are satisfied that this industry, as the evidence undoubtedly shows, has fared very well, that it has practically secured the whole of the trade, and that only an insignificant portion is supplied from over-sea, then I feel sure that they will vote for a reversion to the old duty. Since salt is undoubtedly a requirement of the great butter industry of the Commonwealth, it is highly desirable that the duty should not be increased, because that would simply mean a tax upon that industry. I do not say that Australian salt when properly refined is not equal to the very best imported salt. When proper care is taken - in regard to the refining process Australian salt is equal in quality to any that is imported. The question is really whether the butterproducers of Australia are to be taxed for the benefit of the salt-producing industry which, as the evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission shows very conclusively, was able to carry on very comfortably under the qld rate of duty. Mr Fowler.  tend to support the reduction of the duty to 12s. 6d. per ton, and wish to avail myself of this opportunity to reply to the references that have frequently been made > d 1906, 8,796 tons. These a r , to the attitude which I took up on this question when the first Federal Tariff was under consideration. If any honourable member doubts my word, it is quite easy for him to trace my votes in Hansard. As a matter of fact, the duty originally proposed under the old"" Tariff was £ x per ton. The Committee reduced it to ios - per ton. Then there was an attempt to make it 15s. per ton, but a compromise was arrived at, and the duty was fixed at 12s. 6d. What I did-and this is the vote which has induced some honourable members to say that I slipped-wa s to refuse to support a recommittal. I regarded the duty ot 12s. 6d. per ton as a compromise, and would not vote for interfering with it. I believe that that duty is quite sufficient. I observe that whenever the Queensland representatives have a chance of securing a duty on an item which specially interests their State, they vote for.it solidly, irrespective of whether the commodity in question is actually being"" produced in Queensland or not. However, their conduct has nothing to do with me; I intend to be consistent, though I suppose that I ' could very easily put forward a good-case on behalf of the producers of salt fbr a higher duty.",32
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Would the honourable member vote for making salt free?  Weeks ago I gave notice of an amendment to reduce the duty to 12s. 6d. per ton, in conformity with the compromisie arrived at when the last Tariff was debated. If the Minister takes the trouble to look through the list of amendments which I have circulated, he will find that the duties which I support are considerably below those in the existing Tariff.",33
143,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Robertson) [6.15] - I consider that the honourable member for Grey has been perfectly consistent in his votes regarding salt. I well remember the incident to which he has referred. The duty of 12s! 6d. per ton was the result'of a compromise,. But the honourable member has forgotten to tell the Committee that had he voted with the Opposition on that occasion for a recommittal of the item, that duty, in all probability, would have been reduced.  mittal was after the compromise had been arrived at.",33
144,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"The honourable member is quite correct. This is an industry which especially concerns the electorates of the honourable member for Grey and the honourable member for Corio. know the salt pans on Yorke Peninsula very well. They are close to the sea, in St. Vincent's Gulf, and there is no expense attached to the conveyance of the commodity to a railway or to the port of shipment. The natural protection given to the industry is quite sufficient of itself. used to do a good deal of business in this class of salt some years ago, and the South Australian company, at that time, used to sell salt at £ 1 per ton. Since then the industry has developed into a very fine thing, and numbers of people have gone into it. It is flourishing. The honourable member for Perth has»told us that salt is now being exported. Of - course, people who have been in the habit of using very fine imported salt for table purposes will continue to use it, no matter what the duty may be. But we now export-quite as much as we import, and the local competition has been sufficient to bring about a reduction in price. At the period to whichi I have referred, salt was produced in competition with the world, and was freely purchased curing of hides and skins, the making of bacon, and for dairying purposes. There is no difficulty in producing an excellent article. If we were to carry out the suggestion of the free-trade - section of the Tariff Commission, we should impose a duty of no more than 5s. a ton, which would be. about 25 per cent, on the value of the class of salt I am now speaking about.. That duty will be. quite sufficient for the industry. .The quantity of labour employed is not. considerable, though there is sufficient salt produced to supply the demands of Australia.",34
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"There are 3,000 or 4,000 people employed.",34
146,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"The output is considerable, and it would be still larger if we had a greater population to supply. If we increase the duty the chances are that the price of salt will be increased in the same ratio. I trust that the Committee will adhere to the understanding arrived at amongst honourable members in the last Parliament, namely, that we should adjust anomalies in the Tariff, but not increase duties upon those articles the producers of which are doing very - well. We should rather give a helping hand to those industries that are languishing. This is an industry that is thriving, and could do without any protection whatever. As, however-, we are expected to adhere to the old Tariff as far as possible, I shall vote for a duty I of 12s. 6d. per ton.",34
147,Mr CROUCH,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Corio) [6.19] - I - am glad that in this case no attack has been made on the quality of the Australian article concerned. The honourable member' for Perth has testified to the fact that the quality of the Australian salt produced I is excellent. The only criticism that I have to meet, therefore, is that of the honourable member for Corangamite, who naturally wishes to do his best for the pastoral and dairying industries, and who has argued that an increase in the duty wiil have the effect of raisingprices owing to the probable establishment of a ring. But if that were likely to be the effect, it would have resulted when the Victorian Parliament imposed a duty of jQi per ton. At that time, although the Moolap Company, which carries on business near Geelong, had the benefit of that duty they sold their salt at 22s. per ton. The honourable member for Corangamite will see. that if the company had sold at the price of imported salt, the Moolap salt would have fetched £ 2 5s. per ton. for the We are facing a great danger if we do riot protect the industry sufficiently. There is no doubt that salt is the subject of a worldwide trust. The Financial News of. 8th July, 1901, contains the followingThere have been specific denials of the accuracy of cables on the part of the Salt Union of England.; but a New York corresponednt informs us that the formation of a trust to control almost the entire salt output of the world has been definitely announced at the offices of the National Salt Company, located in the Standard Oil Buildings, No. 26 Broadway. The new company (he says) will embrace the Salt Union of England, the Canadian Salt Company, and the National Salt Company, under the title of the International Salt Company. The concern will also! include the Saleina Espanola Spanish salt mines, which were recently acquired by the Union Salt Company, and incorporated under the laws of New Jersey. Standard Oil Company interests, which own the majority of the stock of the National Salt Company, are behind the deal. This will be the first international combine ever formed. The consolidated company will control the salt output of every civilized country on the globe, with the exception of the salt, mines in Russia. The capital will exceed 50,000,000""dollars. Prominent banking interests have agreed to take charge of the underwriting. If the Australian industry is stamped out, instead of a decreased price to our -'dairymenj--we - shall lia-ve an increased price'. - If J'thought that a ring would be formed in' the-Australian industry, I should not vote for va duty.

155,Mr SINCLAIR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I obtained my information from the report of the Tariff Commission. If that report is not correct, then my statement is wrong. Prior to Federation we <were able to purchase Australian salt for 45s. a ton. Its price has now advanced to 65s. per ton. The price of imported salt usually ranges from 75s - to 85s. per ton, so that the Australian article appears to enjoy a very good natural protection. It has deservedly earned a name for itself amongst the consumers, and consequently it has nothing to fear from outside competition. To my mind, 12s. 6d. per. ton represents a very heavy impost.",37
156,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"North Sydney) [7.55] - Variou s statements have been made in connection with the salt industry, some of which will scarcely withstand analysis. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has said that if the present duty is nol increased from 12s. 6d. to 20s. per ton, the industry in South Australia will probably be destroyed. I am aware that this Committee has displayed great liberality by granting to many industries a protection which, according to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, they do not require. I disagree with the honourable member in the view which he entertains, because the whole of the testimony presented to that body shows that since the imposition of the first Commonwealth Tariff, under which a duty of 12s. 66. perton was collected, the salt companies both in South Australia and Victoria have been doing remarkably well.",37
157,Mr CROUCH,PAYMENT OF MAI L,The companies in South Australia have paid a dividend during only one year.,37
158,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I , shall show the dividends which have been paid f in that State. It has been said that one South Australian company has gone to the wall. I am quite aware of that fact, be the cause I happened to be a shareholder in of it. But that comparty did not go to the wall ih consequence of competition from beyond Australia. It failed purely owing are to internal reasons. That this is so is conshown by the fact that a number of those who were interested in the venture formed a new company, which was perfectly satisfied that it could profitably conduct its operations under the old rate of duty. by From the report of the free-trade section 1899 of the Tariff Commission I find thatThe Cheetham Company, in Victoria, paid no dividends prior to 1806, then only 2^ per cent.; no dividend in 1897, and. in the four years 1808-1901, the dividends paid average 6J; pet cent. In the complete three years subsequently, viz., 1902-4, the average dividends amounted to 7^ per cent, per annum. That statement evidences the progress of the .company, under the operationof the old Tariff"". From the same report I learnThe Castle Salt Co-operative Company of South Australia, according to the evidence of its secretary, did not pay any dividends prior to Federation; the first dividend paid was is. per share in one half-year of 1902. In the years 1903 and 1904 the dividends were is. 6d. per share, and 9a. per share had been declared for the first half of the year 190.5, equal to 7^ per cent. There had been, however, considerable writing down of plant and purchase of new machinery out of proceeds, whilst the company's indebtedness to its bankers of £8,297 in the 1904 account, had been reduced to ^4,400 in the 1905 statement. The actual net profits earned, without special provisions for repairs, & c , appear to have been a shade over 10 per cent, per annum in those two years. That is testimony that the company in question progressed more under the operation of a duty of 12s. 6d. per tonthan it did under the old South Australian rate of 20s. per' ton. The reason for this is obvious; the market for its product had been enlarged. The honourable member for Corio has stated that the Australian companies were entirely dissociated from combines. I understood him to say that if they were not, he would not support the increased duty proposed. Here is a statement from the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission in reference to the Castle Salt Company.The average annual shipments of this company, according to that witness, were 5,000 to 6,000 tons. The salt was consigned to agents in New Zealand, and sold on the company's account at prices about the same as' in Victoria, al- Willis, Henry though the freight was less to that State, but they did as well out of the business in New Zealand as out of that in Victoria, there being a difference in the qualities of the salt. admitted, in reply to further questions, that there was an arrangement with the'English Salt Union as to thepartition of the trade of New Zealand, regulating the quantities each should sell, and the prices, which were made uniform. This arrangement gave the English salt a little better result than it obtained in Australia. It will be seen, therefore, that this company forms part of a large combine which is operating in New Zealand. But there is nothing to prevent it adopting similar tactics in the Commonwealth. Apart from that fact, the progress of the .salt industry, under the operation of trie old rate of duty, has been very gratifying. Since 1899 the imports of salt have declined from 28,000 tons to 8,700 tons. manufacturers have captured nearly the whole of the trade of the Commonwealth, the consumption of which is estimated at from 40,000 to 50,000 tons per annum. Uncler these circumstances, what reason can be advanced for departing from the old rate of duty of 12s. 6d. per ton?

Item agreed to. Postponed item 100. Soap, ad val., 25 per cent. Our Mr JOHNSON .(Lang) [8.12] - I intend to propose a reduction of this duty. The old duty on perfumed, toilet, and medicated soap was 3d. per lb., and on soap n.e.i., including polishing, Jd. per lb. The duty now proposed is an all-round duty of 25 per cent. I am at a loss tb understand why the Minister has not proposed a, preference in connection with this item, seeing that the great bulk of our importations of soap come from the Old Country. Of perfumed toilet and other similar soaps, we imported from the United Kingdom 583,918 lbs. Importations were received also from Canada, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, Straits Settlements, 31 Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States. As compared with 19 the importation from the United Kingdom, AYES. our next largest importation was from the United States, from which we received Reid, G. H . 2 35> 43 lbs., and the third largest importa2 tion was from Germany, from which country we received only 55,026 lbs. of the perTeUers : fumed and fancy soaps. Of the soaps n.e.i. which are imported, by far the largest quantity! comes from Great Britain. NOES. The total importation of soaps n.e.i. is 1,147,486 lbs., of which 1,125,656 lbs. come from Great Britain, and only n.,830 lbs. from other places-Cap e Colony, New Zealand, the Straits Settlements, Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and the United States. Therefore the duty falls mainly on British manufactures. The old duty on perfumed toilet and medicated soaips was equivalent to from 20 to 40 per cent. ad valorem according to quality, while the expenses of importation amounted to 20 per cent. Of polishing soap, Brook's Monkey brand is practically the only kind imported. It is invoiced at 17s. .3d. per 50 lbs:, arid the. old duty was equivalent tb 12 per cent'.' dd valor em, the importing; expenses coming: to 2b per cent - On household soa.ps invoiced at from -21s - 3d. to 24s. 3d.,, the' old duty was equivalent to about 22 .per'cent, ad valorem, * while the expenses of. .importation were about"" 35 per cent. Therefore it will-be seen that, with the exception of the cheaper toilet- 'soaps, the substitution of ;the proposed ad valorem rates'for* the-old fixed rktes means really a substantial increase'of duty. In 1900, potior to Federation and the-imposition-of the first Commonwealth Tariff, the"" irhpor'-tarion of toilet soaps' Was 820/774 lbs., and 'iri I9P6 65,840 lbs.,, an enormous falling off.

178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,The member will see that very little of the imported starch will come under the duty of 2kl.,42
179,Mr JOHNSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"On the contrary, I think a considerable quantity will be subject to the higher duty. We get from Hong Kong, in round figures, 4,000 lbs.; from Belgium, 1,000 lbs.; from 1,000 lbs.; from Egypt, 2,000 lbs.; from Germany, 228,000 lbs.; from the Netherlands, 4^000 lbs.; and also a little from New Zealand and the Straits Settlements. Mr Justice Hood, in a judgment, stated that the-labour employed in this industry is very slight as compared with the machinery, and, in this connection, the f o llowing letter, which was published in the Melbourne Age, is of importanceYour statement of the rase for what has been called the ""new protection"" is timely. I wish to present a side of thi« question which has hitherto been unduly negated. the rice from which the starch is made is about £ 8 a ton; the yield of starch varies, but may not unfairly be put down at 72 per cent., so that to produce 1 ton of starch, raw material worth about £11 is necessary. The Excise duty ->d . a lb - cost s £ 9 6s. Sd. per ton; the cost of producing a ton'of starch is £ 2 12s. 6d., a fact which I have from one of the three manufacturers. Accordingly, £ 2 3 represents the prime cost of the starch per ton. Even at a ing price of ^34 per ton-whic h seems to have been the bedrock price-ther e is l e ft £ 1 1 per ton for cost of distribution, advertising, travel? lers' expenses, and profits. If , as the manufacturers assert, there is a heavy loss, then with sense of fairness can they lay it to the account of cost of production, viz., £ 2 12s. 6d. per ton, an amount of which the wages paid tu workmen is, after all, only a portion? Why not set it down, as every one who knows all tha facts, to the exorbitant expenses incurred in ad travellers' expenses, rebates to custoas well as to the ""cost of distribution ? The amount set down as the cost of production, £ 2 12s. 6d. per ton, is not entirely spent ou wages. It includes machinery charges, f u e l , repairs, cost of packages, boxes, & c , and therefore the wages paid do not absorb the and whole of this. An increase-sa y of 20 per cent. n £ 2 ios. would bring the cost of production U P to £ 3 perton, but even then this would be comparatively small as compared with the J £ I I ton which the manufacturers assert is spent other ways. The Judge was therefore correct in practically saying that in this unhealthy and unnecessary competition the workmen suffered. Competition may be the life of trade, but it by need not mean death to humane feeling.",42

To produce starch from other material will require altogether new machinery. To require persons engaged in an industry which hasi been built up with the.encouragement of a duty of i d . per lb. to purchase new machinery, and to engage in another process of manufacture, would be an extraordinary proceeding.

If we have done wrong in the past,' do not let us do wrong in the future. Let us try to save expense if possible. I believe that it would be very difficult for ah officer to has enter a factory and distinguish between starch made from imported rice and starch made from local products. When an Excise duty is levied upon the products of a factory the position is quite different. I intend to support the omission of the word "" free.""- , .",47

250,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"The honourable member, knows that the fact that there was an Excise duty of i d . per'lb - was anargument in support of the Customs duty.",47
251,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I admit that. Probably if there had not been an Excise duty the im- introduced. port duty would not have been fixed as it was. This afternoon I asked that there should be no differentiation in connection with the factories. I suggested that if a factory were engaged in making starch from various materials it should be allowed to do so, and that a manufacturer should not be allowed to make starch from one material in one factory and from rice in another factory. I hope that the Minister will agree to adopt practically one line and so let us get on with items which are more important. I am informed by a firm of manufacturers in my electorateLewis and Whitty-that if the two lines are allowed to stand, their machinery which was made for the production of rice starch will become obsolete. The manufacturers say that locally-grown materials, if used, would produce an inferior starch. If they desire to make the best quality they should be commended, and Parliament should not place any obstacle in their way. I hope that the Minister will agree to an amendment if moved or move an amendment to leave the Excise on starch precisely as it was in the old Tariff, namely, r d . per lb. all round.  had needed an argument for carrying the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes it has been supplied by the honordemand able member for Yarra, because he has urged produce. that if the manufacturers of starch used any material other than rice their machinery would become obsolete. He considers that he is a strong protectionist, but what has he to say about the interests of primary producers who grow potatoes, maize, wheat, and other starch-producing articles? He has no primary producers of that kind in his constituency, and therefore they do not concern him one iota. Nor does the primary producer concern the honourable member for Mernda so long as he can get his own purse well filled, and can take tent Excise duty. what he can out of the pockets of the people, and out of the pockets of arise his employees too. The primary producer does not concern that honourable member bit. That is the' principal argument in my estimation the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes should be agreed to.",48

I am will be slightly less. [198] sorry that the personal element has been On the other hand, I think that the main attitude which the honourable member for Maranoa has taken up is quite right. If the manufacturers are not ready when the occasion arises to give a preference to Australian articles they are taking a very selfish view, which is not satisfactory to those of us who want to encourage all forms of Australian production.",48
253,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,They will use the rice if it is grown here.,48
254,Mr CROUCH,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"There are other articles which can be grown here. The Minister has mentioned three or four articles which may be used in the manufacture of starch.' If by means of a preference we can induce the manufacturers to use an Australian product, it is only right that we should do so. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Maranoa will be the means of causing Australian products to be used by manufacturers who are heavily protected, and I shall therefore support it . If manufacturers alone were to be protected by this Tariff, many honourable members would not be prepared to support it .

255,Mr KNOX,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Kooyong) [9.56] - I am in sympathy with the object which the Treasurer has in view in separating these items. It should be our desire to see Australian products used, as far as possible, in Australian manufactures; but, since both sections of the Tariff Commission are agreed as to the position we should take up, I cannot see why ,we should depart from the proposal previously made.

259,Mr KNOX,PAYMENT OF MAI L,I think that we should obtain a larger revenue by having only one item of Excise applying to all the material used.,49
260,Mr FRAZER,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Kalgoorlie) [1.0.1] - I - am unable to follow the reasoning of protectionists who ask for a uniform Excise duty upon this article. One of the objects of a protectionist Tariff is to assist the primary producers as well as the manufacturers of Australia. We have given more than reasonable consideration to the starch manufacturers by the admission of rice free from the imposition of Customs duty. We have now a proposal that starch made from rice shall pay an Excise duty of id. per lb., and that starch made from materials grown within the CommonAvealth shall be free of Excise. The adoption of that proposal will offer a reasonable inducement to the local starch manufacturers to seek for raw material other than rice that can be produced in Australia. That is certainly desirable. The ment' advanced against this proposal, primarily by the honourable member for Yarra, and supported by the honourable .member for Mernda, that certain machinery would be put out of use by its adoption, offers no sufficient reason for failing to avail ourselves of an opportunity to encourage the primary producers of Australia to supply the raw material for this industry, instead of our having to import rice for the purpose. The best means of securing the object that I have in view is that of standing by the proposal in the form submitted in the printed schedule.

Amendment negatived.  the last division, I am quite satisfied as to the attitude of the Government towards the primary producers of this country. It appears to me that the man on the land is to have no consideration whatever. In Melbourne, where the Treasurer is surrounded by wealthy manufacturers, they can get his ear and the ear of his officers. But the farmers and producers, who are not present to give him the tip, cannot get any protection. A ll that the amendment of arguthe honourable member for. Parkes meant was to give the starch manufacturers their rice free and to limit the Excise to any other material. We know from the evidence given before the Appeal Board in Melbourne how badly the starch manufacturers want protection ! If I had my way with them, they would get very little of it. I would shut every one of them up tomorrow, considering the wages they are paying. What do they care about the miserable hovels in which the employees live, as shown in the Lone Hand., so long as they can maintain their own palatial establishments? If the Government will not yield to the extent of giving the primary producer some protection, they will receive very little support from me in the future.",49
261,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Parkes) [10.13]. - Many honourable members have expressed a desire to see this Excise duty of i d . put upon starch of all kinds made in the Commonwealth, whether from materials imported or from materials grown in Australia. I propose to test the feeling of the Committee upon that point by an amendment, the effect of which will be to put starch upon the same footing as it occupied under the last Tariff, where there was no differentiation at all. I propose to impose an Excise duty of i d . per lb. upon starch, no matter from what it is made. An honourable member, prior to the last division, asked me why we should have an Excise duty at all. I point out that when we were discussing the Customs duty, the Committee was told that the manufacturers had to pay i d . Excise under a subsequent part of the Tariff, and that, therefore, the duty under consideration could not be dealt with without taking the Excise into consideration. A number of other honourable members have shown a desire to impose an Excise of i d . indiscriminately. I am prepared to join in that direction. We must remember that we are now considering the revenue of the country. We have given a high duty to the manufacturers of starch upon the supposition that they were going to pay an Excise of id. per lb. upon all that they manufactured. I propose that we should look after the revenue by making this Excise duty operate irrespective of the material. I therefore propose to move That after the word "" rice"" the following words be inserted- "" or other materials."" If the' amendment is carried, I shall move to strike out the subsequent words. There are two ways in which what I desire could be done; one is to insert after the word ""rice"" the words ""or other materials,"" and then to move to strike but the whole of paragraph b, or to now move that paragraph b be omitted ",49
262,The CHAIRMAN,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I point out that I can accept the amendment which the honourable member has indicated, but if he moves to'Omit paragraph b he will not be in order.",50
263,Mr WATSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"South Sydney) [10.16]. - I should have preferred to impose a duty of i d . per lb., and to have no Excise. In mv opinion, we made a mistake five years ago in adopting an Excise as against the original proposal for a simple import' duty. However, as we have adopted an Excise, it seems that the differentiation between starch made from rice and starch made from other agricultural products gives an opportunity to assist our local primary producer, as suggested by the honourable member for Maranoa. The amendment just disposed of did not appeal to me as. likely to achieve anything, because an import duty of is. 9d. a central is imposed on cereals, and also on potatoes from abroad, so that it is not probable that these materials would the used by any local starch[198]- 2 makers in view of the additional Excise duty. But the proposal which the Government have now placed before us does give a preference to the local grower of cereals or potatoes as against imported rice. I do not pretend to know anything of technical details, but I think we ought to give some encouragement, by means of a differentiation, of duty, to the manufacturers of starch from our own raw material.",50
264,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.19] - The honourable member for Maranoa made what I regard as quite an unprovoked attack on me just now. I do not know what the honourable member thought he was voting for; but, at any rate, he was not voting to protect the-primary producer. ",50
265,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"The honourable member was voting to exactly the opposite eftect; and I shall test the honourable member when we come to deal with paragraph b. What.I am concerned with is the protection of the primary producer, and not the insignificant point raised by - the honourable member. Does the honourable member suppose that those who manufacture starch will import anything else but rice, in view of the fact that there is a duty on maize and all other similar material ? It was blank cartridge which was fired by the honourable member for Parkes. My desire is to see the primary producer protected. The question is not whether the industry of starch making can be carried on with the machinery thiat is here; the question is whether we ought to encourage the production of raw material of some kind from which starch may be produced. The proposal I submit is consistent with the principle I have always advocated, but if the Committee do not choose to accept it, well, the matter is not of supreme importance. The revenue cannot amount to much, because there is not much starch made'from any material grown in Australia. But the duty is proposed with a view to induce persons to grow rice for the purposes of the industry. This is not a revenue duty, but. absolutely the reverse, and must be regarded as a means of developing the production of our own raw materials.",50
266,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Mr Chairman, I did not quite understand your reply to my question. My object is to invite the Committee to charge the Excise duty on all mg.nv,factured starch.. I should like to know whether I can attain my object by moving the insertion after the word "" rice ' 1 of the words "" or any other materials,""with a view to subsequently omitting paragraph b, or whether I ought to move the omission of paragraph b now?",50
267,The CHAIRMAN,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"If the honourable member were to move to omit paragraph b, and make the Excise duty rd. per lb. all round, the effect would be to increase the duty; therefore, the honourable member would not be in order in submitting such an amendment.  replv to the Treasurer, I may say that I consider I was on safe ground in saying what I did about the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes. I am still of opinion that that amendment would, if carried, have protected the primary producer, so far as importations were concerned, because the words "" or other material imported "" covers the whole range of anything from which starch could be made.",51
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"But those materials are all subject to duty now.  the Treasurer, I am satisfied that paragraph b will safeguard the primary producer, though not to the same extent as the amendment would have done.",51

270,Mr SALMON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"It is impossible to hear what the honourable member for Parkes is saying.

283,Mr SINCLAIR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Moreton) [10.33] - We have already decided to admit rice for making starch free. The effect of striking out paragraph b' would be to bring imported rice, which is free of duty, into competition with our primary products.",51

The Minister would do better if he stood firm instead of suggesting that the Committee - should negative paragraph b.",52

The individual who uses it medicinally upon every occasion that he drinks tea or coffee consumes more than does the individual who drinks it in aerated waters; but we are allowing the oneand preventing the' other. I am not prepared to say whether or not the use of saccharine is injurious. I know that doctors frequently recommend it. If its use is injurious the Government should prevent its local production, and an Excise duty of £ 5 per lb., although it is a very heavy impost may not be' absolutely prohibitive in an article of this kind.",52
294,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,It s import has been prohibited and as an Excise of £ 5 per lb. is levied no local manufacturer likely to undertake its production.,53
295,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"The most direct way would be to prohibit the manufacture. I should like to know whether the Minister is satisfied that the article is so injurious to health that its importation and manufacture ought to be prohibited, or whether this duty is proposed because its manufacture would be an interference with sugar. If it were only interference with sugar, I should be prepared to move that it should not be prohibited, - but if the officers of the .Customs Department have come to the conclusion that the article is absolutely injurious to health, I would not raise the question.",53
296,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Yarra) [10.46] - In the case of every other item in connection with which an Excise duty is imposed, the Committee has dealt with the import duty first. I know that the honourable members for Grey and Boothby, and, I think, the honourable member for Angas also, were waiting for this item when we were dealing with the item sugar. I believe that the Minister, at the time, said that he would take it in connection with item 278. I think he would do well to postpone this item until we have dealt with - the import duty under item 278.",53
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"Trea surer) [10.47] - What the honourable member has said is quite correct. I was not aware that honourable members who desired to discuss this item were absent. If the honourable member for North Sydney will look at item 278, he will find that saccharine is included under "" Drugs and Chemicals,"" and is dutiable at 30s. per lb. The importation of the article is not desirable, except for medicinal purposes. This is the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, who were very strongly against the use of the article except for medicinal purposes. This Excise duty of -£5 is really a prohibitive duty. As I remember that some honourable members referred to it previously, and I said I would have it discussed in connection with item 278, I now move That the item be postponed until the import duties have been dealt with.

300,Mr HUTCHISON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,Will the honourable member for Corangamite suggest something effective?,53
301,Mr WILSON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,;-The honourable member can insist that the Minister shall collect the Excise.,53
302,Mr HUTCHISON,PAYMENT OF MAI L,"I do not know what the law really provides, but Parliament should be informed of the legal position. We should be told whether the Minister can or cannot carry out the provisions of the Act. If he cannot,, he is not to be blamed because nothing so far has been done, and Parliament will be to blame if it does not pass an amending law. But the present condition of affairs is unjust to both employees and those manufacturers who are paying reasonable wages. I hope that the Minister will tell us why he is not collecting Excise from manufacturers who are not paying reasonable rates. The irritation and dissatisfaction which have existed for so many months should not be allowed to continue.",53
