2,Mr BEAZLEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 is a recipe for uncertainty. It is, in its current form, flawed piece of legislation headed straight multiple visits to the High Court. The reason for this is, quite clearly, the fact that piece of legislation has had to be negotiated Australians. through a backbench whose every public presentation of views makes evident its complete ignorance of the legal framework which successful legislation has to be purabout sued. The government has surrendered certainty for pastoralists and the minerals and resources industry, and decent treatment of the property rights of indigenous Australians, for a bogus backbench unity-a unity based, as it is, a fundamentally mistaken view parliament's legislative powers and an ignorance of the certainty to be found in the rule of law. This is the dominant fact of contemportray porary Australian politics on this issue, and is no good for our country. Labor shares the government's stated desire for greater certainty for all stakeholders, greater workability of the Native Title Act 1993 and for the timely resolution of disputes the act seeks to address. The amendment to the Native Title Act is a task and a responsibility that would have confronted the Labor Party had we remained in government. The Mabo decision brought Australia into line as the last New World nation with a tradition of British common law to recognise the pre-settlement laws of its indigenous people as giving rise to native title. Even without the hysteria and campaigns of misinformation that followed the decision, the amendgovernment of the day would have been obliged to respond. There was a need for clarification of the implications for all levels of government and all holders of post-settlement titles as well as for potential native title claimants. There were 1997 complex legal, social and economic issues to be worked through. There was the prospect at the time of a myriad of common law claims native title from indigenous people to be conducted without a statutory framework and with a single piece of case law for guidance. consequence was likely to be a lengthy period of complex, expensive legal action and a great deal of legal and economic uncertaina ty, just as surely as the process had the for potential to be socially divisive both within indigenous communities and between in this digenous communities and non-indigenous Unlike most conservative political leaders across Australia, the Labor government in accepted the concept of native title and set devising a decent, workable, practical response. A key element of the response to Mabo was the Native Title Act 1993. The act was the product of extensive and inclusive negotiations with all stakeholders. The process was further enhanced by extensive research on on comparable responses in Canada, New Zeaof this land and the United States. I go back to that point of inclusive discussions with all stakeholders. Some folk like to the notion that an arrangement was set it in place with one set of stakeholders onlythe indigenous community-and an act emerged. If people recollect those times, as I for do, there were in that community substantial concerns about the way in which the government was legislating, substantial concerns which produced some profound disagreements between the indigenous community and the government of the day. In the end, what was produced was an on-balance result, not a result that went-as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to say in producing his pendulums on these matters-all one way. Interfering with that balanced result places any particular legislative activity at great constitulasting tional risk. The act aimed to provide an expeditious, cost-effective and less legalistic alternative to resolving matters on a case-by-case basis in common law actions. It established the Native Title Tribunal and allowed for state governments to set up approved alternative processes. The clearest immediate outcome from the act was the validation of every previously issued title for every existing title holder. In particular, it validated potentially invalid past acts of governments, such as grants of interest in lands since the commencement of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The aim in a prevailing atmosphere of legal uncertainty was to achieve certainty, clarity and workability. The drafting and passage of the act was carried on in the face of a stubborn refusal on the part of the coalition parties to engage constructively in the process. Every word, every clause, was routinely opposed, irrespective of its merits or the interests that it sought to protect. It makes nonsense of the Prime Minister's rabid assertions that the flaws in the present act are the sole responsibility of the Labor government. Despite urgings by miners and pastoralists-and I well remember them at the time-the Liberal Party in opposition refused constructive participation in that debate. They let this parliament down and they let the country down, and many features in the act which are difficult to work at this stage can be directly sheeted home to that. We will not treat either the government or the country the same way. The majority of conservative politicians simply rejected the concept of native title. They attacked both the concept and the High Court that had seen fit to recognise it. They typified the attitude that led the Hon. Justice Ronald Sackville to observe in more recent times: Attacks are made in some quarters on the High Court's decision in Wik that go beyond robust criticism of theÂ· court's reasoning process and conclusion and amount to attempts to undermipe the authority of the court as an institution. The government took the view that the only certainty for all stakeholders was that which emerged from consensus. Any party aggrieved by the process or the outcome would challenge matters in the courts. In the case of indigenous people, their acceptance of legislated validation of titles was essential to the success of the bill. Their willingness to surrender or forgo any claims related to those titles that were validated was essential for the success of the bill. The principal offsetting benefit for this wholesale validation of potentially invalid titles was the grant of a time limited right to negotiate in respect of grants of mining interests and compulsory acquisition for the benefit of others of land where native title may have survived. There is no veto in this. It is time limited and any outcome is capable of being overridden by a determination by a state or Commonwealth minister. Remember that. There is only one form of title in this country which has an unlimited veto. That happens to be Western Australian freehold title and agricultural lease title. They do, under those titles, have an absolute discretion to prevent other forms of economic activity taking place on that land. There are some features of it similar in the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, but there can also be ministerial intervention in relation to the national interest, so it is not unlimited veto. Only those forms of title in this country carry the right of veto in relation to other persons' economic rights in relation to the land that you owned or have access to by virtue of the title. Indigenous people with no hope of access to any benefits in surviving native title were given access to a land fund. A social justice package promised at the time was being negotiated when Labor lost office. Negotiations have not been continued by the incoming government, though those negotiations were one of the things which made the previous act safe. People need to bear that in mind: they are one of the compromises which produced the on balance outcome that the High Court accepted as rendering the act valid. The government's failure in this bill to understand these underpinnings is one of the flawed elements of their legislative approach which make it highly vulnerable to court challenge. Initial resistance by some state governments was typified by the Western Australian government's resoundingly unsuccessful attempt to challenge the constitutionality of the act and institute a legislative regime substituting an inferior statutory title for native title. The Western Australian challenge was lost 7-0 and the state legislation found to be invalid due to inconsistency with the Commonwealth act. But it is instructive to note this: the Western Australian government responded to its loss by instituting correct future act procedures as set out in the Native Title Act. Since that time, according to figures given in evidence before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on 23 September by the chief registrar of the Native Title Tribunal, Ms Patricia Lane, of notified intentions to carry out mining activities submitted under the expedited procedures, a peak figure of 97 per cent, settling down to 92 per cent, have gone forward without challenge from potential native title claimants. There are approximately 17 native title related cases before the courts, at the conclusion of which many existing uncertainties will have been resolved. After pervading uncertainty with the new procedures, many problems have been ironed out. Confusion in the public mind as to the role of the Native Title Tribunal, sometimes fuelled by mischievous representation by vested interests, has led to criticism of the lack of determinations emerging from the tribunal. The tribunal, of course, is a mediating body with no powers of determination without the consent of all parties. If a state government or other party refuses to reach an agreement, the tribunal has no option but to pass the matter on to the Federal Court for determination. An encouraging sign has been the emergence over time of regional agreements reached with the assistance of the tribunal and without recourse to the court. It should not be surprising that that is an attractive option. More than 70 per cent of all commercial disputes are resolved before reaching court. The motives are often very similar to experiences in the native title field: uncertainty of court outcomes, the high cost of litigation and commercially ruinous waste of time. Yandacoogina and the Murrin Murrin agreements, together with the Cape York heads of agreement, with all of their short-term difficulties, are examples of a capacity to reach agreement faster than any conceivable court settlement of a common law claim. Whatever the shortcomings of the existing act, let us take time to consider that point. The Wik case is a common law claim. It has been in the courts since June 1993. It is still there, with matters of substance related to it yet to be determined. That is four years down the track. Think of the 600 or so claims currently registered with the tribunal. The collapse, in the face of High Court challenge, of a badly amended act, an act bulldozed through the parliament by an unthinking government, would see all those cases, and more, clogging up our courts indefinitely. The pastoral industry might survive such a scenario but not the mining industry. If you thought we had problems now, you have seen nothing compared with that worse case prospect. In fact, observers have already noted what could be a scare effect. In the face of possible adverse treatment through the prospective provisions of the government's bill, there is a worrying trend now reported in the number of cases that otherwise would have been prepared for processing through native title processes that have been diverted now down the common law route. We could already be previewing a corning nightmare for the minerals and resources industry in particular and Australian society in general. I tum now to the government's amendment bill. The opposition endorses the principle that the time is right for amendment. It was always accepted that, with relevant common law cases already in train and with an entirely new process to be put in place, the original act would in time need to be amended in the light of practical experience in the tribunal and the Federal Court and in recognition of new case law as it emerged. There are still many problems to be addressed. Confusion over the meaning of the native title concept and the proper expectations that can flow from the Mabo and Wik decisions has not been the preserve of any one interest group. Unsustainable claims, multiple claims and overlapping claims; on the one hand, have been matched by a failure to negotiate in good faith, a failure to set up appropriate state tribunals and a failure to adequately resource the system on the other. The virtual gridlock inherent in the current situation in Kalgoorlie, with its maze of overlapping, conflicting and sometimes unsustainable claims impacting on mining, residential development and many aspects of daily life, is a dramatic example of the need for considered, sustainable change to the act in the interests of all parties. However, this government has particular difficulty in dealing with the problem. It is attempting to amend an act dealing with a concept it long refused to accept or recognise. In so doing, it is tampering with a piece of legislation that it failed to address with any intellectual rigour on its part when it came before the parliament in 1993. It failed to understand the breadth of its intent, the complexity of its processes and, importantly, the head of power under which it was enacted. It is in the national interest that the act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both indigenous and nonindigenous Australians and of all stakeholders, be they miners, farmers or the Australian taxpayers. It is in the interests of all Australthe ians that they not give into the notion that co-existence is unworkable. We must accept that this nation is mature enough, compassionate enough and pragmatic enough for indigenous and non-indigenous Australians to coexist, indigenous and non-indigenous cultures to co-exist, and the rights and interests attached to them to co-exist. We can work together for the benefit of all Australians. The government must come to understand that native title rights are a reality and that they are here to stay. They have been recognised by the High Court as fundamental legal property rights and are entitled to the same respect and protectionÂ· as the property rights of non-indigenous Australians. It is in the interests of all Australians that we achieve the maximum possible predictability and certainty in the operation of this act and in its practical operation. This government must come to understand that there is an overriding need to guarantee the constitutional validity of this legislation and that its validity could be critically threatened unless it operates for the net benefit of indigenous Australians. We take the Prime Minister back to his oft repeated promises when he said this: We don't wind back the Racial Discrimination Act ... we don't attempt to reverse the Mabo decision ... Failure to act in a fashion that upholds the essence of the original act places at risk things that must be done now to ensure expeditious access for commercial interests vital to our national economy. Labor supports the government in seeking to deal with the registration and determination of claims and the resolving of competing interests in an expeditious and effective regime. These objectives may be advanced by the proper and appropriate adjustment of the registration test. Equally, as we have already observed, these objectives can be advanced by further encouragement and legislative support for the various forms of agreements set out in the bill. Nonetheless, this bill is seriously deficient and it requires substantial amendment. Our areas of greatest concern include the fact that validation provisions exceed anything necessary for addressing any real or perceived problems flowing from the Wik decision. The government's measures purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title through past grants of exclusive tenure involve massive overreach. The legislative provisions, including the schedule, do far more than confirm the current state of the common law as asserted by the government; they involve the extinguishment of surviving common law rights. It is vital that pastoralists are permitted fully enjoy all the entitlements they have been granted under their various tenures. Both 1993 act and the Wik decision affirm that their rights extinguish native title to the of any inconsistency. We will support any amendments that give greater certainty and clarity to that reality. The fact is that the application of the tax act definition of primary production, in defining the activities pursuable without going through the right to negotiate, is simply unacceptably broad. It would allow activities never contemplated in the grant of a pastoral lease which by their very nature require exclusive possession and thereby extinguish native title to the extent of the new inconsiscustoms tency. It would, furthermore, convert public assets such as timber to private assets to detriment of a native title holder. The extension of the primary definition to vacant Crown land adjacent to a pastoral lease allows the leaseholder, with the permission of the state, to carry on any sodefined activity on that land without being drawn into a right-to-negotiate process, that is a clear curtailment of the common law rights of the indigenous people. The test proposed to establish statutory rights is this indefensibly restrictive. It requires contempothat rary, continued physical access. This denies a right of access to land previously exercised within the living memory of most Australians. It must be stressed that each discriminatory measure in the bill raises the threat of challenge to its constitutionality, with the consequence being uncertainty for all connal cerned. The right to negotiate was the critical item in confirming the constitutionality of Native Title Act, yet this bill radically reduces its application. The degree of restrictive application amounts to a form of de facto extinguishment. Changes to registration and claims procedand ures have rendered the system more rigid legalistic, and consequently more expensive. Placing powers in the hands of registrars that they have not been resourced to use and law doing so in a rigid and inadequate time frame will most likely see their decisions challenged with consequent bottlenecks in the courts. to Provision for ministerial intervention before the determination stage will inhibit good faith the negotiations and remove a key incentive for consent agreements outside the court process. extent Respondents will be motivated to lobby the minister rather than deal with claimants. The decision to provide for the application of the rules of evidence and to downgrade regard for the cultural and customary concerns of indigenous applicants in the Federal Court is clearly discriminatory in that it impacts on no other parties and is out of sympathy with the nature of native title as outlined in the Mabo decision. It completely ignores Justice Brennan's statement in Mabo No.2 that: Native title depends upon the traditional laws and of the group, and the nature and incidence of native title must be ascertained as a matter of the fact by reference to those laws and customs. Any amendments that invite legal challenge industry must undermine certainty. The bill descends into absurdity when it seeks to introduce a sunset clause. This is a recipe for ambit claims and guarantees a and return to expensive and complex common law claims after six years. This must surely be the case, unless the government presumes that bill so effectively extinguishes native title there will be little to go to court over. This bill must be made more practical. It must offer a genuinely attractive alternative to common law claims. It must address the legitimate needs of all stakeholders-no more, a no less. Above all, it must be decent and it must retain the beneficial status of the origiact, because if it does not do so it surely has to founder in the High Court. It must the reaffirm the fact that the cultures of this nation can co-exist, that we can all enjoy our rights to our mutual benefit in our own best interests and the best interests of the nation. This is not a bill in our own best interests the best interests of the nation. This is the and minimum achievable bill in a backbench deeply hostile to the concept of native title and deeply ignorant of the operation of the of this nation in regard to it. It is a bill which reflects surrender by this government to that backbench pressure, and the product of surrender by this government to that pressure is that it means it has no solution. There is no solution arising from this. We will cooperate with this government to overcome the problems that it has with its backbench to produce a piece of workable legislation. On behalf of what we understand to be the needs of this nation for certainty and the desire of the people of this country to find themselves in a position where this situation is settled, we offer that cooperation to the government. We have considerable understanding about the operation of this act, but if that offer is spumed by the government then that poses a substantial problem for this country-either in the form of the legislation they get through or in the political consequences that flow from that. This government has to move away from the political motivations essentially underpinning their approach. This is a serious matter which is capable of being dealt with seriously, which is capable of being concluded and which is capable of producing an expeditious and effective process to arrive at conclusions. But that very desirable objective is not contained in this bill.",13
3,Mr TUCKEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Speaker Mr Kelvin Thomson-From the sublime to the ridiculous. Mr TUCKEYI acknowledge that interjection by pointing out that I could claim more good Aboriginal friends than everybody sitting on the other side of this House together. They bring a white, suburban, middle class approach to something about which they know nothing. There was nothing in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to identify where these amendments diminish in any way the native title rights of Aboriginal Australians as allocated to them by the High Court in the Mabo and Wik decisionsnothing whatsoever. Nevertheless, it did not take the Leader of the Opposition long to take some licence with the so-called common law. He told this House that any reduction in the right to negotiate was a diminution of the common law rights of Aboriginal people. Let me challenge the next two legally trained speakers who are listed to represent the views of the opposition on this matter to show me one part of the Mabo or Wik decisions that granted Aboriginal people the right to negotiate-one part of those decisions. The right to negotiate, which is fundamental to the opposition of most people in Australia to the original Native Title Act, was an invention of the Keating government. It was introduced in that act; it was never a common law right; it could never be challenged under common law principles if this parliament chooses to change it. I hope, while the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), was having a little chat, that he heard my challenge. I will repeat my challenge to you: can you point to one part of the Mabo or Wik decisions that granted common law rights to negotiate to Aboriginal people?",18
4,Mr MELHAM,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,It's an extrinsic right to native title.,18
5,Mr TUCKEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Your leader linked the right to negotiate with common law rights, and he misled this parliament in so doingand you know it. The issue of common law is where this matter rests. The fundamentals of what the Mabo decision conferred on Aboriginal people are as follows: The personal rights conferred by common law native title do not constitute an estate or interest in the land itself. They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown, such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession. Again, the fundamentals of that extract from the High Court decision on Mabo 1992 are the words 'exclusive possession'. These amendments do not reduce in any way that granted right. These amendments are an attempt to give more certainty under the law and a better understanding under the law as to how that decision might operate administratively. It is of great interest to me how little time the Leader of the Opposition spent on the specifics of the legislation to sustain the arguments he put forward. The one he can give up on is that there is any common law right or any ability for common law challenge over aspects of the right to negotiate. That was not a right granted in common law by the High Court, and everybody knows it. 'The amendments provide procedures whereby genuine Aboriginal claimants might pursue their rights and ensure that those landholders referred to in the courts whose title has exHnguished native title have the right to occupy their land without intrusion and to understand their rights as well. Australia is a very large country. It has a huge ethnic spread. Some of the most wealthy property owners in Australia today are people who came here as refugees after the Second World War, and they are as welcome to Australia as the first settlers as far as I am concerned. Each and every one has operated and invested their money based on known property law . You cannot have a section of property law that is only to be determined in the courts. The Leader of the Opposition, during his speech, made a lot of remarks which I wrote down. Very early in his claim he talked about the original legislation and criticised the opposition, the coalition, for its opposition the legislation. It is a pity he did not go back to those Senate debates and read them word for word, because most of the issues that he would now concede need alteration, need amendment, were raised during those debates. The then opposition was accused at the time of filibustering, et cetera. But anybody who suggested that as an administrative tool the present Native Title Act is workable would be a fool. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Native Title Act as 'decent, workable legislation'. If it is decent, workable tion why do we have massive multiple claims on a single piece of land, sometimes by up to 23 different Aboriginal groups-Aboriginals fighting with Aboriginals? How workable is that? The solution is in these amendments, which propose that there can be one only claimant. That is, apparently, unreasonable. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned that the requirement for registration just happens to provide that one of that claimant group must demonstrate some traditional physical association. It is impossible in a court of law to determine somebody's 'dreaming'-somebody living in Melbourne who suddenly goes before a court and who, as the original legislation prescribed, is not necessarily subject to cross-examination. It is impossible for a determination of the court to be made concerning someone who has lived all their life in Melbourne and who says they have some form of association with a billabong in the Kimberleys of Western Australia. Clearly, there is a need and there should be a demonstration. It is a simple requirement and it should not be criticised. If the original legislation was so good, why is it that Access Economics can tell us that its processes have delayed $11.6 billion worth of mining projects? Mines tend to be seen as the property of some very wealthy person when, in fact, they provide job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Australians. But it is worse than that. Over time most of these delays may have been overcome but, for instance, in the gold industry as a result of then those delays many projects will now not to proceed. They will not proceed because of the fall in the price of gold, but they could have been up and running and battling with the price of gold, giving jobs to people whom the opposition claims as its constituency. But it did not happen. If we want evidence of how bad the act is we should look no further than ATSIC commissioner Robinson's reference to ambit claims and the remarks of one time Leader of the Opposition and ex-Governor General, Mr Hayden, after his experience in attempting to mediate the Century dispute, where he made legislait absolutely clear that the previous government's legislation made it possible for people with absolutely no links with the land, no rights to native land title, to be involved in a process of delaying a $1 billion development project highly essential to the welfare and the jobs of many Australians and to the development of this country. That is how the present legislation works. It is the intention of the government to make simple amendments to ensure that those sorts of processes cannot continue. It is wrong to criticise that or to consider it a diminution of native title rights. The Leader of the Opposition talked about there being no veto in the present Native Title Act and that is correct. But the reality is that one of the greatest vetoes one can have-well understood by the trade union movement-is the right to negotiate if you never intend to say 'yes'. Whatever the offer made on the other side, you can extend your demands. But when the legislation of the day is so deficient that you can achieve this right to negotiate, a right not granted in any of the High Court decisions, by the simple act of lodging a claim with a registrar whose powers to reject, as granted in the original Native Title Act, were knocked out by the High Court literally within months of their introduction because they were deficient-it gave powers to a tribunal that it was not entitled to have under the law-we find that we have thousands of claims totally unsubstantiated. In public discussion I make the point that the right to negotiate as it has stood is best equated with a group of people attending an auction for numerous lots of residential property where the law provides that they must each negotiate with each other as to the type of house they build before they lodge a bid. You can imagine how stupid any politician who promoted such an arrangement would be perceived as being. Yet the current right to negotiate under the present Native Title Act is exactly that. The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that the opposition will go to the wall to protect this right to negotiate as it exists today. He went as far as to suggest that it was part of the common law right of Aboriginal people when it is not. It is a statutory right created in the original legislation which we intend to amend. The Leader of the Opposition spent a lot of time suggesting that this 'dreadful 1O-point plan'-which it is not-was devised by the backbench. It was devised by our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in negotiation with all the parties. I agree entirely with his view that it has swung the pendulum back to the middle ground; . Property rights are one of the most important things that anybody can have. The High Court in its reference to exclusive possession made it clear what sorts of titles it believed extinguished native title. But the previous government did not have the sense to try to put them intoÂ· some form of list so that each and everyone of them would not be disputed in the courts on whatever grounds you like. Please remember that there are disputes over freehold land. One was settled by the Labor government of New South Wales at Crescent Head-the very backyards of residential freehold property owners were at risk on some technicality which, fortunately for them, the government settled. If they had had to settle it themselves it would have been at 1.5 times the value they paid for the land in the first place. These are the deficiencies of this act which we set out to rectify. What do the 10 points do? For a start they validate past acts that were enacted by the previous government up to a previous date. But they do not remove the native title rights to compensation of Australian Aboriginals even in that process. This government in both past and future acts has offered and will offer to assist the state governments by paying 75 per cent of that compensation to ensure that if and when that compensation is needed there are sufficient funds to pay the Aboriginal people. That is what we have done. Resumption rights were included in the original Keating legislation. There were just no resources made available to fund it and we ended up with a silly situation all round. It is a fundamental principle of property ownership in Australia that the Crown can resume your rights whether they are freehold, leasehold or you name it. While there is an obligation on the Commonwealth to pay compensation, there is no statutory obligation on most states to pay compensation-but they do. At every stage of our deliberations as a backbench committee we understood and endorsed the principle that, where over time there is a diminution of the native title rights of Aboriginal people, they will be treated on just terms. The purpose of excluding the right to negotiate over towns, cities and major public works is plainly obvious and right. Aboriginal people in this country are not excluded from driving on our freeways or attending our major public parks. Neither is any other ethnic race. It is public property and, of course, such public property should be enjoyed by all Australians in whatever way. That should obviously not be the subject of the control or the right to negotiate by a single ethnic group. So what is wrong with putting those sorts of things in? The Leader of the Opposition tells us that they will oppose the use of the tax act to describe the rights of pastoralists in terms of the words used by the High Court in this regard. That is not recognition of reality. The purpose and the business of pastoral activity as frequently described in those old leases is no longer sufficient for the residents of those leases to earn a living. They have to widen their activities. Furthermore, technology today has made it possible for them to enter into aspects of agriculture, as described under the tax act, that they would not have dreamed of in years gone by. Why, when the High Court makes a fairly generai principle, is it wrong for the parliament of Australia to apply their knowledge of this industry to better describe what it is? There is nothing wrong with that and for the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that that definition was too broad is outrageous. I hope some of you are going to go out to those people battling on that land and tell them that you will not even stand behind them at that particular level of protection. These are the issues. There was so much in the Leader of the Opposition's speech which was both foolish and wrong that I have had little time to address all the issues in the 10point plan. They are sensible moves. I repeat, in closing, they do not diminish in any way the native title rights of Aboriginal Australians as granted in the Mabo and Wik decisions. They are administrative arrangements for that purpose and, as such, they should be supported by this House. But you as an opposition have a choice: you can go to a referendum or a double dissolution. (Time expired)",18
6,Mr GARETH EVANS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) native title rights, including on pastoral leases, are fundamental legal property rights, acknowledged and upheld as such by the High Court, and entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-Indigenous Australians: any amendment of the Native Title Act in response to the Wik decision or for any other reason must fully reflect that reality; (2) it is in the national interest that the Act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both Indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders-farmers, miners and Australian taxpayers generally; (3) it is both in the national interest, and in the interests of Indigenous Australians, farmers and miners, that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the Act and its practical operation; (4) there is a need, in particular, to guarantee the constitutional validity of the legislation, by ensuring that legislation operates for the net benefit of Indigenous Australians; (5) it is also in everyone's interest that the processes established by this legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims, and the reconciliation of competing interests, be as effective and expeditious as possible; (6) there are aspects of the Bill which may advance these objectives, in particular by encouraging and assisting the entering into of agreements, and by setting a stricter regime for the registration of claims; (7) nonetheless, the Bill is seriously deficient, and requires substantial amendment, in many respects, including: (i) the reach of the validation provisions beyond that which is necessary for the practical redress of post-Wik problems; (ii) the manifestly unacceptable over-reach of the provisions purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title where exclusive tenure has previously been involved; (iii) the unnecessarily broad application, in relation to coexistence on pastoral leases, of the statutory authorisation of nonpastoral activities; (iv) the unnecessarily broad application of extinguishment in relation to the provision of government services and public works; (v) the indefensibly limited test for allowing statutory access rights for registered claimants; (vi) the dramatic limitation of the right to negotiate, and in particular its effective elimination in relation to mining on pastoral leases, which (along with the provisions amounting to direct or de facto extinguishment) significantly tilts the balance of the legislation against Indigentell ous Australians; (vii) the unacceptable limitation on the effective enjoyment of the right to negotiate which is involved in powersÂ· of early ministerial intervention; (viii) the absurd and counterproductive sunset clause, which will simply ensure a proliferation of ambit claims under the Act, and the pursuit of future claims through expensive and complex common law processes; (ix) the inappropriately rigid and legalistic constraints on Registrars in the management of claims; and (x) the inappropriate introduction of formal rules of evidence, and limitations on the extent to which cultural and customary concerns can be taken into account, in the Federal Court claims process"". About three weeks ago there was played out on television one of the ugliest little scenes it has been my misfortune, and that of many others, to witness for a long time in this country. It involved the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard) holding up to a national audience a map, 78 per cent of which was marked and coloured brown and was a map in respect of which, as the Prime Minister said, 'the Aboriginal people ... have the potential right of veto over the development of 78 per cent of the land mass of Australia. Now, that is a very simple message. I think the Australian people will understand that message.' It was a performance worthy of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) at his crudest; and how revealing it is of the government's attitude that the member for O'Connor should be the lead speaker for the government in this debate. What this House and what the Australian people need to understand about that little performance from the Prime Minister and about the Prime Minister's message is that it was wrong in fact and in law, as even the member for O'Connor acknowledged. It was malicious in 'its intent, it was alarmist in its effect and it was thoroughly immoral in its substance. The Prime Minister diminishes himself and this country every time he goes down this path. If he maintains this totally uncompromising and cynically opportunist attitude towards this legislation, then let me him and let me tell the coalition that they have a fight on their hands in this parliament. I hope the Prime Minister does not in fact go down that path. I hope that we can have a serious and constructive debate in this parliament to get this legislation right. It is in the national interest, as we say in clause (2) of this amendment that I have just circulated, that the act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders-the farmers, the miners and the Australian taxpayers generally. It is, as we say in clause (3) of the amendment, both in the national interest and in the interests of indigenous Australians and farmers and miners that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the Native Title Act and its practical operation. It is in everyone's interest, as we say in clause (5) of this amendment, that the processes established by this legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims, and the reconciliation of competing interests, be as effective and expeditious as possible. There are, it has to be said, a lot of problems with this bill-a bill of nearly 300 pages, with its explanatory memorandum of nearly 400 pages, which is an unprecedented length for a piece of social policy legislation in this country. There are two underlying problems in particular which shriek out at one as we approach this debate. The first of those underlying problems really does go to the attitude of the government to the fundamental, central issue at stake here. The trouble is that the government still does not really see, nor does it want to acknowledge, that native title is a fundamental legal property right, acknowledged and upheld as such by the High Court and entitled to exactly the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-indigenous Australians. There is an attitude problem there. The government sees native title rights as an encumbrance, as an intrusion, as something that is indefensibly intrusive against the rights of other non-indigenous Australians. They have to understand and respect the reality that the native title rights are full-scale, identified, High Court upheld property rights. It is the responsibility of us, as legislators, to get right the balance between those property rights and claims of right and the legitimate property rights of other non-indigenous Australians. That is a point that we make right at the outset in clause (1) of this amending motion. The second underlying problem that runs right through the construction of this amending bill is that, as my leader said just a few moments ago, it simply will not deliver the certainty and the predictability that it is in everybody's interest and in the national interest for this legislation to deliver. To the extent that this bill does not get right the balance of benefits to indigenous Australians and to the extent that, at the end of the day, it does not produce a situation where one can look at the outcome and say, 'This is for the benefit of indigenous Australians,' then to that extent this bill is constitutionally suspect. It will be challenged and there is every probability that it will be struck down and, in the process, every last ounce of that certainty and predictability that everybody wants, including the miners and the farmers, is simply going to disappear. The argument is very straightforward. The constitutional foundations for this bill have to be either section 51(xxvi)-the race power in the constitution-or they have to be built indirectly on the external affairs power in section 51(xxix) by virtue of Australia's adherence to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Under the race power, it is very strongly arguable indeed-it is likely to be upheld quite soon in the High Court-that that race power can only be exercised for the benefit of indigenous people. If you are going to apply the external affairs power, support for justification for this legislation, it has to be applied in a way that does not discriminate against a racial group of Australians or, to the extent that it does discriminate in their favour, it is properly characterisable as a special measure. There is no sign that the government, in the crafting of this amending legislation, even begins to understand and accept that fundamental basic legal reality. We are not talking about policy issues here; we are talking about simple, straightforward legal reality. If we do not get it right, if this bill does proceed with its 'bucket loads of extinguishment' - as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) keeps on putting it-if it does proceed with the removal of the right to negotiate and if it does proceed with a whole set of procedural changes which work against the interests of indigenous people, the balance will tilt so comprehensively agai'nst the interests of indigenous people that this bill, and the act itself, simply will not survive constitutional scrutiny. The pendulum that the Prime Minister likes to talk about is crashing against the nonindigenous side of the clock case at the moment. Unless that pendulum comes back into the middle-in fact, unless it tilts at the end of the day very slightly at least towards the indigenous interests-this bill, this act, is going to be challengeable andÂ· we are going to be forced back to the endless complexity and expense of case by case common law litigation. I do hope that those people who are so stridently opposed to this or that aspect of claims being made about what is necessary for decency and justice in this final outcome at least focus their minds and concentrate on these legal realities. If you want certainty and predictability, you have to change the basic balance of this amending legislation. They are the underlying problems. What about the specific problems? There is a legion of them. There is no time to do more than very quickly sketch out the major ones. The second reading amendment before this chamber does that in a way which highlights some of the major issues we will be concerned with. At the outset, there is the problem of: (i) the reach of the validation provisions beyond that which is necessary for the practical redress of postWik problems ... There are some problems that were created in the aftermath of the Wik legislation. We, on the opposition side, are fully prepared to cooperate in their redress, but there is some overreach involved here when one gets to the detail. Just to give one example, it appears that public works with quite a small impact on native title-for example, the construction of a set of electricity pylons going across a pastoral lease-will, nonetheless, have the result of achieving the permanent extinguishment over the whole area of the lease of any claim to native title that might exist. That is the kind of problem we have with the validation provisions. Secondly, as the motion says, there is: (ii) the manifestly unacceptable over-reach of the provisions purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title where exclusive tenure has previously been involved. When this proposition appeared in the list of 10 points, it seemed, frankly, to be one of the more innocuous provisions. It seemed to be merely declaratory of what everyone acknowledges to be the legal reality-that where exclusive possession has been granted as a result of some legal conferral of interest in the past that means the end of native title, and if all you are doing in the legislation is confirming that legal reality nobody can seriously argue about it. But what we have in this amending package before us is manifestly indefensible and unacceptable overreach. We have all sorts of things now being rubbed out as a consequence of the reach of this particular set of provisions and, in particular, schedule 4. Schedule 4 of the bill, which has only just been circulated, is a 40-page dog's breakfast in which page after page of statutory provisions-with no guidance as to the criteria which lie behind their identification-are set out. Each one of them will result, if aparticular legal property interest is covered by them, in the absolute extinguishment of any claim to native title that might otherwise have continued to exist in relation to that. The provisions as they stand at the moment result, among other things, in the absolute extinguishment of native title claims or rights over stock routes. They result in the impossibility of even now claiming native title over such areas as Yampi Sound in Western Australia, because at some stage in the past that has been the subject of a transfer of land from the state of Western Australia to the Commonwealth for defence purposes: there is a great tract of land there which is used about three weeks a year for defence exercises. But, by virtue of the way these provisions are constructed, there will be a draconian absolute extinguishment of native title claims. It goes too far. That is part of the imbalance. It is part of the bucket loads of extinguishment accomplished by this legislation, which is simply indefensible. A third problem with the legislation is the coexistence regime that is mapped so far as pastoralists and native title interest holders are concerned. Part 7(iii) of the amendment refers to: the unnecessarily broad application, in relation to coexistence on pastoral leases, of the statutory authorisation of non-pastoral activities. Let us get it clear that it is perfectly reasonable so far as the opposition is concerned that the reasonable expectations of farmers be satisfied by this legislation. Farmers and pastoralists should be able to conduct on their pastoral leases the entire range of pastoral related activities that they have always been able to do, thought they could do and should be able to do without let or hindrance of any kind. That includes fencing and stock roads within the area of the lease. It can certainly include dams for the creation of some irrigation for pasture crops and so on. All of that is possible and it should be clarified. That is fine; there is no argument about that. When, however, the pastoralist wants to engage in a different kind of upgraded agricultural activity which goes beyond that which has been traditionally permissible as part of a pastoral lease, then, we say, it is perfectly reasonable that the pastoralist be entitled to do so, provided it is done on a case by case basis in the way that it always has been done in the past, where you apply to the state or territory for a licence or permit to in the intensive cotton crop or grape block or whatever it is and the state or territory makes the decision to allow you to do it on proper environmental or agricultural policy or landuse planning grounds. You go ahead and do it and if the consequence of that is to suppress, for the duration of the exercise of that right, some inconsistent native title, so be it. We will accept that as part of the necessary balance that is involved. But the way this legislation is crafted at moment, it reaches way beyond that. At a matic stroke of the legislative pen, any form of nonin pastoral, agricultural or related use, including farm stays and so on for tourist purposes, permitted and there is a chance of the balance here getting completely out of kilter. There is particularly a chance of a quite massive intruthe sion on otherwise legitimate native title claims if you contemplate the possible appliAustralians. cation of these provisions as they now stand-for example, to the Fitzroy River area of Western Australia, where a major dam and irrigation project on the scale of the Ord fact being contemplated. It is very easy to see how the applications of these provisions could wipe out, over a very large region of Australright is, legitimate native title claims. The provisions about government services are, on their face, legitimate so far as they but they have an unnecessarily broad applicacrown tion. If there is an inconsistency with a grant of an interest to enable a public work or whatever to be carried out on part of the lease in question, then what happens is that, under the act as it is framed at the moment, there permanent extinguishment over the whole of that area in question rather than just that of it which is necessary to accomplish the legitimate public purpose. Point (7)(v) of our draft says that there is an indefensibly limited test for allowing statutory access rights for people who have registered claimant status and who want to get access land during the time-perhaps a quite extendthe ed period-that that claim is being formally determined. They can do it under this legislaof tion only if they have maintained right until the end of last year some regular physical access to the land. But what about the put position, just to take one example, of those people who were forced off pastoral leases in living memory as a result of the pastoral awards in the 1960s and have been in fact locked out? Should they be denied the statutory access right? We say not, and we say that this is the sort of issue on which the government should be prepared to make a ready compromise in the interests of basic decency. Then we get to point (7)(vi) and it really is the quite central to this debate, that is, the dralimitation of the right to negotiate and, particular, the effective elimination of that right in relation to mining on pastoral leases. is Along with the provisions I have already mentioned, which amount to direct or potentially indirect de facto extinguishment, this is stuff that really does significantly tilt the balance of this legislation against indigenous In relation to the right to negotiate, let me say that that mayor not be a matter of common law entitlement. That is for the courts to is in determine. I do not make a judgment about that. What I do say is that there are two very obvious reasons for the legitimacy of that to negotiate being retained in our legislative package and made available on a continuing basis to people in relation to go, pastoral leases just as much as on vacant land. The first is that it amounts to a legitimate form of economic empowerment of a group of Australians who have been spectacularly denied respect and a capacity to advance themselves economically through just is about the whole 200-plus years of Australian history. It is a legitimate redressing of a part historical injustice and we ought to be prepared to contemplate it on that basis alone.",21
7,Mr TUCKEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"That's silly. Mr GARETH EV ANS-The second reason we ought to be able to contemplate it, member for O'Connor, is a much more hardto headed reason. That is, if you do not allow retention of that right to negotiate, you tilt out of balance the whole shape and structure this legislation and make it unequivocally up legislation for non-indigenous interests, legislation which does not protect and respect and advance the interests of indigenous people. If you want certainty and if you want predictability, and if the other interests that have got genuine stakeholder concerns herethe miners and the farmers-want that predictability and certainty, they will go along with just that retention. There are other provisions which will also require attention. There is the unacceptable limitation on the right to negotiate, to the extent that it does continue to exist, involved in the provisions now for a very early power of ministerial intervention to act in the so called national interest to ensure that some particular economic project does in fact take off and is not inhibited by the operation of native title. We were prepared to concede the legitimacy of such a ministerial intervention and override right back in the original legislation-Mabo 1993. It was properly balanced in that context. The balance is now out of kilter by virtue of the early stage at which that intervention is now possible, which will, we believe, make practically impossible for all practical purposes the legitimate exercise of what remains of the right to negotiate. Then there is point (7)(viii): ... the absurd and counterproductive sunset clause, which will simply ensure a proliferation of ambit claims under the Act, and the pursuit of future claims through expensive and complex common law processes. The government has not been able to apply a sunset clause so far as common law claims are concerned because to do so would raise immediately the prospect of constitutionally required compensation. It is proposing to do it simply for the statutory process. It is absurd and counterproductive to do so-and you know it-but it is an example of the pigheadedness of the government so far that we have not had a concession of that. Finally, there are a number of provisions which go to the processes and procedures under the act which are proposed to be changed in ways again that are colourable in terms of their impact on the final assessment of the constitutionality of this legislationtalking about the inappropriately rigid and legalistic constraints on registrars in the management of claims and the inappropriate introduction of formal rules of evidence, to the extent that they are now required to be applied, and the limitations, as a corollary to that, on the extent to which cultural and customary concerns can now be taken into account. Not everything in this act is colourable in the same way as the sorts of provisions I have been identifying thus far. The stricter threshold test which is part of the proposed new regime is in everyone's interests, including that of indigenous Australians, to apply. We will need to have a closer look at the detail of the language in which that is couched, but the principle of having a stricter regime does make sense. It is something we would have done had we still been in government. The provisions facilitating a role for representative bodies makes sense. They can be a terribly important way of ensuring that claims are rationalised in the way they come forward and that there is a sensible negotiating/bargaining process. They are critical to the success in practice of this legislation. We are pleased to see that role recognised in the way the legislation has come forward. We are pleased to see that the legislation ensures that legal aid will be available for a whole variety of respondents; nobody could argue with that. We are especially pleased to see in the amending bill the provisions encouraging and assisting the entering into of agreements outside the formal framework of the act but able to be now recognised and enforced as a consequence of their recognition in the act. That is the best way to go in terms of reconciling these interests either on a site specific or on a regional basis. We have seen in Cape York, we have seen in Yandacoogina in Western Australia, we have seen in the Murrin Murrin agreement, we have seen in half a dozen others of recent times, that it is possible, even with the present shape of the legislation, to get decent, coherent discussion, agreement and outcomes that are in the interests of all the stakeholders and are in the national interests. Let me say just in conclusion that the opposition, as the leader said earlier on, approaches this whole debate in a constructive and a conciliatory spirit. We acknowledge that the act that we passed in 1993 needed some remedial attention. We had no help at all in 1993. And I remember this better than anyone else in this country, because I was up there in that Senate chamber for days on end trying to get some ration-l input int- - he deb-te from the coalition sIde of polItlcs WhICh was spectacularly unforthcoming, and it is the case that a number of the problems in the current legislation are directly attributable to that headed, dogged, dogmatic, bloody-mindedness that we had from the coalition on that occasion. It is the case that the Wik decision does require some rethinking of som- provision- of the legislation and to get a coexIstence regIme properly applicable. We in the Labor Party and the opposition do want to protect and advance the interests of indigenous Australians-as we always have-for which we make no apology whatsoever. But we also want to recognise and protect and advance the legitimate interests of all those other Australians and Australian businesses who do have an interest in the outcome of this legislation. It is in the national interest that we get these balances right. We will work in the opposition as hard as we possibly can, whatever the formidable character of the odds against us, in this chamber and in the Senate to get this legislation right. We simply ask that this government, and in particular its Prime Minister, approach this debate, this legislation, in the same spirit. If the Prime Minister wants to re-establish some credibility for his presently shabby and tattered leadership of this country, if he wants to re-establish some credibility by behaving not like a crude and ugly populist but something resembling a statesman, then he will have, Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you and I assure this House, the full support and the full cooperation of the opposition in doing so.",25

9,Mr MELHAM,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,27
10,Mr RICHARD EVANS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I guess it is probably fair to say that I am fairly disturbed about the debate about native title within the community. Throughout our lives there comes a time when the very essence of one's value system is tested and the strength of character to live by the truth is required-and, for me, this is the time. Before us is the Native Title Amendment Bill which has been developed by the coalition' I think in a caring and compassionate way and in a sense of doing what is right for all Australians and, as the Deputy Leader of pig- the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has j-st said, in the national interest. I support the bIIl because it addresses the issues which are contributing to I think the death by a thousand cuts attitude of the broader Australian community towards indigenous affairs. In my view, this bill is very, very important. It is probably the most important bill this House has addressed for a long time. It is a bill which will provide certainty to all stakeholders. It is a bill which will go a long way to solving the issue of the current confusion associated with land title management within Australia-and we must remember that this is a land title bill. The eyes of the nation are upon us, and it is vitaIly important that we provide justice to all stakeholders in the national interest. For too long, there has been too much rhetoric and not enough action in relation to Aboriginal affairs. For too long, outcomes that the community wills us to deliver have not been achieved. For too long, we have not treated Aboriginal people with the respect they soÂ· richly deserve. For too long, their culture has been treated with disdain, their future has been disregarded and the need for them to be linked spirituaIly and culturally to their land has been misunderstood and ignored. For too long, there has been too much politics in Aboriginal affairs. The Labor Party positions itself as the great advocate of indigenous rights when the facts belie this particular notion. In the last parliament the Labor Party stood, they said, for indigenous people. They. said they w-re working for their weIlbemg. Yet nothmg could be further from the truth. They promised a social justice package associated with this bill which came out in 1993, yet they failed and did not deliver. They took Aboriginal health away from the people who could best deliver it, the Aboriginal people. They created distrust and belittled Aboriginal people over the Hindmarsh Island affair. The Labor Party failed to respond, let alone act, on two significant reports tabled in the last parliament: one called Equity and access, which took them two years to respond to, and the other one called Justice under scrutiny, which just prior to the last election they took 12 months to respond to. They have also failed to respond to other reports. The Labor Party really has no credibility on Aboriginal issues other than giving a false hope to the Aboriginal people. The Labor Party promised land rights, yet did not deliver. The Labor Party promised and never delivered on many indigenous issues. The broader community must now wonder how the mess we now have was allowed to happen. In my view, reconciliation has a long way to go, mainly because the Labor Party promised so much and delivered nothing. Labor allowed Aboriginal affairs to become politicised. Under Labor a wedge of distrust was driven between the black and white communities of our nation. Under Labor, the 'goodwill of the many has turned sour and, in my opinion, the relationships between black and white in our country are at their lowest since I can remember. Under Labor, bigotry and hatred towards our noble indigenous people have been allowed to prosper. There is no greater example of this than the election of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in a strong Labor seat based on anti-Aboriginal sentiment whipped up amongst traditional Labor voters who are conservative Australians, because the Labor Party politicised indigenous affairs. Under Labor inaction, infant mortality in the indigenous population tragically was allowed to be two to three times that of nonAboriginal children. Under Labor, the life expectancy of Aboriginal males is 16 to 18 years less than non-Aboriginal males in Australia. It is not the Labor Party's fault, it has been allowed to happen and continue. The prevalence of diabetes is four times greater than that for non-Aboriginal Australians. Two out of five Aboriginal males can expect to live beyond their 65th birthday compared to three out of four non-Aboriginal Australians. Preventable diseases account for much of the Aboriginal health problems and Aboriginal premature death. These are just some of the sad, sorry stories. When one adds poor literacy standards, poor education, the unacceptably high incarceration rates, the unacceptably high unemployment rates and unacceptable housing and other services, one must ask the question: why is this happening in our country? Why is this allowed to happen? It is no wonder the indigenous leaders of our country are seeking some sort of economic independence. They have left themselves in the care of the many governments and administrations of over the last 200 years, and collectively we have let them down. Who can blame them for wanting their own economic independence when we cannot address the basic priority issues? We have let them down to the extent where some in the community are now blaming them for the position they find themselves in. It is not the Aboriginal community's fault for poor health, poor' education, incarceration, poor housing and dispossession. Collectively it is for every Australian to take responsibility to acknowledge past poor performance and to provide a future for Aboriginal people based upon respect, inclusiveness and bipartisan policy implementation. We owe it to past generations from both communities to right the wrongs and progress towards a future in which the indigenous peoples can rightly participate. But I am afraid we are a long way from achieving this grand plan. We chose a path some years ago, and it was a path of land management. In my view, it was the wrong path. Our former Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, spoke with a forked tongue when he falsely promised a future which he could never deliver. Now we have a tense environment within the community of negotiation but which will split the broader community if a little goodwill is not provided by all partiesa split in the community which will not impact directly upon the broader community but may impact more greatly upon the indigenous community, and it probably is going to be worse than anything in the last 200 years. I ask why. In my view, it is because the Labor Party chose, and still chooses, to play politics with Aboriginal affairs. In 1993, when speaking on native title, I warned of a backlash. I warned that if a poorly constructed Native Title Act were enacted there would be a serious backlash towards our indigenous peoples. Who among us now would dispute that the mood in the community is finely balanced and slowly swinging against Aboriginal people? The question then is: why has this been allowed to happen? Why has community animosity been allowed to grow towards indigenous people? We could point our fingers at the poor administration of the previous Labor government, which politicised Aboriginal affairs, and we may very well be correct in that assessment. We could point our fingers squarely at ATSIC and their failure to produce the key priority issues of indigenous people, and we may very well be correct. Yet, if one analyses the native title debate and cuts through the rhetoric, we come to some of the problems. We have two sides going in the opposite direction and pulling against each other. How could so many good-thinking Australians get it wrong? I think the answer lies within the history of the original negotiations and the expectations which were given falsely to Aboriginal people. They were promised land rights and they got nothing. This is why we need to amend the original bill and provide certainty but, at the same time, recognise native title and how it can exist and coexist within Australian land management. Those who believe that native title is superior to Australian land law have not considered the issue in any great depth and have been caught up just in the emotion of politics rather than in seeking solutions. Just four years ago, speaker after speaker in the then Labor government rose to support the native title legislation, extolling its virtues and how it will mean a new beginning for Aboriginal people. I doubt whether anyone believes that rhetoric now. The fact is that the native title legislation of 1993 is not working. I will quickly give you a couple of examples. Yakabindie is a nickel mining development in Western Australia. Last year it had four claims on it from four different Aboriginal groups. This year it has five claims. If Yakabindie's principals are able to negotiate with each of those five claims and strike an agreement, it will not be a problem. If they do it today, it will not be a problem; they will be able to proceed. Tomorrow another claim could be put on them, and the whole process would start again. This is uncertainty, and it is uncertain for Aboriginal people as much as it is for other mining developments. Another example is Whim Creek, which is another nickel mine. They need to have gas running through to their project. It is 1Yz kilometres away. They want to run a pipe about an inch in diameter under dirt for 1Y2 kilometres. They have asked for an appeasement some 20 metres wide for 1Y2 kilometres. They advertised for the prescribed period. A week prior to the prescribed period finishing, they had a claim put on them from Aboriginal groups 250 kilometres away. The deal was this: pay us a million bucks and we will give you the right to go ahead to put a pipewhich passed all heritage laws-underground. There is uncertainty here, and it needs amending. This Native Title Act provided no certainty and no rights for Aboriginal people in 1993. It would be easy for me to argue what was wrong with the 1993 act, but we should refer to who drafted it. The Attorney-General at the time, Michael Lavarch, was drafting amendments prior to leaving the last parliament. He recently said that Labor may back the amendments before us. Surely this, by implication, means that we need amendments. The shadow minister for resources and energy, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), is in the chamber at the moment. What does he have to say? In a recent edition of Australian Gas Journal he is quoted as saying: The opposition will work in the national interest to seek an acceptable outcome to native title. Kim Beazley has made that clear both publicly and privately. Even prior to the Wik case, the act was not perfect and the procedures and processes need to be improved to make the act more workable. We need a better, more workable process which will provide certainty and validity and which is fair to all. In the words of the opposition leader group, which he is now a part of, we have an admissionÂ· that the current act does not work, and we need certainty. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition on Lateline on 27 August said: Frankly I think it's in everybody's interest that the threshold test be tougher. Again, he is suggesting, by implication, that it needs amendment. On page 328 of a book called Victory, the former Prime Minister is quoted on this subject. The passage reads as follows: To Court's surprise, Keating had confided that he believed he had received poor advice from his own people, that elements of the legislation were not working smoothly and that the act needed amendments to make it more workable. I think we all agree with that. The passage went on to report: But he told Court it was too dangerous to reopen controversial areas such as pastoral leases and negotiation rights, because the legislation would then have to go back to the Senate where it risked further amendments from the Greens and the Democrats. The architects of the Native Title Act 1993 have admitted it was flawed and required reform, particularly-by implication-the controversial pastoral leases aspect and the right to negotiate. So the party that promised everything to the Aboriginal peoples back in 1993 has said clearly, 'The act is not working and needs reform.' With its reform, the coalition has tried to meet four major criteria which have not been recognised by those opposite. The first is to maintain respect for native title, the second is to reduce uncertainty, the third is to improve workability and the fourth is to find a balance among interested parties. Those have been our criteria. It is not just the government asking for these reforms. The list is long and includes farmers and miners. It also includes the former Prime Minister. It now includes the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). It also includes the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for resources and energy. The list also includes those dispossessed Aboriginal people who do not in fact benefit from the current act. So the question then becomes: why is there conflict within our community? Why do we have full-page advertisements saying, 'Let's get it right.' For instance, Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council said on Lateline on 27 August that native title was more than any other title. In respect of being denied access to land, Mr Yu said: What that means is people can't fulfil those cultural imperatives, those cultural obligations to pass on the knowledge to our young children, to our kids, so that they are able to sustain that distinct and peculiar definition of native title which makes us distinct from the rest of the country. What I think Mr Yu is saying is, 'Why can't indigenous people have access to traditional lands? Why can't Aboriginal people have access to land to fulfil their culture?' Mr Yu is expressing exactly the same sentiments as the Australians listed in this advertisement here. The news is good, because this Native Title Amendment Bill allows this to happen. This bill allows statutory rights-which are greater than common law rights-to gain access to traditional lands for the fulfilment of their cultural imperatives and objectives. This right is within the legislation we have before us today. So the worries of Mr Yu and those Australians in this advertisement have been met on this issue. And what is the other issue? It has taken a long time to come out in this debate, but the other issue at the foundation of the opposition to this lO-point plan is the right to negotiate. In my view, it is the money. The sticking point is the money. I really do not want it to be the money. But, in January, Mr Noel Pearson, when responding to Paul Lyneham, who asked, 'What do you want?' said, 'Substantial justice.' What does that mean? Political cynicism says that 'substantial justice' means 'money.' In the West Australian on 11 September with regard to Minister Herron, ATSIC spokesman Geoff Clark was quoted as saying: Herron made positive noises about his commitment to Aborigines but failed to acknowledge the link between land rights and economic independence. Again, that means money. The ATSIC chairman, Gatjil Djerrkura, was quoted in the same article as saying: Any reversal of native title rights won through legal processes will have a huge negative impact on indigenous economic development. So it may in fact be the money. Is it the money? How, from native title, will the peoples of Cullacubardee in my electorate gain economic independence? How will the peoples of Ninga Mire out at Kalgoorlie gain economic independence out of native title? How will the dispossessed peoples of Sydney and Melbourne gain economic independence from native title? The fact is that they will not. And, under the current arrangements, they cannot. Therefore, other than for local Aboriginal communities who are directly affected, economic independence will be provided to just a few. What a cruel hoax to suggest that all Aboriginal peoples of this land will gain economic independence on native title when they cannot-only a few can. Native title is not the panacea for land rights as indigenous leaders see it; native title is nothing more than land title management. The negotiation provisions have been improved, as suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the government is assuring just compensation if those rights are taken away. There is much to do in Aboriginal affairs; there is much to recognise; and there is much to accept and acknowledge. We cannot falter in our desire to gain equity and particularly access for our indigenous peoples. The indigenous peoples are an important part of Australia's future, and the community should embrace their culture without fear and without suspicion. These emotional barriers are amongst us now within the broader community and our first steps towards reconciliation should be the goal of breaking down these barriers. This bill provides the first steps to bringing some balance back to the reconciliation debate. If we are truly keen to provide an inclusive future to our indigenous people, then this bill provides the first step. If we truly want to provide certainty to land management in Australia, if we truly want to move forward, then this bill is the first step-the first step, not the end. I commend this bill to the House.",27
11,Mr MELHAM,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"This current debate about native title will undoubtedly be seen in future years as another important and defining moment in our history and in the development of our national character. This parliament has a unique opportunity to restore some honour to this nation's reputation as an inclusive society and one where the rights and interests of all its citizens are given due weight and recognition. As a nation, we should have pride in our diversity and acknowledge the central place that indigenous Australians have in the formation of our identity. As a nation, we have come late to the recognition that indigenous Australians ,have rights which predate the arrival of the British colonisers.It is only recently that we have afforded indigenous Australians any recognition of these rights within our statute law. After all, up until the High Court's decision in Mabo No.2 in 1993, there were those who maintained their advocacy of the absurd and obnoxious notion of terra nullius. Following the Mabo decision, the Labor government, responding to the clamour of concern that resonated within some sections of the Australian community, sought to give legislative effect to the High Court's decision through the development and passage of the Native Title Act 1993. In passing this historic legislation, the government and the parliament did so in the face of concerted, noisy and sometimes mischievous opposition from vested interests, with the support of some state and territory governments. I well recall the bitter and nasty nature of this opposition, led by members of the then opposition who now hold high office in this government. But I also recall the leadership shown by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who, despite the difficulty in attracting the support of these vested interests and against the backdrop of the divisive rhetoric of others, had the dignity, wisdom, foresight and courage to persevere with the legislation and a package of other proposals designed to address the native title rights of indigenous Australians. The government's legislative response to Mabo included the creation of an indigenous land fund, the establishment of the Indigenous Land Corporation and a social justice package designed to address the fundamental elements of the social and economic disadvantage experienced by indigenous Australians. This outcome was always a compromise, the success of which rested on the preparedness of the government to sit down and negotiate with indigenous Australians over these matters. These negotiations required not only goodwill but also trust-trust in the fact that, once agreed to, the government and the parliament, representing the people of Australia, would be true to its word-but, from the minute this government came to power, it has walked away from that agreement that was given on behalf of the nation to indigenous Australians. Their success significantly also required sacrifice and agreement by the indigenous negotiators to compromise on key issues so that the demands and interests of non-indigenous Australians could be accommodated. It was by no means a perfect exercise, and the outcome for indigenous Australians was, from their point of view, far from perfect. They were prepared to allow the validation of certain past acts which could otherwise have been declared as invalid because of the existence of native title. The agreement to the validation of these acts was arrived at on the basis that the total package being negotiated with the government and the parliament would be implemented, even though agreement to validate meant that native title associafter ated with the acts validated would be extinguished. But it was by agreement. This was a big ask and an enormous sacrifice on behalf of indigenous Australians. I repeat: this was done by agreement and consent. The fact that indigenous Australians were prepared to contemplate this arrangement came as the result of their willingness to sit at the table with the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and accept the bona fides of the government to deliver on any agreement reached. They were party to and central players in a fair dinkum negotiation with the Prime Minister and the government of this country. The then government dealt with the representatives of the indigenous people of Australia with respect. They were closely involved in every stage of the process leading to the passage of the Native Title Act through this parliament. It was a time of negotiation between equals, with full respect given to everybody involved. Of course, the then opposition were implacably and loudly opposed to the legislation and were moved to make the most derisive and condemnatory attacks upon it. It is they who are responsible, if there is unworkability in this package, for it being there because of their head in the sand attitude, their refusal to work with all the stakeholders in a positive way at that time. The core principles which underlie the Native Title Act 1993 were: ungrudging and unambiguous recognition and protection of native title; provision for clear and certain validation of past acts, including grants and laws, if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title; a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts affecting native title; and rigorous, specialised and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title and for negotiation and decisions on proposed grants over native title land. The government's current proposals change each and every one of these core principles to the detriment of indigenous people. However, I guess this should come as no surprise, given the attitude and opinions expressed by senior members of the coalition before, during and the time the original legislation was debated. During the process leading to the development and introduction of this amending legislation, the government has treated the representatives of the indigenous people of this country with disdain. It refuses to listen to them. It takes no notice of their arguments for preservation of the package reflected in the act as it stands. It refuses to respect indigenous people and their concerns. It has refused to negotiate with them. The legislation currently before the House reflects this disdain of indigenous people. It has a significant negative impact on the current rights enjoyed by indigenous Australians. The House should be in no doubt about the position of the opposition in relation to these matters. It has already been enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) in the debate so far. The opposition will not walk away from the agreement reached between the previous parliament and indigenous Australians-an agreement which also respected the rights of pastoralists, miners and others with an interest in land. Last night I was fortunate enough, as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title, to witness a submission presentation by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. This presentation was made by the chairman of the commission, Mr Gatjil Djekurra, and his fellow commissioners, Mr Geoff Clarke, Mr Terry O'Shane and others. Their submission was noteworthy for the thought that went into it and the dignified manner in which the presentation was made. Their submission reflected their belief that the principles underlying the original legislation would be significantly watered down. In particular, Mr Djekurra highlighted key areas of the bill which are of major concern to indigenous people. Page 3 of the submission lists these areas as follows: 1. The extensive extinguishment of native title contained in the Bill. 2. The attack on the right to negotiate contained in the Bill. 3. The problem of only those native title holders who currently have access being given interim statutory access rights under this Bill, and thus potentially denying this opportunity to a whole generation of Aboriginal people who were denied access in the past through no fault of their own. 4. Serious doubts that exist over significant parts these amendments in terms of conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act and their potential to be invalid on constitutional grounds. In their submission, the ATSIC representatives referred to the agreement reached with the government in 1993 over the right to negotiate. At page 8 of their submission, ATSIC indicates its opposition to changes which diminish the rights of native title holders because: they are a breach of the agreement reached in 1993 between indigenous interests and the Government that provisions would be inserted in the Native Title Act which validated potentially invalid grants made after the Racial Discrimination Act came into force, providing they would also have a substantial Right to Negotiate; the Right to Negotiate is the only way that indigenous people can protect their communities from the negative impacts of development and help them benefit as well; the Government has not made any case for proposing significant changes; and native title holders will resort to litigation because the Native Title Act will not provide a fair means for protecting their interests, thus leading to more uncertainty for all parties. Any fair reading of the government's proposals shows that it involves, among other things, validation of titles well beyond any reasonable interpretation of the High Court's determination in Wik-manifestly unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable overreach of the provisions purporting to confirm extinguishment of native title. There are bucket loads of extinguishment involved in this legislation which comprise a substantial diminution of the rights of indigenous people to their land. There is an unfair, unreasonable and indefensibly limited test for allowing statutory access rights for registered claimants. ATSIC, in their submission to the parliamentary joint committee, presented a compelling case on this issue. On page 14, the physical access test to which this matter refers, they said: (i) ... there is no way that such a test can operate in a way which does not discriminate unfairly against some native title holders; and, (ii) the proposed suspension of all common law rights to an area, not just common law access of rights, once even one claimant has qualified for the interim statutory rights. They go on to say: There are many reasons why Aboriginal people have been dispersed from their traditional country. However this displacement is one of the greatest worries for native title holders, as it affects their ability to care for, protect and maintain their important sites, and this in tum creates problems for social cohesion and stability. The most important consequences of the Wik decision for many native title holders was the promise of being able to exercise responsibility for their traditional country. Essential to this is the ability to access country for traditional purposes. To wait for determination of claims might be too long for many people, especially older people who feel this loss of country very keenly, and worry that they might die before these matters can be sorted out. At the heart of this bill is an inability, an unwillingness, by the government and some sections of the community to accept that the rights of native title holders can coexist with those of pastoralists and other non-indigenous Australians. But, on the other hand, nonindigenous Australians have consistently voiced their acceptance and support of the Wik principle of coexistence. As Mr Djerrkura eloquently put it last night in his opening statement to the joint committeeand I quote from page 3: . . . our basic approach to native title is one existence. The Wik case, in identifying the coexistence of native title and other interests, has pointed the way forward for this nation, if we are mature enough to acknowledge it. Co-existence means recognition, acceptance and partnership. It is on this basis that we can build a cohesive society which can face the future with optimism. There is no turning back to the days when the rights of indigenous people were suppressed, ignored or marginalised. With native title we have a great opportunity to build for the future. I would like to add a personal dimension here, because native title is not just an abstract legal notion. Native title is about our lives as Australia's indigenous people and the futures we face. My own experience is one where our native title rights have never been significantly interfered with. In a way my people were lucky to live in a very remote part of Australia in north east Arnhem Land, which was not of much interest to the rest of Australia in terms of economic development until the 1960s. This has meant we have been able to maintain our languages, our cultural and spiritual practices and to continue to live on our ancestral lands. We have not been physically dispossessed and displaced by pastoralism, we have not had our children, in the main, spread around the country far from their loved ones. I know what immense importance it has been to us to have maintained this connection to our country and our law. The psychological and social benefits are immense. It is this strong attachment to our country which gives us a strong basis to participate in and contribute to contemporary Australian life, whether it be economic or cultural. It is on the basis of my own personal experience that I know just how important native title is to our people, and taking a broader view to the future of this country. We must do all in our power to acknowledge, recognise and protect native title, wherever it continues to exist. Further on he says: ... it is all to do with sharing and caring for the land we all love-called Australia. They are moving words. They encapsulate very well what native title means to indigenous Australians. This debate is all about respect-respecting diversity and respecting the indigenous rights of our first Australians who have occupied this land for over 40,000 to 50,000 years. My parents came to this country. This was the adopted country of my parents. I have respect for the indigenous inhabitants of this of coland. I have a sense of empathy with them when it comes to discrimination. The Racial Discrimination Act is a special act of this parliament to me because it is our bill of rights; it is what makes us all equal. This amendment bill shreds the Racial Discrimination Act. That is what it does as a later act of the federal parliament. Worse still, this amendment bill is repugnant in parts; we in opposition agree with some of it. The parts that pare back the existing rights that indigenous Australians hold are based on a repugnant notion that the 1967 referendum, which was voted on by over 90 per cent of all Australians, was a referendum that purported in intent and purpose to give this parliament the power to legislate for the benefit and advancement of indigenous Australians. This government comes into this parliament and abuses the purpose and intent of that referendum by saying that the change to the constitution, as endorsed by over 90 per cent of Australians in 1967, can now be used to pare away not only the limited rights that the High Court has found that indigenous Australians enjoy as a result of the Maho and Wik decisions but also the balanced act that this parliament brought into being in 1993-an act that respected the Racial Discrimination Act and utilised the external affairs power and section 8(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act. It was supported by the race power on the basis that the legislation was for the advancement of the race. That is why i am outraged by this package that has come into this parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) diminishes us all in this reprehensible amendment. (Time expired)",31
12,Mr TONY SMITH,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The history of relations between white settlement and the Aboriginal inhabitants from the time the clash began between a developus ing, civilised society with a coherent laneffecting guage-oral and written-and a primitive rum: group of many tribes without a written lanin guage, basically nomadic hunter-gatherers, can be characterised as one of patronisation primarily but also adjustment. The historian Barbara Tuchman summed it up when she cetera. said: Since the beginning of recorded history, governwith ments have pursued policies which are hannful citizens whom they are supposed to protect. Honourable members who have bothered to listen to or read speeches I have given in House will have appreciated that I am not a fan of more and more government-indeed, quite the opposite. I am a great believer in rule of law and the evolution, not the revoluland tion, of the common law. The common law can sometimes get it wrong. It can overcornent rect, but, because of its innate ability correct an overcorrection in an imperfect world, the common law has the advantage centuries of human experience. It casts a look back, it considers, it observes and it works towards a consistent whole, but it should overstep the mark. Quality judges, divorced from political rhetoric, do not. On the other hand, statute law is frequently inflexible, frozen in time for the time. In It's recent years a mountain of statute law has been passed. In the six years from 1990 to 1995, this parliament passed more pages legislation than it did between Federation 1974. I repeat this because it is very importDeane ant: from 1990 to 1995, 29,230 pages of lost its way. legislation; from 1901 to 1974, 28,502 pages of legislation. This is a staggering statistic. Barbara Tuchman refers to this as a 'march of folly'. Sir Harry Gibbs, the former Chief Justice of the High Court, said recently that the courts and the media have joined with governments in taking part in that march. Today we are considering major amendments to what was a flawed act. At its core, when considering that it followed the two Mabo decisions of the High Court, it was the laudable but foolishly patronising notion that title, whatever that means-and I recoil in horror at the prospect of the High Court, millions of dollars in legal fees later, telling what it ultimately does mean-is somehow or trying to effect a restitutio integin other words, putting Aboriginals back the same position they would have been in if European society and development"" had never appeared in this country with its standards of living, health and social welfare, et One can appreciate, without going too far this notion, how unrealistic, absurd and to horribly patronising it is. It gets worse. Notwithstanding the dear assumption in the Native Title Act as originally drafted, espethis cially in the recitals that pastoral leases extinguish native title, the High Court in the Wik decision decided that that was not the the case, throwing a further 40 per cent of this mass of Australia open to claim. The High Court was once considered a pre-emicourt in the common law world under to the auspices of Sir Owen Dixon, Chief Justice. But, unfortunately, it has crossed the of line; it has simply gone too far. Malcolm Fraser, a former Prime Minister, in an article in yesterday's Australian renot counts a discussion with a distinguished English jurist who questioned in the early 1980s what had happened to the High Court. This jurist said: a pity about your High Court. We used to read its judgments. We all used to learn from them. It is clear from the extraordinary rhetoric that of has characterised some of the judgments in and the Mabo case, especially that of Justices and Gaudron, that the court has simply For example, under the rulings of the High Court, the Racial Discrimination Act, from being an act that basically hung around in the comer of your average law library, has assumed the status of holy writ, immune from tampering, unamendable and capable of being stretched to any comer of Australian life, taking on the esteem of the constitution itself. That was very clear from some of the remarks of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). The High Court in the Koowarta case upheld by a bare majority of four to three that the Racial Discrimination Act was a valid use of the external affairs power and thus a valid act. Sir Harry Gibbs, a former Chief Justice, said that a bare majority of the High Court ignored the context provided by the constitution as a whole in construing the power to make laws with respect to external affairs. The High Court in Mabo No. 1 continued this particular march. In that particular case the question was whether it was discriminatory to abolish a form of property which could be held only by one race. Let us think of that notion. Was it discriminatory and in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act to abolish a law which discriminated in favour of one race of people? The High Court held four to three that it was. What a curious notion this is. Thus, a state law which purported to extinguish native title was inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. Mabo No. 2 overturned hundreds of years of settled law. Whereas the states ran the land title system, the Torrens title, which has been copied as a model all over the world, there is now a disturbing, - convoluted and unsettled system of land tenure in this country. I regret to say that I do not think any government, no matter how well intentioned and motivated, can coherently wrestle with it. A brave attempt has been made by this legislation, but can years of expensive litigation generally funded out of taxpayers' money be ruled out? I am not sure that any legislation can exclude that prospect or that any legislation is capable of being accepted by the parliament as a whole in that regard. So while I risk being labelled as one of those conservatives who would take us back from the 'advances', I ask again: we all want progress, but what is progress? Is it not getting into a position where you want to be? I do not want to witness the obscenity of 36 barristers appearing in the High Court for three days, as in the Wik decision-obscene because that indelible image of folly is contrasted with the image of the many Aboriginals for whom I have acted over the years, their lives wrecked by alcohol, by a culture of violence, by an isolation from the mainstream, cast adrift, lurching, getting nowhere where they want to be. It is this group, sadly, the great majority of Aboriginal Australians and to some extent Torres Strait Islanders, who are my constituency and who will not get anything from this amorphous monstrosity called native title. What is native title? Well-meaning Australians think it is like the title we have on the homes and land that we have purchased. Let me tell the people of Australia that it most certainly is not. I can mortgage my land and make it work for me, I can invest in business, I can use it to make myself prosperous, I can sell it and tum it into cash, I can buy a better piece of land. But if I am an Aboriginal and a native title holder I cannot do that. They cannot sell it. In any event, they cannot and do not, almost without exception, own it in their own name. It is communally held. They cannot mortgage it. Hence, they have little chance of improving on it or improving their own standard of living. Thus, I ask: of what value is it in advancing the health, welfare, living standards and employment opportunities of most Aboriginal people? Some might say: but what of the mineral royalties? Apart from the fact that I do not see people advancing individuallyand recent history would seem to suggest this-from yet another handout, at best it can affect only a small number of people. You cannot forever say of a race of people that they are the most disadvantaged in Australia, for this forever condemns them to continued disadvantage and stigmatisation. This is where patronisation and paternalism are founded. It is a patently flawed and failed approach and it is time it was discarded in our dealings with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I have had much experience as a barristerat-law appearing for Aboriginal people and I have seen that patronisation. It sickens me. Some years ago I appeared for a 16-year-old Aboriginal charged with murder. His name was Fred. He was almost a full-blood Aboriginal, a fine physical specimen if ever there were one, a keen intellect, lawyer/doctor material if I ever I saw such a person. He had enormous potential. Whilst he was on remand for a period of about nine months he was a model young individual in the Westbrook centre near Toowoomba. Reports came back to me directly that he was a leader of men, he was someone whom the other boys approached, he was someone whom the other boys looked up to. His mother, Mary, was also an extraordinary woman. He was an example to all of these boys. This incident arose from a street fight which originally arose from excessive use of alcohol. Many people were involved. The leading citizen of the town died in this street fight. It was never murder; it was manslaughter at most. But Fred had to cope on two fronts. In the court case, it was alleged that the person who threw that punch was the same person who scooped up the money that fell out of the deceased's pocket. It was a riot that night. Fred admitted to pushing in the direction of the upper chest of the deceased, but he did not admit to the fatal punch. He vehemently denied stealing the money. He identified the culprit who stole the money. Many Aboriginals were apprehended that night. The watchhouse charge book identified each of those Aboriginals and each of them was searched for money. All of them, bar one, had small amounts of a few cents in their pocket. The one person who was identified by Fred had a lot of money in his pocket. When you think of the crown case you think: what has happened here? Fred was convicted by an all-white jury of that offence and of the stealing. I have no doubt that it was a miscarriage of justice, a real one. I cannot stand injustice. Fred, as I said, was very much a tremendous specimen of his own race, yet a prisoner of it. A meddling, interfering uncle told him repeatedly that Fred did not understand concepts-which he most certainly did-because he was Aboriginal. This notion goes back again to patronisation. The uncle believed that because Europeans told him, and half-smart ones of his own race built on that concept of discrimination and race. So we are beset with this notion of patronisation. This, in effect, is a concept that we, I am sad to say, as European Australians, have foisted on Aboriginal people, just as with the word 'reconciliation'. This is a word of European derivation, unknown in Aboriginal language. It is patronising in the extreme, though well meaning. It is muddle-headed and divisive and should be discarded, as it is used as a whipping post to foster division in Australian society. I have never seen more division in my life since this notion was foisted upon us. Likewise the use of divisive terms such as 'indigenous' and 'non-indigenous'. I pay tribute here to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and its report A new deal, where the committee eschewed the use of this divisive language. The problem with using that language was particularly acute when looking at Torres Strait Islanders. For example, what do you call a person of Japanese origin who has lived in the Torres Strait for over 100 years, as opposed to a Melanesian who has been there for fifty years? It can't be 'indigenous' and 'non-indigenous'. Again, the use of these terms is divisive, unnecessary and patronising. It is important to mention a couple of things in relation to the opposition amendment. The opposition amendment speaks in 7(iv) of 'extinguishment'. That is simply not true. Compensation will be paid. Similarly with validation. Compensation has been set at 75 per cent with a Commonwealth contribution. If the opposition can show anywhere in this legislation-and I challenge them to do so-where a native title right is established that compensation will not follow, then I would be very happy for them to do so. Likewise with this comment in lO(vii) about the rules of evidence. It is yet again patronisation, yet again wanting to say that there is a race of people who cannot be subject to the same rules of evidence laws as the rest of Australia. It is Hindmarsh Island revisited. I commend to honourable members the book by Michael Warby, Past Wrongs, Future Rights. I want to refer quickly to that book. In the summary it says: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have levels of life expectancy, health, income, educational attainment and employment which remain very significantly below mainstream Australia. These poor social outcomes have proved unresponsive to past and present policies, despite very considerable expenditure of public funds ... These outcomes are the legacy of past discrimination and uncompleted processes of cultur-Â· al adaptation from hunter-gatherer societies to becoming part of a global .industrialised . society. The harm done to present and past generations of indigenous Australianshe uses that term, which I disagree withhas overwhelmingly come from treating them as ""special cases"", not subject to the same rights, laws, consideration and respect as other Australians. Continuing to treat indigenous Australians as a collective special case runs the risk of retarding the process of adaptation. The welfare approach to indigenous policy detracts from, or even frustrates, cultural adaptation. Similarly, focusing on discrimination and allegations of racism emphasizes attitudes to a biologically trivial, and scientifically irrelevant, distinction rather than achieving the necessary improvements within indigenous communities. The issues are not ones of race . . . but of the development of the personal skills, knowledge and informal and formal institutions that will generate and sustain social outcomes . . . The only appropriate role for the concept of race in public policy is to bar racial discrimination. I want to close with the final quote from this particular book: The developing thread in public policy of building up an independent, privately owned asset base for indigenous Australians is far more potentially productive than the previous welfarist and antidiscrimination approaches. But only provided such an approach is: a basis for building up institutions, and assisting in the re-construction of a vibrant civil society, genuinely inclusive of indigenous Australians; and fostering the cultural adaptation which must occur if indigenous Australians are to gain rightful benefits of participation in Australian and global society. Cultural (including institutional) adaptations must come from within indigenous societies and communities if they are to succeed. Forced persistence with, for example, communal and inalienable title is not only not a basis for progress in improving conditions for indigenous Australians, it will actually retard progress. Native title, construed as communal, inalienable and generally partial title, is not a path forward. I agree wholeheartedly with this. It continues: That public policy should be based on the principle that race should not matter, except when in does, is a contradiction that cannot stand. It is too subtle a mix for the coarse operation of political processes; its intellectual incoherence not only ensures that it will not achieve its aims, but is a sign of deep lack of seriousness, of lack of genuine concern with consequences, with what actually occurs for real people with real lives to lead. Unfortunately, I do not have time to finish the whole quote. This bill goes some of the way to improving the present difficult situation. I do believe that the problem with this great area is to get away from patronisation and paternalism and to generate within Aboriginal people that real sense of worth that will help them solve their own problems and have them advance within Australian society. Debate (on motion by Mr Lee) adjourned. DEFENCE PERSONNEL: NORTHERN NA",35
13,Mr MCLACHLAN,TERRITORY ELECTIONS,"by leave-On 3 September 1997 I gave an undertaking to the House that I would inquire further into the matter of the release to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory of the ranks of the Defence Force members living in the Larrakeyah Military Barracks. The Vice-Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, has completed his investigations and has provided me with the following information. The ranks of individual Defence Force members are not compiled in any publication generally available to the public but they do appear from time to time in documentation printed by Defence and made available to the public, such as the Defence functional telephone directory, which members of the public can purchase. Legal advice from the Attorney General's Department is that the matching of members' names and addresses as they appeared on the electoral roll with the member's rank and the disclosure of the information to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory was technically in breach of the Privacy Act. The Attorney-General's Department added that the disclosure in this situation is of a relatively minor nature and unlikely to cause significant interference with the privacy of an individual. I might add that this was not a breach of the Defence Act as suggested by the shadow minister for defence. The issue in question is simply not covered by the Defence Act. Defence instructions are being amended to ensure that no breach of the Privacy Act occurs in future by this means. Members would realise that a military person's rank is hardly secret. Indeed, it is displayed with pride on the uniforms of everyone in the ADF. I also note that the Privacy Act does not prevent the release of information on members' ranks for inclusion on honour rolls and the like where an ADF member may reasonably be expected to have known that information on his or her rank would be used in such away. On 2 September I told the House that I had been advised that there was no recollection or record of advice from Headquarters Northern Command given to the office of the leader of the Northern Territory opposition stating that rank information could not be made available. I also told the House on 3 September that I was not satisfied with the accuracy of this initial advice and that was what led me to ask Admiral Barrie to undertake this investigation. It now appears that such advice was indeed given to the office of the leader of the Northwas ern Territory opposition by a newly appointed civilian staff member of Northern Command. Admiral Barrie reports that this person did not know that the commander had available in his office a copy of a previously compiled list if it was requested by political parties. Despite extensive questioning the commander was not able to establish this fact until after the matter was raised in the House. Admiral Barrie's judgment is that this arose because of a lack of understanding rather than any deliberate attempt to mislead. I have already passed a copy of Admiral Barrie's report to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). Some of the material in the report is of a staff-in-confidence nature and I would ask the honourable member to handle the material accordingly.",38
14,Mr BEVIS,TERRITORY ELECTIONS,"by leave-I would like to thank the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) for making the report available and for providing the information roughly on time along the lines that he had indicated before the House rose a couple of weeks ago. For the record it should be recalled that, when this matter was first raised in this parliament, the question was put to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) and was shrugged off. The day after that, a similar question on this matter was put to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), representing the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, who clearly had no knowledge of the situation and was unable to provide any answer to assist the House. Having had the matter asked twice in that way I find it quite unacceptable that, when asking the Minister for Defence a question about this, which I did on 2 September, the minister's brief response brushed it aside, saying: Quite frankly, I think it is nothing less than a childish question. In fact, he repeated his conclusion that it was a childish question on another occasion. What we now know is that it was not a childish question; it was not an insignificant matter. It a matter of some significance, which has now been acknowledged as a breach of the Privacy Act. The carelessness with which the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, then the minister acting for the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and then subsequently the Minister for Defence dealt with the matter is of some concern. In fact, later that day, when the Minister for Defence gave a more detailed answer and provided documents from Brigadier Roberts and others, he repeated the comment, as I said today, 'It is a childish question.' It is not a childish question; it is a significant issue, as the minister quickly learned the foIIowing day when he was in the House and commented that he was not satisfied with the original advice and had determined to ask Admiral Barrie to undertake a review, which is now before the parliament. The information which I provided by way of statutory declaration, and the matters I sought to raise by way of question, have largely been confirmed as being factual and accurate. We now know that, in spite of what may have been in Chief Minister Stone's mind or Brigadier Roberts's mind, the material was not freely available to other candidates. Indeed, when the Labor Party in the Northern Territory and the leader _of the Labor Party's office sought information about this, they were not only denied it initially but, after some checking by the person who they thought was the appropriate contact point within Defence, they were told that information of this sort is not made available and that they would not be getting it. We now know that is not the case and the frivolous way in which all ministers involved in this have dealt with the matter has been exposed. I would hope that future issues that the opposition raise in respect of defence personnel matters are treated with the seriousness with which I and other members of the opposition raise them. NA (REFORM AND SEPARATION OF FUNCTIONS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 24 September, on motion by Dr Wooldridge: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Macklin moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for the closure of Medicare offices, the threat of further closures as a result of this bill, and reducing access to Medibank Private retail outlets; (2) is appalled that the Government is risking higher premiums for Medibank Private members due to separation costs and loss of economies of scale and higher fees for other private health funds if the competitive force exerted to date by Medibank Private is weakened; (3) calls on the Government to fully protect the job security of all staff at the Health Insurance Commission including those at Medibank Private; (4) deplores the additional cost to taxpayers caused by the separation, including: (a) replicating computer and information systems; (b) a massive upheaval in branch office networks for both Medicare and Medibank Private offices; and (c) staff transfer and re-location costs; and (5) deplores the Government's total mismanagement of private health insurance which has seen $1.7 billion of taxpayers money swallowed up by massive premium rises approved by the Health Minister and the Prime Minister"".",39
15,Mr LEE,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill seeks to make two significant changes: the first is to separate the Medibank Private health insurance fund from the Health Insurance Commission, the second is to expand the role of the Health Insurance Commission. While the Labor Party is quite prepared to once again acknowledge the fine work which has been done by the Health Insurance Commission in data and claims processing, in particular the fact that the Health Insurance Commission has been able to provide a wealth of information and statistics on the state of the nation's health, we strongly oppose the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission. I will explain today why I will be supporting the second reading amendment which has been so ably moved by the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). Our main reason for opposing the separation of Medibank Private is that we believe that this is the first step in the ultimate privatisation of the fund. The government has quite generously provided the opposition some weeks ago with a briefing on this particular bill. During that briefing we sought to test - the government's bona fides in its claims that the legislation which it was introducing would corporatise Medibank Private but that any government that wished to privatise Medibank Private would have to enact subsequent legislation. As part of that briefing, I sought from the government an assurance that merchant banks and clever advisers could not come up with a scheme that would allow this government to perhaps sell off the revenue stream from the shares of a corporatised Medibank Private, even if the government retained the ownership of those shares. We have seen a number of corporate financial transactions where various financial instruments have allowed control of an entity to be transferred, even though the ownership of the shares may not be transferred. The government agreed to go back and have a look at this particular issue. I am not sure if that was the reason, or whether there were other reasons, that caused the government to suggest that it was intending to amend its proposed legislation to close off a loophole that might have allowed the effective privatisation of the fund without any new legislation. The reason I make this claim is that, in the Senate committee hearings on this bill, Senator Knowles told the committee: The bill is being delayed by one week in the of Representatives to enable further consideration on tightening the provisions which would prevent any possible future privatisation of Medibank Private without necessary parliamentary approval. As we understand it, the government is now not intending to make any such amendments. That makes us quite concerned that either this loophole still exists or the government has now received legal advice that it is impossible for anyone to privatise Medibank Private or to sell off the future revenue stream for Medibank Private without further legislation having to pass the parliament. If the government has received that legal advice, . that is reassuring and fine, but we would like to see a copy of that legal advice. When this debate continues in the Senate, we will be seeking to ensure that that legal advice is provided. If the government does not have that legal advice, we remain very concerned that, having asked questions, further amendments were being considered, but they are not before the House today. We would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth) could respond to those particular issues at the end of the debate. It is quite clear what organisations are pushing for this particular measure to be before the House today. It is probably not the Liberal Party, it is probably not government backbenchers, it is probably not the members of Medibank Private and it is not the management of Medibank Private. The organisations which have been pushing for this legislation to be before the parliament today are the other private health funds. The other private health funds are the ones who have been demanding that Medibank Private be separated from the Health Insurance Commission. Let us look at what their agenda is all about. The Australian Health Insurance Association's submission to the government's Industry Commission inquiry into private health insurance said: The Commonwealth has no more role in operating a private health insurance organisation than in running an airline. The Industry Commission report also indicated the views of National Mutual Health Insurance, which said that they 'consider that House Medibank Private should be de-linked from Medicare and privatised'. The Industry Commission report also states: Australian Unity considered that Medibank Private could. first be corporatised and then ultimately privatised. It is quite clear that two of the major health funds and the funds' major representative organisation, the Australian Health Insurance Association, have been arguing not just for the separation andcorporatisation of Medibank Private, not just for it to be split from the Health Insurance Commission, but for its ultimate privatisation. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) we have the clear statement that this action has been taken because of the perception that Medibank Private has some competitive advantage over the private health funds. We are entitled to ask: who has that perception? Who are the people who have this perception, who have lobbied the government and twisted arms that has resulted in this legislation appearing before the House? It is certainly not the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts who, in 1992, found 'no evidence that cross-subsidisation occurs between Medibank Private and Medicare'. My understanding is that, despite extensive examinations by Treasury and the Attorney General (Mr Williams), it certainly was not their perception that there was some difficulty in the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private being co-located. There was certainly no demand from those departments requiring the separation of these two organisations. The group that has this perception is health funds, who are demanding not just the separation but, ultimately, the privatisation Medibank Private. The minister who claims that this perception needs to be addressed in this legislation is the same minister who has given the health funds $1.7 billion of taxpayers' funds-the biggest lemon in Australian health policy that we have seen since the Second World War. I am quite pleased that the second reading amendment of the member for Jagajaga highlights this very issue-the fact that we now have not only the AMA and the Industry Commission but even Jeff Kennett, the Liberal Premier of Victoria, describing that policy as simply money down the drain. Given that we have had the development only in the last few weeks of MBF and Medibank Private announcing another range of increases, I would like to spend a few minutes on this particular issue. Over the last year the government has had in place a policy that required the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the health minister to approve increases in health insurance premiums. We have had John Howard as Prime Minister approve an increase in MBF's premiums of 15 per cent in New South Wales, or five per cent if a fund member agrees to pay a new $50 a day bed tax for nights spent in private hospitals, subject to a limit on the number of nights each year. The Prime Minister has also approved MBF imposing a massive 25 per cent increase in Victoria, or a 15 per cent increase if those Victorian members agree to pay that $50 per night bed tax. We have the same Prime Minister also agreeing to Medibank Private, the very fund we are considering today, imposing an average 11.2 per cent increase in their premiums across the country, or an increase of 20 per cent in Tasmania. You have heard me on many occasions, Madam Deputy Speaker, mention the point that every one of these increases further erodes the tax rebate which ordinary members were led to believe would provide them with a reduction in the costs of their private health insurance. We have not seen a reduction; we the are actually seeing increases in the cost of private health insurance. We are certainly not of seeing an increase in fund membership, which is what we were promised. About 1,000 people are still leaving private health insurance per day. The reason why this latest round of increases which has been approved by the Prime Minister are so disturbing is the fact that the government has now accepted this new $50 a night bed tax for people who use private hospitals. The reason this is so disturbing is that the government said that this policy was about spending $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money to reduce the cost of private health insurance. That would, in theory, boost membership and take pressure off our public hospital system. That is what the $1.7 billion tax rebate was supposed to be all about-to reduce pressure on public hospitals. By the Prime Minister and the health minister agreeing to MBF charging this new $50 a night bed tax for private fund members who use a private hospital, this will force more of MBF's members to be treated as private patients in public hospitals. The reason why MBF has instituted the fee is that MBF pays a lower rebate for a private patient in public hospital than it does for a private patient in a private hospital. MBF is going to increase the pressure public hospitals in complete opposition to the government's claimed intention of this policy, yet the government gives it a tick. The was: government gives a tick to the new $50 per night bed tax for MBF members in private have hospitals. If you are an MBF member and choose this option-there is almost a gun your head: you will get a 15 per cent increase if you do not accept the new bed tax or a five per cent increase if you doI you will be paying not only your Medicare levy, the cost of your health insurance mium and gaps but also a fourth cost: the new $50 per night bed tax, which this government is imposing. When we raise these issues and try to get the government to admit that its $1.7 billion rebate has been $11 billion, its response that the Labor Party never blocked any health fund premium increases and that when Labor was in government people kept leaving private health insurance. The point I want make is, yes, health fund premiums did ideological increase when we were in government and, yes, the number of people in private health funds declined. But that is happening todayAustralian people are still leaving, and fund increases are still taking place. The big difference is that the government has blown $1.7 billion and it has made no difference whatsoever. It has spent $1.7 billion on a failed tax rebate policy that have been spent directly on patient could have been spent directly on public hospitals to reduce waiting lists, to keep operating theatres open and to have put more throughput in our major public hospitals instead, the government has blown it on this tax rebate which is clearly not having any impact whatsoever. Jeff Kennett was right when he said it was money down the drain; we just cannot get the Minister for Health Family Services to admit it. One of the crucial reasons why Medibank Private should remain in public hands is that it provides some competition for the private health funds, for the other fund members. My a evidence for that is the evidence that Russell Schneider, the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, gave to the on Senate committee. He was asked by one of the senators whether Medibank Private offered lower premiums. Mr Schneider's response I think in some cases they have done that. There probably been times when some products have you actually been more expensive than most. at Mr Schneider was asked again by a senator about whether or not Medibank Private was $50 per night cheaper. He said: do not think it is possible to say that across the board, Senator. We would use the term undercut, prebut that might not be appropriate. If Mr Schneider and his colleagues use the term that Medibank Private undercuts the premiums of the other health funds, it sounds to me that Medibank Private is doing a good job for its members. It makes us question is whether it would be in the interests of the fund members of Medibank Private if the fund was corporatised and privatised, as many people are arguing. That is the reason we to believe that the government, through an obsession with wanting to emasculate public enterprises, has set out on this course. We already have evidence of this with Hearing Services, which is recognised as one of the great public enterprises in health services delivery in our country, and which the government is keen to corporatise and set up for further atrocities. Australian Hearing Services has been put through the could ringer and the government now wants to do care. It the same to Medibank Private. The difficulty for the government is that it already has a track record in this area. We already have 44 Medicare offices which have but, been selected for closure. We can in some ways be grateful for that in that the government announced in its 1996 budget that 80 offices were going to close. The community campaign of protest against Medicare office and closures, which has resulted in a reduced number of closures, from 80 offices to 44, is a welcome concession. But it is going to cause a great deal of inconvenience for the communities whose offices have been selected for closure by the government. My colleague the member for Jagajaga has particularly highlighted the consequences to her local constituents of the closure of the Medicare office in Heidelberg. In my own state of New South Wales, 17 of the 44 Medicare offices were singled out for closure. I know you will be shocked by this, Madam Deputy Speaker: by a strange coincidence, 13 of the 17 offices selected for closure just happened to be in Labor Party electorates. I am sure it is a complete coincidence; I am sure the minister has not tried to single out local Medicare offices of Labor Party members in my state for closure. If asked, the parliamentary secretary might say that a high proportion of Medicare offices have closed in government electorates in the state of South Australia-but that might have something to do with the electoral success of the governing parties in that state at the last federal election. The minister has a responsibility to explain what methodology he used to select 13 of the 17 Medicare offices for closure in New South Wales Labor electorates. My constituents are pleased that the Medicare office at The Entrance, at Erina, is currently not scheduled for closure. That is a tribute to the minister. He made the right decision in that case. It is also a tribute to efforts of members of the Long Jetty Combined Pensioners Association, who for weeks had a petition outside the Medicare office at The Entrance where they collected thousands of signatures. I am sure that played a big role in the minister agreeing to keep that particular Medicare office open. The difficulty the government is going to have is that Medibank Private currently has 270 shopfronts because of the co-location with Medicare offices. They are going to shrink from 270 shopfronts to only 70 shopfronts. So, if you are a Medibank Private member, it is going to be much harder for you to get the information you need. The government might claim that there will be some agency arrangements put in place, but we all know that, with the best will in the world, people who act as agents for Medibank Private will not have the detailed knowledge and thorough understanding which the excellent staff at the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private have built up over many years. The member for Jagajaga explained a number of concerns the opposition has about the impact that the changes will have on the staff at the Health Insurance Commission. In particular, we think the tightening up on the limited staff mobility rights is quite unfair and sets a very dangerous precedent. We also will be seeking some assurance from the government about the right of staff to continue to be able to apply for Australian Public Service jobs. One of the other difficulties the government will have is that, in some cases, the offices which are used jointly by Medicare and Medibank Private are leased by Medibank Private. So we will have the ridiculous situation of Medibank Private booting out Medicare, and then Medicare in those places needing to open new offices. Imagine what the cost of a fit out of those offices will be. Mr MCDougall-Your administration was obviously very bad.",40
16,Mr LEE,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Our administration was very bad because we had 270 offices right around the country. It was a terrible thing for us to be the providing excessive service to claimants who were trying to get rebates from their health fund and from Medicare! But, in most cases, Medicare has the lease and Medibank Private will be forced out of the 70 communities lucky enough to retain a Medibank Private agency. For all of these reasons, we oppose the corporatisation of Medibank Private. We think it is the first step on the path-the inevitable path-of a Liberal government in privati sing Medibank Private. We continue to remain concerned about what the impact will be on the cost over the long term for Medibank Private members. We will seek every opportunity to continue this matter in the Senate.",44
17,Mr MCDOUGALL,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"It really amazes me and makes me wonder about the credibility not only of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) but of the Labor Party. They get up here and talk about private health and bleat about the fact that the changes we are making will have some deleterious effect on private health. During their 13-year reign, private health insurance membership fell from 64 per cent to 34 per cent. We must always remember that. I hope the public out there remembers that it was actually the opposition, when in government during those years, that set about destroying private health funds. Today they have the hypocrisy to come in here and bleat about this government's actions in ensuring that the rebuilding of private health in Australia takes place. The member for Dobell may not have been one of those responsible for starting that process of destruction. I do not think he around during the time of the then minister, the former member for Oxley, Mr Bill Hayden. But I certainly am one who rememHealth bers the commencement of the destruction of private health in Australia by the then my electorate. minister, Mr Hayden. I think he started that process in about 1972 to 1975. We have listened to the member for Dobell talk about the recent increase in private health insurance. He criticised this government for its concern about the reserves of private health funds which need to be maintained ensure the viability of people getting their returns-a requirement of the act. However, those opposite averaged the approval of a 12 per cent increase per year over those 13 years. It is very hypocritical for the member for Dobell to even have the hide to raise the point, let alone to try to put some criticism this government for upholding the act and its requirements. We certainly do not like having to do that. It is not our desire to have increasexpand es in private health funds. But it is our desire to ensure that private health funds maintain their service to the community and that give people in the community the opportunity to choose. But I will get back to addressing the purpose of the Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill vate, 1997 before us today. In my electorate of Griffith, we will see the closure of two Medicare offices. The member for Dobell claims thought he was a little hard done by, but two Medicare offices are to close in my electorate. There will be the opportunity for alternatives to be put in place-by the establishment of an agency or through technology, which I will address shortly-in order to overcome that problem. However, it would be totally irresponsible of the government to be operating facilities in the community which are not only not paying their way but not delivering the services because the service demand is not there for those offices to be commercially viable. I, for one, expect all government. services and facilities, whatever they may be, to be commercially viable. The closure of two Medicare offices in my electorate have great relevance to the Health was Insurance Commission bill we are debating today. This bill, which provides for the separation of Medibank Private from the Insurance Commission, will have a subtle but important impact on the people of I believe that separation of our public health fund, Medibank Private, from the Medicare claim system will create a far more efficient and user-friendly system for the people of my electorate. It is obvious that the health system is in crisis from the comments that I and to others have made in this place. It is also obvious that it has been lurching from one disaster to another for more than a decade. It is also very obvious that little or no consideration was given by the previous government for long-term plans to arrest this decline. This bill will allow the health fund on Medibank Private to be established as an independent statutory corporation. It will also enable the Health Insurance Commission to its operations in the area in which it excels-that is, the processing of claims. This bill makes only minor changes to our giant they health machine but changes which will at least set a course for faster and more efficient servicing of health customers. The Health Insurance Commission, which currently runs Medicare and Medibank Priis one of the most efficient and effective of all our statutory bodies. Established in 1973, the commission processes 200 million a year and does so with great efficiency. In fact, it is recognised as a world leader in its field. The commission wants to expand this facility and become a major national and international consulting organisation. By removing the health insurer Medibank Private from its structure, we are freeing the commission to focus on what it does best. Separating those health funds from the Health Insurance Commission also puts Medicare in a position to become more efficient and client friendly. Today's electronic technology makes it possible for service centres to be dotted throughout the community in the form of computerised units connected to a master centre. This is far more preferable than the existing system of one or two retail-style outlets dotted around the suburbs. For many, the mastering of a video machine is the high point of their electronic programming skills-I add myself to that. The thought of handing your personal business over to a mindless machine is out of the question. But surfing up and down the global electronic highway is not just for boffins today nor the young, who have grown up with this technology and simply take it for granted. It is not just a major way of doing business in the future; it is a way of doing business today. The separation of Medibank Private from the health commission and Medicare will allow the modernisation of both organisations. The closure of 40 of the 700 Medicare offices throughout Australia is the beginning of major changes to our claims system. Currently, trials are under way for electronic processing of claims which will give clients greater access to funds than in the past. Under consideration and study is the instalCombined, lation of electronic touch screen terminals in doctors' offices and medical centres. The technology is available for Medicare claims to be made by telephone now. It is also available for computer generated machines, the same as those currently in use to pay rates. In the mall in the CBD of my own city of Brisbane, machines like ATMs are in place. On a regular basis you see people standing at the machine punching their information onto the touch screen and paying their rates to the council. They are paying on a direct line basis and are not bothering to walk two blocks around the comer to draw their money olit Â·of a bank and either pay it by hand or write a cheque. The public is already aware of these changes and is using them in other areas of their business with other levels of government. Major changes to our lifestyle sometimes are unsettling. But major technological advances have been taking place throughout our lives often without us even noticing. I ask you to consider the modest fountain pen. Because it was easy to pull apart and figure out, its introduction did not cause any social trauma. But it had a major effect on the way we conducted our lives. It replaced the messy inkwell which had chained mankind to a desk. Today the ability to assess documents and transfer funds by sticking a plastic card in a machine is a fact of modem life. We now carry out our banking using machines on street comers. This is not only local banking but involves national and international transactions. That Medicare claims will be assessed this way is not anÂ· if but very simply a when. The separation of Medibank Private from the health commission and from Medicare will also set up this organisation, as I said earlier, for modernisation. Medibank Private will continue as a health fund. The only difference is that it will become a Commonwealth entity. That the health fund industry is in crisis is an understatement, as I said earlier. There are 45 funds in Australia, and only two of these are not for profit. Medibank Private is one. the 45 funds last year lost $81 million. The largest, HBA, lost a whacking $10 million alone. It is an indictment on the opposition that, until Labor when in government dropped incentives to the health funds, the funds were running at a profit. To those on the opposition benches who are concerned that the separation of Medibank Private could mean the possibility of privatisation of the fund, I would suggest they get their priorities right for a change. Our first and major concern is to steip the bleeding and revive Medibank Private; After 13 years of neglect, that is what has to be done with Medibank. As I said earlier, during its time in government the Labor Party encouraged the drop in the membership of health funds from 64 per cent of the community to 34 per cent. That Paul Keating proudly announced that. neither he nor his family had private health insurance was a clear signal that the Labor Party had no intention of saving or supporting the private health insurance industry. As a result, Medibank Private-just like all the other funds-has suffered from membership loss. The message I give to the people of my electorate is that, once membership of any fund goes below 25 per cent, it is all over rover. This government is determined to establish a viable health care system, and this bill is just one of the many ways to do that and one of the many changes being introduced to tum the health insurance system around before it is too late. Medibank Private is a health fund and will continue to provide competition in the industry. Severing its links with Medicare and the Health Insurance Commission will not alter its competitive neutrality. This government has already shown it supports Medicare and Medibank Private. By taking them both into the 21 st century and preparing them for the change to the electronic technology of the future, we are confirming that support. I support the changes in this bill.",44
18,Mr ROCHER,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill is an important one for the Howard government. The separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission-the HIC-will bring about a dual benefit. The first is by way of continued modest reform in our public health system and the second results from the government's commitment to improving competitive neutrality through its microeconomic policy. The decision to separate Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission has widespread support throughout the community-from independent analysts and, as I understand it, from within the rank and file the HIC itself. The decision to corporatise is also consistent with the findings in the 1997 report of the Productivity Commissionwhich I will abbreviate to PC-into private health insurance. The PC found that the relationship between Medibank Private and the HIC presented problems, both in terms of competitive neutrality and in transparency and accountability in the management of the health fund. Several submissions to the Productivity Commission noted that Medibank Private was now operational in all Australian states and territories and had grown to become the largest private health insurer in Australia, with around 1.9 million members since its inception in 1976. Other health insurance providers commented that seed money provided to Medibank Private during its establishment had allowed the health insurer to more aggressively compete for market share in an ever shrinking market. The Australian Health Insurance Association revealed that successive federal governments had failed to claim interest on funds advanced for the establishment costs which, in effect, provided Medibank Private with-according to the PC-'a commercial advantage unavailable to all organisations with which it was competing'. So much for the claim by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that there was no crosssubsidisation and never had been. The Productivity Commission report found: The existence of a dominant government owned insurer . .. leads to specific questions about competitive neutrality ... Medibank Private shares its shopfronts with Medicare-and appears to derive significant market advantages unavailable to other insurers, from their co-location. For this reason, the PC recommended that the government consider separating Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission. Importantly, the PC qualified its recommendation and proposed that the decision to separate the two should be reserved until the findings of a Treasury review into competitive neutrality were handed down. That review was scheduled to be presented to the government in March of this year. Presumably the taskforce was in agreement of with the PC on the fate of Medibank Private, because we are here today debating the very issue. I say 'presumably' because we do not know what the Treasury taskforce recommended to the executive. The taskforce did make a report available to cabinet, but its findings have not been made public. It is a curious thing that Treasury's findings have been closeted, given the coalition's undertaking to promote competitive neutrality at every opportunity. Perhaps someone from the government can shed some light on why the report has not been made public and, indeed, whether the Treasurer (Mr Costello) intends to release it at all. If he does not, then the House deserves an explanation. As recently as 2 December of this year, the Treasurer reaffirmed the government's commitment to competitive neutrality as part of its overall policy to boost economic growth. In response to my question without notice about salary packaging in the Western Australian public sector, the Treasurer said: Where things can be done by the private sector, we encourage it to be done, for (the sake of) competishould tive neutrality. The issue of competitive neutrality was addressed by Medibank Private in its own submission to the Productivity Commission. It was suggested that Medibank Private already operates on a competitively neutral basis with its competitors, but the submission also observed that minimal change would be necessary for it to meet everyone of the competitive neutrality principles. Medibank Private purports to already essentially conform to the competitive neutrality guidelines, but at the same time it is inferred that health funds are not competing on equal terms under the current arrangements, and that this commonality could be achieved with a minimum of change. You cannot have it both ways; either competitive neutrality is present or it is not. All the evidence in the case of Medibank Private suggests that there is a strong case for its separation from the HIC in the interests of competitive neutrality. The issue is not whether Medibank Private has benefited, either directly or indirectly, from its shared accommodation with the HIC but whether it has benefited at all. The Commonwealth's competitive neutrality policy statement suggests that no business activity 'should enjoy net competitive advantages over their private sector competitors simply by virtue. of public sector ownership.' That is premised on the notion that distortions in the allocation of resources can occur when governments . use their legislative edge to their own advantage over private sector competitors. Efficiency and competitiveness in those cases are, of course, the big losers, particularly if market based mechanisms are not adopted. The fact that Medibank Private recorded an operating loss of $33.7 million for the year 1995-96 after posting an operating surplus of $22.4 million the previous year merely reinforces what I have been saying. Medibank Private should be answerable to its fund members for its poor performances, rather than being cushioned by taxpayers' money from the outcomes of questionable market decisions. It is a luxury not afforded to any other rival health insurance provider and it not be extended to Medibank Private. Few Australians appreciate the true cost of health care services, and most are keen to limit their contribution to the system wherever that is possible. The continued drop in private health insurance illustrates that very point. It is hard to imagine many taxpayers being impressed with the notion that their taxes are being used, at least in part, to buffer losses incurred by Medibank Private. It is now generally agreed that our health insurance system is in dire straits, and our health care system generally is under great pressure. All the more reason for the government to divest itself of business enterprises that, in the first instance, have a distortional effect on the competitive process and, second, drain limited funds that could be better utilised elsewhere in the delivery of basic health care. A recent study of health care policy in advanced democracies by Mr David Wilsford at the Institute for American Universities found that: The demand for high-volume health care services of greater and greater sophistication is practically infinite. This demand confronts increasingly severe resource constraints as health care expenditures consume an even larger share of national income, rising in real terms faster than economic growth. The bottom line is that government resources are finite and our health care system is facing severe cost problems. Federal spending in Australian health care has increased by than 20 per cent over the past five years in attempt to keep pace with the ever increasing demands for 'free' universal health care. I said during the debate on the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 that the government needed to take approach to reforming our health care system. Tackling the supply side of the problem measures without also focusing on demand will not the reduction in the share of gross domestic product needed to pay for health care. Hence my earlier remark that the reforms contained in this bill should be championed only in so far as they are one part of a wider change policy direction. The competitive neutrality statement sets out all those government Dobell business activities which should comply the designated requirements. The Health Insurance Commission and its subsidiaries included on that list. The implementation strategy in the 1996 statement specified that a review of borrowing costs, ownership and operations of the was to be conducted under the coalition government government. The government should be given practice ceases. credit for following through with that commitment. Importantly, the strategy states that government businesses 'can achieve success as a result of their own merits and intrinsic strengths, but not as a consequence of unfair advantages flowing from government ownerHIC ship.' Clearly, Medibank Private has enjoyed considerable benefits from its co-location Medicare. The existence of a captive tenant arrangement and a captive client throughput were just two examples illustrated by the Australian Health Insurance Association in submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the matter. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill suggests that the separation of Medibank Private from the HIC will not have any significant impact on Commonwealth therefore revenue, but the budget papers outline the government's intention to spend more than million over the next three years in its paign to inform Australians about the implications of separation, as well as encouraging greater participation in private health insurmore ance. While in the scheme of things $4 an million does not seem to be much of a sum, in this time of thrift in government any expenditure on health care must bring about an improvement to the system, and it should be have been mentioned in the explanatory a holistic memorandum, in my view. To date all indicators suggest that the in this bill will correct other anomasee lies. Information provided to the Senate inquiry by the ARIA shows that Medibank Private has benefited from its relationship with the HIC by way of the cost sharing of audit fees, salaries, property, and plant and in equipment. Again, that gives the lie to the assertion of the honourable member for that there is no subsidisation involved. with According to the AHIA's figures, the HIC absorbed the cost of $13 million in salaries are that should have been paid by Medibank Private in the 1994-95 year alone. It is totally improper that Australian taxpayers should be subsidising Medibank Private salary costs via HIC the Health Insurance Commission. The is correct in making sure that this It is likely that these amendments will have an impact on staffing levels at Medibank Private. The government has conceded, for example, that there will have to be changes in the corporate services department, because the is currently served by this section. However, this bill is unlikely to bring about the wave of redundancies that the Community with and Public Sector Union, the CPSU, would have us believe it will. The CPSU's submission to the Senate inquiry stated that the separation of Medibank Private from the HIC its will reduce employment security for staff at both organisations. It argues that the separation will leave the two stand-alone organisations more prone to external threats, and that together they: ... offer a more diversified range of operations and opportunities to survive, if one of its component parts is threatened or attacked. $4 It is an argument that shows a total lack of camregard for the importance of promoting fair competition in the Australian health insurance industry. Some analysts have argued that the government has not gone far enough in its decision to corporatise Medibank Private and separate it from the Health Insurance Commission. They believe that it should, instead, have been sold off. However, the government never committed itself to that option. In his second reading speech the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) stated that the second part of this bill concerns itself with increasing the functions of the Health Insurance Commission. However, a closer inspection of the amendments shows that there will be no change to either the HIC's Medicare functions or its service delivery capacities. It is worth noting the change to the HIC's spare capacity functions that will be brought about by this bill. Comparisons of the procedures and systems used to process medical transactions put the Health Insurance Commission ahead of comparable instrumentalities in all other OECD nations. The HIC currently processes individual transactions at a cost of $1.25 each, and this bill will provide for the possibility that the HIC sell its expertise to anyone interested in purchasing it. According to the minister's office, countries including Turkey and Indonesia have already expressed an interest in buying information like this. In terms of cementing our place as a provider of information technology to offshore markets, this measure could prove to be a good one. Section 8AA of the bill will also see changes to the HIC's additional functions. The explanatory memorandum sets out three categories of additional functions that will be affected, including those conferred under the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. Also, certain functions conferred by written determination of the minister and functions conferred by regulation will alter. The proposals will provide the HIC with the statutory authority to liaise with state health departments in the pursuit of administrative best practice. This is a positive amendment and one worthy of support. The final change to the Health Insurance Commission's functions relates to those things that are deemed to be 'incidental or conducive to the performance' of the functions mentioned. While information on the specifics of this amendment is a little sketchy, I understand that it will provide for senior HIC staff to have access to credit facilities, including Cabcharge. It is difficult to comment on this provision, given the lack of detail, but I would like an assurance from the government that there are adequate checks and balances in the bill to ensure that these privileges cannot be abused sometime in the future. The measures contained in this legislation have not been watered down by the government. They are no less ambitious at their adoption than they were at conception. The coalition is right to adopt measures that rein in the spiralling costs in our health care system. However, cost cutting and patchwork measures will never compare with real reform. A Canadian researcher recently posed a question to the Canadian government. He asked, 'Is this the future of health care: a string of unnecessary disasters before real reform?' The similarities between the Canadian and Australian health care systems suggest to me that this government should ask itself the same question.",47
19,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"With almost everything this government brings forward, one has to look for the hidden agenda. When we hear about protecting the most vulnerable, we look and see the changes to social security. When we hear about protecting the aged and getting more funding into aged residential services, we look to a budget cut of half a billion dollars. Every time the government says one thing, it is invariably doing something quite different. This is particularly pertinent in Medibank because in Medibank we have a replay, if you like, from more than 20 years ago when a previous Liberal Prime Minister promised the people before an election that Medibank would be maintained. Medibank, members will recall, was in fact a full medical and health insurance system instituted by a previous Labor government in the early 1970s. The Medibank that was to be maintained is what we are talking about today. This is the kind of symbolic Medibank from the 1970s, the one of which Malcolm Fraser said, 'Medibank will be maintained,' and what was maintained was the name-Medibank-as a private health fund; not as a total medical and ho-pitalÂ· insurance system for all Australians but as an organisation called Medibank Private, .which was another health fund but owned by the public. SoÂ· there is a great deal of symbolism here today because we are seeing the next Liberal government, within their first year and a half, into Medibank again-22 years on, they are back at it again; Guess who is the Prime Minister? The person who was the Treasurer through the decimation of the original Medibank.Â· The one who was in control of the finances of the Treasury and who probably led the charge in the then cabinet is now Prime Minister of the country and his governrnent is back at Medibank yet again. The last vestige of one of the world's best designed systems for health care, the original Medibank, is now being turned over yet again and, of course, we are being told that it is to privatise it but simply to make it more rational or whatever. I find this very peculiar. One looks for the logic as to why it is so critical to do this and why it has to be corporatised and formed into a company but there really is no compelling argument at all unless there is a hidden agenda. The agenda is not very hidden. It is pretty open; it is pretty transparent. What we are seeing will be replicated in the next few months--or for however long these people are in power-in Medicare itself so it is really quite fascinating to watch, if you like, a revisiting of the seventies on Medibank and a replay for Medicare. So, on one hand, the old original Medibank in name only and what is left of it-its vestiges-is now being finally dispatched effectively out of government control. There is no question that is what that is about. This is about eventually selling off the name Medibank. At least Malcolm Fraser kept the name and at least he kept it within public ownership. This lot are really preparing the way to even sell the name off as well. Not satisfied with destroying Medibank in the seventies, they are intent on actually getting rid of the name and public ownership as well-and this is simply the first step. At the same time as this is happening, we are seeing complaints. We are all getting them-there is not a member in the House who would not have been approached in recent times by constituents concerned about bulk-billing and about how Medicare is operating. It is all very well for government members to pontificate about what wonderful reforms they are making. The word 'reform' means to make better. Change is not reform. Most of the changes that we are seeing are not reforms at all; they are regressive changes-they are going backwards-and those members know it because their constituents are telling them. The more they stand up in here and pretend that black is white and that white is black and that these are reforms and that these are progressive and improvements, the more their own constituencies will reject them and disown them. In recent weeks, a torrent of people has not been coming forward on a range of issues and not least amongst them is Medicare itself. So we are seeing the vestiges of Medibank from the Whitlam government being prepared for final dispatch. They are finally getting rid of it all together, because remember: when this government came to power, it did not promise to keep Medibank--only Medicare. So the Fraser promise of 'keeping' Medibank has been completed. This new Liberal government can now finish off what the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the then Prime Minister started back in the mid-seventies. Anybody who thinks that this is not about privatisation of Medibank is simply kidding themselves. Anybody who thinks it is not also linked to a broader agenda about the role and nature of public enterprise in Australia is also kidding themselves. Some would have watched yesterday the formation of the so called Centrelink. We are watching the corporatisation of the Australian Public Service. There would not be a person in Australia who has not had an argument at some point in time with an Australian bureaucrat, myself included, but there are very few systems in the world that have been so durable and so effective in providing continuity of professionalÂ· advice and service to government, the parliament and the community. The concept of a professional bureaucrat has been a fundamental principle of Australian government and in fact Westminster government for a very long time. We are seeing the decimation of that concept and the institutions themselves. The tragedy of all this is that these institufraud tions are more important than governmentsnot the bureaucrats themselves and not the jobs they do, but the institutions-because they have had the continuity, the consistency and the detachment to provide professional advice to governments of all political persuasions over very long periods of time. The HIC and Medibank Private have effectively been an instrument or an arm of government. How strongly that is applied can be argued and can be varied. But, if you are going to decimate Medicare, first you have got to get rid of Medibank because that would otherwise be inconsistent. The thousand or so people who currently work for Medibank Private are public servants-they are employed by the government of Australia in one form or another. The government can say, 'That will be fine-we will protect them; they can transfer forwards and backwards,' and we all know that will not be the case. They know it and we know it. The community might not understand that very well yet but it will come to understand it because that will certainly be the case as it has been with other organisations. The transfer of so many of our public servants into corporate bodies such as the single service agencies-:-where it is management by a board and there is no accountability to the parliament-are very important changes that the public really should understand. This government is actually creating a public service that does not answer to the public via the parliament but answers to a minister via a board. One would expect, given the events of recent days, that all those board members would have already signed their resignation letters in advance before they would be appointed. In other words, what we are getting is government by ministers without accountability to the parliament. The fact that this week we are seeing a minister justifying, on behalf of the government, people signing in advance a letter to resign indicates the particular board is not autonomous or sovereign in any form, so the idea that somehow they are creating a system that is objective and at arms-length from government is in fact utter nonsense. It is a on all of us because those board members have all signed the same letter, I guarantee, that the members of the CASA board have been asked to sign in recent days and one would assume that they have all signed. In other words, they have signed their own resignations in advance. If the minister does not like you, then you will resign as required and as requested. These amendments seem quite innocuous. They seem pretty harmless; they are simply corporatising an existing public body which will stay in public ownership. In theory, legislation is required to do anything other than that. Firstly, why bother doing it if it is so innocuous? Why waste the parliament's time? The cost involved in this process will be quite significant. If it is so innocuous, why bother? What is the major benefit? Any benefits that will be obtained by this could be obtained without doing this. Secondly, the staff involved warrant this government's confidence and support. People are employed to do a job. They act professionally and they carry out their work in good conscience. They deserve a bit better than what they are getting from this government. In the last 18 months virtually every public servant has been stigmatised as being untrustworthy, unreliable or tainted in some form. Let me tell you that they are leaving in droves. I received a call in my office this morning from a staff member working in one of the departments in Newcastle who is leaving in absolute despair. This morning she telephoned to say goodbye, to thank me for working with her over the years and to tell me that she could not take any more. They were her comments: she could not take any more. This woman has been a tremendously good employee and has acted extremely professionally. We have argued with her often, but a very profes-ional public servant who has done a great job is leaving right now because she cannot take any more. That is a tragic indictment. What I am finding in all the departments is that all the corporate knowledge is going. All the experience and expertise is disappearing. What is happening out there in those departments is an absolute tragedy. I am also finding that mistakes are coming through. I know of a case where a man who became unemployed was told by soCial security that he was entitled to $8.54 a fortnight, and he had no income. We checked with the department and got them to go back and check through their records because it did not make any sense to us. There was a mistake. I cannot blame the person who made the mistake because the fact is that they are all overloaded. They are administering rules that no-one understands. The guidelines are contradictory and are being worked out as they go along. They are understaffed and a lot of their most experienced people have gone. The people who are suffering are the people in the community who require services. Medicare and Medibank are no different. We are going to see an exodus of staff as and when they can leave. Rather than be shunted, shifted and pushed around the way people are being, those who can leave will go when they can at their choosing rather than become victims. Some of those will be the very best people they have. They will get out when they choose. The services that will be offered will be scaled back. The complication between Medicare and Medibank will be exacerbated as the culture and the nature change. Guess who will suffer? The person who fronts up to make a claim or to pay a bill will find that people do not understand, or there is a mistake, or it is not what they thought it was. While all this is happening, the real issue health funding is being ignored. All this is basically a smokescreen. There is a hidden agenda, and the real issue of health insurance is being ignored. Some of us remember very well how in the last parliament the then health minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), tried desperately hard to get some bipartisan support for the concept of full insurance, where the health funds and the hospitals would work together to give people 100 per cent coverage. Some of us recall how that legislation was passed with violent opposition from the then opposition. We are watching now in some bemusement as the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) tries feroCiously to get that same system in place. Everything that we tried to negotiate in the previous parliament in terms of a better outcome for both the health funds and their members is now being revisited by a minister who comes from a party whose hands are not clean on this matter. Their violent opposition to it in the previous parliament sabotaged and virtually destroyed the potential for the whole system. Now he is blaming someone else. Now he is blaming the doctors or somebody else because they will not cooperate. The people who are not cooperating are the people that the current government encouraged and incited not to cooperate in the last parliament. As I said at the start, with this government you watch what they say and then look for the hidden agenda or the inverse. If they are talking about improving Medibank, watch out. If they are talking about improving service delivery, watch out. Jf they are talking about improving efficiency, watch out. What we are finding is that virtually all of those things are not reforms, they are regressions. We are now getting a worse service in almost every area. For all the lauding of their changes and their savings, we know who is paying. We know who is suffering. We know who is not benefiting, and that is the general public. Most of my constituents have suffered in one form or another, particularly in recent weeks. The changes that came in last Saturday are horrendous. The changes to nursing homes are absolutely mind-boggling. People of who are managing nursing homes are now required to give 28 days notice of fee changes. The new fees come in next week, and their residents do not know how much they are required to pay because the government has not yet told them. The departments have not yet told them. When the minister comes and asks us for our support for amendments to this legislation on the grounds that it is going to iron out some competitive advantages and disadvantages and create a more transparent system, a more arms-length system, we start asking: what is the government really trying to do; what is really going on here? The reasons become fairly clear. Firstly, it is finally going to get rid of Medibank altogether-the final guillotine, the final chop. Let us think back to the conservatives' view of Medibank when it was originally introduced and remember the anger and the hatred they had for it. Fraser said, 'We will keep it,' and he kept the name. Well, we are finally going to get rid of the name. Twenty-two years later they are finally going to get rid of the whole lot. Medibank will not be owned by the Australian public. It will become somebody else's. That really has great symbolism for people. I think the government is much more symbolic than actual in its approach. The reality tests that the government is having at the moment in a lot of these areas may make some government members wake up, because I have no doubt their offices are being besieged by their constituents, like mine is, with these matters. That is their hidden agenda on privatisation. The second agenda is the staffing. The aim is to get rid of as many public servants as possible in whatever form is possible and at whatever expense is required. Let me tell you: the payouts for some of our long-serving public servants have been enormous and have been quite wasteful. People did not want to leave, but the offers were too good to refuse. We will find similar things occurring as this legislation works its way through. When people are moved into the new system but then want to move elsewhere, they will be forced to be compensated in some form. Those who cannot-those who have less service-will be pushed around. Those with bargaining power will bargain; those who cannot bargain will have to cop it. We are talking about getting rid of another thousand. We will then see the Prime Minister up saying, 'Another 1,000 public servants gone; isn't that terrific? It is another burden off taxpayers.' What a load of rubbish! It is not a burden off the taxpayers; it is simply shifting another burden onto the taxpayers in another form. I think the blatant dishonesty of so much of the last 18 months comes together in what appear to be very obvious and very innocuous amendments. But, in a way, they symbolise so much of this government: the appearance defies the reality; the objectives are never clear; the outcomes invariably disadvantage normal people in the community; and, on top of all that, they then start boasting and bragging about what a wonderful thing they are doing on behalf of all of us. Some of us have been watching this for long enough to understand that it is not as simple as that. It is not done with mirrors or glib words. Eventually, governments have to perform and they are judged on their performance. Let me tell you: out there the community are now judging the government, and they are not judging the government's performance kindly. Government members know that because the panic in recent weeks since the parliament resumed back in August is now becoming pretty transparent. Until the government backbenchers start to stand up and be counted and demand activity of their ministers-as they did this week of the minister for aged services-we will see more legislation like this; we will see more of these deceptions and deceits that are being practised. These amendments are unnecessary, disruptive and destructive. They should be opposed.",50
20,Ms WORTH,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (1.03 p.m.)-I thank all members for the contributions they have made to this debate on the Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill 1997. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) asked for the criteria which are applied in selecting Medicare offices for closure. I think I have heard the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) already answer questions on this but, as the member for Dobell has asked about it, I will tell him the again. The first criterion is that there be minimal disruption to the public. Therefore, a branch will be within 12 kilometres of another branch. That is why most of these closures are occurring in metropolitan areas. Mr Martin-In Labor seats. Is that one of them?",54
21,Ms WORTH,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"We will get to that in a moment. The second is the ability to redeploy staff and the third is the volume of face-toface claims. That is all about whether there is a high volume of bulk-billing in a particular area. That is probably the greatest single contributing factor to the offices that are being closed. One is actually being closed in my own electorate, which members opposite might be interested to know, and I am certainly a member of the government. But I recognise that area as an area where there is a very high volume of bulk-billing. The fourth criterion is the leasing arrangements; that is, the ability to terminate a lease, assignment or sublease. No branches are closing as a direct result of the separation of the mc from Medibank Private. The good news for rural areas is that, within two months, we will have an extra 100 claiming facilities for rural Australians. This is another example of this government's commitment to rural Australia and, certainly, a great win for the bush. The question of the selling of Medibank Private has also been raised by opposition speakers. The government does not intend to sell Medibank Private. The member for Dobell asked for details on this matter; I can give him some details. The National Health Act 1953 has had a possible hole in it, which would allow the government to sell its interests in the fund while retaining Medibank Private as a hollow shell. This provision has been there for years, through Labor and Liberal governments. A question from the member for Dobell to officers of the Health Insurance Commission and an adviser to the minister on 27 August raised the possibility of the income stream of Medibank Private being sold. After checking with the Health Insurance Commission, the minister subsequently was informed that the National Health Act 1953 allows for a fund to be merged with another authorised fund and makes no comment on the ability of a related transfer of compensation. It seems, from legal advice, that it is possible to merge a fund with another and for the owner of that fund to pay for that merger. There is nothing new about this. That provision has been there for years. The government has decided that, because it has been there for such a long time, it is not necessary to make any change now. I repeat that the government has said that Medibank Private is not for sale. I have been astounded that the opposition would come in here and talk about our privatisation record and what we might be going to do about this, because before the election we said we would not sell Medibank Private. We will stick to our word. Labor's record on privatisation is really quite different: they said that they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank and they did; they said they would not sell Qantas and they did. In contrast, this government went to the election saying that we would sell one-third of Telstra, and we have done so. The opposition has also raised questions about this legislation risking higher premiums. Premiums will not increase as a result of this separation. There will be no cost impact at the macro level. Premiums did increase as a result of Labor's mismanagement. A new CEO and board devoted to Medibank Private, for example, will obviously have cost implications. However, this will be managed within the total management expense budget. Net management expenses represent less than five per cent of the fund's total expenditure. Priorities will be assessed and costs will be examined by a board whose sole purpose is to run Medibank Private. Labor spent years saying that Medibank Private does not enjoy a cost advantage, so I am now surprised to hear them say that costs will increase. The opposition really cannot have it both ways: they were either right then or they are right now. I do share with the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) a dislike of hypocrisy. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has raised the question of job security. The member for Jagajaga wants us to protect the job security of those in the Health Insurance Commission. We will do that by the very mechanism that the member for Jagajaga deplores-and that is compulsory staff transfers. Without this measure, the terms and conditions of staff cannot be protected. It provides visible certainty to staff regarding their terms and conditions of employment, including their mobility rights. The Health Insurance Commission has put administrative mechanisms in place to ensure that staff are consulted and that their preferences are taken into account. On the question of additional costs to taxpayers, which once again the member for Jagajaga raised, she deplores the additional cost to taxpayers, including massive upheavals and replication of computer and information systems. Using technology is an ongoing process, requiring constant update and adaptation. Electronic claiming, for example, now accounts for over a quarter of the Health Insurance Commission's Medicare business. While the member for Jagajaga may wish to use pen and paper and queue with customers, the HIC is moving ahead into a more sophisticated method of service and delivery. Information systems will, as I mentioned earlier, include the 100 additional pharmacy claiming facilities in rural Australia as well as electronthat ic and telephone claiming. The opposition has spent considerable time in this debate criticising the government about how it has managed its support for the private health industry. It is absolute hypocrisy for Labor to criticise this government on private health insurance policies and issues, given its record. Let me remind those present what the previous Labor government has done and why we have had such a mess which we are now dealing with: the previous Labor government abolished the federal contribution to the reinsurance scheme; the previous government cut the Medicare rebate for in-patient services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent; and the previous government abolished the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. These decisions alone led to a 40 per cent increase in private health premiums in just two years. The old arguments have been trotted out about Medicare being under threat. It is not. But we know that a strong public sector needs a strong private sector, so the government is committed to that. I emphasise again that a lot of damage needs to be undone. The previous Labor government either ignored or did not understand the significance of the private health sector. However, I know that at least one Labor health minister understood the problems and actually had the honesty to refer to them. I quote Graham Richardson when he said: Labor health ministers are not allowed to believe that the decline in private health insurance is anything other than a vote of confidence in medicare . . . they are also not allowed to believe that the public hospital system will ever find itself unable to cope with the influx of formerly insured citizens, which will one day create one hell of a problem. This government is now having to deal with that one hell of a problem, caused by Labor's refusal to deal with-or perhaps their woeful ignorance of-the relationship between the private and public sectors. When Labor came to power in 1984, over three in five Australians had private health cover. When Labor left office, it was barely one in three. We are still dealing with that one hell of a problem that Graham Richardson identified; is, less people are in private health insurance which has resulted in longer waiting lists in public hospitals. Labor ignored this problem and remained unresponsive to the desire of Australians to have a choice in their health services. We have inherited a Medicare system in trouble, jeopardised by the rising costs and the weakening of the private sector, which saw over one-quarter of Australians drop their private health cover during Labor's administration. But we are trying to fix it. We have been successful in containing the costs of Medicare while maintaining the bulk-billing rates. Medicare, after growing out of control under Labor, is slowing to a sustainable rate of growth. We are trying to fix this mess left to us in the private sector through a number of means, notably the private health insurance incentives. Despite criticisms from the opposition, I am pleased to say that we are actually giving $450 to families to assist them with their private health insurance and $250 to pensioner couples. Yet the opposition would have us not provide that assistance. Premiums have gone up. They have gone up a lot more than we would have liked. The funds are still trying to cope with the legacies of Labor's attitude that private health insuranCe was unimportant. It is no wonder that so many young people now do not have private health insurance. There was a culture which was rampant particularly under the last government when the former Prime Minister and the then minister for health, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), were very publicly saying that you just did not need it because you could rely on Medicare. Of course, we know that the Medicare levy only brings in between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion a year, and Commonwealth expenditure is, of course, closer to $20 billion. So the problems we are having now have been a direct result of former government policy. I will refer quickly to another couple of matters. This government supports competitive neutrality and is committed to that. Many in the private health insurance industry believe Medibank Private has an unfair advantage by virtue of its association with Medicare. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) covered this subject particularly well. While not supporting this view, the government sees value in removing any perception of unfair advantage. The administration arrangements between the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private are sound. Labor has claimed that there are winners and losers and that this bill will only produce losers. That is certainly not so. Staff of the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private will be the winners, with a tightly focused board of directors and a general manager devoting full attention to each. Staff will be part of a vibrant, focused organisation, whichever way they choose to go. Members of Medibank Private will be winners. Those members will be part of a fund eager for new opportunities, employing new technology and a more flexible option of enhanced services. Members of other funds will also be winners because Medibank Private will continue to push and develop new service opportunities which will drive industry forward. I think that is a very important point. Of course, funds are now operating in an environment of support from the government which, as I have been at pains to point out to you, is very different from the contribution under the previous administration. I again thank members for their contribution and commend this government legislation to the House. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",55

The government is moving a couple of minor amendments to the bill concerning the use of credit cards and allowing for transitional arrangements with respect to commissioners. Amendment (2) enables the Health Insurance Commission to use credit facilities such as Cabcharge. This is needed as the act currently restricts the commissioner's power to borrow. Allowing the use of credit card facilities would be useful in the day to day administration of the Health Insurance Commission. Amendments 0), (3), (5) and (6), with respect to the board, are transitional only and allow for the number of commissioners to be increased from seven to nine, in the short term, before settling to a final board of five members. These amendments are there so that there will be a high quality interim board to ensure such smooth transition.

VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND COMPENSATION MEASURES) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the bill be now read a second time.",58
25,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,I present a replacement explanatory memorandum to the bill.,58
26,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Reid) (1.21 p.m.}-As originally introduced, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) BIll had three major elements: clarification of advance pension payments, extinguishment of Commonwealth liability for the medical consequences of future smoking, and changes to repatriation benefits and clarification of defence declarations. In addition, the government yesterday foreshadowed 28 pages of amendments regarding treatment benefits, fringe benefits and carers paymerits. Whilst many amendments arise from earlier bills, they come at the death knell a full three months after the bill's introduction, and this is obviously an unsatisfactory practice. The opposition endorses the change in regard to advance payments. It stems from the 1995 legislation that allows pensioners on modest means to have advance payments for the purposes of repairs to the home, equipment or travel. The measure is now liberalised to allow disability pensioners and war widows also to have access to these advance payments which must be repaid over a period of six months, the maximum payment being $500 or 13 times the person's fortnightly rate. Similarly, in regard to smoking, we support the change whereby, from 31 December this year, the future taking up of smoking or an increase in smoking will not be compensable injuries, diseases and deaths where the only cause stems from the use of tobacco products. This comes in the context of wider knowledge of the dangers of smoking and the fact that the defence department has been smoke free since 1987. We will not be opposing these aspects because they are purely prospective in nature and do not reduce or eliminate a veteran's existing entitlement.. Under the changes, the department will continue to provide automatic treatment benefits for veterans with cancer, as well as for PTSD and TB. It also appears unlikely that the changes will impact on disability pension claims in the immediate future. No savings have been included in the current forward estimates and ex-service organisations have not criticised their introduction. Obviously,' the actual implementation of the measures needs to be closely monitored lest it later produce any unanticipated adverse effects on veterans' entitlements. A major element of the bill deals with what has become known as overseas service anomalies. On behalf of the opposition, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its confused, secretive and inconsistent handling of repatriation benefits and awards for overseas service; (2) believes the Government should extend qualifying service status to personnel at RAAF Ubon Thailand from June 1965 to August 1968 and to RAN ships that served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan emergency; and (3) recommends that the Government should restore entitlements to Vietnam naval logistical support personnel for the journey to and from Australia and Vietnam"". I wish to consider, firstly, the nature of the government's review of overseas service anomalies. The coalition's 1996 platform promised to review all overseas service anomalies in respect of both military medals and access to repatriation benefits. It set up a joint Department of Veterans' Affairs and Department of Defence review and announced the resulting repatriation changes in the 1997 budget. It is disturbing to note that the review lacked any community representatives or public consultation. Its report has not been released to the public and its reasoning and the evidence that it relied upon have not been revealed. I wrote to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) on 26 June 1997 seeking a copy of the report. Three months later she has not even had the courtesy to reply to my request. This is sadlyÂ· typical of her idiosyncratic approach to the portfolio and conventional government practice. She alone in the government has refused to allow the opposition an overall departmental briefing. All this is in stark contrast to the former Labor government's Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards-CIDDRA-which comprised.community members with service experience, which consulted with ex-service organisations and whose full report was published and publicly distributed. Neither the opposition nor the ex-service community can be expected to simply accept blanket assurances that the review properly considered all identified anomalies and reached reasonable conclusions in this context. This is particularly the case, given, Minister Bishop's bungling over double. medalling, the First Lord of the Admiralty letters and the failure to gazette medal changes over many months. We naturally welcome the fact that the bill extends operational service benefits to many veterans. These benefits consist of disability pension entitlements and medical treatment for any disease or injury resulting from that overseas service, and access to defence service home loans for 11 groups. The groups include: the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan; the RAN personnel I speak of; RAAF personnel at Ubon and other ADF personnel in north-east Thailand; service in the demilitarised zone of Korea; and various United Nations missions such as in Lebanon, Korea and the India-Pakistan border. The bill provides that disability pensions can be backdated to 13 May 1997 if the individual veteran applied by the middle of last month. Otherwise, an application can only be backdated three months. It is very much in ' the interests of the veterans concerned to make application even while the necessary' legislation is still making its way thrQugh parliament. I would urge the government to better publicise the importance of early applications, given the government's studied indifference to the impact of its tardy actions in finalising this legislation. As I said, it was first introduced three months ago. Service pension rights are extended also to 80 embassy guards and RAAF evacuation personnel who remained in Vietnam after the withdrawal of ground forces and up until the end of the war, that is, between early January 1973 and the end of April 1975. The opposition is pleased to support this measure. Obviously, those involved would have incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy-the basic qualification for qualifying service in regard to service pensions. The bill also clarifies the nexus between defence declarations and repatriation benefits eligibility through new classifications of warlike service and non-warlike service. These will equate with the repatriation concepts of qualifying and operational service. When it becomes law, the Minister for Defence will be empowered to declare particular overseas service as being warlike or nonwarlike without the need for further amendments of the act to give servicemen rights. It is relevant to note that the ADF's current conditions of service manual Indman defines warlike operations as: . . . those military activities where of force is authorised to pursue military objectives and there is an expectation of casualties. Non-warlike operations are defined as: ... those military activities ... where there is a risk associated with the assigned task and where the application is limited to self-defence. These definitions strengthen the opposition's argument that the situation of RAAF personnel at Ubon and Royal Australian Navy FESR service were warlike in nature, as the personnel involved were not restricted to acting in self-defence. The opposition endorses these changes and notes that the Defence classifications concerned were introduced under Labor. The recent experience of drawn out debates years later about the precise nature of veterans' overseas service, with semantic changes having potentially serious implications for individuals with dimmed memories many years later and increased problems of substantiation, and with the passage of the necessary legislation often subject to numerous potential delays, is obviously not an ideal situation. We believe that ADF personnel serving overseas are entitled to be clearly and speedily told what classification their service comes under and what their entitlements will be. We would insist that any changes in the operational environment be followed by appropriate changes in the classification of service. The government should also be able to legislate to extend coverage to other overseas service anomalies that might arise. The bill also introduces the pbrase 'assigned for service' as an alternative to the long standing expression 'allotted for service'. No definition is given for 'assigned for service' and the change in terminology is not mentioned in the explanatory memorandum. Whilst there may be some unstated explanation for the change, there must be grave suspicions that it has been employed to soften the reality that, as recently as February this year, coalition ministers were asserting that the Royal Australian Navy Far East Strategic Reserve ships, which the bill now declares were assigned for service, were never allotted. As far as can be ascertained, the expressions the application have an identical meaning . The coalition's review severely downgraded veterans who served at Ubon, Thailand, during the Vietnam War and in RAN ships attached to the FESR during the Malayan Emergency. I would first like to canvass some of the issues and difficulties involved in making judgments about qualifying service or warlike service for service pension purposes. This pension was introduced for the likely adverse effects on veterans of theatre of war service. The most frequently cited instances are premature ageing and reduction of earning capacity. Both are encapsulated in the concept of the 'burnt out digger'. Broadly speaking, access to service pension is usually restricted to persons who have rendered service against the enemy during a period of hostilities and have incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy, whereas disability pension is available to a broader group that have experienced hazardous or peacekeeping service. The accepted interpretation of the term 'incurred danger' was made by the Full Bench of the Federal Court in the Thompson case in 1988. They said: The words 'incurred danger' provide an objective, not a sUbjective test. A serviceman incurs danger when he encounters danger, is in danger or is endangered. He incurs danger from hostile forces when he is at risk or in peril of harm from hostile forces. There are two particular difficulties in objectively determining the degree of danger encountered in post-World War II conflicts. Almost all such service has been in circumstances other than a declared war fought on traditional lines. In many of the situations covered by this bill our participation was contentious and in several cases owed more to the request of third parties-chiefly the United States-than to a formal invitation from the country concerned and, particularly during the Vietnam era, the true nature and military objective of our participation was not always truthfully conveyed to the Australian people. Conflict was more likely to involve sporadic, hit-andrun tactics and acts of sabotage involving small numbers of highly mobile opponents rather than traditional battles, and the identification of categories such as civilians, combatants and allied and hostile forces was often tenuous. Another concern involves the relative difficulty of assessing the degree of danger facing naval personnel and air crew in circumstances that did not involve high technology battles along Battle of Britain or Battle of the Coral Sea lines. There is no foolproof formula that can be used to assess such different warlike or hazardous circumstances. There can only be reasoned judgment based on the available evidence. We are not convinced that the coalition government has done this in the two cases we cite. The government argues that RAAF personnel were at Ubon, Thailand, from 1962 until 1968 pursuant to Australia's South East Asia Treaty Organisation treaty obligations and that their role was merely to guard Thai airspace. The government insists that their activIties were entirely separate from Australia's Vietnam involvement. Even in February, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) stated: There was a RAAF contingent based at Ubon in Thailand situated on the borders of Laos and Cambodia between 1962 and 1968. She further said: They were there pursuant to our arrangements and our obligations under SEATO and it was separate from our involvement with the Vietnam war. That was on 13 February this year. RAAF personnel were despatched to Ubon in May 1962 as Australia's first bilateral military engagement in the region with the United States. There is no doubt that we were actually invited there by the United States for broader strategic reasons related to the situation in Indochina. The official Thai invitation was a diplomatic pretence along identical lines to our subsequent entry into the Vietnam War two months later. As far as the Americans were concerned, Ubon' s strategic location was the central issue-it being only 50 kilometres from the Laos border, 80 kilometres from Cambodia, close to the Mekong River and 200 kilometres from the Ho Chi Minh trail. Until 1965, Ubon personnel were basically engaged in a schedule of routine training. Whilst they had permission to use force in self-defence and in the air defence of Thailand, they were not required to do so. During this period their rules of engagement stated: That no aircraft will be directed to investigate any identified contacts unless specifically requested by the Royal Thai government and, secondly, that no aircraft will attack unless fired upon. We accept that service at Ubon during this early period was not qualifying service. We emphatically reject, however, the argument that the above rules of engagement, quoted by Minister Bishop in February, were those that applied to the Royal Australian Air Force's final three years there. Following apparent Chinese air assistance to North Vietnam, the United States decided in 1965 to escalate operations at Ubon. A fully integrated Royal Thai Air Force and United States Air Force Air Defence System was established under effective US control. Under this system, RAAF personnel No. 79 Squadron came under the effective control of the US 2nd Air Division Task Operations centre. From 25 June 1965, the Alert Status of that squadron was altered to place two aircraft at 'alert 5 status' seven days a week \yith Â·aircraft to be armed with 30-millimetre cannon and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The relevant documentation entitled, Air Defence, Thailand involvlng the Royal Australian Air Force, No 79 Squadron-a copy of which is held by the opposition-includes the followrngstatement: The' RAAF agrees to accept the authority of the [USAF] Director of Combat Operations (AOC) or his nominated deputy for scramble and intercept purposes ... [subject to conditions regarding ,'base weather conditions' only]. The above document incorporated new rules of engagement for Ubon applicable from 25 June 1965. Amongst other things, they said: 1. Applicability: Applies to all RT AF unitswhich are the Thai unitsand all other units, including RAAF, responsive to CINCRTAF for the Air Defence of Thailand ... It further noted of hostile act: Anrurcraft commits a hostile act when it conducts unauthorised aerial reconnaissance or combat tactics within the national boundary of Thailand. Certainly, RAAF personnel at Ubon were to be employed only within Thailand's boundarif-s. However, in all other respects, from June 1965, their rules of engagement authorised - hem to take action to destroy enemy aircraft engaged in broadly defined hostile acts. Their effective role was to be responsible for the air defence of Ubon, which the US used as the Thai base for their massive, 24 hours a day Operation Rolling Thunder bombing campaign against North Vietnam !1nd Laos. The RAAF role included patrolling Thai territory regarding border helicopter activity and ground arm caches. From late 1966"" RAAF Airfield Defence Guards were alsQ involved in providing physical base security due to local insurgent acti-ity. ,Published Australian and unpublished US (ecords regarding Ubon have been consulted. We have also been provided with statutory declarations by RAAF officers who served there. From this material, extensive reported enemy activity directed at Ubon which entailed danger to Australian personnel included many instances. For example: a guerilla attack on the US radar unit in May 1965; a Thai helicopter being shot down in May 1967; a USAF C130 was hit by ground fire during its approach to land in 1968; combat experienced US air crew reported 12 separate cases, of muzzle flashes; an enemy MiG 21 was identified and chased by two RAAF Sabres--:-et cetera, ad nauseam. On 3 January 1968, Pilot Officer L. J. MCGRATH was killed near Ubon. According to the then RAAF Officer Commanding at Ubon, 'The cause of the crash was not established although insurgent action cannot be discounted. ' We hold specific references from official sources on these incidents. Based on this material, and in the absence of any credible coalition material against the claims by the servicemen, we have come to accept that RAAF personnel at Ubon were de facto participants in the Vietnam War from June 1965 until withdrawal in August 1968. Whilst they were ordered to stay in Thai airspace and did not directly participate in the United States bombing raids into Laos and North Vietnam, the rules of engagement they operated under from June 1965 were warlike in nature and they were not restricted to acting in self-defence. They faced a degree of danger from hostile forces; chiefly infiltrators from nearby Laos. Ubon RAAF personnel performed much the same role as RAAF personnel did in Vietnam itself. In neither case were there direct enemy attacks on allied air bases. Archival material indicates that Australian authorities considered granting them repatriation benefits on a number of occasions. This culminated in the June 1967 suggestion that Ubon should be subject to special legislation. This did not occur before the RAAF's withdrawal. The second anomaly that our amendment addresses concerns naval personnel who served in Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan emergency. This is a long standing grievance that has dragged on for the best part of 40 years. It reflects no credit on successive governments. There have been three traditional arguments used to justify their exclusion from repatriation benefitspeople namely, that the RAN personnel were allegedly never 'allotted to duty', they subject to military law' and they did not incur additional 'operational risk'. Whilst I will touch on each of these arguments, I would Force observe that, with the budget announcement granting them access to disability pension, the coalition has implicitly abandoned ments regarding 'allotted for duty' and 'not subject to military law'. However, it appears to be still maintaining the argument that they did not incur sufficient additional operational risk to justify the service pension. It appears clear to us that the Royal Ausmilitary tralian Navy ships concerned were originally allotted for duty in 1955. According to a to Treasury from the Secretary of the Navy 11 November 1955: The date on which RAN Ships were allotted for duty as the RAN component of the Reserve was 1 July 1955. Similarly, on 4 August 1955, the Minister for Navy and Army stated in a minute to Prime Minister Menzies: The Naval Board recommends also the RAN personnel be granted the benefit of cover under the Repatriation Act and be eligible for whatever taxation concessions and other general benefits, not associated with living costs, as are granted to the Army and the RAAF personnel. This request was never granted. However, Army and RAAF personnel who saw service during the Malayan Emergency qualified for a campaign medal, the Returned from Active Service Badge, and were eligible for full repatriation benefits, including the service pension and War Service Home Loans. They also received generous allowances and income tax concessions denied to the RAN. The latest budget decision acknowledges that these personnel were on operational service. In doing so, the government must also acknowledge that they were 'allotted for duty', even though senior coalition figures, such as Senator Newman, were denying this as recently as February. To soften its change of position, the government actually uses the phrase, 'assigned for duty' in the bill, but the two phrases have identical meanings. The second traditional argument in support of denying repatriation benefits to these was that the RAN personnel were not 'under military law'. However, section 5 of were 'not the Defence Act reads: This Act shall apply, subject to the provisions of the Naval Defence Act 1910-1949 and the Air Act 1923-1950 to, and in relation to, all the Naval, Military and Air Forces of the Commonwealth and to all members thereof whether appointed enlisted or deemed to be enlisted under this Act the arguor under any other Act. That being the case, I would ask which pari: of the act removes the naval force from being subject to section 4? Senator Newman claimed on 14 May that the RAN forces were subject to the Naval Discipline Act and not to law. The evidence that she presented was a letter from the chairman of the Repatriletter ation Commission to the secretary of the on Prime Minister's department in response to a request dated 20 March 1953 to define properly the description of Australian operationStrategic in Malaysia. It stated: The secretary, Attorney-General's department haS brought his description into conformity with the proclamation made under Section 4 of the Defence Act, declaring Australian Military Forces in Malaya to be on active Service. This declaration, which relates only to Army Forces, was made primarily for the purpose of the application of certain provF sions of military law to Army personnel serving il} Malaya. If these provisions only related to the Army personnel in Malaya, this does not explaiIl how the RAAF forces in Malaya qualified for recognition. Both Army and RAAF personnel who served during the Malayan emergency received the GSM clasp Malaya and repatriation coverage. The opposition does not consider that the veterans concerned should be denied benefits due to semantic wording problems and highly dubious arguments about the applicability of military law. In support of this, I note that the Veterans' Entitlements Act does not include a definition of, or impose requirements regarding, military law. The third and only remaining argument is that the navy personnel who served with tht strategic reserve are not considered by the coalition to have been subject toÂ· sufficient 'additional operational risk' to justify the grant of the service pension. Senator Newman, for example, stated in the Senate on 5 February: Service by RAN personnel in Navy ships attached to the FESR was specifically excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits, on the enemy did not have the capability to threaten naval vessels, while it did have an offensive capability against forces ashore. This echoes a statement by Dr Donald Cameron, then coalition federal Minister for Health, Who said as far back as 1956: They are not regarded as being subjected to additional operational risks. They are subjected to the risks of service for which they engage, and therefore their conditions are in accordance with the terms of enlistment. The accepted basis for qualifying service for the service pension is that the person rendered service against the enemy during a period of hostilities and that the person incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy. The concepts of danger and operational risk are not defined in the act but, as previously mentioned, were defined by the full bench of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v. Thompson in 1988. The difficulty with regard to the Malayan emergency and other guerilla conflicts is that the enemy was more often than not concealed and was, to a degree, unidentifiable. In such a context, danger to ADF personnel often stemmed from civilians, including children. Government apologists have also argued that, because the enemy in this conflict had no substantial naval capacity and did not possess surface to sea missiles, there was no perceived additional threat. However, archival evidence suggests that the naval personnel actually engaged in warlike operations and experienced a degree of danger from hostile forces of the enemy. They were not restricted to acting in self-defence. The operations that these RAN personnel assumed in Malaya were clearly beyond peacetime demands. The primary role, as laid down in the general directive, was to secure and to defend the sea lanes and coastline of Malaya. The secondary role was to participate in operations against communist forces. Actual operations included escorting land troops through the harbour, which was allegedly mined; enforcing a blockade of enemy positions; preventing infiltration by the enemy; bombardment of communist positions; general supportive functions.for other Australian and Commonwealth personnel; and prothe basis that tection of merchant shipping. Whilst the enemy did not have its own navy or possess surface to sea missiles, it is equally true that they lacked an air force or surface to air missiles. This was not seen as a reason to deny qualifying service benefits to other services, which qualified after only 24 hours s-rviCe in an operational area. The additional operational risk faced by the RAN .personnel is obvious and should be recognised. This very week, the coalition member for Riverina (Mr HiCks) told the House: The navy's contribution to the achievements of the reserve is highly regarded in the annals of history. They were an effective blockade and a powerful deterrent. It is strange that their highly regarded contribution is not seen by the coalition to warrant the appropriate recognition of access to the serviCe pension. The original decision to exclude the RAN personnel from 'repatriation benefits in 1956 was essentially based on economiC considerations. Every excuse in the book cannot change this. The unexpected expense of the Malayan emergency caused a shortage of funds, and the purpose of excluding RAN personnel was simply to save money. In a secret letter from the Prime Minister's department to the Deputy High Commissioner of the United Kingdom on 25 November 1955, the government stated: . . . the Australian offer . . . of 2nd September represented a large increase in the financial commitments which Australia envisaged when the formation of the Strategic Reserve was originally considered . . . this commitment will be further substantially increased at a time when Australia is facing balance of payments difficulties and has had to increase restrictions on imports . . . The RAN played a vital supportive role in the emergency, under a very present potential enemy threat. Of the four conflicts involving ADF personnel during the 1950s and 1960s, navy personnel who served during the Malayan emergency are the only ones to be denied equity, comparative treatment and recognition through full veterans' entitlements. The reason is not because of allotment, operational risk or military law. The rationale is economic and political. The opposition's amendment seeks to remedy this injustice.",58
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Sercombe-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,65
28,Mr BRADFORD,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"I listened with considerable interest to the speech of the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). I believe that he has made some very good points. No doubt the points he made were made on advice from various ex-service personnel and ex-service organisations. I am sure that when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) responds in due course he will quite correctly deal in detail with a number of the matters that the member for Reid raised. I do think, however, that it is slightly disingenuous of the member to move an amendment which states, in part, that the House: condemns the Government for its confused, secretbenefits. ive and inconsistent handling of repatriation benefits and awards for overseas service ... On . the contrary, and as the member for Reid's speech clearly indicates, these are complex matters-matters which are not resolved easily. That was the case with the previous government, which certainly had some excellent ministers for veterans' affairs. I pay credit to them. Ben Humphreys and Con Sciacca, who were the ministers in our first two terms in the parliament, were excellent ministers. I do not think it is entirely fairnot that this place is about fairness-to move an amendment which condemns the government for things that are just not true. The present minister's handling of these matters has not been confused, secretive or inconsistent. The government has taken many steps to honour its pre-election commitments on veterans' benefits. Since the election this government has clearly demonstrated that it has a very strong commitment to veterans' affairs. I notice that the minister makes the point very strongly in his second reading speech that we, on this side of the House-indeed, in this parliament-understand that, by virtue of ANZAC Day and other commemorations, we need to pay our greatest respects as a nation to those who gave their lives in the service of this country and to be concerned that those who served and survived have their interests safeguarded. This is particularly true of older veterans whose needs, by virtue of their ageing, are tending to increase. Before the last election, the government promised a review of repatriation entitlements. We,in opposition, had been critical to some extent of some of the decisions taken by the former government, as they are now being critical of us. That demonstrated not only the complexity of these issues but also the fact that in making decisions you have to keep in mind the basic element of fairness and make sure that there is a reasonable differentiation in service which entitled service personnel to particular benefits if they were placed at a level of risk. Those who had served at the highest level of service, if you like, obviously had a full entitlement to a wide range of Those who had served in a lesser sense nevertheless had to have that level of service and that degree of risk recognised. There will always be degrees of debate about where those lines should be drawn. I believe that this government, since it came to office, has demonstrated very clearly its total integrity in the handling of veterans' matters, and we will continue to do so. I know that there is a good degree of bipartisanship in this parliament on the issue of veterans' affairs, as there should be. We should not allow our veterans to be used as political footballs. We will never be able to keep everybody happy. As the member for Reid said; in a sense there are financial restrictions and ramifications. There are obviously budgetary constraints in every portfolio. The government came into office faced with a huge economic problem and has had to go about solving that problem in the interests of all Australians. But I believe our commitment to veterans is not a matter that can be questioned. On election to government, we implemented our promise to review repatriation entitlements. After the election, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence jointly conducted a study entitled A review of service entitlement anomalies, which was submitted to cabinet. The legislation which we are dealing with today deals With some of the recommendations that were made in that report. It is interesting that the report is actually entitled A review of service entitlement anomalies, because that is where there are these grey areas. Indeed, in his amendment, the member for Reid addresses some of those areas of service which have been difficult, based on the fairness test to determine whether in fact they represented the level of service that was required for recognition. The member's amendment deals with a couple of particular matters. There are other matters which are contentious, but it deals specifically with theRAAF at Ubon in Thailand. In his speech, the member for Reid made a very good case for why consideration should be given to that particular matter. However, at the moment the government's position has been that qualifying service entitlements should not be extended to personnel who sery:ed there. That is not necessarily the end of the matter and, as I said, the member for Reid made a useful contribution and, indeed, gave a rationale for why perhaps further consideration should be given to that particular matter. Another matter that the member for Reid raises in his amendment deals with the Far East Strategic Reserve. At the moment, the government's position on that is that RAN personnel did not incur danger from the enemy as a result of that particular service. But, having said that, that matter is still active consideration. The other matter that the member for Reid has raised in his amendment deals with a recommendation that the government should restore entitlements to Vietnam naval logistics support personnel for the journey to and from Australia and Vietnam. I am sure the minister, when he responds, will be able to confirm the situation, but let me foreshadow his response by saying that my understanding is that the government is already moving to restore that so-called port to port coverage for Vietnam naval logistics support personnel. I am not sure that the member for Reid in his speech gave the government the credit which it deserves, but let us be under no misapprehension that the amendments that are included in this legislation are comprehensive and of substantial benefit to a very large number of veterans. In fact, as a result of this particular legislation, 10,500 veterans, at a cost of $19.4 million over four years, will become eligible for compensation for injuries or diseases resulting from their service in the Australian Defence Force. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to continue my remarks at a later time today.",65

31,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Technology. I refer to the minister's statement yesterday, 'I did not wrongly claim. I was not wrongly paid.' Minister, can you assure the House that under every one of your 213 travel allowance claims, in particular those for Canberra and Melbourne, was completely above board? Minister, will you also provide the House with a list of the days and destinations drawn from the hat by your staff that resulted in your $9,000 repayment?",66
32,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes and yes, but it does give me the opportunity to answer some of your slurs by innuendo which you have been running around the place. The simple story is this, and it is perfectly straightforward: after the tabling in May of the travel allowances for ministers between March 1996 and March 1997, I was severely criticised in the media. I decided to take action so that I would not again be the focus or subject of such criticism. Mr Crean-Well, that worked!",66
33,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are not really interested, are you? Mr Crean-I am. I am real interested.",67
34,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Good, but you are not interested in the facts or the I decided to repay nine nights on the basis of the material before me, which was that tabled on 29 May, believing that I would have a high travel allowance again in the financial year 30 June 1996 to 1 July 1997. When I was notified in late July that, notwithstanding this repayment of approximately $3,000, had a travel allowance of some $42,000, I decided to again repay, refund, to the taxpayer, to public funds, that which I was perfectly entitled to. Consequently, I decided to reduce my entitlement, my perfectly legally claimed and paid entitlement, by some 20 per cent. So I simply wiped off the months of April and May, all nights there-Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and country Victoria. I simply wiped off two months-including two weeks of parliament, I might say. Mr Crean-Which two months?",67
35,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The last parliamentary sitting week of March, all of April, all of May. So it was a perfectly reasonable judgment for me to make. For that reason there is no need to apologise in the slightest for repaying claims that were correctly made, are verifiable, and for that reason I think the behaviour of the member for Hotham in the last day or so, however predictable, is able. I will formally table the locations and amounts of the repaid travel allowances, ing on Monday, 24 March and concluding on Sunday, 25 May. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, could. you clarify whether there is still a problem with the sound system after yesterday?",67
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Pardon? Mr Tim Fischer-My case rests. Could' you clarify whether there is a problem still with the sound system after yesterday?,67
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy PriniMinister. Notwithstanding my immediate response, I am advised that the rectifications that we expected have been done but that there is some inconsistency in our expectation and we may continue to have some difficulties. They are technical by nature and the resolution of the problem may take some little time, but we will certainly work on it with great speed over the next. day before we sit truth. On 3 June again next week. Trade: New Zealand",67
38,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister for Trade. I ask the minister: will he inform the House about the outcomes of .the I still Australia-New Zealand Trade Ministers meeting which was concluded today? .,67
39,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for, MCPherson for his timely question, as I have just completed over four hours of formal dialogue with my counterpart Dr Lockwood Smith from New Zealand in the last 24 hours and, in addition to that, a working dinner and today a working lunch with my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson. It reflects the spirit of the CER that they were constructive talks, underlying the need to further expand the CER agenda to complete those outstanding aspects which are starting to fall in the too-hard basket. But' a great deal of progress has been made over the years by successive governments. '' Firstly, I can announce that both of us; now believe that we will get in place the TTMRA legislation amendments and regulations quickly, which will allow further harmonisa despiction of trade between Australia and New Zealand. Secondly, we are committed to finestarttune and make uniform the food risk list which allows for mutual recognition of inspection by New Zealand and Australian relevant authorities in respect of highÂ· value food product agreed for export between Ollr two countries. Thirdly, we are committed to a series of initiatives associated with the 15th anniversary year of CER. "", The outcome of all of this is very good news. The two-way trade between Australia and New Zealand this financial year is set to break a new record, a new milestone, of $10 billion. That reflects a lot of jobs. We are in surplus. It was Doug Anthony many years ago who set the pace in the fonnation of the CER. The coalition has returned to this task in further expanding CER and we are making great headway in that regard. Lastly, we also committed to further explore linkages between CER, AFTA-the ASEAN Free Trade Association-and the Mercosur group of countries. Mercosur is the group which is developing a great deal of momentum in South America and includes Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil, and on the cusp of that Chile, Bolivia and Peru. I am pleased that Senator David Brownhill, my parliamentary secretary, will be travelling to an APEC meeting in Santiago, Chile, on the business of government next week. All in all it was a very constructive dialogue. It will further underpin the development of jobs on both sides of the Tasman. It is an absolute case of a win-win outcome for trade liberalisation between Australia and New Zealand and we look forward to the 15th anniversary year of CER when more progress will be made. Minister for Science and Technology: Travelling Allowance",67
40,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Science and Technology. I refer to his earlier answer and his statement yesterAustralian day, and again I quote, 'I did not wrongly claim. I was not wrongly paid.' Can the minister confinn that on 16 July 1996 he chartered a flight from West Sale to Canberra and back at a cost of $1,600? Can he also confinn that he claimed $145 travel allowance for being in Canberra the night before and a $320 travel anowance for being in Melbourne on the day of the West Sale charter? Minister, did you claim for Canberra and Melbourne when you had actually spent those nights at home, and if you were in Canberra and then in Melbourne why didn't you just take a commercial flight?",68
41,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will check my records and provide the member with an answer. Information Technology: Outsourcing,68
42,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister infonn the House how the government will use the outsourcing of its information technology requirements to promote and develop the Australian information technology industry?,68
43,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. In the near future the government will be releasing a draft request for tender document for the first cluster of government agencies' information technology outsourcing. As part of the tender process, the government will require vendors to propose and to commit contractually to industry development initiatives. We will be using our purchasing power and the size of our business to support the growth and development of the Australian technology and telecommunications industries, to promote the international competitiveness of those industries and to create growth, employment and development in regional Australia. Australia's IT and T industries are vital to the economic development of this country because of their growth potential and their potential to contribute to the competitiveness of businesses in all other areas of the economy. At present the Australian IT and T industries are focused on a domestic market that is small in global tenns. There is a need to build on the inherent strengths of the industry. Those strengths include a number of innovative local finns, particularly small and medium enterprises, and also a considerable skills base in the software area. The government wishes to develop this local industry to ensure that it is successful regionally and in global markets. The aggregation of the Commonwealth agencies' IT and T requirements into clusters will deliver a series of large long-tenn contracts to the private sector. The Commonwealth will require from successful tenderers a series of commitments that are commercially sensible and sustainable and that contribute to the growth and the globalisation of the Australian IT and T industries. Tenders will not be accepted from multinational companies alone. Multinationals will be required to partnership with Australian small and medium enterprises, Australian small and medium IT companies. The partnerships will be required to show what other Australian and international business will be conducted by those partnerships, and the tenderers must also show what Australian products and services will be used in the delivery of the contract and what jobs will be created, particularly in regional Australia. In short, we want jobs, particularly in regional Australia, and we want exports. We are getting the government out of non-core business and we are building the industry. We will be seeking from tenderers what commitments they will make to industry development and what sanctions they will propose if they fail to honour those commitments. The government's decision to outsource its information technology requirements and our commitment to using the size of the business to promote industry development presents a considerable opportunity for the Australian IT and T industry. Minister for Science and Technology: Travelling Allowance",68
44,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Science and Technology. I refer to his first answer and his statement of yesterIn day in which he said, 'I did not wrongly claim. I was not wrongly paid.' Can the minister confirm that on 15 March 1996 he chartered a flight from West Sale to Black Mountain and back at a cost of $1 ,OOO? Can he also confirm that, according to his travel allowance, he spent the nights of 14 and 15 March in Melbourne? Now we know he has repaid those but still claims he did not do anything wrong, can he explain how he can be in two places at once?",69
45,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, I will take that on notice and provide an answer, but I can assure the honourable member for Hotham that, again, his continual slurs against my name will be answered. Schools: Jobs Pathway Program Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister tell the House how many schools have extended their role to become employment agencies for their students under the government's highly successful jobs pathway program? Can the minister tell the House how many of these schools are in New South Wales?",69
46,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. There is no doubt that schools and parents want to help their young people get jobs. For a year now I have been suggesting that schools should extend their role to become job placement agencies for their school leavers to help them get employment. Today I am delighted to announce that, under the government's jobs pathway program, 73 schools have successfully tendered to provide employment placement and support for their school leavers both as individual brokers and as members of consortia. The schools, of course, receive extra money to do this job. In the first tender round last year members may remember that only two schools tendered successfully. Those schools had over 100 per cent success rates and I am pleased to say both of those schools have successfully tendered again. They have been joined by 71 other schools in this important development. addition, 50 other agencies have successfully tendered to provide services to school leavers. In all, this program will assist over 10,000 school leavers to get jobs in the coming year and encourage another 10,000 students to remain on at school and build up their skills. Over 1,100 schools, almost half of the high schools in Australia, will be able to participate. The revolution in schooling in Australia is now under way and there is no turning back. In fact, I believe Australian schools are school leavers. There is only one disappointing feature of this tender round. Of the 73 schools that successfully tendered, only one was in New South Wales. The reason why there was only one school that successfully tendered as a broker in New South Wales is that the New South Wales Carr Labor government banned its schools from tendering. The Carr government told New South Wales school principals that they must not tender for a Commonwealth program designed to get schoolleavers jobs. Schools in every other state and territory were permitted by their governments to tender. . The fact is that the Carr government capitulated to the unions in that state on the issue of employment of school leavers, just as it has on literacy, just as it has on school reporting and just as it has on school reform generally. I believe that government will be condemned by every parent in New South Wales for its arrogant disregard of the interests of school leavers in that state. Their behaviour is disgraceful. I would say that the Carr government, with this sort of decision, is not fit for public office. It is playing politics the lives of young people in New South Wales and parents will make their views known about this government at the next election. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to say whether he will raise this matter with the Carr government, whether he will stand up for . the rights of young people in New South Wales to get assistance to get employment when they leave school or whether, as on literacy, he will sit back and do nothing, offer no leadership and confirm, once again, that the Labor Party has no commitment to getting jobs for young Australians. Minister for Science and Technology: Travelling Allowance",69
47,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Science and Technology. It refers to his first answer and to his statement yesterday in which he said, 'I did not wrongly claim. I was not wrongly paid.' Can the minister confirm that on 5 August 1996 he chartered a flight from the La Trobe Valley to Buchan and back at a cost of $760? Can the minister also confirm that he claimed $320 travel allowance that day for being in Melbourne? Again, Minister, I ask: how can .you be in two places at once?",70
48,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously I cannot recall, any more than you could, off the top of my head the events of a year or so ago. I am happy to provide this information and get back to the honourable member. But my recordsMr Crean-Today?",70
49,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Most certainly today. My records are good. We have a good system in my office and I would believe that those trips were where I drove to the electorate, fulfilled electorate and ministerial duties and then returned to Melbourne. Migration: Skills Category",70
50,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The government has moved to restore a proper balance between the family and skilled streams of the immigration program. Could the minister inform the House with what is being done to. ensure Australia gains the maximum benefit from the skilled categories?,70
51,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Of course, the skilled category was one that had been marginalised under the former government. When we came to office I think less than 30 per cent of available places were in the skilled program. We have been moving to address that very considerable problem that we inherited. It was a result of, I think, deliberate policy that we saw a very significant increase in the number of people who were applying for skilled migration to Australia, and an unwillingness to process them expeditiously and appropriately. We saw the maintenance of low pass marks for those who were applying in the late 1990s. Low pass marks were maintained over most of that period and, of course, with a low level of skill people were able to enter Australia but they were not necessarily able to contribute significantly to the growth of our economy. We saw a situation as well where the former government set up a priority occupation list which was designed, I think, to ensure that those people who were coming were more likely to have skills that were going to be beneficial to Australia. But in their latter years no particular occupations were nominated for that priority occupation list. We have been actively addressing this question. We have increased emphasis on English. language ability in the points testing arrangements. That is important because research has shown that English language skills are one of the most important factors in obtaining employment in Australia. In other words, if people come without English language skills they are more likely to be unemployed after arrival than able to find employment. I will shortly be finalising an external reference group that will be assisting my department in relation to a review of the points test system. What we know of the points test system is that it is not sufficiently well targeted to ensure that people who do enter Australia with recognised skills-with English language competency-at an appropriately young age are necessarily going to be able to obtain employment when they arrive. We have situations, which are well known around Sydney, where very highly qualified people are often forced to drive taxis because the skills that they have are not in occupations where they can be readily used. So we do want to see the points test more carefully targeted. We do want to see that those people who will come to Australia and who will not be eligible to obtain social security benefits are not misled into believing that if they are able to access Australia through a points system that is drawn in general terms and not able to get benefits they have been let down in some way. In this review we are looking to see whether there are other steps that should be taken to more carefully target skills to produce the national benefit. This will supplement the other initiatives that I have already announced and dealt with: the review of the employer nomination scheme, which has made it more responsive to the need of Australian employers, the skill matching scheme for employers in regional areas to assist them in filling vacancies that cannot be filled locally and, of course, the active promotion, which we are involved in, of the regional sponsored migration scheme so that employers outside major capitals can get the skills that they need to keep their businesses running. A skills program which is carefully targeted benefits Australia greatly. We are about ensuring that the program that we are managing delivers those results for Australia. Minister for Science and Technology: Travelling Allowance",70
52,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Minister, in view of your offers to release information to the House and the member for Hotham, will you now release to the House all your records for the years 1995 and 1996 of your Comcar records, charter aircraft records, DAS fuel card records and original travel allowance forms?",71
53,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am very happy to answer any queries any member of the opposition wishes to put to me. Veterans: Medication Reviews,71
54,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer to the results of a trial conducted last year which demonstrated that the difficulties many chronically ill veterans experience with their medications could be substantially reduced by a medication review conducted by an accredited pharmacist. When will this medication review service become available to veterans in my electorate of Hinkler?,71
55,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and also acknowledge his great interest in the veteran community not only in his own electorate but more broadly across Australia. I am pleased to inform the member for Hinkler that medication reviews will now be available to at risk veterans in his own electorate. The first pharmacist accredited to provide this service in Australia is, in fact, in Bundaberg in the federal electorate of Hinkler. She was signed up only yesterday. I am sure that when the member goes back to his electorate he is going to be making sure that there is a little bit of publicity about the fact that a pharmacist in his electorate in his own home town is the first accredited in Australia. Veterans identified by their local doctors as being at risk of medication misadventure can be referred to this pharmacist for a comprehensive medication review and, of course, at no cost to the veteran. The review identifies existing and potential problems with the veteran's medication and provides, importantly, ongoing monitoring of the veteran's use of medication. The aim of the program is to ensure that veterans receive the best results they can from the medication that they use. With the administrative arrangements for the program now in place with the department, the department has invited accredited pharmacists to sign a deed of agreement and, in so doing, make the service available to at risk veterans throughout Australia. We know from the trial that was conducted last year that this program can produce outstanding results. In one example, a veteran involved in the trial had his required number of medications reduced from 19 to 14. In his case they were identified as duplication of medication, confusion over some of the medication that he was prescribed to take and othersÂ· counterbalancing some of the drugs that had been prescribed. This is just one program that identifies how this government is encouraging an expanded relationship between the Department of Veterans' Mfairs, doctors, pharmacists and other health care providers in our community. I urge all members of this House to encourage pharmacists in their own electorates to participate in this program because I think we all agree that this nation owes a great deal our veteran community. I would urge you to look at this program and talk to pharmacists in your electorate. It is going to promote better health for the veterans of this nation. And what could be more rewarding than that? Orange Juice: Labelling",71
56,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. Does your government support the concept of labelling that identifies products as 'Made in Australia' as meaning exactly that-made in Australia? If so, why do you allow Brazilian orange juice concentrate mixed with Australian water and packaged in Australia to carry the labelling lie 'Made in Australia'?",72
57,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"By chance, I represent the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs in this House. The particulars of the answer to your question I do not have to hand immediately. I will seek a reply from the relevant minister. It is under review by the government at the moment, however. Trade: Exports",72
58,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister. According to Austrade, in the first six months of 1997 more than 900 companies were assisted into new export activity, over half into the Asia-Pacific region, which is the region of highest foreign and trade policy priority, and several of these were in my electorate of Gilmore. What steps is the government taking to ensure this sort of assistance continues in regional and rural areas?",72
59,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I advise the House, firstly, that Austrade is maintaining a dynamic network throughout regional Australia, including 22 regional trade commissioners, one of those being located nearby at Wollongong in the vicinity of the electorate of Gilmore. Secondly, we are maintaining a dynamic network worldwide, especially in Asia and Europe, as we seek to build our trade and market access, and trade promotional efforts right around the world. Thirdly, we to have, of course, Austrade's export hotline, which is now handling some 4,500 calls per month; and the export advisory and market unit has assisted 640 export-ready companies and marketed 1,100 opportunities from overseas posts to over 6,500 Australian companies in the past six months. So, through her question, the member for Gilmore has, in a timely way, highlighted the further progress that is being made, as a consequence of the activities of Austrade, in furthering our record trade effort. I remind the House that, in the last financial year, there was a $104.4 billion record export effort. That means a lot of jobs here in Australia-345,000 jobs alone attaching to the trade Australia has with Japan, both direct and indirect. I might add one other thing. It is true that Nowra and the Shoalhaven export network is a particularly dynamic zone for real export effort, expanded export effort, and a lot of that involves small and medium business. I commend the member for her support of those businesses as they go about their exports. And I remind the House that, under the revamped and revitalised export market development grants scheme, there is additional assistance to small business and for the tourism industry of which the government is mightily proud. Travelling Allowance",72
60,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development's claim that he had not attempted to acquit his TA claims until January this year, some 10 months after he became a minister, and then with a heavy cold. Prime Minister, isn't this excuse factually incorrect? Weren't 60 per cent of all the former minister's false TA claims actually lodged with DAS in June 1996? Prime Minister, will you now table copies of these claims?",73
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will have to look at that. I will have to look at it because I cannot recollect, without looking at the documentation, in a way that will enable me to precisely answer the honourable gentleman's question. I will look at it, and I will come back to the House. Mr Crean-Today?",73
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If that is appropriate, yes. If it is not, it will be next week. Papua New Guinea: Drought",73
63,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and relates to the serious drought and consequent human hardship in our neighbour Papua New Guinea. I ask: is the minister aware of reports this morning that the Australian assistance being delivered by RAAF flights is being confined to areas close to the Australian owned Ok Tedi mine? Is the minister further aware of calls by the group Aidwatch for Australian companies operating in Papua New Guinea to contribute to the drought relief efforts? Can the minister advise the House whether these reports are accurate and of what Australia is doing to reduce the effects of the drought in Papua New Guinea?,73
64,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question. As I said yesterday, I recognise that many members of the House are very interested in, and concerned about, the drought situation in Papua New Guinea. In relation to the points the honourable member raises, first of all, the reports, which have been drawn to my attention, which were run on the ABC this morning are in fact misleading. It is true that the Royal Australian Air Force has been ferrying much needed supplies to affected areas of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, but I emphasise that these are areas very much in need-not because the Ok Tedi mine just happens to be in the Western Province. This Australian cooperation, let me add, was requested by Papua New Guinea's Minister for Provincial and Local Government Affairs. So to say or suggest that the Australian government is somehow focusing on the area around the Ok Tedi mine because of some sinister relationship between the Australian government and the Ok Tedi mine is, frankly, completely misleading. Â·It is also not true that the Royal Australian Air Force is only bringing supplies to the township of Tabubil where the Ok Tedi mine is located. Today, the RAAF will deliver essential medical supplies, food and fuel to Kiunga, a township some distance from Ok Tedi-I understand about 100 kilometres away-in Western Province. Essential supplies will be delivered to enable schools and aid posts to remain open. Australia's High Commissioner to Port Moresby will today visit the drought affected areas on this RAAF flight. In addition, an officer of Emergency Management Australia is now in Port Moresby to assist the national disaster emergency service with coordination and development of action plans. It is essential that our aid help, not hinder, Papua New Guinea's capacity to cope now and in the future. In relation to the second point the honourable member raises about the private sector giving assistance, I am aware that a number of companies, including BHP, have taken action to provide logistical support. I understand that this includes release of senior management personnel to assist PNG's own disaster coordination efforts. Also, our Australian High Commission in Port Moresby has already arranged to meet representatives of the Australian business community in Port Moresby on Monday to ensure that there is a clear information flow about the situation and the activities of the companies and the Australian government in PNG. I add one other thing in conclusion and it relates to the forest fires and consequent smoke haze problems that are occurring in South-East Asia. I have instructed our ambassador in Jakarta to make a detailed assessment of the situation and report on the kinds of assistance required by the Indonesian government that Australia could deliver. Having undertaken that task, we will then respond with appropriate assistance to the Indonesian government to help deal with this extremely difficult problem which is afflicting people throughout South-East Asia. Travelling Allowance",73
65,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Minister for Administrative Services. Minister, are you aware of any irregularities in the travel allowance claims by staff of the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development? If not, will you inquire into the matter and report back to the House?",74
66,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not aware of any such matters. The first mention I have heard of them is from the honourable member. I will certainly ask the department to advise me on the matter and will report back to the House at an appropriate time. Mr Crean-Today?,74
67,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,At an appropriate time. Small Business,74
68,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. As the minister would be aware, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released its business expectations survey this morning. Would the minister outline to the House that which the survey reveals about the outlook for the small business sector in this country? Is this the same small business sector that over the previous 13 years Labor used, abused and all but destroyed not only in the Hunter but all over Australia? Mr Martin-Did you write that question?",74
69,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I did not write that I certainly did not write that last bit-but what an excellent question it was. What an excellent point the member makes. I do a lot of breakfasts, lunches and dinners with people in the small business community and they talk to me about interest rates. When you look at interest rates today, you will see that they are as low as they were when man walked on the moon. What a tremendous turnaround we have seen with better economic management under this government. It was only five or six years ago that the small business community in Australia had interest rates of 22 per cent, 23 per cent and 24 per cent. It is no wonder so many small businesses even today are doing it tough as a result of the legacy of the Labor government. Small business should never forget that it was the previous Labor government that introduced taxes, red tape, the burdens and the unfair dismissal laws which have been such a major problem to small business. I thank the member for his excellent question. He is right: the ABS put out some figures today. Whilst some small businesses are doing it tough, it is also important to say to small business that there are a few bright signs on the horizon, that there are a few positives out there. I am a great believer in saying that a bit of confidence is very good for encouraging confidence generally in the small business community. The other day we saw in the WestpacMelbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment that confidence was up 4.2 per cent in September, which is good news for small business because consumers are feeling better. We also have had this survey on expectations, and it is quite important because if you look at the ABS you see it says that this means that the results can be used indicatively in terms of expected future levels of economic activity and for providing early signals about turning points in the economy. So it does give you a bit of a feeling for where the economy is going. There are some very useful signs in this figure. For example, if you look at trading performance and the medium-term expectations of sales, you see a figure of 4.4 per cent for profits for small business, which is up. You will see the figure of 22.9 per cent, which is a very encouraging figure-a real push-along on the profits side. If you look at profits again, you see that it is described somewhere in the document as a fairly significant increase. This survey is based on 3,000 representative Australian businesses. It tells you that there is a growing confidence within the small business community. That is good for everybody. It is certainly good for small business and it is certainly good for job prospects in the future. Travelling Allowance",74
70,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and relates to the Auditor-General's inquiry. In order to assist the Auditor-General in assessing whether the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development's wrongful claims for nearly a third of his TA in 1996 were in fact a mistake, will you amend his terms of reference to enable him to scrutinise Mr Sharp's TA claims for 1994-95 when he in fact made more claims, including for Sundays and Thursdays, than he did originally in 1996?",75
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought the terms of reference were adequate and that, if the Auditor-General thinks that in some way the terms of reference are constraining his investigation, he will ask me to expand them. I am not going to initiate at this stage an expansion. The whole process that we have embarked upon has an unprecedented transparency compared with the sorts of processes that you lot adopted. The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is that, if the Auditor-General, in whom I would hope members on both sides of the House have great confidence, believes that the terms of reference in some way constrain a proper investigation of the matter, I have little doubt that h-, like other interlocutors appointed by governments of all persuasions at a state and federal level over the years, will come back and ask for an expansion of those terms of reference. That is the answer to the first part of the Leader of the Opposition's question. The second part of the Leader of the Opposition's question, when he alleged-I must do him justice-that expenses in one year were higher than in another, reminds me of a piece of information that came to my attention this morning. That piece of information says that in the financial year 1996-97my government's first full year in office-the total expenditure on travel related expenses for ministers and parliamentary secretaries was $812,829 less than the Keating Labor government's expenditure in 1994-95. Can I say that it gets a little better. This is all meant to be about a prudent use of the taxpayer's money. This is all meant to be about whether you have overspent the dollars of the Australian ,taxpayer. That is what this is all meant to represent. I suppose that is hardly surprising, given the attitude to travel allowances adopted by the man whose name was left behind on the last Labor government in this country. Might I say that the comparison that I have just mentioned to the House represents a saving of 14 per cent in relation to the travel related expenses for ministers and parliamentary secretaries, and I have also been informed that the travel bill for the Keating government's last eight months in office was even higher than my government's first full financial year. In eight months they spent $100,000 more than in my government's first full financial year on travel related expenses for ministers and parliamentary secretaries. To use the old expression, they not only have the largest snouts but built the trough. Tariffs: Sugar",75
72,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, is it true that very little sugar is imported into Australia? Is it also true that the price of sugar on the domestic market is dictated by the price set by the Queensland Sugar Corporation? Is the member for Burke cruelly misleading cane growers when he says maintenance of the tariff will be of benefit to them?",75
73,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say at the outset that, if there is one thing to be said about the member for Page, it is that he understands the sugar industry a great deal better than the shadow minister for primary industries. Somebody said, 'That's not hard.' The member for Page is absolutely right. The customs duty on imports of sugar last year was about 700 bucks. That is how much came in. Almost nothing; it was almost negligible. A little over $700 is all it was. Almost no sugar came in last year. And he is absolutely right. The retention of the tariff would not yield returns to Australian producers because the price is established by the Queensland Sugar Corporation. The member for Burke, who in this instance can be described only as a cheapjack opportunist, really needs to be confronted with a very simple reality, and that is that no-one in this place and no-one outside believes anything other than, as the Financial Review in its editorial pointed out, had the Labor Party retained government, they would have abolished the tariff. That is the reality. It is as simple as that. Why? Because they set up the competition policy-which they said was going to be the great saviour of Australian jobs and of rural and regional Australia-under which the review was conducted and under which this recommendation was made. So they are a bunch of total and absolute hypocrites on this issue, as well as being people who do not understand the sugar industry. They miss out on both. It is quite simple. They have walked away from virtually everything they said they believed in in government, and now they have walked away from competition policy as well. They have walked away from that mainstay of their commitment to economic reform in this country. We are the people who are securing the future for rural Australia. It is this side of the House that is securing the future for sugar farmers and for the rest of the nation's farmers. It is we who tackle this nation's major problems in terms of interest rates and an overvalued dollar. ABARE's research shows that that is delivering far more tangible benefits for the sugar industry than anything that you delivered or might deliver. You take them back the other way. And it is not only that; it is packages like the AAA package which the Prime Minister and I recently launched. That has been universally recognised in rural Australia as being focused, well targeted and the best thought out policy approach for rural Australia for decades. It is we who are providing such important programs as a communications upgrade approach for rural Australia. The final point that I cannot help makingit is a vitally important one-is that the sugar industry is an export industry, and it is this side that is tackling waterfront reform. You are the people who are identifying with those who want to block it. You want to look after the privileged few at the expense of Australia's exporters, including our sugar exporters and the jobs that depend on them. The best my opposite number can come up with: he was out on my local radio station the other day giving his imprimatur to a report from somewhere the other day that says that what farmers ought to do is diversify intowait for this-insect breeding to cash in on growing demand for bush tucker! Australian Defence Force",76
74,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence. Is the minister aware of a report today that the Ombudsman has criticised the Australian Defence Force for using informal inquiries without guidance or accountability mechanisms, leading to some investigations going 'off the rails' and 'perceptions that complaints were being swept under the carpet'? Is the minister aware that the Chief of the Defence Force, General Baker, has agreed with those conclusions, which relate to inquiries conducted in the last 12 months? Minister, in light of your failure to act, which has now led to the Black Hawk inquiry being badly undermined, will you take immediate action to implement proper guidance and accountability mechanisms?",76
75,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have already taken that action. The Ombudsman's media release yesterday dealt with her annual report. That report substantially covered her own investigation into the way the ADF investigates serious matters, and they are being investigated. I might say that I am glad that the honourable member mentioned the subject of the Black Hawk inquiry, because, as I said yesterday, both he and the Leader of the Opposition have acted with total impropriety in this matter. I think that the Leader of the Opposition probably knows that. But they have been out making recommendations publicly about interfering with the legal military processes, and you know and he knows that your interference and suggestions of interference are totally improper. A little later in the day during the MPI I will read out those transgressions. I will you that they are the worse that I have seen, because you know better. What is more, in the process you have criticised the military leaders of this country and are undermining the process yourself.",77
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Saudi Arabia: Murder of Australian",77
77,Mr DOWNER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I wonder if I could add to an answer I gave to a question yesterday? Mr Martin Ferguson-This is the first of many.,77
78,Mr DOWNER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I am sure you will be very excited about this one, Martin. I want to add some facts to a question I answered yesterday about the case of the murder of Yvonne Gilford in Saudi Arabia. Yesterday in response to a question concerning the murder of Yvonne Gilford I advised the House that further court hearings in Saudi Arabia would be held on 17 October. I am now advised that the date of next court hearings in Saudi Arabia will be 4 October. NA Member for Hotham",77
79,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I rise on standing order 75. Page 8151 of the Hansard of 23 September records remarks made by the member for Hotham which were directed at me and which are clearly offensive. The member was named for his subsequent behaviour and ejected from the parliament before withdrawing the remarks which were offensive to me. I now request that he withdraw those remarks.,77
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As I was not in the chamber at the time and cannot verify the information, I invite the honourable member for Hotham to reflect on the occasion and if necessary take the appropriate action. Otherwise, I will investigate it and report back to the House further. Mr Crean-If I can just say, Mr Speaker, tell if the member took offence, I apologise.",77
81,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The appropriate format for that is for the member to unconditionally withdraw.,77
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for O'Connor. The honourable member for Hotham has made a gracious apology. I equate an apology to an unreserved withdrawal. News Clipping Service  occasions I have asked you whether or not it Citizen would be possible to institute a wider clipping service for the House of Representatives than currently operates. Could I ask that you apprise the House of the latest situation.,77
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Chifley. I know this is an item of considerable concern to you. We have been making reasonable economies in the efficiencies relating to running of the various departments on the Hill. It is something that we have continuously under review, and when I am in a position to advise the House of any improvement in your prospects I will return to the issue. Staff Cafeteria",77
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On 24 September the member for Moore asked me some questions relating to recent price increases in the staff cafeteria. The questions asked by the honourable member were covered in an information circular distributed by the Joint House Department on 15 September. The circular advised that under the terms of the catering contract food and beverage prices are set on a commercial basis as determined by the contractor. It expected that prices will be competitive with retail base establishments in the ACT. This is this first across-the-board price increase applied since the contract started in January 1996. Since then this contractor has absorbed increases in both labour rates and in suppliers' prices. Information has been provided on a commercial-in-confidence basis of its trading statements for the staff cafeteria which demonstrate that the previous pricing structure was not covering the costs of the operation. The prices now being charged are within the range but towards the upper end of the scale of prices being charged at cafeterias in other Commonwealth buildings. On his own volition, on 15 September the senior manager in the Joint House Department responsible for the catering contract wrote to the managing director of the catering company expressing concern at the lack of notice of the price increases, the magnitude of the increase and seeking discussions on future practices. This meeting is yet to be held. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",78

87,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The desperately low morale in the Australian Defence Force caused by the Minister for Defence's failure to provide leadership. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",78
88,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is theÂ· first matter of public importance this House has dealt with on defence since 1988. Nearly a decade has gone without the requirement of the House to consider a matter of this sort. The reason it is before the parliament today after a decade is that the morale within the services has reached a stage where it threatens capability. It has reached that low stage not just because of the incompetence of the last month but because over a period of some 18 months we have seen a series of slipshod decision making by the ministers responsible without any plan and without any guide. It has been a process of slipshod decision making that has also seen some 7,000 or 8,000 military jobs tagged to go, with another 5,000 to 6,000 civilian jobs identified to goall of this being done without any concept of Australia's defence needs. If you were to be serious in any endeavour as Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), or for that matter in any serious endeavour of any kind, you would set about establishing a few goals, what you are about; and, having clearly identified those and having made sure everyone understood them, you might then go about establishing a plan of action and involve people in that. Then you would set about making a few decisions to implement the plan. But here we have a minister and a government that have actually reversed that process. For 18 months there has been a series of decisions, starting with the abolition of the ready reserve, the establishment of the defence efficiency review, the defence review program and the carving up of thousands of jobs out of the Defence Force. All of that has been done as a string of uncoordinated, unconnected decisions. Having done a whole host of those, this government sat down and said, 'We had better have a plan.' So they cobbled a few of those together to make them into a plan, and some time later this year they are going to give us the goals. Some time later this year the minister is actually going to tell the people of Australia what his and this government's strategic analysis of Australia's needs is. The thing that should have been done first has been put on the tail end. Everyone in the defence forces, and I might say a heck of a lot of people in the region who take some interest in Australian defence matters, have observed this malaise, and the people in the defence forces are bearing the brunt of it. They are the ones who are actually walking out the door. And it is not just the thousands of people who are having their heads lopped off; there are good career service officers, men and women, who are leaving early because they are disgusted with th- way in which this government has operated its defence policy. Let me tum to the events of the last month. If time permits, I will go back to the longer litany of the errors that have occurred prior to that. Over the course of the last month, what we have seen is a sad and regrettable lack of leadership which has turned what was a terrible tragedy into farce. I think that was probably best encapsulated by the Canberra Times this Monday with a front page headline which says 'Army in Turmoil over Black Hawk Inquiry'. That is not a happy headline and it is not a happy story for the Australian Defence Force. The fact that it makes the banner front page headline of the national capital paper is some indication of the depth of feeling not just of people in the community broadly but of people in the defence community as well. That headline is simply the latest in a string of catastrophes that this minister and this government have been a party to. We go back to earlier this month when the Black Hawk tragedy became news again in rather sad circumstances. We had the disclosure in the Canberra Times on 5 September with the headline 'Black Hawk Tragedy: Army was Warned'. It is worth recounting what that article drew to the attention of the public. It said: The army officer who headed an inquiry into the Black Hawk helicopter disaster which claimed 18 lives, Brigadier Paul O'Sullivan, was sent a report highlighting deficiencies exposed by the tragedy three months before it took place. And what did that report that Brigadier O'Sullivan actually say? The Canberra Times managed to get a copy of it, which in itself is an indication of the level of morale loss and discontent within the services. That document said this, amongst other things: Proficiency in operational tasking has suffered, in particular formation flying, airborne operations and support to special forces operations. It identified a potential problem. I do not advocate that the events of that tragedy should be gone back into or that the inquiry should be reopened. Mr MCLachlan-What are you advocating?",78
89,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you listen and if you read what I said, you would have a better idea of it. What I have called for, and what I am now urging you to do, is for you as minister to take some responsibility for the process, because the process has now been called into question not just by me or someone else in this place but by everyone in the street and everyone in uniform. The simple fact of life is this: when issues like that arise ordinary people say, 'Hold on, isn't there a conflict of interest here?' If the person who was heading up the inquiry happened to be the officer who got a report three months before the tragedy that said, 'Hey, we have got troubles here and we cannot exercise like we want to with the special forces,' wouldn't you think that there may be some cause for concern about conflict of interest in the subsequent considerations of that inquiry? The minister did nothing about that. He sat there for a week and did nothing. If the minister cannot see that he has a role in that or that there is a built-up problem in the defence forces, where everyone in the defence forces had their morale stripped from them in the course of the last couple of months, thankfully someone in the defence forces did. His failure to act was not replicated by the Defence Headquarters. The Chief of the Defence Force actually set up an inquiry to look into the way in which that original board of inquiry was conducted. That is not going back and looking over all the evidence necessarily or getting any witnesses. They should not do any of that. But it was to re-establish some confidence in the process, some integrity in the process. The minister did none of it. He sat on his hands and the Chief of the Defence Force had to act, and we see the references to that in the media. All this, I must say, has been done by press release. There has been no statement to the parliament; there has been no accountability to the parliament. This has all been by press release from Defence Headquarters, from the Chief of the Defence Force, not from the minister, who should have responsibility for it. The Australian newspaper carried an article at that time saying: A federal judge has been appointed to investigate the conduct of an army board of inquiry into the Black Hawk collision amid allegations of a conflict of interest and controversy over charges against three officers for their part in the tragedy. The Australian got it dead right. And it was as much that concern over conflict of interest as anything else that led to the need for the issues to be cleaned up, for integrity to be restored and for confidence to be restored. The Chief of the Defence Force acted to do it; the minister didn't. The minister should have. The sad part about it is that I think the Chief of the Defence Force got it wrong technically. A couple of days later we find ourselves in a situation where the person appointed to undertake that review, Justice Rowlands, had to be removed from that position. Again, who did that? Not the minister but the Chief of the Defence Force. How did he do it? There was no accountability to the parliament. A press release from Defence News that simply says: 'Defence Chief announces Black Hawk Change'. Mr MCLachlan-Why don't you read it out?",79
90,Mr BEVI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You use your 15 minutes to read it out. The simple fact is that the Chief of the Defence Force had to act to clean up a problem that he should never have been placed in a position of dealing with and the reason, of course, why Justice Rowlands was not able to serve is no reflection on Justice Rowlands as a person. It is a conflict between the role of a serving judge and the requirements of the executive government. There are a number of rulings about that matter that call into question his capacity to undertake the inquiry that he was asked to do by the Chief of the Defence Force while he was a serving justice. In all of this, the minister has gone missing in action. He should have been front and centre doing these things. The minister's response throughout this has been to say that I and the opposition have been mischiefmaking and that really his hands are tied. His authority for that is an Australian Government Solicitor advice of 1 September 1997 dealing with the question of Black Hawk discipline. That very advice, which the minister relies on, also points out that he does have the authority to deal precisely with the questions that I am now raising-the questions of the manner in which the inquiry is conducted. That advice says: While it is appropriate for the minister to satisfy himself that the required procedures under the Defence Force Discipline Act are being properly followed ... it would not be appropriate for him to influence the outcome on a particular matter. What I am now saying very clearly to the minister is that you have a responsibility, and it is set out there in your own legal advice, to satisfy yourself that the required procedures are being followed. The Chief of the Defence Force understood that matter had been brought into question and he took a decision that it needed to be acted upon. You should have done that, and you did not, and your failure has contributed to the slide in confidence that exists within the Defence Force at the moment. The other thing I will just comment on in passing is that the Defence Force Disciplinary Act, which this whole legal advice is all about, is not actually the act that the board of inquiry was established under anyway. The head of power for the board of inquiry is not the Defence Force Disciplinary Act at all, so you can throw that away-forget it. The head of power for the board of inquiry is the Defence Act, and the minister has an absolute responsibility to do a couple of things. He has an absolute responsibility to make sure the act sets out precisely what the government of the day and the people expect of its Defence Force-No.1, first and foremost-and secondly, having assured himself of that, he has got an obligation to make certain that it is properly followed and mented. He has done neither. The simple fact of life is that over the course of the last year the minister has had warning of these problems-this is not something that just lobbed three or four weeks ago with that first article I mentioned. The minister would be well aware of recent precedents last year involving defence disciplinary action in the United Kingdom and in Canada where disciplinary acts under the military legislation have been overturned. In the case of a UK sergeant, the European Court on Human Rights overturned disciplinary action and called into question the entire basis upon which the UK military disciplinary procedures operated. That is known by people here. I am sure he has received advice about it. The alarm bells should have rung-'Hello, here's the wake-up call. There's a problem. We'd better actually have a look at our own procedures because there are some parallels between our legislation and our procedures in Defence and what the UK people do.' But so far, nothing. So far we leave the Chief of the Defence Force to dangle out there and we leave the ordinary troops to bear the brunt of the pain of reform while they feel themselves not only leaderless but also increasingly betrayed. That is a terrible position for them to be in and, make no mistake, that is precisely the feeling they have. Anyone who wants to debate that should spend a day roaming around talking to people on base. Don't talk, listen. If you do that, you might in fact get a few shocks about the attitude that those people have. The other warning signal that this government got but it seemed to sleep through was the report tabled last year by the Defence Judge Advocate General, who just happened to be last year the same Justice Rowlands I referred to a moment ago. In his annual report last year, he said: If the ADF is to continue for good reason to conduct its own legal proceedings in serious cases, it appears to me that the case for professional military judges with appropriate independence from command is unanswerable. That was the warning last year and we seem implenot to have taken any notice of it. This government and this minister, having got that advice in the annual report from the Judge Advocate ignores it, goes ahead and falls into the very problem the Judge Advocate says you have got to look out for. It is time this problem was cleaned up, and if the minister is not willing or able to act on it, the parliament will have to. What we will be doing as an opposition is pursuing the opportunity for a parliamentary committee review of the existing defence legislation and the procedures concerning internal inquiries and disciplinary action. There needs to be a full and open account of what is transpiring that does not just focus-in fact, hopefully, does not focus at all-on the events of the last few weeks but looks at the events of the last year, including what has happened overseas. When the minister gets up and says that he cannot do these things, here is a question he might like to answer: Minister, if it is not possible for you to act in relation to the Black Hawk board of inquiry, why have you acted in relation to a RAAF board of inquiry where, as advised in the Australian only a few days ago: Defence Minister Ian MCLachlan has demanded an independent investigation into the conduct of the RAAF board of inquiry ... What is the difference between that RAAF board of inquiry, which you instructed a review into, and the Black Hawk inquiry, where there is evidence of concern in the community? (Time expired)",80
91,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is interesting that the only public contribution that anybody has noticed in the last 18 months or so from the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) is his recent and constant undermining of senior army officers and the military processes that they have been going through, and it is mostly in regard to the extremely tragic Black Hawk case. I have to say that it is a rather disgusting way of putting politics before propriety. I have told the shadow minister previously that he got it wrong when he constantly advocated publicly a course of events which would interfere with the legal or military legal processes. It is possible that the shadow minister now understands that the first fortnight of his publicly interfering with those processes were wrong, because I noticed that of recent times he has pulled out of it. I am so disappointed in this matter because I was told by the previous Minister for Defence that the shadow minister would be somebody that the nation could trust. When it came to this very important and tragic matter of Black Hawk, I might have to tell him that he was wrong. The shadow minister commented that we did not have a plan. Let us talk for a minute or two about the plan that the Labor Party must have had when they were in office. They had six previous years of defence budgets coming down from 2.7 per cent of GDP to 1.8 per cent, which is the lowest since 1938. Mr Bevis-Not as low as yours.",82
92,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You obviously cannot add up. Numeracy and literacy are the things that you should be chasing up. We have had to quarantine the defence budget for the first three years of government. In the previous five or six years, 16,000 to 20,000 people lost their jobs. You had a separation rate which averaged somewhere in the nature of 10 to 12 per cent. We found when we came to office that the machine guns did not work and that the Navy had a whole lot of hulls but was not fitted with the gear to look after itself. We found that the Army had almost finished a report into itself which contains just about the most scathing self-criticism that I have ever read by any institution anywhere-commercial or government or defence. You are saying that we should have had a plan. Where was your plan for the Army? We put a plan together, we did a review in the last couple of years, we then put the plan together and called it Army into the 21st century. When we looked at the defence efficiency review, the shadow minister's plan also showed IIp a billion dollars worth of waste, duplication or simple lack of efficiency. One billion out of 10. Not a bad effort after 13 years of running the place! A minute ago I mentioned the navy policy of building ships fitted 'for but not with'. I think your defence policy was 'for but not with'. You had a defence shell with no technical ability to produce a decent Defence Force. I might add that that scathing self-criticism which the Army called 'Army 21'Mr Bevis-We initiated it.",82
93,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know you did, but it is a pity you did not initiate it at the beginning instead of the end of 13 years. That document stated: Units not adequately prepared for combat. Army lacks sufficient combat power. It would require substantial warning time and financial expenditure to mobilise for a major conflict. Finally, amidst hundreds of pages of other things, it stated: With some exceptions, reserve units are understaffed, poorly equipped and have a low readiness level. That was your plan, and that is just the Army. We have not been to the other services yet. Let me tum to the real issue that the shadow minister has raised, and that is morale. How can you possibly expect a Defence Force to have super-duper morale in 1997 with a litany of failures like those behind it? That is, budgets coming down, people leaving, an Army with the greatest self-criticism imagi!'table. We have had to try to pick that up. What do we do with it? We make sure that we. have an Army into the 21st century plan. And you know, because you have been around those areas, that if you talk to those task force members today they are extremely enthusiastic. They are getting some gear they were not getting before, and they know there is more coming. We are also building the reserve situation, something which you did not do. If there was one failure that tops the lot, worse than ships fitted for but not with, worse than the fact that the machinery did not work, it is your lack of interest and performance in regard to the reservists in the last 13 years. I had some reservists in yesterday, and they will tell you that at the present time they do not believe they will be anything but a drag upon the regular Army. That does not apply across the board, but it applies enough for us to have to put a major financial effort into get the reserves up to speed. I think that will be the most difficult. It will be more difficult than spending the money on acquisitions or on platforms and so forth. The most difficult thing will be to change the attitude not only to reservists but by reservists, by their employers and so forth. But that is not the major point of this MPI. The shadow minister has raised the matter of the Black Hawk inquiry. I will come to his own efforts in this regard in a minute, but he raised, in particular, that magnificent newspaper the Canberra Times and that irregularly accurate correspondent who works for them. I took the trouble, as I have done all the way through the Black Hawk matter, to get the best legal advice I could as to the proper process. I have made sure that when other people were getting legal advice that I had it checked. That is the reason why-and you did not read this out because you did not consider it worthwhile going this far-in General Baker's press release it states: The Minister has advised me that he has received independent advice from the Chief General Counsel, Mr Burmester, to the effect that the task ... I got the advice, I gave it to General Baker and he changed it. You say that I am inactive. That is a bit of inactivity that actually came home. Let me tell you what the Acting Deputy Government Solicitor says about the very article that you raised which you seem to put so much store by. I put no store by anything that the Canberra Times has written on this matter of recent times. Until such times as the Canberra Times makes its mind up that it is going to report things accurately and in a balanced way, I will be paying no attention to it. The advice I have been given by the Acting Deputy Government Solicitor states: 2. The thrust of the articleand he referred to the articleis that Brigadier Paul O'Sullivan was sent a report highlighting the deficiencies exposed by the tragedy three months before it took place. This is very important. You should take notice of this: Brigadier O'Sullivan was the President of the Board of Inquiry established to report on the accident. The imputation in the article is that Brigadier O'Sullivan had a personal interest in the outcome of the investigation which he ledthat was the imputation in the article that you just supportedthat he was biased and that the recommendations by the Board for disciplinary action were coloured by that bias. 3. I do not think that the Canberra Times article raises any implications adverse to the present disciplinary action. In the first place, I am informed that the report referred to by the Canberra Times was in evidence in the Board of Inquiry . . . That is a fact you know. It continued: There was no attempt to conceal it. Secondly, the report, while drawing attention to problems or potential problems, recommended a course of action to deal with those problems. Thirdly, Brigadier 0' Sullivan was one of four members of the Board of Inquiry and, even if he had been biased it does not follow that the other three members of the Board were swayed by that bias. 4. Fourthly, and significantly, disciplinary charges under the Defence Force Discipline Act could not be and were not laid on the basis of the report of the Board of Inquiry. Most people knew these things, but you chose last week or even the week before to interfere with those processes. T hat is what I want to come to now. I think the shadow minister's efforts at interfering with the legal processes are one of the worse examples that I have ever seen. When you talk about the possible lack of morale, how could you discourage people more than going down a course which, my guess is, you now know was absolutely improper and the future. without any integrity whatsoever. What you were saying back then was that charges against three junior officers could be counterproductive-that is what you said. I hope you now know that advocating any course regard to those things is quite wrong. 'They should put a halt to this process,' you said, 'an article reports that shadow minister Arch bane. Bevis has repeated his call for the dropping of the charges.' I cannot make-and you know I am at a a disadvantage in this matter-any comment offended the chair. and I will not make any comment about any of those matters. What I am saying to you is that, on any number of occasions, we go to the Attorney-General or the Australian Government Solicitor and we get the advice and we act on it, just as I advised General Baker to act on that advice only several days ago-and we will continue to advice. I suggest that you go along to the Australian Government Solicitor, get some advice AUSMIN. and act on it because, if you did, then you would not be making the mistakes that you have been making out there in the last few weeks. I have to say to you, and I repeat what I said before, that the only actions of the shadow minister that anybody has seen in public over the last 18 months or so been an undermining set of actions which are quite without precedent. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, after advice from me at this box several weeks ago, also went out there and said that I should give under the table in some covert way some quiet advice-I think he called it 'quiet advice' - to my senior military officers that they should do this or that they should do that. Maybe that is the way you did it in government, but that is not that the way we that to try do it in government. We have put in place these processes after copious amounts of advice to the senior military officers, and they have acted entirely properly and with my support. I have also had advice which has backed up the advice that they have had. Therefore, I say to the shadow by minister that he should go and get some advice himself so that he can act properly in Mr Bevis-What about the RAAF inquiry?",82
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)that Order! The member for Brisbane, you have in had your tum. Minister, I would like to suggest that you should address your remarks to the chair and ignore the member for Bris",84
95,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes. I did notice that it happened in reverse, so I thought there was little licence around. I apologise if I have Mr Bevis-I apologise too.",84
96,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let us just have a look at what we had to do when we came into office. The first thing, and I am not saying there was anything particularly wrong with this in the past, was that we had to enhance act on that the US relationshipMr Bevis-Nonsense.",84

100,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The quality of the interjection that the shadow minister for defence was offering was not one that I had to intervene in because the quality was not there. I am sorry if he finds it necessary to keep on intervening. We had to find $125 million per annum of reductions in administrative costs and redirect that in our first year to combat capability, which we have done in regard to FIll projects, FA18 projects, ANZAC, Collins and so forth; we had to restructure the Army, as I mentioned before; we had very successful Tandem Thrust exercises with the US; and, most of important of all, we not only released the defence efficiency review but also acted on the defence efficiency review. I have had many military officers coming up to me and saying, 'You have to get on and do this.' All ranks have been saying, 'There is no alternative while you are dealing with this massive deficit the Labor Party has left you with,' We have had closer defence contact with Japan in recent weeks. We have had most successful plans in putting together lead-in fighters and so forth. I might say in that respect that we have not had any JORN disasters like we have been left withhundreds of millions of wasted taxpayers' money in some extraordinarily badly-administered acquisition programs. I just say in finishing that I have very great regard for the ADF and its officers, its people and its young people. I will continue to help it become the best medium sized defence force that this country can possibly afford. (Time expired)  shadow minister outlined, it is a rare event in this House to have a matter of public importance raised on defence matters, the last being in 1988. Members on both sides of the House understand the seriousness and importance of defence matters. They understand that decisions made by the present government, like decisions made by the former government, are left to be implemented. Defence is an important area with long lead times, where one must reach out for bipartisanship. The MPI talks of the 'desperately low morale in the Australian Defence Force caused by the failure of the Minister for Defence to provide leadership'. We have heard the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) answer the accusation. He does not deny that there is low morale; that is not up for debate. Low morale is not being debated or defended by the government. What the government is saying is: 'Yes, we do have low morale, but even though we have been in government for 18 months it is all your fault'. I would like to pick up on a few of the things that the Minister for Defence has said and raise a couple of my own points. He says that in our acquisition policy we were creating 'defence hulls'. Let me remind the minister that we had a very active defence industry policy approach which saw in 13 years the level of Australian industry capability, of Australifrn industry input into defence acquisitions, which usually ran under us at about $2 billion plus per annum, go from 30 per cent to 70 per cent. This meant jobs for Australians but also in-house Australian industry capability. That is very important and needs to be nurtured and fostered. Unfortunately, we are now returning to an age-old approach by defence under this minister, and particularly under his junior minister, that the world is a supermarket, overseas and off the shelf and that is how we should buy. Indeed, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), in outlining her approach to defence industry, said: 'You can count on my personal support.' That is terrific-a real commitment from the minister. But the rub was: what did that personal support for Australian industry mean? 'I will help in any way I can with letters of support, telephone calls, visits, or whatever is required'. This is the coalition's defence industry policy. This is the policy that is desired to overcome what the minister has called the 'defence hulls'. We will need a defence capability into the future. We need to maintain it. We need to nurture it. That is now slipping under the new government. I hope it will not be to our cost. I hope that when we need to make that telephone call we will be able to get the equipment in the way that the government envisages. I do not believe we will if we are involved in any serious conflict. I would like to return to the issue of restructuring the Army. I have to confess that in the previous government I was very excited about Army 21, a plan initiated by the former Minister for Defence Robert Ray. It looked fundamentally at what was going to be the role of the Army in defending Australia, how we needed to restructure the Army, and what sort of capability we needed to restructure it. The Minister for Defence says: 'Oh, yes. We picked this up. We have a new plan now, restructuring the Army-""Army into the 21st century"". We have done it all.' What have they done? They have decided to trial over two years some concepts-a commitment to trialling. 1I have never been more surprised. 1 said to the minister: 'I would love to know, for my own understanding, Wr,i).at army came up with Army 21 and what is the difference in the plans being trialled by the minister.' It is not a matter of just restructuring the Army or changing some of the equipment, of reshaping some of the units, or positioning them differently. We have a problem, which the minister obliquely alluded to, in wanting to change Army conditions. What is the approach of the new coalition defence team? Again, what does the junior minister do? There is a very decent report-and I am not saying you would want to implement everything in it, but it certainly highlights the to go-that was, again, prepared under the previous government: the Glenn review. How have the government implemented the Glenn review? No departmental or uniformed officer is now allowed to refer to the Glenn review. This is how we implement changewe just pretend it does not exist. But there are very real issues that need to be faced up to and very real changes that need to be made in the defence forces. We need to have mobility between full-time employment, part-time employment, and allowing people to opt out. We need much greater flexibility if we are to be capable of attracting the people we need to attract to the defence forces. I would like to mention the ready reserve. It is true that the coalition in opposition opposed to the ready reserve. I do not necessarily criticise them for that, but I want to point out what the ready reserve was doing. It was introducing, as Army knew only too well, a calibre and quality of had not experienced in other ranks before. The greatest advocates of the ready reserve scheme were the Army-for that very good reason. Why would they want that calibre of recruit? Warfare is no longer about grunting, although you do need a highly capable infantry, and I mean no disrespect to them. What I am alluding to is that technology is moving on and we need serving officers in other ranks capable of operating and being competent in the use of that equipment. Indeed, we pride ourselves in Australia that we can operate equipment far more capably, probably, than any other army in our region. To do that goes to the quality of recruits. They have abolished the ready reserve scheme, as predictably they would, but there is a vacuum. Where are the university type people that the ready reserve was encouraging into the Army-either into the ready reserve or the full-time Army, into other ranks or at the officer level? Where are you getting those people now? The short answer is that you are not. I wanted to say something about ADFA-a personal thing of mine. ADFA is the most expensive university in Australia, absorbing way 50 per cent of the officer training budget. I say to the minister, as I have said before: I thought the committee report was a decent one, although it was rubbished, again, by the junior minister. We need to look at a scholarship scheme that allows people to do their university training at other universities, mix with their peers and, after completion, embark on a military career-either at officer level or other ranks, full time or part time. But that was completely rejected by the government, and I regret that. In the short time remaining I wanted to make this point: there is a lot of change going on-and we do not object to change-but, as the shadow minister has said before, if you are going to implement change, at least do it in a structured and ordered way. Have your were strategic review so you understand what you are confronting. Have your force structure review so you have the forces deployed and structured in a way to meet that threat. And by all means go through your defence effirecruit that they ciency review. Mr Fitzgibbon-Deficient review.  honourable member points out. But how can you do it bottom up? That is what we are doing-we are cutting, hacking and slashing but saying on the side, 'Yes, we are going to have a strategic review; yes, we are going to have another look at force structure.' No wonder. morale is so low. It is all because of this government. It has absolutely nothing to do with the previous government. I hope that both ministers go away from this debate a little chastened that things have got to such a point. (Time expired)",84
101,Mr LINDSAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The only result that is going to come out of MPI on defence is a demonstration of the lack of understanding that the Labor Party has of the modem ADF in this country. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) does the ADF disservice today. Labor continues irresponsibly to talk down the morale of the ADF. find that a great shame because I come from a city that has Australia's largest ADF infraof structure. I know the men and women in the ADF in my area are proud to be in they are proud and keen to serve. They do good work for this nation and yet they politicians talking down their morale. I find that absolutely disgusting. For a start, I do not think that the shadow minister understands the role of the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan). Soldiers in the ADF do not care about political issues. They care about the minister providing strategic level leadership. They want to get on with the fighting and the inevitable administration that today. occurs in the ADF. They want the minister to secure strategic level policy and secure the MPI: funding. The minister that we have today leading the defence forces of this country will likely be remembered as a minister who has done all of those things that the ADF expects. You see, this minister has delivered the DER, the plan to restructure the army, and an extra $125 million to the sharp end where it is really needed. On top of all that, he has delivered what the ADF have been looking for for so many years-no further cuts in funding. I believe that the members of the ADF will see the hypocrisy that occurs from the Labor Party in this matter today. Mr Deputy Speaker, I said to you that I represent the largest ADF base in Australia. The shadow minister said that we should get out and talk to the troops on the ground. Every week I talk to the troops on the ground. I talk to all ranks in the ADF. I ask them what their concerns are. I do not see any problems with morale in my area. Instead, I see a fighting force that knows that it has an important job to do and a job that it is keen to get on with. I see troops who have a strong commitment to our nation, and that does not an come from a lack of morale. I see soldiers being continually asked for more, and I see them delivering it. You do not get a situation of being able to deliver more and more if the a great morale of the forces is low. The soldiers in Townsville do not give two I hoots about what appears in the Canberra Times. They are not interested in the politics this issue. They are interested in getting on and doing the job of looking after our nation, the ADF, and they do that very well. This year we have had two exercises out of have the RDF in Townsville-Exercise Tandem Thrust, based in Rockhampton, and Exercise Tasman Eagle. Both of those exercises were carried out with our allies. Both of them had a superb result. Our allies looked at the ADF in Australia and said, 'It is a fine organisation. ' You do not get a fine organisation, a well-oiled machine or a keen machine if there is lack of morale. It gives the lie to this MPI Look at the words that were used in the The desperately low morale in the Australian Defence Force . . . Where is it? I do not see it. I talk to the ADF every week. I talk to all ranks in the ADF and I simply do not see it. I see soldiers who want to get on with the job and to work well. I probably know as much as any person in this parliament, and probably more, about the Black Hawk situation. I look directly at the shadow minister sitting opposite and I say this: the ALP were first alerted in early 1992 to problems with the Black Hawk fleet. By 24 January 1994,24 of 5 Aviation's 27 helicopters were not flying. Mr Bruce Scott-Who was the minister then? Who was in government?",87
102,Mr LINDSAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Who was the minister then? It was not a minister of this government. You talk about the failure to provide leadership. Goodness gracious; 24 of our 27 helicopters, under you, were not flying. What a situation to put us in. I am happy to go to 5 Aviation. I go to 5 Aviation all the time. Let me tell you what they tell me. The unit is getting on with the task of providing the 3rd Brigade with support. They are not interested'in the politics the board of inquiry. They are not interested in the political shenanigans of the Labor Party. They are not interested in you trying to drive down the morale artificially. They are interested in getting on with the job. You might note, if you look at the performance of their exercise Swift Eagle last year, which was after the accident, they took out 17 Black Hawks. After only having had three flying under Labor they took out 17 into the field. I think that indicates a pretty strong performance from the officers and men of the 5 Aviation Regiment. I can categorically tell this parliament this afternoon that there are morale problems in that particular regiment. The RDF, which is the 3rd Brigade, is an organisation in Townsville which has a tremendous focus. Because they have that focus we have seen that group deployed to areas like Somalia and Rwanda. Recently a small component of the RAAF went to Cambodia. They have a purpose. The morale is not poor. They are doing the job. Look at the wonderful success we had out of the operation in the Southern Ocean, for example. That is not part of the RDF but it is part of the ADF. Look at what we were able to do there. Mr MCLachlan-It shows a bit of confidence, though.",88
103,Mr LINDSAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You are right, Minister, it shows confidence in it. Obviously the Rapid Deployment Force in Townsville would like the recognition that it deserves. They do not get recognition when an opposition party irresponsibly talks down the morale of the ADF. I think that is a most irresponsible thing to do. Just in my own patch I have the former member for Herbert, a member of the Australian Labor Party, jumping up and down in the Townsville media saying, 'Well, guys, the 11th Brigade is going to go; 3rd Brigade is going to get scaled down.' Fear, scare-driving it down. And what happened? It did not happen. The minister recognised, in the planning, what should occur in northern Australia and that was put in place. Labor continues to push the fear and uncertainty buttons of the ADF. I do not know to what end because, at the end of of the day, it is the Labor Party that suffers with credibility among our soldiers-among the men and women of the finest fighting force that we have had for some time. I do believe that the leadership from the minister, Mr MCLachlan, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) in ensuring that the funding was provided for the ADF at a time of very tight financial budgeting processes is indicative of the leadership that is shown on this side of the parliament. The minister has secured the future of the ADF. He has secured the future well into the no next century. Certainly he will be known in the ADF, and is known now, as the first minister to secure a sound budget base for the ADF. I am hopeful, without pre-empting it, that in future years we can increase the expenditure in the ADF as a percentage of GDP. I think when our budgetary processes allow it we will be able to go in that direction. I express my disgust at the member for Brisbane's great disservice today. (Time expired)",88

105,Mr RONALDSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (3.51 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Since its creation under the NRTC Act 1991 the National Road Transport Commission has been the means of carrying forward a major progr-m . of reforms inÂ· road transport. The commISSIon reports to the Australian Transport Council, recommending policies and legislation for reforming road transport and pro-ucing a uniform, consistent regulatory enVIronment. Road transport affects every part of Australian life. Inefficient road transport that is more - ostly than it needs to be affects everyone; Improvements in efficiency and safety benefit every Australian. This government from the outset has reiterated its commitment to road transport reform. When in opposition we gave bipartisan support to the road transport reform process. . Having different regulations, different m-pe-tion requirements and different permit cntena from one jurisdiction to another is frustrating, tim- con-uming and costly. Fragmented regulatIOns m states and territories imp-de the competi.tiveness of industry and restnct the effective mtegration of the Australian transport market. This government has committed itself whole-eartedl- to bringing the regulatory and operatmg enVIronment for road transport up to date: Since the NRTC was created in 1991 heavy vehicle charges have been reformed. The Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act has been passed to provide the basis for new, nationally uniform road rules. The Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Act allows for uniform and consistent registration requirements across the country. The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act provides for a safer operating regime for the transport by road of dangerous goods. Driving hours for long distance coaches and for trucks have reached an advanced stage of development. Although a great deal has been accomplished, much remains to be done. Such matters as driving hours and speed manage-ent have consumed vastly more time and mvolved a great deal more consultation than could have been envisaged at the outset. Pilot projects on alternative compliance for the management of vehicle maintenance mass limits and fatigue management have proved to be more complex than was thought necessary when these projects were commenced. The reform process must continue. The tasks that have commenced need to be brought to completion. More progress has - een mad.e in re-orming road transport legislation and m achIeving uniformity and consistency of approach in the last six years than had been made in the previous half century. In accordance with the NRTC Act 1991, the government set up a review last year of the functions and achievements of the commission. That review found that the commission should continue through an amendment to its enabling legislation but that several improvement- - eeded to be made to improve its functIOmng and effectiveness. In February the Ministerial Council on Road Transport accepted the main features of the review report and gave in-principle approval to proceed. Since that time, Commonwealth, state and territory officials have been working to translate those principles into - mendm-nts to the NRTC Act and heavy and h-ht yehicles agreements. Accordingly, this bIll WIll extend the NRTC Act by one year to e-able the - ommission to continue in operatIOn. The bIll also provides for commissioners to be reappointed, if necessary in the interim period. ' This bill is an interim measure. It is intended to allow the reform process to continue while the legislation is finalised to place road transport reform on a more solid foundation to deliver the returns to the industry for the benefit of all Australians. In this bill no changes will be made to present arrangements for the operation of the commission. It is the government's intention to introduce a substantive bill to put the recommendations of the review into effect. The changesÂ· that will result from the review will make substantial improvements to the operational efficiency, the direction and the accountability of the commission. It is intended to introduce the bill to give effect to those changes later in this session. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA MANAGEMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ronaldson, for Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",89
106,Mr RONALDSON,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (3.56 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to give effect to government's commitment to cap aircraft movements at Kingsford Smith Airport, KSA, at 80 movements per hour through the implementation of a slot system. This commitment was first made in our election policy statement on aviation in the 1996 election campaign. Today I am pleased to be introducing the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill, which represents a legislated cap on aircraft movements. Its introduction follows 18 months of effort necessary to ensure a cooperative scheme is ready to be formally implemented following the passage of this legislation. The timing for formally legislating a maximum aircraft movement cap at KSA is right, as the number of movements at KSA in the peak morning hours is rapidly approaching the 80 movement limit. Unlike the earlier private member's bill of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), we have been concerned when we legislated to put the cap in place to also deliver an effective tool to administer it. We have achieved this with the development of a slot allocation system. The slots system which has been developed, in cooperation with industry, will ensure that we have a workable and effective means for administering the cap. The slots system will not only manage the cap in a non-discriminatory way but help alleviate delays through congestion at KSA. This will be beneficial for all users of the airport-the airlines, the airport owner and, most importantly, the travelling public. By limiting the number of scheduled movements in any five-minute period, the slots system will force the airlines to move away from their practice of cluster scheduling, where a group of flights, potentially well beyond the airport's capacity, are scheduled with the same arrival or departure time. The bill requires movements to be spread more evenly across the hour. We have also incorporated a compliance regime into the slot system which, in tandem with the spreading of scheduling as cluster scheduling is dismantled, will also promote reduced delays at the airport. Under the the compliance system airlines will be liable to fines and other penalties for poor on-time performance. This is a crucial element of the slots system which will provide airlines with an additional incentive to perform on-time. Because off-slot movements may involve fines unless an acceptable reason exists, the system will also bring transparency and accountability to a process of explaining why delays occur into and out of KSA. We intend to trial the off-slot provisions of the proposed slot management regime for six months. This will enable the scheme to bed down and for industry to adjust to the new arrangements before fines are imposed. Another objective we have met in developing the slots system is to guarantee residents of regional New South Wales continued access to KSA. The system we are establishing will safeguard the current levels of access that regional New South Wales has to KSA, reflecting the Commonwealth government's commitment to country residents. This will be achieved by setting aside dedicated regional slots based on existing service levels, which cannot be sold or swapped to interstate or international services. Consistent with a deregulated aviation industry, the slots system also provides for any potential new entrants to have equal access with their established competitors to slots at Australia's primary domestic airport. This is the most progressive level of access for new entrants at any slot-constrained airport in the world. And it is possible to do this principally because we are putting this cap in place now, before the limit is reached in any hour. However, should the bill be delayed, allocation under the present ad hoc, first come, first served process will continue. On current trends, the 80 cap will soon be exceeded if not clearly established through this bill. We are convinced that the introduction of a slots system will effectively administer the cap and will overall help reduce congestion and delays at Sydney airport. This will have a flow-on beneficial effect as so much domestic aviation traffic is affected by good performance at KSA. I turn now to the main provisions of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill. Maximum aircraft movement limit Part 2 of the bill establishes a cap of 80 movements per hour at KSA, and requires Airservices Australia to monitor compliance with the cap. Airservices Australia is also required to report any breaches of the cap. These reports will be tabled in both Houses of parliament. In allocating slots, hourly movements are to be measured every 15 minutes. As I noted earlier, this will assist alleviating the practice of cluster scheduling. Under clauses 7 and 8 it will be possible to lower the maximum number of hourly movements at KSA after consultation with interested parties. However, any change to the cap must be made in the form of a disallowable instrument which must go before the parliament for the full disallowance period before it would come into effect. The capacity to lower the maximum number of hourly movements is essentially a reserve provision. The cap of 80 remains our policy. Penalties for unauthorised aircraft movements Part 3 of the bill establishes a system of penalties for unauthorised aircraft movements. This will protect the integrity of the cap and establish clear guides for all users of KSA as to the range of sanctions which may be levied if an infringement occurs. Unauthorised movements will be subject to penalties in the form of an infringement notice or civil prosecution. A range of civil penalties have been specified in relation to breaches of the slot allocation system. The most serious of these breaches relates to no-slot movements, where an aircraft lands or takes off without having permission to do so. This is a fundamental breach of the slot system which jeopardises the cap and disrupts other airports users who have applied for a slot. A no-slot movement will be punishable by a maximum penalty of $220,000 per infringement. The maximum penalty for an off-slot movement is $110,000 for a corporation, or $22,000 for an individual. It is proposed that the Compliance Scheme will provide initially for relatively small fines, but persistent offenders will find an exponential increase in the level of fines for the second and third offences-up to the maximum. It is worth noting that fines are not triggered unless a flight is more than 15 minutes late, and offslot movements which are outside the control of the airline will not count. Emergency and state aircraft will be exempt from this part of the bill. In addition, the slot in manager may grant, within approved guidelines, a dispensation to certain aircraft. The guidelines will be a disallow able instrument as part of the slot management scheme and will therefore be subject to further scrutiny by this parliament. . Revenue received from penalties is to be used by industry to offset the costs of administering the slot management scheme. This signifies that the government is not aiming at raising revenue under the scheme. Rather, we are serious about improving poor performance and delays. The slot management scheme Part 4 of the bill establishes the broad slot Conclusion allocation framework. It does not contain the fine detail covering the day-today operation of the slots system. An outline of the detail the scheme to be authorised under the bill is contained in the regulatory impact statement. A detailed draft scheme will be the subject of further development by an appointed slot manager. The scheme will be a disaIIowable instrument when finalised. Clause 46 of the bill provides a ministerial discretion to vary, suspend or cancel slots. This will be important for short-term adjustments to the slots system to meet the operational requirements of special events, such as the 2000 Olympics. Any directions under this clause will be required to be tabled in parliament. The compliance scheme Part 5 of the bill establishes the broad compliance framework. It provides for a compliance committee to develop and oversight enforcement provisions in relation to the slot allocation system at KSA. The compliance scheme will be a disallowable instrument. The slot manager Part 6 of the bill establishes that a slot manager, which will be a separate company, will be appointed to put forward a slot management scheme and future amendments, and administer slots at KSA. It is envisaged that the company appointed will be one formed by Sydney airport and Australian airlines or operators using the airport. The compliance committee Part 7 of the bill provides for the appointment of a compliance committee for KSA, with responsibility for developing, administering and amending the compliance scheme. The minister will appoint the committee. Miscellaneous Part 8 of the bill allows the making of regulations necessary to address the issue of slot management at KSA. The bill allows approval of amendments to the slot management scheme and the compliance scheme to be delegated to the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Development, or to any person holding or performing the duties of a senior executive service office. The bilI is a strong and reliable framework against which Sydney airport and the airlines of using it will have the opportunity to build a mature, cooperative arrangement for better ontime performance and effective planning, up to the cap of 80 movements an hour. The full details of the scheme and amendments to it will be tabled in parliament as a disallowable instrument. A great deal of work has already gone into developing the slot management scheme, and it will be available for tabling later this year. There is no excuse for further delay. The necessary advance work is now complete; and the 80 cap must be set in concrete now, before it is exceeded by growth in the morning peak hour. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.

107,Ms WORTH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (4.10 p.m.)-I thank those Secre- members who took part in the debate in the Main Committee on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. But, in doing so, I say that it is disappointing that the opposition is attempting to hold up its passage. The bill seeks only to correct anomalies in the Northern Territory land rights act which allow certain land claims to remain technically on foot when, in practice, they should not. This has the potential to unnecessarily restrict economic development in the to Northern Territory, which would disadvantage all territorians, including those from Aboriginal communities. One of the anomalies, relating to stock route claims, is actually a Labor mistake. Labor proclaimed an amendment in 1990 which was intended to prevent stock route claims. This amendment proved technically deficient, and this is one of the things we are now trying to fix. The government is acting in good faith in doing this. It will be insisting that the Northern Territory government keep to its side of the bargain and improve aspects of its Pastoral Land Act before this amendment comes into force. So there is no argument for delaying passage of the bill here. It is true that the Northern Territory amendment bill lapsed at the recent election. However, the government expects the Northern Territory government to reintroduce its Pastoral Land Bill during the new assembly'S first sittings. This is likely to be in November this year. Labor further argues that this bill should wait until completion of the land rights review. Such a delay is not warranted, as the government has repeatedly made clear that amendments seek only to fix minor technical anomalies in the act. They are not relevant to any of the important policy issues that will no doubt be examined by the review and therefore need not await the outcome of that review. The sunset clause was introduced by Labor in 1987 and the government has no intention of removing it. This is implicit in the terms of reference for the review. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Melham's amendment) stand part of the question. Jones, B. O. The House divided. [4.18 p.m.] (Madam Deputy Speaker-Hon. 1.A.

108,Ms WORTH,PAIRS,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (4.21 p.m.)-by leave-I move: (1) Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 8), after item 1, insert: lA At the end of paragraphs 67A(5)(a) and (b) Add ""or"". 1B Paragraph 67A(5)(c) Repeal the paragraph, substitute: (c) the Commissioner informs the Minister, in the Commissioner's report to the Minister in respect of the claim: (i) that the Commissioner finds that there are no Aboriginals who are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area of land; or (ii) that the Commissioner is unable to make a finding that there are Aboriginals who are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area of land; or (2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 11 to 17), omit subsection (6), substitute: (6) If: (a) an application has been made under section 50 by or on behalf of Aboriginals claiming to have a traditional land claim to an area of land; and (b) either: (i) the application was made after 5 1997; or (ii) subsection 50(2D) applies to cation; the traditional land claim, in so far as it relates contrary, to that area of land, is taken to have finally disposed of. Note: Subparagraph (b) (i) relates to subsection 50(2A), which prevents CommisAffairs sioners considering applications to traditional land claims made after the expiration of 10 years after commencement of that subsection. subsection commenced on 5 June There are only two amendments, and like to speak to them very briefly. The Aboriginal Land Commissioner has held that land claims technically remain on foot, even after a conclusion that it was not possible to decide whether traditional Aboriginal owners exist over the land under the claim. The sunset clause prevents the Aboriginal Land Commisamendments sioner from dealing with claims lodged after 5 June 1997. It does not prevent claims lodged and technically remains on foot. The problem is that another provision Land Rights Act creates some doubt about the election. ability of the Northern Territory government to deal with land under claim, including land in these instances. These amendments will remove the doubt by deeming these claims to be finally disposed of. I present the signed supplementary explanatory memorandum. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Ms Worth)-by leaveeligible read a third time. VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND COMPENSATION MEASURES) BILL 19.97 Second Reading Debate resumed.",94
109,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"Before question time. I was dealing with the amendment that has been moved by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) June and indicating that I thought it was slightly disingenuous of him to be condemning the the appligovernment for its handling of veterans' affairs. I was making the point that, on the I believe that since this government been came into office it has delivered on its commitment to veterans. I am pleased that the Minister for Veterans' (Mr Bruce Scott) is at the table this relating afternoon. The member for Reid did actually the make a number of points during his contribuThat tion that I conceded were points worthy of 1987. consideration and I am sure that the minister will deal in detail with those comments at the I would time he sums up this debate. Before the last election the coalition promised to review repatriation entitlements and we have done that. This legislation reflects a number of amendments that are consequential upon that particular review. In fact, the in this bill in relation to operational qualifying areas of service arise from being the report that was commissioned by the government. That report was undertaken jointly by the Department of Veterans' Affairs of the and the Department of Defence after the I am surprised that member for Reid was not prepared to concede that there is no doubt that this particular legislation has within it considerable benefits for a wide range of veterans. I want to quickly reiterate what those are. Mr Laurie Ferguson-I said that.",95
110,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"I did not hear you say that, but if you said it, you said it. The fact is that another 10,500 veterans will become for compensation for injuries or diseases resulting from their overseas service in the Australian Defence Force. That will represent an additional cost of almost $20 million to the government. The measures in this bill will take effect from 13 May 1997. There are also six new areas which this bill adds to the list of overseas deployment regarded as operational service. Once again, this will be of benefit and interest to a large number of veterans. There is the BCOF, or the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces, in Japan for a certain period of time; Singapore during the Malayan Emergency; the Far East Strategic Reserve the navy for certain dates; the DMZ, as it is called, the demilitarised zone, in Korea from 19 April 1956 and onwards; HMAS Vampire or Quickmatch, which saw service in Vietnam for a certain period of time; and north-east Thailand, including Ubon, for a period of time. This partly addresses the member for Reid's concerns. The bill also makes a number of amendments aimed at giving some groups access to the service pension. It does this by including a number of peacekeeping forces on the list for qualifying service. I will not go through that list because of the shortness of time. In addition, the bill changes the way in which operational qualifying service will be determined in the future. At the moment operational service for the purpose of veterans' entitlements is whatever is listed the act. In future operational service will be that list, plus any service defined as warlike or non-warlike, and qualifying service will include warlike service. The legislation that we are dealing with today not only honours the government's commitments to veterans, but it delivers on our pre-election promises and also in no uncertain terms is of substantial benefit to a wide range of veterans. There are a number of other important elements within the legislaindustry tion. One is the extension of eligibility to certain other people of advance payment of pensions, and that is a positive benefit for many veterans. I will make a brief remark about the changes which the bill proposes to the treatment of tobacco related illnesses. There are two items in this bill which seek to make it clear that the commission will not accept tobacco related death or injury as war caused if the serviceman or servicewoman began to smoke or use tobacco products after 31 December 1997 or increased the amount of cigarettes or tobacco products used after 31 December 1997. The opposition spokesman accepted that, of course, and I do not think there would be any debate about that particular change because it is absolutely justified. The dangers of smoking are now well known, and that was not the case back in World War II and at other times since then. In fact, many World War II veterans, including my own father, actually took up smoking during the war, were unable to stop smoking after the war and have subsequently succumbed to a number of different sorts of cancers which were caused by smoking. But these days we are much more enlightened, and therefore this particular change is not about saving money, although in an indirect sense it may well do that, but is about recognising that everybody in our community, including members of the ADF, are informed about the dangers of smoking. I would like to observe in this context that the tobacco companies still refuse to accept the situation as it is. They accept in some obscure way a statistical association between people who smoke and cancer, but they do not actually in accept that it causes cancer. They maintain their position to this day, to this hour, that causation has not been proved. In the meantime, of course, they continue to market products to children, yet also deny that they do it. I think the Tobacco Institute said recently that advertising is not what makes people take up smoking. I am not sure why the companies are spending so much money on advertising if that is the case. I have no respect at all for the way the tobacco goes about marketing its products to children. There is no doubt in most thinking people's minds about the causal link between smoking and many illnesses, including many forms of cancer, and that is why this particular provision in this legislation is broadly accepted. There are a couple of other matters I want to touch upon briefly. The legislation provides for the transfer of carer service pensions and carer income support supplement recipients to the Department of Social Security. I need to make it very clear to people that veterans are very jealous and very concerned about the maintenance of their department and the department's administration of their affairs. The minister understands that and I know the government understands it, and I want to underline the fact that there is no intention to deviate from that position. I do not think, and I do not think anybody in this place thinks, that that is going to be the case forever, and maybe in 20 or 30 years timeMr Bruce Scott-Long after that.",95
111,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"Long after the minister has gone somewhere; hopefully, still in this world but gone from this placeMr Sercombe-It will be the Bradford government then.",97
112,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"It could be the Bradford government. Thank you very much. The member for Maribyrnong might well be very perceptive. The fact is that for the time for the immediate foreseeable future, that will not change. There are in fact some very positive benefits in that particular change because there are only a very small number of DV A pensioners who are affected and the great bulk of carers, the 24,500 who exist, are paid through the Department of Social Security. I want to assure veterans that this is not in any way the thin edge of some wedge to disband or remove the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Those sorts of rumours float around from time to timeMr Bruce Scott-Not with this government.",97
113,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"And, as the minister says, this government has absolutely no intention of going down that track. The other thing that has been floating around is the criticism of the proposed merits tribunal. I have had letters from some of my RSL clubs about that. I have got one here from the Currumbin-Palm Beach RSL subbranch. I understand that there was originally a bit of misinformation floating around about the government's intentions, and particularly about the effect it might have on veterans' capacity to prosecute their cases before the tribunal. I think those concerns have now been allayed, and the amalgamation of the AAT, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Veterans' Review Board and so on into a single tribunal will have substantial benefits for everybody involved. I think that has been put to rest. There were a number of other matters I wanted to touch on, but let me quickly go to the last. I know this is also good news for this government, and I applaud the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) of the new Australian active service medal. Mr Laurie Ferguson-It is the fourth attempt, though.",97
114,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"The result is of substantial benefit to a great number of veterans in our country. I might have some sort of interest which I should possibly divulge, but the fact is that that is good news for veterans, as being, is this legislation. (Time expired)",97
115,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,PAIRS,"In talking about the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997, I might start off almost where the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) finished, and that is on the question of the tribunal and the department's future. Despite what has been said in recent times, many of us are in fact very concerned about this new super-tribunal. As someone who has dealt with the various tribunals over time and has very much appreciated the level of expertise within those tribunals, and the level of sensitivity which they have displayed over the years, I am actually quite nervous about the government's proposals. I think the possible savings that may be involved may lead to a system where the individual gets lost in a tribunal which will not be sufficiently expert, if you like, and sufficiently sensitive to deal with all of the matters that come before it. Until we see its final shape and how it is going to be formed and so on, one has to keep some reservations, but I personally have some very strong reservations about what has been announced to date. I would think the veteran community of Australia are equally concerned. They have not yet made a judgment about it but there is a genuine concern. In effect, the logic is that appeals are the most complex of matters and, if you can handle appeals in one tribunal, why do you need a separate department? It is not the thin edge of the wedge in one sense, but in another sense it is a logical conclusion to say that, if you can handle the most complex things in one organisation, why can't you handle the simple things in a single organisation? So, if you can merge the SSAT-the Social Security Appeals Tribunal-and the Veterans Review Tribunal, it does beg the question: why have separate departments? I think there is a very real apprehension about that part of it. The second part is whether or not the level of expertise and sensitivity that we have grown to appreciate and respect in the separate tribunals will carry through to a new tribunal. In the case of staff members, many will be different. The personnel will change to a large degree-no doubt the tribunal members will change and the staffing as well. Of course, the government will say they will not, but we all know that they will because these things always happen that way. So I suspect that the culture, if you like, that will be lost, and I am genuinely concerned about the implications of that. The member for MCPherson also spoke about departmental professionalism and so on. I think another cause for concern actually came up in the minister's speech on this matter, in which he referred to outsourcing. He expressed with some pride that this was the first Commonwealth Public Service to outsource its computer infrastructure. I am not sure if he realises that is not something to be proud of. As someone with a computer background, I have a genuine concern that what is happening with the government will lead to a very serious problem in the years ahead in terms of privacy and ownership of intellectual property. The software and data that are being outsourced are, in fact, the personal records of people who are pretty special. Those systems have been developed at taxpayers' expense over a lot of years and will be transferred to a private supplier who will operate that software. In the years ahead modifications will, no doubt, be required. The system will need to be adapted and changed with changes in legislation. There is a real concern that the changes will belong to the provider and not to the government. So if one wanted to change the supplier of that outsourced infrastructure in five years-for example, at the end of a contract or for some other reasonthe supplier, or provider, would keep the changes and would give back the original software. These things are complex and I am not satisfied, and I am sure many in the community are not satisfied, that what is happening is something to be boasting about. It has been put forward as a cost saving measure but, certainly in terms of intellectual property, it opens up an area of genuine concern and, even more importantly, our capacity to protect the data and the privacy of that information becomes very vulnerable, particularly when the government has a view that the private sector should not have privacy legislation. I accept that the government's proposal for its outsourcing does require the provider to observe Commonwealth standards on privacy exists so I am not making that broad statement in that context, but I am questioning the government's capacity to monitor and control the privacy provisions with an outsourcing provider. To do that properly will cost almost as much as running it-you almost have to have somebody in there auditing all the time to make sure that the system is not being tapped into and that it is not being misused. We saw cases in New South Wales recently where both Commonwealth and state information on social security and motor traders was being misused in a corrupt fashion and it took ages to come out, and that was in departments with very strong privacy protection. One wonders how much security that information will have with an outsourced supplier. So, as a minister I would not be so boastful. I think it was not his idea-it was forced on the department by Finance and Treasury as a budget measure. It is not in the interests of veterans and, in the long term, the current government may well rue the day that it took such a decision. The amendments in general will be supported by those on this side. The shadow mini.ster has spoken on a number of matters, particularly regarding Ubon and the Far East Strategic Reserve, where there are problems. Let us make no mistake about this-over the years since the thirties the definitions of theatres of war, what constituted danger and who should be recognised have been a matter of perpetual debate and argument. Ta-e the case of Darwin: there were people there m the army during a particular period when it was recognised as a theatre of war. Others sent there as part of the civilian defence corpsthey were not volunteers-helped to build structures. They helped to build the buildings for the soldiers who were there. Those people were not treated as soldiers and they were not entitled to the same benefits as the people they worked next to. Those kinds of issues have always been a problem and always will be. I think Ubon has got a second problem-it was part of a dirty war. It was part of our not wanting to recognise and accept that we we-e involved in wars that were not legal. There IS no doubt that the air force personnel in Thailand during that period were part of the Vietnam army, air force and navy with the Americans and ourselves. There is no doubt that they were part of that, but w- do. not want to admit it out loud because It brmgs Thailand into, if you like, a situation that not officially accepted. So for years the department and the military have tended to want to put screens around Ubon. That has been a grave injustice to the people who were involved. It is a similar case with the Far East Strategic Reserve, the Malayan incident and so on. We have been involved in things as a country perhaps for good motives but, whatever the motives may have been, the outcome has been that we have been involved in issues that we have not admitted to openly. Clearly, there were naval ships involved, but those who served on them are not recognised, and discrepancies still exist. These amendments go a long way towards recognising the service of a lot of people who were not recognised previously and who made contributions under Australian flags. We are pleased about that, but this is not the end of the story. This will go on for years to come, just as this is one more step taken as ,:""e mature as a country and as we recogmse increasingly our responsibilities. There is another group of people who have equally missed out in this legislation. I refer to the entertainers who went into Vietnam. There were two kinds of entertainers. There were those who were engaged by the Australian Army or the Australian defence forces and were sent in strictly for the Australian troops. There were others who were originally engaged by the Americans and were sent in as part of the American entertainment corps or group but who were then contracted across to entertain Australian troops-not mi-ed groups but Australian troops. They came in and entertained Australian troops as Australian entertainers. They were never recognised. The department know that they were there and they know they contracted them, but because they were not employed by the Australian defence forces directly they cannot be recognised. These are the invisible people. We know they were there. They entertained our troops, in some cases for very long periods, and they did it very well. They were known to be Australians and they were known to be there. But, when it comes to their recognition,up goes to the screen and was they say, 'Because we did not engage them, they do not exist.' One young woman who was entertaining Australian troops at the time is Lyn Lawson, who is now a nurse and a councillor. She is a tremendous worker for the Vietnam veterans' cause in Newcastle. She does an enormous amount of voluntary work and provides an enormous amount of support. She and her husband, Gerald, have done a great job. Lyn is quite accepting of the situati?n, but the Vietnam veterans are not. They thmk she has been dudded very badly, because they know how much she did and how much she does now. She puts herself forward as a Vietnam veteran who is part of that group, but the fact that she cannot be officially recognised for that service is a travesty and quite unfair. I suggest that the government look very closely at the pettifogging, nitpicking terminology we tend to use. These traditions go back perhaps before 1066-who knows?- They when the military decided what level what medal at what stage for how many days. We had the silly situation about the Sydney and others where the air force had one day Vietnam and received a medal but the navy required 30 days. I find it very difficult times to understand and interpret their judgHunter ments. Hence, many of us have campaigned over the years to re-think and re-visit those issues. The issue of the entertainers is needs revisiting. On behalf of Lyn Lawson and those like her, those young Australian men and women who were engaged originally by the Americans, who entertained our troops in battle situations, who were as significant the ones who were engaged by the Australian Army and defence forces, should be recogticular nised for their presence-for at least being there. I think that is what my Vietnam as are saying to me. Lyn herself is certainly not making any approaches in that sense, but the local Vietnam veterans have given her medal of their own. They struck their own medal for her because the government would not do so. I think that in itself is an indication of the depth of their concern. This legislation progresses these issues more step. There are still more steps to go. think the Far East Strategic Reserve and question about Ubon will come forward again. There may be other areas that we still do know about. Year by year more little pockets of activity that were surreptitious, that were not visible to all of us, come forward. I would think that on both sides of the parliament there is recognition that we need to underNew Guinea. stand and appreciate that the separation of people from people who have faced similar experiences should diminish and the equality of treatment should be extended. This has been a wide-ranging debate in parts with the minister's comments about outsourcing and the previous member's good, comments about a number of other issues. is Therefore, I want to make the House aware that this weekend the underdogs are a great chance; Manly are beatable. I think the whole of Newcastle will be looking forward to the Knights putting up a tremendous performance. are a team of veterans in the sense of gets their skills and professionalism. Whilst many of them are quite young and a great number are home grown, they have in done our region proud. I am sure on Sunday afternoon that they will prove that Manly are at not invincible. Watch the underdogs. The are often the underdogs in this country, as I think on Sunday we are again. Manly should not be too confident about their chances of success. Madam Deputy Speaker, I one that appreciate that opportunity.",97
116,Mr BOB BALDWIN,PAIRS,"I concur with the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) on his thoughts about the Knights on Sunday and his thoughts as - about the forgotten people in the Vietnam War. It is most appropriate that at this partime, when the highly successful 'Their service, our heritage' initiative is beginning to veterdemonstrate its effectiveness by making Australians, and in particular our young Australians, more aware of the huge contribua tions our ageing service personnel have made in Australia, that the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill should be introduced. Only too often do we perceive that the one ANZAC spirit and our Australian veterans I belong to an era past, leaving only an aura of the gratefulness, pride and memories of old soldiers and battles. The reality is that our not current veterans in some cases include soldiers who are still young with young families and are still serving our great nation in many parts of this troubled world-be it Somalia, Cambodia or, even closer to home, Papua We should always bear in mind that we, as Australians-and I mean all Australianshave a responsibility to honour the commitment that our service personnel make time and time again in the tradition of our forebears. As true ambassadors for all that is honest and true, our service personnel never shirk their responsibility and, like the ANZACs of old, demonstrate that the spirit of mateship and of being true blue is far from dead. Recently the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, known as the AATTY or The Team, which produced some four VC winners and numerous other bravery awards, celebrated their 35th reunion. A message arrived from the Commandant of the US Marine Corps, General C. C. Krulak, who wrote in part: Â· .. on the occasion of the 1997 AATTV 35th birthday, and on behalf of the Marines in posts and stations around the world, it is with great pleasure that I extend my greetings and warmest best wishes. During the Vietnam war, AATTV worked alongside our Marine units. Working as advisers, AATTV was an invaluable asset to the many successful missions. The indomitable spirit and raw courage of the AATTV will forever remain a significant part of the history of the Vietnam war and remains the standard by which US marines measure the mettle of a warrior. Although that war has now been over for some 25 years, the memories, the pain, the pride and the ghosts of this conflict are still very much part of our current community. Sometimes we forget this. As the National President of AATTV, Brigadier Garth Hughes, said recently in a response to an address by the South Australian Governor: Â· .. when we came back from Korea and Malaya, we were largely ignored, but we accepted this with a soldier's stoicism. After all, what was it Kipling said? 'Oh, its Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy go away, but it is ""thank you Mr Atkins"", when the bands begin to play' Â· . . and while we were ignored, at least nobody spat on us when we came home from Korea. There is not much point in reiterating what happened during and after Vietnam. We all know about that. Further, he went on to say: Â· . . the war has been over for more than 25 years. I think it is time to let the dead rest in peace, for the rest of us to get on with business of living out what's left of our lives in whatever happiness we can find. Personally, I do not think that I can accept that gracious epitaph. We can, should and must do more as politicians and legislators. Every year, as I stand and watch the ANZAC Day parade, I see a sea of new young faces wearing service medals and awards proudly earned on peacekeeping missions that they display and share with veterans three times their age. Even in this Parliament House there is ample evidence of a younger generation of veterans who served their country. Madam Deputy Speaker, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, next time you walk through the entrance to the House cif Representatives or pass a security station, allow your eyes to wander to the left side of the jackets. You will notice that quite a few of our parliamentary staff are wearing Korean, Malaya and Vietnam medals and awards. For example, there is: Des Campbell, ex-training team Vietnam, who served in Malaya and Papua New Guinea and who is up in the gallery at the moment; Bruce Glossop, engineer, who served in Malaya and Vietnam; Garry Cosgrove, engineer, Vietnam; 'Buff Phillips, air force, Vietnam; Lindsay Kidd, navy, Vietnam; Klause Wendt, RAAF, Vietnam; Tony Forbes, infantry, Vietnam; Frank Armour, navy, Vietnam; and even Lynne in our parliamentary post office is the daughter of Neville Dodds, ex-training team, Vietnam. Peter Hulsing, who works as 'my chief of staff, is ex-training team Vietnam and has also served in Papua New Guinea. But it would be remiss of me not to mention our own Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, the Hon. Tim Fischer, and my colleague and friend John Bradford, the member for MCPherson, who also saw overseas duty in Vietnam. We should never lose sight of our responsibility towards this serving community. Our legislation, therefore, must keep pace with the ever-changing conditions and needs of this very important legacy of our nationhood. This bill goes a long way towards addressing this issue. It delivers the outcome and of an election policy undertaking to review perceived anomalies in the eligibility for veterans' entitlements for overseas deployments since World War II. It nominates areas of operation not included previously, where the level of risk existed above that of normal peacetime conditions. It includes Far East Strategic Reserve naval service in Malaya between July 1955 and May 1963. It adopts the defence classification of warlike and non-warlike service which vides a consistent closer link between the eligibility for benefits and the nature of services rendered. The existing legislation dealing with the operational service has been rewritten and restructured to improve readathe bility. By presenting new operational service provisions within the revised setting, government is continuing its commitment to simplify the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It also provides access to an annual advance on pensions and excludes liability for the effects of tobacco usage started or increased after 1 January 1998. In my electorate of Paterson, I meet with many ex-service personnel-like Peter Lord of the Maitland RSL who, with his team, works tirelessly raising funds to have a World War II memorial erected. Then there is Bill Gardner and Graham Chandler of the Vietnam Veterans Association, who are constantly striving to have the Department of Veterans' Affairs recognise the many problems these much maligned warriors experience. Les Dwyer, President of the Naval Association of Newcastle and President of the Newcastle and Districts Council of RSL Subbranches, and former Chief Petty Officer John King, Pensions Officer of the Naval Association of Newcastle and the Nelson Bay subbranch, are tireless fighters for their groups to have their World War II and post-World War of this advance. II efforts recognised. And not forgetting Bill Paterson of the Gona Memorial Association, who recently visited Papua New Guinea to commemorate their fallen mates with the unveiling of a special memorial they have built. We must also pay homage to the work of Ron Anelzack, President of Karuah RSL sub-branch, and his efforts to build a memorial at Karuah. I would like to advise this House that have a special affinity for the Harbourside Haven Aged Care facility located at Port Stephens, which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) during a recent visit described as model by which others could be measured. On 9 October, the Harbourside Haven Aged Care facility will open a $3 million recreation centre for the aged veterans who live on site proat the new complex at Fingal Bay. The opening will be performed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott. This occasion will also mark the first visit of the minister to my electorate. During visit to Paterson, Bruce Scott will be taking the time to visit the Newcastle Vietnam the Veterans' Association and will present cheques to the Karuah and Maitland RSL subbranches as part of the Their Service-Our lump sum Heritage initiative. The one common goal of all these organisations and associations is to look after their mates who are in need. The least we as politicians can do is to assist them to the full, and the most appropriate way to do this is to regularly update and improve the legislation which deals with the conditions affecting our affected veterans. I know that the inclusion of nine areas of service which extend eligibility . for disability pensions and treatment for injuries or diseases incurred whilst serving there will be applauded by the many ex-service men and women who to date have not received this recognition. In addition, this bill will give those veterans who are income support recipients the ability to claim an annual advance on pensions. Disability pensioners, war widows and war widower pensioners will welcome the access to a lump sum advance on their pension and simplification of the calculation of the amount Another important part of this bill deals with the Commonwealth's liability for the effect of tobacco use. The dangers associated with the use of tobacco products have been well known for some time, and there is wide community awareness of these dangers. There new are prominent health warnings on tobacco products and smoking is forbidden in Commonwealth buildings and many public I places. Current service personnel in the Defence Force are discouraged from smoking and encouraged to maintain healthy lifestyles. The Commonwealth should therefore not a continue to accept liability for conditions caused through an individual's lifestyle choice. This bill amends the Commonwealth's liability for deaths, diseases and injuries among veterans and members of the Defence Force caused by the use of tobacco products where that use commenced or increased after 31 December 1997. There is no doubt that this measure will also be applauded by the veteran community. The Commonwealth should provide clear warnings and guidelines which are in the best interests of the individual. Too often it is found that wisdom comes easy in hindsight. Not only should compensation be entertained when legislation does not allow for certain incidents but education and clear measures designed to protect each serving individual should be enacted as well. I again reflect on Brigadier Hughes's speech: Each of us brought home our own private ghosts from that war. Personally I don't think they were much different to ghosts from any other war. When one considers the conditions under which soldiers fought during the first world war, then the Vietnam War was a walk in the park. What makes the ghosts from Vietnam appear worse to us is the treatment meted out to returning servicemen by the media, the politicians, the bureaucracy and worse of all, by the public. We were made to feel guilty for serving our country! Those who served during WWl and WW2 were treated as heroes and cloaked in an aura. If they drank too much they were forgiven because, after all, ""they'd been through the war"". If they couldn't hold down ajob everyone understood because: ""weren't they just of the army?"" I know! I was one of their greatest admirers. We should learn from our mistakes and never again allow a negative attitude to reflect on those who served and still serve. Instead, we have the solemn responsibility to ensure that, for those we send out in our name to uphold peace and the great Australian tradition of looking out for our mates, our legislation recognises and protects their interests on their return to our shores. For instance, the recent announcement by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, recognised the fact that the additional issue of the Australian Service Medal to Australian servicemen who received imperial awards made all the difference in feeling accepted by Australian authorities. Following the minister's recent visit to my electorate of Paterson, I have received numerous letters of congratulations on her solid support for this initiative. Surely that is a strong indication that our role as legislators is appreciated but, even more importantly, constantly monitored. In addition, it is important to recognise the other people who serve, like the women's auxiliaries of the RSL, and the tremendous work which is undertaken by Legacy. The bill before the House at the moment, although small in measure, marks another important milestone in the history of our veterans' affairs. Although we have a lot further to go on our veterans' affairs legislation amendments, I wholeheartedly support the current bill and commend it to the House.",100
117,Mr SERCOMBE,PAIRS,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). I do so beca-se, as he indicated, the process which has brought this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill to the House really is confused and secretive and it has produced inconsistent handling. The coalition had an election commitment to review the anomalies that exist in relation to veterans' entitlements. In our view they clearly have not been successful enough in out removing those anomalies. We welcome the extension of recognition for operational service to a number of areas including the Far East Strategic Reserve and to Ubon. We also acknowledge the extension of service pension entitlements to some categories, primarily the United Nations peacekeeping categories and importantly to embassy guards and evacuation personnel who remained in Vietnam after January 1973. In our view the extensions, as welcome as they are, simply do not remove all the anomalies. It seems to us that there are three substantial anomalies remaining. There is the naval component of the Far East Strategic Reserve and their eligibility for service pensions, there are RAAF personnel who served at Ubon and there are naval logistic support personnel from the Vietnam conflictÂ· who we believe are being significantly disadvantaged in this process of tidying up anomalies. As I understand it, the coalition advances three arguments against the extension of recognition to the RAN personnel in Malaya. They talk about there being no process of allotment of personnel, they talk about there being no operational risk and they talk about the fact that they were not subject to military law. In relation to allotment, the archival evidence clearly contradicts that. There is correspondence to the Defence treasury from the secretary of the navy dated 11 November 1955 in which it is made quite clear that RAN ships were allotted for duty as the RAN component of the strategic reserve. That allotment occurred from 1 July 1955. In terms of the question of military law-without bogging the House down in legalistic mumbo jumbo-there seems to be some sort of argument that naval personnel were not covered by military law and rather were covered by naval regulation. Clearly, that is a lot of nonsense. If army personnel are the only ones covered by military law for the purpose of these matters, one can ask how it is that RAAF personnel have been included. So we think that anomaly remains and does not stand particularly close scrutiny. It seems to me that it is the area of operational duty, though, that is the most misunderstood in this respect. I did, several weeks ago in the context of an adjournment debate, read into Hansard the operational experience of a former RAN gentleman who had been to see me and had given me a documentary account of the circumstances surrounding the death of Able Seaman Spooner in that period. I have a number of other documents from personnel that I would like to deal with in this debate that I think indicate that these people were experiencing warlike conditions. Of course, one has to, by way of preamble, say that clearly all these conflicts post Second World War did not have the sorts of characteristics of, say, the Battle of Britain in terms of being a clearly delineated conflict for the purposes of air force personnel. They did not have the characteristics of the Battle of the Coral Sea for RAN personnel. The conflicts in which Australia has been involved in the period since the Second World War have primarily been conflicts which have had characteristics of low level intensity. They have been conflicts with circumstances where perhaps the involvement has not been part of a declared) war. There have been circumstances where there has been some contentiousness about Australia's involvement. There have been circumstances where the military conflict involved sporadic hit-and-run tactics by an enemy, and tactics and acts of sabotage, and limited traditional battles. There were circumstances where the identification of categories such as civilians, combatants, and allied and hostile forces was not always clear cut. It seems that, in those circumstances, some generosity of spirit and some more genuine attempt than what has been apparent by the government to clear up anomalies really ought to be taken. As I said earlier, I would like to recount tales of some circumstances that RAN personnel found themselves in in Malaya to illustrate the sorts of situations that they faced. I have a letter from Keith Davidson, who was in the gunnery division as a quarters armourer. He says: On the 26th July 1957 I was serving onboard the destroyer HMAS ANZAC which was attached to the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency ... On that day the ANZAC carried out bombardment, assisted by Army spotter aircraft, of communist terroristlbandit positions in the Malayan state of Johore. My action station was in ""B"" gun-bay which is a compartment on the deck directly below ""B"" gun turret. My duties were to oversee the non gunnery branch sailors such as cooks, stores staff etc whose action station duties were to manhandle ammunition onto the hydraulic gun loading hoists as directed. ANZAC's main armament 4.5 inch gun ammunition comprises of two sections the shell and the charger which are united just prior to entry into the gun breach for firing. During the bombardment an emergency situation occurred whereby I was instructed, via the ""B"" gun turret loud speaker system, that 'There is a brick and charger dropped into the expended charger compartment, get them out quick.' The ""brick"" is a reference to the 4.5 inch shell, the charger is the brass cylinder containing the cordite which is the propellant, and the expended charger compartment is located in the centre of the gun bay one deck below gun turret and is where the hot expended charges drop. What had occurred was a hydraulic failure. When the gun barrels were in an elevated position the hydraulic operated 'rammer' did not return to the loading position which resulted in the live shell the full cordite charger dropping down the channel and ending up amongst the hot expended chargers. Upon opening the access door to the expended charger compartment I saw the shell lying amongst the hot canisters with its nose cone broken. I also saw the cordite charger with its aluminium cover displaced and sticks of cordite melting amongst the hot expended charges. Being mindful of the consequences and with fear my immediate action was to physically remove the cordite charger and its content before flash point occurred. Given the above situation,'the close proximity of explosives was an extremely dangerous situation which could have resulted in serious damage to the ship by fire and/or explosion and had that occurred it would have most certainly caused serious injury or death, most probably to myself and to the other members of ""B"" gun bay and the ""B"" gun turret crew. Gunnery operations off the Malayan coast were always in the high risk category when conducting bombardments due to the oppressive heat which resulted in serious malfunction of the gunnery hydraulic systems. The malfunctions usually occurred towards the completion of a bombardment after continuous running of machinery. This is an illustration of the real-life situations in which our RAN personnel served. To suggest that that is not a warlike situation or a situation exposing them to considerable danger is clearly nonsense. I have a statement from Joseph Charlton of Devon Hills in Tasmania. He says: While serving in HMAS Quickmatch during the Malayan Emergency 1955-57, sailing in Malayan coastal waters we were either at action stations or at action cruising watches. With the closeness of the shore line we were always in danger of being 'picked off by heavy machine guns which had the capability of both accuracy and range to reach vessels sailing in the coastal shipping lanes. When our ship was in dockyard atHMS Terror, Singapore, we would have sentries posted on the focsle and quarter deck armed with sub-machine guns. Once every hour we would send the clearance diver over the side to inspect the ship's hull above and below the water line for attached mines. I remember having to get the electrical party to have the flood lights rigged to expose the ship's side. Uriderwater lights were rigged to assist the diver and also to assist the sentries in seeing under water for enemy swimmers. Our passive sonar sets were switched on to listen for enemy approaches. When billeted in HMS Terror, we had to take part in duties pertaining to the safety of personnel sleeping and working. Part of these duties were and guarding the peripheral fences of the establishment against terrorist infiltration. Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers had automatics. Ratings usually carried 303 rifles with one of these carrying a submachine gun. When we went ashore from Port Sweatman or Port Dickson, we always went as an armed party. As we were allotted to this operational zone, the ship's company was always aware of the dangers from enemy attacks in these waters or on shore. The list of documentation goes on. I do not intend to read them all on this occasion because I think I have amply illustrated the . point. To suggest that these were not real warlike conditions is wrong. That these people are being denied service recognition for that purpose continues, despite the government's efforts in this regard, to be a very serious anomaly indeed. I tum to the position of the Vietnam naval logistics support personnel. On 9 April, the head of the department's Compensation and Support Division issued an instruction headed 'Extent of operational service with deemed allotment'. The import was that: .. , for deemed allotment cases, the extent of operational service is confined to the day or days when they were in the operational area, and does not extend to the journey from and to Australia. Army personnel have traditionally had the journey to and from Australia counted as part of the period of operational service. The position regarding those who ferried troops and supplies to Vietnam has been contested over the years, with the department favouring a restrictive interpretation. On 22 September 1993, the Federal Court, in the Hawkins case, found against the commission and held that HMAS Sydney was allotted for service from its last port of call in Australia to its first port of call in Australia on return. Consecutive Labor Ministers for Veterans' Affairs provided written confirmation that the government would honour Hawkins. On 16 November 1993, in response to a question on notice, Senator Faulkner replied: Operational service for those members of the Australian Defence Force logistic and support units . . . will now be determined on the same basis as all other members who were allotted for duty operational area. This means that journeys from Australia to and from the operational area will be covered. A subsequent Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Sciacca, substantially confirmed that position. The coalition argues that the 1995 amendments overturned Hawkins and provided the legal basis for its departmental instruction. The tortuous basis for this appears to be the claim that the 1995 reordering of the act means that the reasoning used in the Hawkins judgment can now apply only to units that were actually allotted as opposed to those that were deemed to have been allotted. The coalition's position is dubious on two fronts. Firstly, the relevant amendments were passed as far back as late 1995, yet the departmental instruction that supposedly stems from it was not issued until 9 April this year. I know of no other case where a government has waited over 18 months to draw the Public Service's attention to legislative changes that were allegedly specifically designed to overcome what was considered to be an unfavourable court decision. Secondly, there is no reference in the debates on the 1995 legislation to either the Hawkins judgment or to the position of Vietnam naval logistic support personnel. In his second reading speech, Mr Sciacca described the relevant amendments in the following terms: simplification of the bill; preservation of the original intention and concepts relating to the requirement of danger from hostile enemy forces; the operational area; allotment; and the specific rights of members of units allotted to Korea but who served only in Japan. When the instructions were criticised by ex-service organisations, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) issued a media release in July this year headed, 'No naval veteran to lose any current benefits'. This claimed that no-one 'who has current entitlements to pensions, medical treatment or allowances . . . will lose any of those benefits'. He said 'The Government has made no changes to the rules'. He also observed that 'no ship transporting Australian forces to in an Vietnam was ever attacked by an enemy'-a pointer to his gUilt in this travesty. The minister must either accept full responsibility for the change and the consequent reduction in veterans' entitlements or assume control of his department and direct that the instruction be withdrawn: He cannot seriously expect the ex-service community to believe that Labor is responsible for government decisions made in April 1997. In support of the opposition's position on this matter, I refer to a departmental minute dated 28 July 1997. It stated that the 9 April 1997 instruction will apply 'to all matters where deemed allotment is the issue'. It said that 'it will not matter that in the past a different meaning has been given to the legislation than was intended, no matter that a previous claim had a different period applying'. Clearly, departmental practice changed as from April 1997. The opposition believes that the government should act to restore the entitlements of the naval logistical support personnel to ensure that the journey between Australia and Vietnam is counted as operational service. There are probably a number of ways to do that, most obviously by having the Minister for Defence retrospectively allot the ships concerned. Whatever the government decides to do, it cannot deny responsibility for this situation. It cannot deny that it is assaulting veterans' rights and trying to cover up its own complicity in this or its own responsibility by attacking the previous government. The third area which is subject to amendment from the opposition relates to the circumstances of RAAF personnel in Ubon, Thailand, in the period after the commencement of the Vietnam conflict. To deny that in a real practical sense these people were not involved in the substance of the Vietnam conflict is simply to talk nonsense. To deny that these people were not subject to direct warlike threat is also nonsense. I will just give a brief catalogue of experiences. There was a guerilla attack on the US radar unit in May 1965. Aircraft were fired on from the ground while approaching the airfield. A Thai helicopter was shot down in May 1967. A United States Air Force C130 was hit by ground fire during its approach to land in 1968. Combat experienced US air crew reported 12 separate cases of muzzle flashes or tracers directed at their aircraft from September 1966 to March 1968. An enemy MiG 21 identified and chased by two RAAF Sabres from Ubon was shot down by a missile from a US Air Force Phantom in January 1967. An unmarked C123 was identified on 1 December 1965. The list goes on. To suggest, as the government does, that these RAAF personnel were not experiencing warlike conditions is simply a nonsense. The government ought to honour its election commitment to tidy up the anomalies once and for all and ensure that justice is done to our veteran community.",103
118,Mr NAIRN,PAIRS,"I am very pleased to speak to this piece of very important legislation, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997, and I am sure that, in doing so, I will have the support of many of my constituents in Eden-Monaro. I say that confidently because I have quite a large population of veterans living throughout my electorate-in particular, along the coastal area, where many of them live in splendid retirement. I am also confident in that I have had constituents make representations to me since my becoming a federal member on a number of the issues that are addressed in this legislation. I will return to that aspect later. The three specific amendments to this legislation are, firstly, to extend the eligibility of certain benefits to armed forces personnel who served in some overseas deployments, and these benefits will include defence service home loans; secondly, to allow all disability pensioners and their war widows or widowers the possibility of an advance of a lump sum payment of up to $500; and, thirdly, to limit Commonwealth liability for injury and death to service personnel 'due solely to tobacco use commencing or occurring after 31 December 1997. The first part of this amendment is particularly important. As background comment, I should point out that currently there are two categories of pensions and benefits: operational service and qualifying service. Operational service refers to service overseas in a clearly defined area during a war or similar operation. Under this category, personnel are eligible for a disability pension for injuries, disease or death where it can be attributed to that service. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Travelling Allowance",107
119,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Just before question time this afternoon, the former Minister for Administrative Services, Mr David Jull, handed me a signed statement by Mr John Sutherland, his senior adviser, which contained suggestions that some material relating to the matters which led to the resignation of the former minister and the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development had been conveyed to two members of my staff in May of this year. Those two staff members were Mr Grahame Morris and Ms Fiona MCKenna. I am this afternoon sending the document to the Auditor-General, and it follows from what I said in the House at question time that it is open to the Auditor General to interview any member of my staff regarding what is contained in the document. May I again affirm to the House and categorically assert without qualification that I personally knew nothing of these matters until the past few days. I can also inform the House that the staff members in question have affirmed to me that they had no discussions with me about these matters in Mayor, indeed, until the past few days. I should also inform the House that the provisional advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), which I obtained this afternoon, is that it would not be appropriate, on grounds of possible prejudice, for the statement signed by Mr Sutherland to be tabled at this time. I should also say to the House, given the statements I made yesterday, that, in the lead-up to the resignations of the two ministers, I had a number of discussions with both the former Minister for Administrative Services and Mr Sutherland, and at. no stage during those discussions was any suggestion made by either of them that any member of my staff had been given prior knowledge these matters or had been involved in prior discussions. The relevance of that is that context of some of those discussions involve inquiries from me of the former minister as why information had not been conveyed to me about these matters. I felt it necessary, having got the document and having discussed the matter with my two staff members and, in the interests of fairness, given them an opportunity to comment, that the House should be informed. I do not wish to canvass the various recollections because I think that does also go to the possible questions of prejudice. But I wanted the House to be aware of that material. I repeat: it will be sent to the Auditor-General, and all stages I am utterly and completely comoccurred mitted to an open inquiry.",107

The Prime Minister should not just having the open inquiry, which we welcome; he should be considering his position I would also like to know where the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) is.

122,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to take advantage of this strated adjournment debate to speak briefly about local football team, the Gold Coast Chargers. This team has come from relative obscurity to considerable notoriety during the last season, of and we on the Gold Coast are very proud of its achievements. Its coach, Phil Economidis, the was named coach of the year, which was a great tribute not only to him but also to the to team. Mr Economidis came to the Gold Coast also from relative obscurity to achieve prominence. He has done that in the Gold Coast community and has had remarkable success with the Chargers rugby league team. Over the last 12 months there has been considerable disarray in the rugby league community at large. There has been disruption caused to the game by the separation into the two competitions. No matter whose side you take in the debate, the result has been disappointing for the sport. I think it has led in part at to the disappointing attendances that have at many of the games throughout the year. The Gold Coast Chargers deserve to continue in the competition in their own right. has Members mayor may not be aware of the end of proposal to amalgamate the Gold Coast Chargers with the South Queensland Crushers. We do not necessarily object to that amalgamation if it is in the best interests of the ARL But what the Premier of Queensland, certainly the Gold Coast City Council and I are expecting is that the team will be continue to be known as the Gold Coast Chargers and that it will continue to play tonight. regularly at the Carrara stadium. Over the years, the Gold Coast based team has had a chequered history. It has had a into number of owners, a number of names, a number of home grounds and a number of fairly dismal performances in the competition. All of that has now changed. The Gold Coast community has demonstrated over the last season that it has the capacity to deliver very large crowdsÂ· to our home games at Carrara, which incidentally is where I happen to live. In fact, I can walk to the game. But I must say that that is not the reason I am necessarily concerned about it. The fact is that the Gold Coast has demonthat it has the capacity to support a my team in the ARL competition. We have done that with some very substantial interest in home games. We have also demonstrated with some substantial interest in our away from home games.

As I understand it, the arrangement that Gold Coast City Council entered into with ARL was one that in effect guaranteed that the team would continue to play at that dium until the end of the 1998 season. The Gold Coast City Council has spent a very repayment. large amount of money on upgrading the facility.

The claim for is incorrect. My records show that I was at my home at Nambrok; therefore it is the a wrong payment of $145. On 16 July 1996, I did indeed charter to Canberra this day from West Sale. The claim from Melbourne is incorrect as my records show that I was in Canberra. There was a wrong payment of Consequently, there is a $420 overpayThe claim for Melbourne on 5 August 1996 is correct.

After voluntarily repaying $9,000 of taxpayers' funds, I now find that I will give another $1,462, being the charter of $1,042 and $420 travelling allowance.

We now have a circumstance of corruption involved in the cover-up of these travel allowances-the Priine Minister's Travelgate. We now have evidence' of this involving the Prime Minister's office. From the Prime Minister's own mouth we learned that his senior political adviser knew of the secret repayment by John Sharp back in May. It beggars belief that that would not have been conveyed to the Prime Minister or acted upon through the Prime Minister. One final point I make is this. Grahame Morris, the Prime Minister's adviser, is not accountable to this parliament; it is the Prime Minister who is accountable to the nation.

135,Mr BRERETON,ADJOURNMENT,"This afternoon in this House we have witnessed the most incredible end to an incredible week which has bathed this government in absolute shame and the nation in disarray. There has been a series of revelations that no-one on either side of this House could possibly have believed could have been the case had we not been here and heard them for ourselves. The very sequence of events, starting with the revelations on Channel 9 about the coverup of more than $8,700 in false, fraudulent claims by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)which were hidden away by the former Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) in his administration-leads to the knowledge we have now that this could never have been made public to the people of Australia were it not for the fact that it was leaked and the subject of that broadcast. We have seen the questioning that has occurred since that fateful evening, and we have seen revelation after revelation. The press today were carrying the story about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his actions in stepping in so speedily and swiftly-his outstanding demonstration, many people said today, of leadership. And ringing in their ears were his words, spoken here in this parliament only yesterday. He said: I should also inform the House that I was not informed of these matters when the adjustments were made in May of this year. Given the circumstances, that also was an oversight which should not have occurred. That was ringing in everyone's ears. People have a right to be able to believe a Prime Minister, briefed since last Saturday-when he returned from the South Pacific Forum-in respect of these matters. He went on to say later in question time, in answer to another question from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley): I might also, in the interests of full disclosure, make it plain that I knew nothing, as I said in my earlier statement, about these repayments of this money or about these matters when these events occurred. These are the words of a Prime Minister, and the people of Australia have a right to be able to believe their Prime Minister. And yet this afternoon, at the eleventh hour, when there is no time left for the debate, and the parliament has resumed, we have this dog's act by the Prime Minister, who comes into this chamber and reveals the memorandum, saying that the knowledge has been in his office, amongst his best friends, his two closest confidants, for a matter of months. Mr Bevis-His most senior adviser.",110
136,Mr BRERETON,ADJOURNMENT,"His most senior adviser. I am reminded of those words of Paul Keating when he quoted the words of Mr Howard who was then Leader of the Opposition: We want to assert the very principle that the is absolute, the truth is supreme and the truth is never disposable in national public life. By golly, it is not going to be in the course of the days and weeks ahead in this parliament. What we have seen is a shameful performance from a Prime Minister-and one that must surely cost him his job. Let us make it absolutely clear. This coverup, this conspiracy to keep the truth from the people of Australia, did not stop with the former minister for transport or with the administration of the former Minister for Administrative Services; it went right to the very top, to the pinnacle. And there is only one way, in the national interest, that this matter can be resolved properly-that is, not with an Auditor-General' s report but with a full and open judicial inquiry, armed with the full powers of a royal commission, able to take evidence on oath and to compel witnesses to give evidence. That is the only way that national honour can be restored. That is the only way that transparency can be returned to government in this nation. If they are not prepared to announce it today, surely in the course of the next two days they will be forced to. The name that is ringing in all our ears is the former leader of another great nation, one Richard Nixon, who was dragged kicking and screaming into resignation.

137,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT,"What incredible cant and hypocrisy from the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). You must think we have short memories, Laurie. To hear Laurie Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith, talking about standards must be one of the great political jokes of 1997. What incredible tactics you have over there to talk on the question of standards and to put up none other than the member for Kingsford-Smith. We remember you and your mate Keating, the part-owner of the piggery. We remember Keating and his mate Warren Anderson receiving FIRB permission to sell Tipperary truth to Indonesians when Keating was the Treasurer. We remember the former Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, who negotiated for the Australian National Audit Office to move to Centenary House, the Labor Party's national headquarters, to get the ALP a windfall in rent. We remember Richo, the bloke who boasts that, as a minister, he lied to the Australian people, a director of 2HD when he was the Minister for Transport and Communications and the bloke who was on the phone contacting the President of the Marshall Islands on Simon's behalf. You must think we have short memories. For you to talk to us about standards is incredible hypocrisy. Mr Melham interjecting",111

141,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Who are honest, who are open, who are transparent and who, when issues need to be presented to the parliament, do so without delay-in fact, in this particular event on the very day. As stunned as they may be on the other side-because in the 13 years that you were in you never saw a Prime Minister come in as our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did today and be a person of his word, something which this country has cried out for for a very long period of time-it should not be forgotten that this issue started with Senator Mal Colston, who was a Labor senator. It should never be forgotten that advice was given to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) when Labor was in office that the circumstances surrounding the Colston matter should be referred to the Federal Police. What a contrast it makes to the transparent way in which this government has dealt with these issues in the time that we have been in office for people to remember back to when Labor was in office and dealing with the very person whose conduct has initiated these series of events. No-one could be more guilty of a cover-up than the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition back in those times. When you think of the events of yesterday, it was right and proper for David Jull to say, as he tendered his resignation, what irony it was that he tendered his resignation within 10 days of putting in a system which will provide transparency, openness and honesty in the dealings of the parliament in respect of travel allowance claims. I am glad he said that, because it was the Labor Party that was the cause of the problem, it was the Labor Party as they went after a Labor rat that gave these issues public prominence, yet it was this coalition government that knew what needed to be done, did the right thing and has put in place a set of standards and a set of processes which should have been put in years and years ago but was not as you protected your mates. So do not stand and give us your cant and hypocrisy . We have memories that go back longer than the last 18 months. We know what you were like in office. (Time expired) Travelling Allowance",111
142,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT,"We have just heard the start of the leadership challenge. We have just heard Peter Reith staking his claim when the death rattle is round for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). And what has caused this death rattle? We have the Travelgate affair engulfing the Howard government. In terms of the analogies with Watergate, make no mistake about this: Grahame Morris is the Bob Haldeman of John Howard's office, MCKenna is the Ehrlichman of John Howard's office and the scalps that we are collecting are all the President's men. We have a circumstance admitted by the Prime Minister today at 5.25 p.m., five minutes before closure at the end of a sitting week. This is the new openness of government by John Howard, sneaking into the House hoping to get his statement on the record whilst the debate concludes. This is the person who, from his own lips today, admitted before question time that he was aware that Grahame Morris had this information back in May. Why didn'the fess up in question time? Why has he waited until the end of the night to slink in here and scurry out? Where is he in this building at the moment? If he is watching, I challenge him to come back into this place and make a full explanation as to why, if he knew before question time, he did not fess up. The reason he will not fess up is he hopes the problem goes away. Have you ever known this Prime Minister to delve? This is a Prime Minister who, so long as he is told, 'It is all under control, we have fixed the problem,' doesn't even ask the question. But here he is today standing by his Minister MCGauran, who, within two hours of repeating his statement that nothing had been done wrong, nothing had been claimed wrongly, is in here admitting to four false claims. And why four false claims? Because we put all four to him. There are more to come. So I say to you that the Prime Minister's code of conduct is in tatters. It is only applied when we enforce it. It is only applied when he gets caught out. The circumstances are these: even if the argument is that he knew on Sunday-and he has admitted that about John Sharp--why didn'the come into the House on Monday or seek the answers on Monday of John Sharp that he was forced to accept on Wednesday? This is a Prime Minister who, frankly, is not up to it; a Prime Minister who will moralise but who will not act; a Prime Minister whose own office is steeped in the cover-up of hidden repayments because his ministers have been into falsely claiming they are in places that they are not. This is a circumstance that demands a full and open judicial inquiry. The Auditor General's inquiry is not enough. Opening that up to the Auditor-General is not enough-we want a full and open judicial inquiry with the ability to take evidence, to hear it on oath, that we can get before the public what they try to hide from the people in this parliament. What is the most pathetic excuse of the lot is to say that his own chief of staff, Grahame Morris, knew back in May but to swear on a stack of bibles, 'I did not know and he did not tell me.' This beggars belief. We know the relationship between Grahame Morris and John Howard. We have read about it in The Victory. We know of Morris's association through DDB Needham and that shabby deal associated with letting the contract for guns. But let me say here that we are not going to have Grahame Morris alone become the scapegoat. He is not accountable to this parliament, he is not elected by the people to this parliamentMr O'Connor-But his leader is.",112

When the action happened, the member for Hotham wasn't even here. You look at the record of those that are on the front bench and you look at Labor and you think, 'Here are these pious people, these upholders of integrity and honesty.' After all, remember Mal Colston. Let us run through the record. Remember Gary Punch, minister for aviation, when he was trying to block the second parallel runway at Kingsford Smith airport? We have the former Speaker, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), one so of those great advocates of propriety. Rememberthat compensation bill? I wonder how his elbow is? If you are going to try to bay for blood in this place, what you have to do is at least know what you are talking about. To start off with, we have two cries this afternoon. One is for the resignation of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), according to the Labor Party. The other is that there should at least be a judicial inquiry. I can tell those in the opposition that, when it comes to an Auditor General's report, there is no better basis to establish the facts. The Labor Party seems to feel there is something odd in coming to the House and doing as the Prime Minister didagreeing to have a full and proper open scrutiny, as there is through an Auditor General's report, into factors of which he has only just become aware. It is important that people put in contrast the fair and open way in which the Prime Minister has enabled a true scrutiny not only of ministerial but of members' travel allowances. He is not only looking at the superficialityMr Kelvin Thomson-So he briefed Laurie Oakes, did he?",113
147,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,"Chequebook journalism has been around a long time. I can tell you that that same Laurie Oakes revealed a budget a few years ago, and I have often wondered who paid what for it. As far as the actual circumstances tonight are concerned, what the people of Australia need to know is that this government has put in place practices which Labor tried to conceal. What did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) do when the records of Mal Colston first came to knowledge? He allowed Mal Colston to pay the money back. Senator Colston should have gone through the same scrutiny that the Prime Minister is ensuring that all the members of this House go through. Don't forget the sandwich shop affair. Don't forget the whole of the whiteboard affair. Don't forget Senator Richardson and don't forget the Marshall Islands. Don't forget Senator Bolkus. But think how long it took. We had it day after day, week after week. The former member for Canberra with the whiteboard: that took, what, a fortnight? It took a year-day after day. We had the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in this House pretending all was well. What happened this week? We lost two excellent ministers, the former Minister for Administrative Services and the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development. They lost their places only because they had the integrity to immediately acknowledge there were errors in what they did. It is a sad and sorry day in parliament when there seems to be a propensity to judge people before they are found to be guilty and, as far as I am concerned and as far as the people are concerned, the Auditor-General's report is where this matter should be left.",113

(2) Will he have the pamphlet referred to in part (1)(c) widely distributed. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) (a) Yes. It has proven difficult for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to determine appropriate criteria for what constitutes a serious deficiency in terms of providing meaningful advice to consumersHowever, I expect CAS A will soon be in a position to provide a report covering several months of this year.

(2) Yes, it is intended to be distributed through the major airlines. and travel agents. Defence Establishments: Aboriginal Community Negotiations (Question No. 2076) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Does his Department negotiate with local Aboriginal communities on matters concerning access rights, living areas and sacred site protection at Defence training areas and other Defence establishments; if so, what arrangements have been negotiated for each training area or establishment. (2) Who is responsible for negotiating arrangements on behalf of his Department. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Defence acknowledges the need for protection and conservation of culturally significant sites and supports the provision of access onto or through Defence property for the purpose of assessing, maintaining or visiting such sites. Other forms of access such as permanent or long term occupation of camps or out-stations, and hunting or fishing activities are not generally compatible with Defence management of the training areas. The nature of activity undertaken by Defence on training areas, and the requirement to exercise duty of care, dictates the necessity for controlled access. Determination of a right to access is assessed against possible conflict with Defence use of the property and is guided by safety considerations. Access to a site for cultural, educational or ceremonial purposes will generally be granted provided no military activity is impeded. If there is an obvious hazard in accessing a particular site, for example, as a result of the possible presence of unexploded ordnance, escorted access will be considered. Where range management plans are being prepared or revised for specific training areas, it is common practice to include a cultural heritage assessment and to seek input through consultation with representatives of interested groups. In such cases, Defence representation is normally provided by local Defence staff. Where more substantial access is being sought, representatives of Defence Estate Organisation and other government agencies are usually involved in negotiations. Formal access arrangemenfs are in place covering Shoal water Bay Training Area and RAAF Base Scherger in Queensland; Yampi Training Area in West Australia; Beecroft Weapons Range in New South Wales and Larrakeyah Barracks and Kangaroo Flats Training Area in the Northern Territory. Where military training activity does not preclude the granting of access, that access is granted following notification to the local Base Commander or Range Control organisation. The terms and conditions of these arrangements essentially form the basis for other arrangements under negotiation and for periodic grants of access to other Defence properties. Other access arrangements are currently being negotiated over the Delamere Range Facility in the Northern Territory, following an Aboriginal Land Claim over that area, and the Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, Queensland, in relation to proposed environmental and archaeological studies, and Point Wilson in Victoria. (2) The Head of the Defence Estate Organisation or his representative is responsible for negotiating aboriginal access arrangements. Nuclear Fuel Rods: Transportation (Question No. 2086) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) will transport additional nuclear fuel rods from its Lucas Heights reactor; if so, is the Minister able to say (a) how many rods will be transported, (b) to where will the rods be transported and (c) wh-at will be the means of transport. (2) Will the Government implement environmental impact procedures; if so, what. (3) Will ANSTO consult with local governments and federal and State members prior to transportation; if so, how. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (a) Approximately 1989. (b) 689 to the United States and 1300 to the United Kingdom. (c) The means of transport will be by road transport to the port of Sydney, by marine transport to the United States and United Kingdom. The mode of transport within the US and UK is not yet finalised. (2) Yes. The proposal to repatriate fuel rods to the US has been designated by the Minister for Science and Technology under the Administrative Procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (the EPIP Act). The level of environmental impact assessment will be determined by the Minister for the Environment when necessary information is available to enable a decision to be made. The proposal to return spent fuel elements to the UK has not yet been designated under the EPIP Act. (3) Prior to and during the 1996 shipment of spent fuel elements to the UK discussions were held with relevant local and State government agencies. It is anticipated that similar discussions will also occur with future shipments. HMAS Sydney: Vietnam Medal (Question No. 2134) Mr Sawford asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: Will the Government award the Vietnam Medal to the former crew of HMAS Sydney; if so, when. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Vietnam Medal was instituted in 1968 to recognise service in the operational area of Vietnam during the period 29 May 1964 and 27 January 1973. The medal is awarded for service of twenty eight days afloat in operations on inland waters or off the coast of Vietnam, one or more days on the posted strength of a unit or formation on land in Vietnam, or one operational sortie over Vietnam, or Vietnamese waters, by aircrew on the posted strength of a unit allocated for direct support of operations in Vietnam. The Vietnam Medal was also awarded for service of thirty days, continuous or aggregate, for official visits, inspections or occurrences of a temporary nature. The conditions for the Vietnam Medal, therefore, differentiate between persons posted to units stationed in the operational area of Vietnam and those who served in the area on duties of a temporary nature. HMAS Sydney did not operate in the Vietnam area of operations, other than on visits of a temporary nature in logistic support of operations, such as the loading and unloading of troops and supplies. It was not stationed in the area to provide combat support operations. Accordingly, for those of the crew of HMAS Sydney, thirty days service, continuous or aggregated, in the operational area was required for the award of the Vietnam Medal. The Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal was instituted in 1993, following strong representations from various service and ex-service groups, including the HMAS Sydney Association. The medal is awarded for service of one day or more in support of the Australian armed forces in the area of operations of Vietnam, as a member of the crew of a ship or aircraft, while attached (a visit) to a unit or organisation, or serving as an observer. The eligibility period is also between 29 May 1964 and 27 January 1973. Accordingly, where former members of HMAS Sydney have not met the qualifying period of 30 days for the Vietnam Medal, they qualify for the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal. This Government does not, therefore, intend reviewing matters in relation to the award of the Vietnam Medal to crews of HMAS Sydney, particularly as the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal was instituted for such service on the basis of veterans' submissions, including former crew members of HMAS Sydney. Cleaner Production Program (Question No. 2140) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the UN Cleaner Production Program. (2) Is the Government implementing that or another program to achieve cleaner production by industry; if so, what is the nature of the Government's program. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) The Government completed the successful Cleaner Production Program in May 1997. This program drew on aspects of the UN Cleaner other Production Program. The Government in conjunc. tion with the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) is developing a National Strategy for Cleaner Production. This Strategy when complete, in early 1998, will provide direction for future Commonwealth activities. Perth Career Reference Centre: Psychologist (Question No. 2148) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 26 August 1997: (1) Does the Minister's Department employ a psychologist at the Perth Career Reference Centre to assist young unemployed persons. (2) If so, is the psychologist employed on a full time basis; if not, for how many hours each week is the psychologist employed. (3) Is there a waiting list for appointments to see the psychologist. (4) For how long do persons have to wait for an appointment. (5) What services does the psychologist provide. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) The psychologist is employed for 7.3 hours a week. (3) Yes. (4) The waiting time currently is between two to four weeks. (5) A counselling service is provided. The purpose is to gather personal and employment information and then to apply this to career alternament tives and training options. Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation: EIS Auditor (Question No. 2160) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 27 August 1997: (1) Is the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) auditor of the environmental impact statement (EIS) for Sydney's second airport; if so, has SMEC been restricted to viewing the EIS in a secure room in the company of an official from his Department. (2) Are the auditors only permitted to view a single draft copy; if so, why. (3) Are the auditors permitted to copy the draft copy referred to in part (2); if not, why not. (4) Are the auditors required to convey all of their auditing material to the locked room. (5) Were the auditors required to sign confidentiality undertakings; if so, are those undertakings now not strong enough. (6) Will the EIS be released for public viewing; if so, when. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1),(2),(3),(4) and (5) The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC Australia Ltd) is the independent auditor for the EIS for Sydney's second airport. In view of the high sensitivity of the EIS, tight security arrangements have applied to all Governagencies and consultants given access to the drafts. These arrangements included a requirement that all the consultants' sign confidentiality agreements. To assist SMEC undertake its audit role, the Department of Transport and Regional Development established and staffed a data room less than a block away from SMEC's offices in North Sydney. The data room was used extensively by the audit team. These arrangements applied between 28 July and 22 August 1997. Similar security arrangements applied in Canberra for staff of Transport and Regional Development portfolio agencies. On 22 August 1997, the data room arrangements ceased and SMEC received three copies of the draft documents for use at their own premises. (6) On 3 September 1997, the Government announced the elimination of Holsworthy options from the EIS process. The EIS process will now focus on the three Badgerys Creek options and the Draft EIS will be released as soon as practicable, for a twelve week public exhibition period.",156
