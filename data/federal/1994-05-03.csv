4,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege which concerns the conduct some weeks ago of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). I should inform the House that I notified the Minister for Industrial Relations that I would be raising a matter of privilege affecting him. The matter of privilege arises out of an article in the Australian Financial Review of 29 March 1994, written by Pamela WiIIiaf!1s, the national correspondent of the Australian Financial Review. It concerns recent appointments to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Briefly, the' article recounted that there had been much speculation about who would be appointed to the positions of deputy president of the commission-one position dealing with enterprise bargaining and the other position dealing with the superintendency of the award section of the commission. It was widely rumoured in industrial relaThis tions circles that one Roger Boland, who the industrial relations director of the Trades Industry Association of Australia, . in fact the favoured candidate of the minister for the position of deputy president in chargof the ba:rgaining division. But that before Mr Boland gave evidence before Senate committee investigating the provisions of the government's legislation. During that sworn evidence, Mr Boland raised a number of concerns about the legislation, was generally critical of aspects of it flick by the mlnister. and, from his vast industrial relationsexperience, cast doubt upon whether it would raise achieve the ends that the government had mind. Apparently that was too much for the minister; and I will come in a: moment to why that is relevant to my submission. I take verbatim the article of Pamela Williams: But four weeks ago, Mr Bolaild's telephone It was Mr Brereton. He explained that while Boland was the plum for the job, there was a problem. And the problem was Mr Boland's position before the Senate inquiry in stirring up Senate. opposition to the legislation. Mr Brereton said he would think about the problem. The next day, a press release was issued announcing Mr Rossstraight out of the ACTU officeas head of the bargaining division, and路 Mr MCIntyre, a partner at B1-ke Dawson Waldron, as 'head of the award division. A traditional Labor knee-capping. Mr Boland still believes the legislation represents lost opportunities. What is material is the conditions that govern the molestation of witnesses before parliamenwas tary committee inquiries. There are general provisions as路 you, MJ;' Speaker, would aware under the privileges legislation and also what one might call the common tion upon this House and upon the Senate to protect people from inteiference and to protect witnesses in giving evidence. One of those the subject of a resolution that was agreed by .another chamber.. Under the 'Molestation of witnesses', it is couched in the following terms: 11. A person shaH not inflict any penalty or injury upon, or deprive of any benefit, another person on account of any evidence given or to be路 given before the Senate or a committee. is a very clear case where a penalty has is been imposed. It is obvious that the minister Metal was going to appoint Mr Boland to the was position, and I can inform the House that I have spoken to Mr Boland about this matter and he confirms the substance of the article was written by Pamela Williams. There is no a doubt that he was dumped by the minister because he had the honesty, perhaps the temerity, to actually give his bona fide view before the Senate committee and for his pains, . despite his vast experience, he was given the . Some of those opposite may wonder why I it here. One of the reasons I raise it here in is that I put it to the parliament that this House has a clear duty, and its Committee of Privileges has a clear responsibility to investiup gate this kind of conduct by a member of this House. But there is another even more comrang. pelling reason: this government has made it Mr abundantly clear that under no circumstances will it submit itself in the person of its senior members in any way to the jurisdiction of the To those opposite who might say that this is just a matter for the Senate, I say that it is obviously a matter for the Senate but it is also a matter for this.House, because it concerns the conduct of somebody in this House who Tony has behaved like a thug in dealing with this . particular person. I think it is a matter that ought to be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges. I invite you, sir, to investigate my claim that there has been a breach of privilege. It is clearly the路 case that this man punished because he had the temerity to give his view and to fulfil his obligations as be a witness before the Senate committee. The minister has breached privilege and I think he law obligaought to be investigated.",11

7,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES," I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to implement the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law to make much needed reforms of the law relating to search, arrest and related matters for the investigation of most Commonwealth offences. These areas of the law have been the subject of careful examination by the Australian Law Reform Commission'in its report entitled Criminal investigation, and more recently by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law established by Mr Bowen as Attorney-General and chaired by theRt. Hon. Sir Harry Gibbs. The bill closely follows the recommendations made by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law in its fourth and fifth interim reports. The review committee made recommendations to modernise Commonwealth law to ensure that technological advances are taken into account by these laws and the increased awareness of the need for parliamentAn incident having occurred in the gallery",16
8,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! Would an attendant please remove that gentleman from the gallery.,16
9,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"1 was indicating that the review committee made recommendations to modernise Commonwealth law arid to ensure that both technological advances are taken into account by these laws and the increased awareness of the need for parliament to state clearly the balance considered appropriate between the community interests in effective law enforcement and the maintenance of individual rights and freedoms. To date laws in this area haye been contained in numerous Commonwealth statutes, state and territory laws applied by the Judiciary Act, police each instructions or generaJ orders and case law. This has led to considerable uncertainty and inaccessibility of the law. The bill provides for a comprehensive substi- scheme for obtaining and executing search warrants, including telephone warrants, stopping and searching conveyances, arrest and related matters such as personal searches, taking and destroying fingerprints, holding identification parades and other identification procedures. It sets out the powers and obligations of police when carrying out any of these procedures and spells out the many safeguards that are designed to protect the rights of individuals. Right from the beginning of its development, which can be traced back to the 1975 Australian Law Reform Commission report on criminal investigation, this bill was always going to involve a delicate balancing of about civil liberties and law enforcement efficiency. Therefore, it did not surprise me that following its consideration by a parliamentary committee the need for amendments would arise. The Senate amendments, which emerged from the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and subsequent discussions with the opposition and the Australian Democrats, have in my view produced well balanced amendments which should be acceptable to this House. I want to convey my thanks for the courteous and intelligent way in which all those involved in the development of the amendments conducted themselves. I believe that the manner in which all members and senators have - approached this bill has produced a quality. result which will serve Australians well for many years to come. Today I expect this parHament to pass the amendments and in doing so achieve a much needed reform of the law which has eluded governments for at least 18 years. The key amendments are as follows: insertion of a requirement on the person applying for a warrant to provide details of previous appHcations for a warrant and the outcome in relation to the same personal premises which are the subject of the appHcation, which is designed to combat forum shopping; extension of the occupier's right to remain present when items taken from premises are examined so as to determine whether they are within the scope of the search warrant, which previously was restricted to electronically stored informadecision tion; insertion of an entitlement for occupiers to be present where a search warrant is being executed, which was suggested by the Senate standing committee as a measure to reduce the opportunity for planting material; a Hmitation on the requirement for suspects and witnesses to provide their names and addresses to poHce. It also proposes that this requirethe ment only apply to indictable offences. The amendments also contain: inclusion of a provision requiring police to provide receipts for'items seized-currently police do this in accordance with internal procedures but the Senate considered this important enough to be considered in the act; improvement of the provisions relating to children and incapable people. While the bill had safeguards to protect thesepeople,such as the presence of parents and guardians and the requirement for parental/guardian or personal representative's consent, the amendments provide for greater input from the child or incapable person but use the court to protect the child or incapable person where agreement cannot be reached in relation to their participation in a procedure such as a strip search, the taking of identification material like fingerprints, or participation in an identification parade. These amendments are necessarily involved, given variations on the types of procedures and the circumstances, for instance where the child is a suspect or victim. The amendments arose as a result of the submission from the National Children's and Youth Law Centre to the Senate standing committee. The amendments also remove a provision which provided that where a suspect refused to participate in an identification parade the court or jury might draw such inferences from that refusal as appear proper. The amended provision states that the comnion law position will apply with respect to this matter. Under the common law there can be no inference drawn as to the guilt of a person from refusal, but evidence of the refusal may be given to demonstrate why the prosecution used alternative means of identification. There is a requirement that a legal representative of a person be present at the time the is made as to whether the suspect will take part in an identification parade. Previously, the bill provided that the presence of such persons was required during the holding of the parade. The protection given by their presence is needed earlier when the decision to participate is made. The decision to refuse could have adverse consequences for defence case as it could lead to the use of alternative, less satisfactory methods of identification. The amendments also include additional notifications to ensure that those having deaHngs with the poHce under the legislation are fully informed of their rights and provide for the specific exclusion of the application of state and territory forensic samples legislation where it relates to the. taking of identification material. For ease of understanding, I present a revised explanatory memorandum which incorporates the various amendments, and I commend the amendments to the House.",16
10,Mr WILLIAMS,COMMITTEES,"Tangney) (12.51 p.m.)When I spoke on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill in the second reading debate I indicated that, in principle, the codification of powers and safeguards relating to the search, arrest and other matters in the investigation of most Commonwealth offences in the bill had much to commend it. I indicated, however, that it appeared to be desirable that the detail of the bi1l be given further consideration with an opporturiity for pubHc input. At that time, I moved that the bill be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for review. The particular concern at that time was the absence of comment from interested groups. This arose, I suggested, because of the time of the introduction of the bill, which was just prior to the House rising for the ChristmasHouse New Year vacation and when the focus of House was almost entirely on the debate on Lavarch), the Native Title Bill. The second reading debate took place on the first day of return, on 1 February 1994. I pointed out that many volunteer groups do not function during the Christmas-New Year holiday period and that cases. volunteer groups have the greatest input in terms of community interest on a bill of this nature. My motion received some support from the government side in that the chairman of the House committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), earnestly implored the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to seriously consider the motion. Unfortunately, the, minister did not accede to the motion and, the basis of the government numbers, the matter went to the Senate without being referred to the House committee for review. At the time, coalition members indicated that, if the matter were not referred to a House com'mittee, it would be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitusubject tional Affairs. In due course, that occurred. and arrest. The various amendments which the minister is now so pleased to support were passed a result of a process which could have occurgave red in this House but which occurred in face of government opposition in the Senate. The level of interest in the provisions bill can be seen from the report of the Senate standing committee. Nine written submissions were received from a variety of bodies, including the Law Council of Australia, law societies, civil libertarian organisations more than one state, individual legal practiwhen tioners and others interested in, for example, youth affairs. Seven witnesses gave oral evidence to the Senate committee, only of whom had provided written submissions. The committee delivered a 19-page report name dealing with a wide variety of criticisms the provisions of the bill, and bill is an extensive letter from the minister in which he dealt with criticisms under approximately 30 headings. . I submit that this vindicates the position taken by the coalition. It is unfortunate that the reference .of bills' to committees of this has almost never occurred. I hope that the the action of the Attorney-General (Mr in agreeing to refer the Interriational War Crimes Tribunal Bill .to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, is a precedent which will be followed, in many appropriate The members of the House standing committees represent a significant resource of experience and talent particularly in the case of a bill of which the one under debate is an example. A bill can be significantly improved by detailed consideration in a committee. The opportunity for community input in similarly appropriate cases is also of great valueThe amendments that have been returned on from the Senate are not opposed by the coalition. They were agreed to in the Senate. The amendments, in the main, address civil libertarian concerns along with provisions of the original version of the. bill. The amendments make a variety of changes,protecting the rights and interests of persons who are to the powers of investigation, search . One point to be noted for the purpose of the as record in this House is that Senator Bolkus an undertaking on behalf of the govern the ment in the Senate committee debate in relation to an amendment that was proposed of the by Senator Spindler and later withdrawn foIlowing the undertaking. The amendment was to the effect that a notice detailing information and rights would be provided to the occupier of premises entered pursuant to in a warrant. The amendment was withdrawn the minister undertook that the form of warrant to be used' and given to an occupier will enumerate the rights contained in the two amendment. The amendments required that the notice provide such information as the of the issuing officer, the address of the of premises and a clear statement of the appended to the occupier's rights. This House has important functions to perfonn in the scrutiny of legislation. If the course proposed by the coalition had been followed, this House would have properly fulfilled its functions instead of leaving if to the Senate to do the job that the House should have done.",17
11,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"We on this side of the House are in a position to say to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), 'We told you so.' In the second reading debate I pointed out: The minister is on notice. from a wide group of respected people who have no political axe to that there are some problems with this legislation. The minister refused to accept our position that this matter should be either left to lie on the table or referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal arid Constitutional Affairs. As the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) pointed out, the honourable member for Banks (Mr . Melham) supported our suggestion. The government makes a very great play of criticising the Senate, at times even seeking to abolish it. I am mindful of the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has referred to senators as 'unrepresentative swill' and as 'pansies'. The effect of the minister's refusal to accept the recommendation that this matter be sent to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is that the equivalent Senate committee has had to do our job for us. As the honourable member for Tangney has said, there were nine written submissions to the Senate committee. Oral evidence was taken and a 19-page report was handed down. An ounce of prevention is better than a ton of cure. This debate jsquite unnecessary. Had the government and the minister followed the procedure that was later followed by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in relation to the war crimes bill we would not be discussing this matter in the House today. I hope the minister takes on board what has occurred and endeavours to use the House of Representatives committee system more than it has been used in the past. It is an absolute disgrace that this House has abrogated its responsibilities in these areas in favour of Senate committees.  wish to take up the time of the House for very long. Obviously, the coalition's stance on this issue has been vindicated by the government's accepting a large number of the amendments of both the coalition and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. I did speak on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill on 1 February. I spoke about some concerns I had with the bill, such as proposed section 3E(2), grind which gives police the power to seek a search warrant to search an individual person; proposed section 3D, which creates an offence of failure to supply a name and address; and proposed section 3ZA, which gives police the power to enter premises without a warrant to arrest. I think it is worth noting that, had the government accepted'the advice of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and referred the matter to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, some of the time that has been wasted on this bill could have been averted and some of the work of the Senate, which is inundated with referrals with respect to legislation, could also have been saved. The Senate obtained a referral and, as we know, it has made significant amendments to the bill which have been accepted by the government. The government should be congratulated on making that decision and not stringing out the matter any longer. The coalition's stance was vindicated right from the beginning. The honourable member for Tangney had discussions with the Minister for .Justice (Mr Kerr) about our concerns. Obviously, the government shared some of those concerns. I wish the government had listened to the honourable member for Tangney more clearly and followed the obviously wise advice he gave at that time. It would have saved us all from standing up, as we are, and saying to the government, 'I told you so.' The House of Representatives Standing Committee on路 Legal and Constitutional Affairs is a very rarely used body. I understand that almost no referrals have been sent to that committee for many years. I believe that it is an under-used resource which could be better used. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) is also a supporter of that position. He said that when he spoke on this bill in the House. If the government listened to the left of its party more often, I think it would be better off. I notice that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) is agreeing with that position. He is obviously in that faction. I am delighted that he is supporting his colleague the honourable member for Banks. I am sure that he will be pleased to hear about that. In conclusion, I believe that in future the government路 should take the advice of the honourable member for Tangney, the honourable member for Banks and perhaps the left of its party on some of its legal issues. Mr Nugent-He's in the left.  clearly, he is out of step with his own faction. Perhaps he will now recognise the error of his ways in the past and will start to do what some of the obviously more sensible members of his faction are advising him to do. But I congratulate the government on changing the bm and I hope that it will be a better bill as a result.",19
12,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased that the opposition now regards the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill as being in proper form to meet that delicate compromise and balance, which I indicated was important to find, between those interests of effective law enforcement and the protection of civil liberties. It was always going to be a question that had to be referred for detailed consideration through the parliamentary process. At the time the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr WiIliams), put it to me, which was just before the debate began, I indicated to him that,had he come to me earlier and allowed me to consult with the Australian Democrats as to whether or not they would insist on a separate and an additional Senate process had the bill gone through the House processes, I would have been content to take that course. I was not content to take a course which would have subjected this bill to a prolonged inqlliry in the :Souse of Representatives and which would have resulted in that process being repeated again in the Senate. . I simply say that I would welcome any course of action suggested by shadow ministers in those areas for which I have responsibility provided I have sufficient time to make the necessary inquiries to see whether the processes can be facilitated without unnecessary delay. I am pleased that, in the end, the parliamentary processes are vindicated. The bill is a good one and I am certain that it will help in effective policing with the necessary safeguards to protect the individual interests of all Australians. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (NORTHERN TERRITORy) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading .Debate resumed from 2 February, on motion by Mr Tickner: That the bill be now .read a second time.",20
13,Mr NUGENT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I remind' the House that the Aboriginal. Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill adds one parcel of land to that granted to the Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. The addition results from agreements between parties wishing to access the land and its resources. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, which was passed by a coalition government, provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in schedule 1 Of the act may be granted to the Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. . Since the act came into operation in 1977, a total of 57 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. The most recent additions occurred in May 1993. This additional parcel of land proposed in the bill consists of an area of 1,238 square kilometres in the Wave Hill locality of the Northern Territory, to the far north of Tennant Creek. The inclusion follows agreement between the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council and a company called Gambamora Industries Ltd to settle a standard claim over the area. It is understood that the land was the subject of a much larger land claim east of the Wampana area. However, that land claim failed and, pursuant to the land rights legislaAboriginal tion, a repeat claim was made for a smaller area. The area is dry, arid, vacant crown land and, due to its limited commercial value and remoteness, has never been the subject of路a pastoral lease and obviously it is very appropriate in terms of Aboriginal land. There were concerns on the part of the adjoining landowner, Gambamora Pty Ltd, which owned the Cattle Creekstation, regarding fencing erected which appeared to encroach on the land that was the subject of the claim. Before the hearing before the Aboriginal Lands Commissioner had concluded, the parties reached agreement and concessions were made in relation to the fencing and a number of other issues. As a result of that agreement, the Northern Territory government agreed to request the Commonwealth to grant the claim area to the traditional owners by scheduling the area under the principal act. It is interesting that the Northern Territory government, which perhaps has a reputation that some would consider to be negative in this respect, has made it very clear that it wants this land scheduled. It has made it very clear that territory policy is to settle as land claims as possible by negotiation. That, of course, has applied in this case. The opposition will not oppose this legislation. But, beforeI close my comments, I want to make a couple of other observations that I would like to commend to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). It seems to me that this is a good example whereby common sense and some cooperation and talking can actually have a positive outcome for all parties. The government often articulates in its public statements that it wants cooperation and bipartisanship; yet I would have to say that all too often recently that has not been the action路 it has performed, only the rhetoric it has followed. For example, there were many calls last year during consideration of the native title legislation for a bipartisan approach. Yet, as I have said in this place before, on two separate occasions last year approaches by me to the government to try to sort out some common ground were rebuffed. In the last week we had the Minister for and Torres Strait Islander Affairs issuing press statements calling for a bipartisan approach on the land acquisition fund. I have to tell the House that, in spite of approaches there, we have had no information, no debate and no discussions-only a lot of public statements. I contrast that to the time when the previous Prime Minister was in the chair when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was set up. When informal approaches took place, the issue was debated, there was an opportunity from my side of politics to consult with state colleagues around the country and, after some negotiation, a common position was agreed and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation legislation was introduced and passed without difficulty. It seems' to me that there we have a good example of the substance of how a cooperative and constructive system can work for the benefit of all, compared with the crash or. crash through approach adopted under the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). If the government is serious about looking at bipartisanship Or cooperative affairs, then it seems to me that we need more than rhetormany ic: we need some constructive action. I commend to the minister that the action that has taken place with the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council and the commercial interest concerned has been very constructive. Perhaps this government should learn the same lessons on some of the bigger issues that come before this House.",20
14,Mr GIBSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I am pleased to support the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), has outlined, the intention of this amendment bill is to enable the incorporation of an additional land claim area under the schedule of the act. It is supported by the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council, the Commonwealth government and, as we have just heard, by the opposition. Therefore, this bill and the debate surrounding it is basically a simple and noncontroversial matter. This bill represents a very significant achievement for the people involved in this land and one about which we should be very pleased. The people involved are very pleased because this bill has resolved a .long standing claim they have had to this land and it will enable the transfer of this land to them. As the honourable member for Aston said, the process of negotiation that was undertaken to resolve this matter was a very good one which involved conciliation on all sides and a willingness to negotiate and to act reasonably. The differences of opinion that were occurring over the boundary claims were resolved amicably, to the satisfaction of both the cattle station owners.,-cattle creek station---.:and the Aboriginal people. ment contains significant benefits not only for the路 pastoralists involved but also for the Aboriginal people, the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth government. The honourable member for Aston, in his concluding remarks, commented on the fact that there was a failure to achieve bipartisanship on the very significant native title legising lation that this House and the Senate debated last year. He indicated that, in meetings with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), he had attempted to achieve somt< level of bipartisanship. He seemed to make the accusation that it is somehow the government's fault that the plea for bipartisanship and for cooperation in that legislation failed. The honourable member failed to indicate that his position during that debate was being undermined by his own colleagues. He failed to recognise or to record in this House the fact that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and a number of members of the other place were making very strong speeches anti to the Mabo legislation and the achievement of native title. Despite his personal desire to achieve bipartisanship, which I think was quite correct-I know the honourable member for Aston and his position on these issues-he was not able to achieve bipartisanship. That was not due to any failure on the part of the government but due to a failure of will on the part of his colleagues on his side of the House. He should be very careful about making accusations about this government and its failure to achieve bipartisanship: In the 11 years. in which we have been in government we have continuously striven to have that as the hallmark of our administration of Aboriginal affairs. During the current minister's period of office, in any debate about Aboriginal welfare or Aboriginal needs, it has been his desire to cooperate with the members of the coalition on all occasions and to achieve an outcome satisfactory to all sides. It was not through our weaknesses or our failings that we were not able to achieve The settle- that outcome on native title. After the coalition lost the election it did not believe it was possible to lose, it decided to adopt an oppositionist position on every issue; That was the position it took on native title. Those in the coalition were the ones who changed their position. When the High Court brought down its decision in 1992 the coalition had a very good position. It was expressa desire to cooperate and work with the government, and we were pleased to have that happen. The coalition changed its position after the election. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) changed his position and came out very strongly against the government's desire to introduce Commonwealth legislation on native title. The positions being taken by members such as the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Flinders undermined any possibility of bipartisanship. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) .Amendment Bill is a very good example-an effective example-of almost 20 years of bipartisan administration of Aboriginal land rights. The legislation, although passed by the Fraser government in 1976, originated with the Woodward Aboriginal Land Rights Commission. Justice Woodward was appointed by the Labor government in 1973 to inquire into the appropriate means to recognise路 and路 establish the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to rights in or in relation to land; This legislation came about as a result of the findings of that commission.. So .the legislation was born because of a Whittam Labor government initiative. It was produced by a Liberal government and administered for its first six years by a Liberal government and for the la:st 11 years by a Labor government. Throughout that period it has received bipartisan support in this House, as will this amendment now. I think that is a significant point to make. It is a pity that the achievement of bipartisan support on this bill was not extended to the other important land rights legislation that this House has debated this century-the native title legislation. I remind honourable members of some of the things sJlid in 1976 when the bill was first introduced that recognised the importance of a bipartisan position on Aboriginal affairs. In the debate in the Senate in December 1976 Sena.tor Chaney had this to say about this legislation: ... when theWoodward commissionreport was put down the then government very quickly advised that it accepted the repqrt in principle and the leaders of the National Country Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia in the Parliament also indicated very quickly that they, too, intended to support the general thrust of the Woodward report. Further on路 he said: ... since Mr Justice Woodward's report there has been basically no real argument in Australia against the establishment of Aboriginal land rights. That applied up until 1993 when an argument emerged during the native title legislation, the opposition changing from the position of principle it had held for almost 17 years to the position of opposition it adopted lothe Mabo legislation. It is also important to recognise that the first and only Aboriginal parliamentarian in federal parliament, Liberal Senator Neville Bonner, moved the following motion which was adopted unanimously in 1976: That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. It is very interesting to note that that motion--:-moved by a Liberal senator and supported by the then opposition, the Labor Party-was carried unanimously in the Senate in 1976. That was the principled position of the Senate in 1976. What a contrast there is between that principled position that was supported unanimously then to the position taken by the opposition in 1993 of total opposition to the Mabo legislation. I am pleased that, with regard to this current legislation before the House, the opposition has understood that it is crucial' to have bipartisan support for Aboriginal issues, for Aboriginal welfare and for the advancement of Aboriginal people in this country.. That leads me to the other point that has been dominating political debate in the last few days. It is also very crucial to the question of Aboriginal路 welfare and opportunities for advancement. In the last few days we have had a lot of chest beating by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and other members of the opposition as to the intentions of the government towards improving its expenditure on Aboriginal health and路 other programs to advance the conditions of Aboriginal people. This debate has been trying to predict what might be in the budget to be brought down on 10 May. It has been a very interesting debate. The Leader of the Opposition has been attacking and criticising the government because we are to increase the allocation to Aboriginal health by only some $500 million over the next five years. He says it is a disgraceful situation that we are to increase the amount of money by only about $500 million. We have on record the comments of the Leader of the Opposition; He held a doorstop interview on 27 April 1994 in which he was asked: So - ou'd like to see more spent? And he said: We obviously want to see more spent. We've supported the reconciliation process provided it focuses on dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage. And it's not just in the area of health, it's in the area of education, job opportunities, housing and so on. Later on that same dayMr Ronaldson-You don't disagree with that, do you? .",21
15,Mr GIBSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I certainly do not disagree with it; it is the hypocrisy behind it that I am concerned with. Later that same day, on the . ABC PM program, the Leader of the Opposition said: Look, our policy and our support for the process of reconciliation to be specific, is路on the basis do something about improving the obvious Aboriginal disadvantage and I've listed the main areas, health, education, housing, employment opportunitieset cetera. The fact is he is attacking the government for outlining its intention, which will be contained in the next budget, to increase by some $500 million the allocation that it is making to Aborigirial health, housing and welfare. But what is the actual coalition policy on this matter? Those opposite do not have any written. policies at the moment, so it is very hard to find out exactly where they stand. But if we go back to their policy which they took to the people of Australia some 12 months ago, that gives us a fairly clear indication of where the coalition really .stands with regard to Aboriginal health. It shows the total hypocrisy that we have listened to from the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members of the opposition when they start claiming that somehow they are the saviours of Aboriginal people and that, if they were in power, they would be doing a lot more for Aboriginal people. Let us just look at what they intended to do should we now be faced with the sorry state of their being on this side of the House occupying the Treasury benches. From their policy document, I quote: The Coalition proposes to cut spending on Aboriginal programs by $90 millionThat is in a year. That would have meant a cut over five years of $450 million. I contrast that with what we are intending to路 do which is, I believe-although we will have to wait until the budget is delivered to find out-an increase in expenditure of some $500 million. Where would the coalition have made its cuts? We have had the Leader of the Opposition crying crocodile tears about how he would have increased money on education, housing, employment opportunities and health for Aboriginal people. These are the cuts that the coalition would have made: a cut of $25 million a year from路 the Aboriginal housing fund; a cut of $21 million in Aboriginal education and employment programs; a cut of $20 million in the community development that we employment program, the CDEP. Then there is a whole list. of other cuts which the coalition would have made. That puts on record the true position of what the coalition would have done if it had been in charge of Aboriginal affairs. So let us not have any more chest beating and hypocrisy from the Leader of the Opposition about how the coalition would be looking after Aboriginal people. It is only this government, a. Labor government, that is truly committed to trying to address the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. That will be demonstrated further by our commitment to increased expenditure in the budget when it is brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 10 May. I am pleased to be able to speak on this legislation. It is another landmark piece of legislation for the governrpent in ensuring continued justice for Aboriginal people. I am pleased that the people involved in the Wave Hill district of the Northern Territory will now be able to get access to their land which has been denied them for so long. I commend the bill to the House.",24
16,Mr TRUSS,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill adds an area of some 1,238 square kilometres in the Wave Hill area to the parcels of land .granted. to Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. In this instance, the land concerned is described as arid vacant crown land which has never been the subject of a pastoral lease and which is of limited commercial value. The Northern Territory government has agreed to the grant of the area to those claiming to be its traditional owners. In so doing, this legislation will' add to the 48 per cent of the Northern Territory which is already inalienably controlled by the Aboriginal communities. While this particular land transfer may be relatively un controversial, the Aboriginal land rights issue is causing major concern, particularly in rural and regional parts of Australia. Unfortunately, much of the debate is being conducted in an emotional atmosphere of ignorance, and many of the arguments are being based on little better than academic theory, wishful thinking and stupid name-calling. The government's entire Aboriginal affairs policy seems to be built around the granting of large areas of land to various Aboriginal groups. Land rights is not a magic wand which will solve the social and economic problems of Australian Aborigines. There is no evidence that the granting of land title has provided any improvement in the living conditions路 and lifestyle of the new landowners. Indeed, in most instances their circumstances seem to have become even worse. Some of the Aboriginal communities where social degradation and disgraceful living standards are at their worse have been owned by the Aboriginal people already for a couple of decades. A visit to many of these areas would. make most Australians ashamed. Buildings, housing and facilities have been destroyed. Education and. other services have been hampered or stalled. Alcoholism and violence are the norm. Family relationships and social discipline are in tatters, and there is no hope or planning for the future. I welcomed the reports following the visit by the former health minister, former Senator Richardson, to the Northern Territory when he committed the government to an extra. $800 million for Aboriginal health care. Throwing money at problems does not correct the wrongs, but there is an urgent need to address Aboriginal health issues. Now, it seems, the government has decided to slash that expenditure increase, but apparently there will still be money available for .the new Aboriginal land fund. The purchase of extra are-s of land will . . 15 not help cure alcoholism, will not stem the spread of AIDS, and will not extend Aboriginal life e-pectancy or improve their state of health. Much has been said about the number of Aboriginal deaths in custody. The most te1ling information to come from the Royal Commission into. Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was the fact that Aborigines are not more likely to commit suicide in custody than other Australians. So many of them die in custody because they are heavily overrepresented in the prison population. They are in gaol not because of racist police or magistrates hut because they commit more crime and more serious and violent crime. The federal government's own report, Australia s health, found that Aboriginal men and women lived on average 17 years less than the non-Aboriginal population. Infant mortality is four times higher than among the non-Aboriginal population. Aborigines smoke more, drink more, and have much greater rates of malnutrition and higher rates of a wide range of diseases. They are in hospital two or three times more often than the restof the population. They .are also more likely to be killed in car accidents or to be victims of violent crime, almost always inflicted by members of their own race. These appalling statistics occur in spite of all the land grants that have. been provided over recent years. Indeed, many of the worse . locations of degradation, appalling lifestyle and violent conduct are in communities where Aborigines have had title to the land for considerable periods. Land rights has become a路 part of the Aboriginal industry rhetoric, along with words like' 'sacred .sites', 'dispossession' and 'racism'; None of these words adequately justify the crisis confronting Australia in its dealing- with the Aboriginal people. The arrival of a white man six generations ago is no excuse for gangs of young Aboriginal youths to bash one another or smash up a town. It is not racism which denies opportunities to Aboriginal people. Indeed, there is much criticism in the community about the large number of special programs available only to Aborigines or to those who claim to be Aborigines. Obtaining title to land perhaps a thousand miles from where they have lived for perhaps several generations will do nothing to solve the problems of despair and hopelessness. . Australia has a clear responsibility to its Aboriginal people to ensure that their standard of living is improved and that they enjoy equal opportunities with their fellow Australians. This obligation means that special programs and special opporturiities funded by other Australians may be necessary to address their disadvantage. However, the sooner we move to a situation where rights are available equally to all Australians irrespective of race, .where welfare is provided on the basis of need-not on race-where one law and one set of standards applies to all, the sooner our country will have a harmonious, progressive and non-racist multicultural society. It is simply not good enough for anyone who makes comments that do not exactly fit the politically correct agenda of the Aboriginal industry to be immediately branded a racist. Indeed, such criticism could be most fairly directed against those who advocate special laws and special land titles purely on the basis of race. It is not racist to expect Aboriginal company to pay its bills as one would any other Australian company. Indeed, it would路 be racist to suggest anything else. I was horrified by a judge who allowed an Aborigine found guilty of attempting to kill his de facto wife to go unpunished, and by his telling the man that had he not been an Aborigine he would have gone to gaol for years. It is not acceptable to allow hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to be unaccounted for, just because it is spent in Aboriginal communities.' We must confront these issues, not merely attempt to dismiss those who draw attention to the current problems. The key to a better future for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders is meaningful employment and an opportunity to contribute to the country' and raise self-esteem. Perhaps one of the best and most successful programs introduced to assist Aborigines is the community development program. This scheme has provided work opportunities for thousands of Aborigines within their own communities as a substitute for dole payments. The scheme is highly regarded amongst Aboriginal communities which have seen the tremendous benefits of the program.' People who were once idle are obtaining fulfilment from doing useful tasks while the community itself has bene6ted from improved facilities, better maintenance and the development of a constructive attitude .. The community development program may not suit some of the social engineers in Canberra because it involves putting in some effort in return for the receipt of unemploytheir ment benefits, but the scheme has been a success and, frankly, should be extended to non-Aborigines right across the country. I am alarmed that the government is planning to cut funding for the community development program and reduce the number of places available.' The' Labor government, which cannot find adequate funding for Aboriginal health, proposes to cut the community development program .. At the same time, it has committed billions of dollars to land acquisitions. If one speaks to Aborigines privately and an away from their white advisers, one will find that very few believe that their problems will be resolved by further land acquisition. After all, Aborigines already have on average eight times more land than other Australians. Most Aborigines are voting with their feet and choosing not to live on the areas of land that have already been provided. Aborigines, like other Australians, prefer MCDonalds to kangaroo stew. They want a choice of television channels and access to the services and facilities of a western lifestyle. Only rarely is the land provided put to productive use. Occasionally great publicity is given to what appear to be successful cattle stations, new crocodile farms and tourist developments on Aboriginal property, but far too often it is not long before the cattle are wandering over the whole district, the crocodiles have escaped and the tourist development is closed through lack of custom-more mi11ions of taxpayers' money just lost and never accounted for. The路 West Australian reported recently on large grants being made to communities where no-one lives, with extensive buildings and motor vehicles provided just left abandoned. Greater land holdings are not the key to an improved lifestyle for Aborigines or to better understanding and goodwill between black and white. Labor's Aboriginal affairs strategy has not, the-gh, failed just Aborigines. The current Mabo land rights crisis represents the biggest threat to the sovereignty and economic future of Australia outside of wartime. The fallout from the extraordinary High Court decision has already severely damaged investor confidence and placed security of land title in doubt right across the nation. Overseas investors, who once would have looked at Australia for mineral, tourism and other developments, are already going to other parts of the world. Whenever Australians travel overseas and talk with members of the business community, the first thing on the agenda is always Mabo. I was in Hong Kong just a few months ago and the story was exactly the same. All the questions from the business community were about Mabo and its potential effects on their investments. Even Australian mining companies which had been established here for years are now seeking to explore in South America, New Guinea and even Europe because of their lack of investment confidence in their own country. The cost of Mabo in economic terms has already been substantial and there will undoubtedly be many greater problems ahead. But it is affecting not just big companies and big developments but also ordinary Australians. Queensland is perhaps the only state with any kind of matching Mabo legislation at the present time, and there isalready plenty of evidence in the路 state of Queensland about what life is going to be like after Mabo. In my own electorate of Wide Bay, the Gympie Bridge Club has been forced to cancel or defer its new hall building project because of potential Mabo style claims over the site, which is currently a crown reserve. The Gympie show pavilion is in doubt because it is on crown land which could some day be claimed by Aborigines. Even the Cherbourg Aboriginal community, which has had title to its own land for years, has had to stop building much needed houses for the community because of the likelihood of claims by other Aboriginal groups. There are problems with banks being. unwilling to lend funds for projects-even new factories on crown industrial estate.s-because of concern about potential Aboriginal land claims. Councils have been unable to open roads on reserves because there may be a claim by an Aboriginal group at some. stage. So it is not just miners, tourist operators and pastoralists who face uncertainty with this legislation. Sporting and community groups, factories and other organisations operating on crown land, including reserves and leasehold estates, face particular difficulties in the future as a result of the combination of the federal and Queensland Labor governments' Mabo legislation. Any groups with future development proposals are possibly going to be delayed at the whim of Aboriginal claimants, many of whom may never have seen the land involved. Premier Goss has given all sorts of assurances to the people of the Wide Bay electorate that they will be unaffected by land claims that have already been made over large parts of the electorate. A gentleman by the name of Mr John Jones-a classic member of the Aboriginal industry who had not been seen in the area prior to the Fitzgerald inquiry and prior to suggestions that there might be land available-has now lodged claims over vast areas of Fraser Island, the Great Sandy region and surrounding city and urban areas, together with a bill for compensation for hundreds of millions of dollars. Premier Goss has dismissed these claims as frivolous and as having no chance of success. But when the state government attempted to have these claims struck out in the courts in Queensland the judge refused the application. Premier Goss says that these claims are frivolous but they are still hanging over the heads of all the land-holders, whether they be in possession of leasehold, freehold, or any other type of title. This particular gentleman, Mr Jones, claims to be an elder of three separate tribes-'-not a bad effort, I would have thought; for a single Aborigine. His links with the local community are at best very tenuous. , Nonetheless, those claims are in place. No doubt it will take many months-perhaps years-to dispose of those claims; Those claims are' going to be prosecuted with the benefit of taxpayers' funds through the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service. Those sorts' of funds路 are not available to land-holders who may have to defend their oWn title which has perhaps been in the possession of their families. for four or five generations. It is not enough for premiers and prime ministers to say that these claims are fictitious. Already, the very existence of those claims is delaying projects, preventing development and driving away potential investors in this area and, indeed, in other parts of our country. The decision of the High Court was extraordinary in many ways. But it is even more extraordinary that the Prirrie Minister, in attempting to make a mark for himself as a Whitlam style provider of social change, extended the findings of the Mabo inquiry to . cover such a large area of our country. After all, the Mabo decision was about a small Melanesian community that has cultivated a particular parcel of land on an island in the' Torres Strait that had .never been used for any other purpose. It has now been extended to enable people claiming to be Aborigines to make claims over :the whole of continental Australia. I know they have said that they will not claim Sydney, Melbourne or some other areas. But it is no more ridiculous to claim the main street of Sydney or Melbourne than it is to claim a grazing property, held by a family for four or five generations. So there are these concerns right across the nation. It is not just the existence of this appallingly complicated Mabo legislation' that lawyers are unable to' understand, whose full intent no-one-nows. It is also. the fact that, at the same time as this legislation is going through the parliament, Australia is participating in the development of the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, a.proposed new United Nations treaty which, if it comes into fruition, will grant rights of self-determi颅 nation and self-government to indigenous peoples around the world. The Australian government will be responding to this draft covenant by July this year. It needs to be remembered that if this treaty were to come to fruition Aborigines and other indigenous peoples around the world would be granted rights to self-government within their own continent, They would have the right under articles 3 and 4 of the declaration to opt out of any state or any part of it. Article 3 states: ' Indigenous peoples have the fight to self determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine. their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. Article 4 states: ... while retaining their rights to participate fully, if they so choose, in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State. So they can opt in or out. They can make decisions as to whether or not they want to participate in some part of the country's activities. They can accept the social security system but decide not to serve in the military forces or to undertake other obli-ations. . Articles 22 .and 23 give indigenous people the right to special measures for their development-the right to determine and develop all health, housing and other economic and social programs affecting them路 and, as far as possible, the right to administer sUGh programs through their own institutions. Articles 22,23,31,32, 33and 34 become even more emphatic. Article 31 says: Indigenous peoples, as a specific form. of exercising their right to self-determination, have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, including culture, religion, education, information, media, health, housing, employment; 'social welfare, economic activities, land and resources management, environment and entry by non-members, as well as ways and means for financing these autonomous functions. Arti-le 32 talks about establishing their own citizenship. Article 33 gives indigenous people the right to have their own distinctive judicial .customs and traditions, their own judicial systems. OtlJer articles talk about power sharing in various different levels of government. This treaty gives, in practice, the right to set up a country within a country. Is it. any wonder that investors are looking at Australia with concern? Not only have vast parts of the continent already been handed over to less than two per cent of the population, but the signing of this particular treaty will mean that those areas will have the capacity to selfgovern their own affairs irrespective of the needs of other Australians with whom they share this continent. Land rights of themselves will do nothing to cure the many ills confronting the Aboriginal population. It would be far better for the governmentto maintain its commitment to health and other matters, rather than路 these things. (Time expired)",24
17,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"It is always disappointing-certainly for members on this side of the House, and I believe for the vast majority of members on the other side of the House-to hear speeches of the kind we have just heard from the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). Mr Deputy Speaker, you are a member of a parliamentary committee which is concerned about the alienation, the dispossession, the deprivation, the devastation of a race of people as a result of European settlement in Australia. That process has taken place over the past 200 years when the Aboriginal races had occupied this country for 60,000 years, possibly longer, before the Europeans arrived here. The honourable member for Wide Bay, while acknowledging some of the serious social, health and economic disabilities suffered by Aboriginal people, then set out to decry any of the measures which have been adopted in an attempt to redress some of those disabilities. He referred, for example, to our obligation to improve the standard of living of Aborigines and create equality with other Australians. But apart from mouthing a few cliches and slogans, the whole of his speech was intent on diminishing the nature of Aboriginal Australians and decrying all the measures that have been attempted aimed at redressing some of those past wrongs. The hOnourable member said that land will not solve the social disabilities of Aboriginal people. No-one ever claimed that it wouldMr Truss-You do.",29
18,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"That is a gross misrepresentation not only for the honourable member to make in the first place but then to compound by repeating it when I tell him that is not the case. I ask the honourable member to give me one quotation showing where any- . body in support of the Aboriginal land rights and land title legislation has ever suggested that all of those prpblems resulting from the dispossession of those people from land that they had occupied for at least 60,000 years would be overcome in that way only. He then said that the problem would not be solved by throwing money at the problem. Again nobody ever claimed that it would. It is a question of the adequacy of a whole complex of integrated, coordinated, effective and sensible programs to make it possible for some of those questions to be resolved and some of the past wrongs to be redressed. I refer to one comment made by the honourable member for Wide Bay which serves to discredit absolutely his whole approach to the question and by other people who make the same sorts of comments. He said that Aborigines in Australia had eight times more land than other Australians, but he just left the statement there-full stop. He must know that has been the case because nobody else wants it. The Aborigines were dispossessed of any reasonable land in Australia. That certainly refers to decent hunting grounds, apart from land occupied by Aborigines out in the deserts and in the dry and tropical areas of the north. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, if the land were suitable for grazing it would have been taken up under freehold or leasehold. If suitable for mining, the land is under leasehold. If suitable for urban development it is used for housing and other types of commercial development. Therefore, for the member to say that Aborigines have eight times more land than other Australians with the implications that lie behind that bland statement, finishing with a full stop at the end of it, shows the motives of the member for Wide Bay and those other people who mouth similar types of comments. The honourable member then went on to comment that Mabo represents the greatest threat to the security of Australia outside wartime .. I thought that everybody now accepted the fact that Mabo represents nothing more than a recognition of the fact that terra nullius was false right from the start of European settlement. To suggest that Australia had not been occupied by any people earlier than 200 years ago was a falsity of monstrous dimensions. Terra nullius was not the, case. I say to the honourable member for Wide Bay that Aboriginal Australians before 200 years ago are now acknowledged to have occupied the whole of Australia. It is not our role to redress the injustices of history. A lot of those events were路 accidents of 路history. They were circumstances which occurred in the total historic panorama of world development and the spread of civilisations over areas which had been occupied by people who did not have access to the same types of technological developments and innovations which were taking place in Western Europe, North America and elsewhere. To claim, as the honourable member must imply by the comments he made, that terra nullius was a correct assessment of Australia'S circumstances at that time is surprising, ,to say the least. It was not so very long ago, in 1976, that an important and relevant motion was adopted unanimously in the Senate, not only by members of the Liberal Party, including the then Senator Bonner, the only Aboriginal to have sat in this parliament, and by members of the Labor Party, who were then in opposition, but also by members of the National Party. The Senate adopted that resolution unanimously. Every member of the Senate, from every political party in the Senate, adopted that resolution unanimously. Let me read what it said: That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian G()vemment to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. Every member of the National Party in 1976, tog-ther with every other member of the Senate, endorsed that motion. Was that just a sop to the only Aboriginal that ever sat in this parliament? Was that just a gratuitous act on the part of his Senate colleagues and his party colleagues in 1976, almost 20 years ago? Or was that a genuine response from members of the National Party at that time? We indicate the very positive and creditable-certainly courageous and moralapproach which has been taken by the Australian Labor Party in government and in opposition in pursuing many of these questions. But we do not claim that only the Labor Party has been responsible for any of the improvements which have taken place. It would not be correct for us to do that; we do not do that. lhave indicated my approval and my pride as a member of this parliament in knowing that in 1976 every member of the Senate endorsed that Bonner motion. While we were in government-the Whitlam government-the Woodward royal com. mission was appointed. It was given a commission by the government in 1973 to report upon the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to rights in or in relation to land. After the Woodward roy-l commission was completed and that report was brought down, Senator Chaney from Western Australia, as he then was, in a speech in the Senate in 1976, said: But since Mr Justice Woodward's report there has been basicalJy no real argument in Australia against the establishment of Aboriginal land. rights. Fred Chaney, listen to this debate. The former Senator Fred Chaney left the Semite and came into this chamber. . Mr Duncan-Which party? Mt ROBERT BROWN-The Liberal Party, from Western Australia. He left the Senate and came into this chamber hoping that he would be able to exercise, I believe, some modifying and more moral influence on his colleagues from both political parties. Where is Senator Chaney now? Not in this parliament. Why is he not in the parliament? Because he chose not to stay in the parliament. Why did he choose not to stay in the parliament? Because, I believe, Fred Chaney was a genuine small 'I' liberal, a tolerant democrat. His colleagues, his mates, called him Red Fred because he was tolerant, because he was a democrat and because he was a liberal. The debate at that time was concerned with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill, the bill which we are now in. the process of amending in order to provide an additional parcel of land, 0.1 per cent of the Northern TerritoryMr Knott-They kneecapped Peter Baume.",29
19,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Absolutely. That is not a bad way to express it. In fact, I would endorse that. That is a good way to express it. Everyone knows Peter Baume is now the Professor of Community Medicine at Sydney University. He was a genuine liberal and a good, honest and honourable man. When the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill was being debated in the Senate in December 1976 he said in his usual, statesmanlike way: ... with the passage of this legislation for the first time the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory will have land rights and that this will be good, new, positive and desirable. I hope that honourable senators will proclaim what is being given, what is being achieved and what is being offered in a bipartisan spirit. I believe that this land rights legislation does no more than offer justice in a humanitarian way to the indigenous people of Australia. I believe that it will be a monument to the Thirtieth Parliament. Where is Peter Baume? Where is that small 'I' liberal, Peter Baume? He is no longer in the Senate. Why is he not in the Senate? Because he chooses not to be in the Senate. He left the Senate after his colleagues failed to respond adequately to his moral influence. In desperation, frustration and disillusionment Senator Peter Baume left the Senate and took an academic appointment in an area where he could more directly and more personally bring to bear for the benefit of people all of those great personal talents that he has. That is the reason he abandoned the Senate; that is the reason he abandoned this parliament. That is the reason this parliament lost a great liberal advocate and an honest and honourable man; it is the same reason the parliament has lost others, too. Those people who now sit in this chamber, and who sometimes sit at the table, need to examine their own basic morality. I believe that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) was a young, promising, small '1' liberal and, like the rest of those people in a state of disillusionment, frustration and defeat, he may leave this chamber and seek other pastures. I think in frustration he will finish up giving his colleagues away as well. This particular parcel of land is up in the Wave Hill area.",31
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,I might interrupt just to say I am delighted that the hon- . ourable member for Chariton is now getting to the subject of the bill. Thank you.,31
21,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very impressed by your tolerance. I know that you have allowed a very wide-ranging debate on this subject. You always allow members on either side to respond to claims and arguments which are . raised by people on the other side. You are a good deputy speaker and I know that you will continue to show the same degree of tolerance for my remaining five minutes. My point is this: that parcel of land is in the Wave Hill area. 'Wave Hill' is a very proud name in the history of the Aboriginal land rights movement. The land that we are dealing with at present is in the same general area as the land that was claimed. by the Gurindjis in the 1960s. But the claimants for this .land are the Wampana people, not the Gurindjis. The proud, determined and courageous fighters at Wave Hill in the 1960s and the 1970s were successful in what they set out to achieve. They were nobly assisted by the late Frank Hardy and they were victorious as a result of the support that Gough Whitlam gave them. On another occasion, I said that I hoped no Australian would ever forget the magnificent symbolism of the occasion when Gough Whitlam, as Prime Minister, went to Wattie Creek, Wave Hill, and ceremoniously poured the land back into the hands of the Gurindjis. It was a magnificent, symbolic gesture. So the struggle proceeds. It is recognised that, as a result of this amendment, this freehold land is now being handed to the Aboriginal people. I will quote a comment from the Bills Digest prepared by the Parliamentary Research Service which deals with the claim that two per cent of the population holds more Australian land than all other Australians. I will tell the chamber about the whole 1,238 square kilometres of land, or 0.1 per cent of the Northern Territory that has been claimed. The Bills Digest states: The area is dry, arid vacant Crown land and due its limited commercial value and remoteness, has never been the subject of a pastoral lease. Aboriginal people, who probably for 60,000 years have occupied that land, have now made a claim for that land. Some people in the parliament who, by their comments, have indicated that the attempt on the part of the Aboriginal people to secure freehold title to that land is not something which they can endorse. The Mabo legislation was, as the chamber will recall, opposed in total by the opposition. The opposition made itself irrelevant as a result of the position it adopted. It left it to the small groups-the Independents and the Greens-in the Senate to become the negotiatOrs on behalf of the different interest groups. It made itself irrelevant, and it continues to be irrelevant. The opposition exposed its antagonism to the whole concept of Aboriginal land rights. As everyone has said, the Aboriginals have been given nothing as a result of the land titles legislation or the Mabo decision. All that the legislation does is recognise the fact that they occupied that land. Those Aboriginal people, who are the most devastated, the most displaced, the most dispossessed by the white alienation and occupation of their land, will benefit as a result of this amendment to legislation which was introduced by the federal parliament. (Time expired)",31
22,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (2.04 p.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to be involved in this debate this afternoon for a range of reasons, the most significant of them being that I know the people who are going to benefit from this land claim. In my previous working life before entering parliament, I worked as a policy adviser for the Central Land Council, whose responsibility it was to administer and run this claim. A range of issues have entered this debate thus far. I plan to canvass some of them. But I think we need to put this debate into some sort of historical context-not so much beto cause of the land it deals with or the fact that a fortunate group of people have been able to acquire, through agreement, a piece of their own country back, but in order to recallthat this land grant is exercised under the Northern Territory land rights act and to recall what that act means to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. We should also contemplate the opposition that there has been, and continues to be, to that act-and the rights that the act gives Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory-and the sources whence that opposition comes. The other historical context路 which I think is relevant, bearing in mind the nature of the debate, is the historic events in South Africa. Over recent months we have seen a vigorous, sometimes violent, debate around issues of race. Over the last three or four days we have seen the successful culmination of a campaign waged against the concept of apartheid and against issues of racism, in the form of the election through democratic processes of an African government properly representing the interests of the people of South Africa. I raise this matter to see the parallel contexts between a debate in South Africa which is about issues of racism and which has culminated in the election of a government in South Africa which truly represents the interests of the whole community and. this legislation which, in the first instance, when it was introduced in 1976, was designed to represent the first step-in fact, the only step at the time-to come to terms with the historical reality of the dispossession and alienation of Aboriginal people from their country. , It was done in the Northern Territoryfortunately, from my point of view-because that was an area which was subject . to the Commonwealth parliament and because that was where the demand was greatest. It was there that Woodward had his royal commission and made the recommendations which formed the basis of the legislation which was ultimately passed. Opponents to that legislation have been vociferous and many. They have embarked upon a consistent campaign to denigrate the importance of land rights and the land rightS act, often to denigrate those people who are going to benefit from that act, and to denigrate those non-Aboriginal people who supported them. We have seen campaigns waged against these people, whether they are nonAboriginal or Aboriginal, because at various times they have been seen, by vested interests-principaIly in the Northern Territoryas somehow stealing the birth right of territorians. There is an obvious contradiction and a certain amount of hypocrisy in that statement. Who ultimately are these territorians, bearing in mind that the most territorian of territorians, in any event, must be those people who were alienated and dispossessed of their land? They are Aboriginal territorians.But often in these debates, for some reason, Aboriginal territorians are not regarded as teiTitorians; they are regarded as 'them' or 'other' - some other classification of people. 'In the campaigns which have been waged successfuIly over the years by the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, the partners in crime.to the National Pat;ty of Australia, principaIly, and to the Liberai Party of Australia-and the CLP senator from the Northern Territory who sits with the National Party in the Senate-they have consistently waged what often have been overtly racist campaigns against the interests and rights of Aboriginal people as they have been expounded under the Northern Territory land rights act. I do not know what the corporate m'emory in this parliament is like of those debates, it is worth contemplating when those debates took place and where we are currently in the recognition of those legitimate rights which Aboriginal people were afforded under the land rights act. In the context of elections, I cannot think of one occasion since self government in 1978 in which the Northern Territory CLP has not, either. directly or indirectly, run a campaign based on division and on race, subtly at times but more overtly at other times. Perhaps the most pronounced Northern Territory election campaign was in 1983. I refer to the 1983 Northern Territory election campaign because it provides a very interesting example of the psyche of these people who oppose land rights. In this instance, the CLP consistently opposed Aboriginal people being provided with land rights and all of the accompanying rights that are contained within the hind rights act, including a limited right to withhold consent for developments on their land. That, of course, has been the key to all the opposition in a sense, because members of the CLP could not contemplate that Aboriginal people might have a different association路with the country which required a different recog!1ition of rights than is accorded to non-Aboriginal Australians. They had no idea of this concept of relationship with country; no understanding of the spirituality which Aboriginal路 people conceive when they talk about country; no idea of the kinship obligations which confront Aboriginal people when they talk about their country; and no idea of the ceremonial obligations which confront Aboriginal people when they talk about country. None of these things seem to register in the psyche of these people who oppose land, rights. I often wonder why, but we will come to that in a moment. As I was about路 to relate, Paid Everingham-I do not know whether honourable members remember him; he has Just been sacked as the Liberal Party President in Queensland-had a very prestigious career in the federal parliament which lasted about two rounds of the revolving door. He was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in 1983, which was the time the Commonwealth but was talking about Ayers Rock. Can members remember this? He spoke of Uluru and the transfer of title of Ulum to the traditional owners under the land rights act and its lease back to the Commonwealth under the provisions of that act to be run as a national park in the interests of all Australians. 1 think that Uluru and Kakadu have been the two most prescient examples of what lands rights has delivered to this country. Here we have in any sense of the word two of the most important jewels in the cultural tourism crown of this country, managed jointly by the Commonwealth through a management board which .comprises a majority of traditional owners or their representatives and the Commonwealth through ANCA, the Australian National Conservation Agency. Let us not underestimate the importance of that relationship or what it has meant. It has been done at the behest of the traditional owners who have seen fit to say to the Amitralian community, 'We want you to share with us in a way which suits both us and you.' They have done it in a most appropriate manner. There are very few tourists who come to this country who do not want to see or experience either Kakadu or Uluru. Both of them are outstanding examples of cooperation, done at the behest of the traditional owners conjunction with the Commonwealth. The traditional owners in both cases rejectcynical, ed all approaches from the Northern Territory government because of the racist way it approaches people and because of th- underlying reaspns the Northern Territory government had in opposing the interests that Aboriginal people have路 in the land. In 1983 an election was called by Porky Everingham, which is what we used to call him-I do not know what they call him in Queensland any more",32
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Order! The parliamentary secretary should address the memberby his correct title.,34
24,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"He is not a member; he is Porky Everingham, ex-Liberal Party President of Queensland. That is who he isPorky.",34
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Mr Everingham. Mr SNOWDON....,..The election was called in response to the federal government plan to hand over the title of Uluru to its traditional owner. Everingham fought the election almost exclusively on the theme of the rock. The CLP won the 1983 election against Labor by 19 to six seats. In 1984 Everingham was elected as federal MHR for the Northern Territory where he continued his virulent antiCanberra,anti-land rights, anti-Aboriginal and anti-territorian theme. In 1985 his successor, the then Chief Minister, Ian Tuxworth, embarked on a threeweek national media campaign described by the media at the time as a crusade against the handover of Ayers Rock and land rights in general. The campaign cost Northern Territory taxpayers approximately $300,000. I was present at the handover of uiuru. I remember the statement made by Yammi Lester on behalf of the traditional owners about that handover. He said, 'Loqk, today we've got the rock. We've signed the agreements. It hasn't disappeared. We haven-t moved it across the South Australian border. It is still here.' And of course it is. still there. Prior to this campaign by Tuxworth,his in political image wason the wane. Like his predecessor, Everingham- he undertook a very overtly racist campaign to manipulate anti-Aboriginal prejudice within the community for his own political purposes. The CLP .has traditionally used divisive, racist campaigns and divisive, emotive themes based on racism as a political weapon against the ALP, which it has offensively described in the past as the Aboriginal Labor Party. We are talking about people in the 1990s,not the 1880s. As I said at the beginning of my contribution, this is being said in the context of what has happened recently in South Africa. . Comments made by Everingham and Tuxworth on the Uluru handov!!r, whilst made only a few years ago, obviously appear even more dishonest and stupid today, considering the history of what路 has happened and the benefits which have been derived by the Australian community-let alone the Noithern Territory community-as a result of that meritorious association and as a result of the traditional owners who got the land underthe Land Rights Act, agreeing with the Commonwealth to allow every Australian access and overseas tourists to benefit. This has not only boosted the Northern Territory economy but also recognised Aboriginals' rights. According to Everingham, Aboriginal people were manipulated by white advisers and lawyers into believing they were traditional owners. I have to say that nothing has changed; that is still the sort of garbage we get from people within the CLP in some instances. In a cynical inversion of the truth, Tuxworth claimed that the Land Rights Act was inflaming racial tension. Here we have people using a burner-a blowtorch-to try to incite racial tension and division in the community against Aboriginal interests by saying that, somehow or other, it is the fault of Aboriginal people. It is the traditional blaming of the victim. None of the alarmist predictions came to fruition, but things have not dramatically changed-surprise, surprise! Now we have a Northern Territory government going to an election some time this year. Again it is trying to engineer a debate-more subtly, it is true-around the issue of land rights. First, it opposed Mabo, as we would expect from these great bastions in the protection of democracy. Twenty-five per cent of its, population is Aboriginal. A large proportion of those people are dispossessed of their country. What country Aboriginal people have been able to get has been unalienable crown land claimed under the land rights act. An' even larger proportion of that land was scheduled land, put aside for Aboriginal interests prior to the land rights act and just transferred to them under unalienable freehold title post the land rights act. A very cynical approach is now being adopted by the Northern Territory government in opposing the development of a land fund. It opposes the development of a land fund because it does not want Aboriginal people to buy more land in the Northern Territory. One of the spin-offs of land rights is that Aborigitory nal people have gained royalties. Also, a significant contribution has been made by the Commonwealth. But eventually Aboriginal people have had money at their disposal to buy properties. Some of them have purchased land and gone through a claims processwhich is their right until 1997-to transfer those titles under the land rights act to inalienable freehold title. That is opposed by the Northern. Territory government, and it has its reasons for that. I do not want to debate the merits or otherwise of its opposition. On 15 April this year the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, in speaking on this debate about land and its acquisition by Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, said: The principle is .you're using taxpayers funds to satisfy those Aborigines who do not have access to land under Native Title or Land Rights legislation. In the Northern Territory we have nearly 50% of the Northern Territory already Aboriginal land or under claim. The balance of the Territory is largely pastoral property. If you provided another 2-3 million dollars in the Northern Territory situation you could probably buy 90% of the Northern Territory and that would mean that 25% of the Territory's population would own nearly all of the Northern Territory ... Can members imagine the Chief Minister of a territory or a premier of a state or the Prime Minister of this country actually saying that there ought to be a limit to the amount of land which is purchased by any class or group of people in their constituency? But the Northern Territory Chief Minister is arguing that, because Aboriginal people comprise 25 per cent of the population and because, through dint of the land rights act, they have been able to claim land-a lot of it useless land in non-Aboriginal terms; they have been able to purchase land either through appropriations of the Commonwealth or through their own savings, through land trusts or through back royalty payments-somehow or another we should put up a barrier to them purchasing any more land. I take honourable members back to the beginning of my contribution when I asked, 'Where are we now in 1994 in a context where we have just had an election in South Africa based on expunging racism?' An election is to be called in the Northern Terrisome time this year. What I am arguing, I think coherently, is that, if we really want to call this country democratic, if we really want to recognise and have recognised the rights of indigenous Australians, if we really do support the sentiments behind the original legislation, if we as a nation are to come to terms with what it is to be Australian as we approach the year 2000, do we not have to come to terms with this fundamental issue, this contradiction between, on the one hand, the racist arguments-certainly divisive arguments-and, on the other hand, the rights of a group of Australians to participate in Australian economy and to the right of that same group of Australians to have their legitimate interests in their country recognised? What we have instead is a farrago of lies about the way in which the Northern Territory has been disadvantaged by the land rights act and how territorians, whoever they are-understand that they are not Aboriginal people-have been disadvantaged. Aboriginal people are a very important part of the Northern Territory. They are a very important part of Australia. The net advantage to the Northern Territory and to Australia as a result of this land rights act can never be underestimated. I urge members of thy opposition to put pressure on their CLP coll-agues in the Northern Territory to at last come to terms with contemporary reality, to at last come to terms with the fact that they have to live and work with Aboriginal Australians in the joint interests of the Northern Territory and Australia as a whole. If they do that, we will go a long way to expunging the stupidity of the divisive campaigns that have been a hallmark of the past. (TIme expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon) read a third time. DEFENCE FORCE (HOME LOANS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL Consideration resumed from 2 March. Second Reading  Science and Personnel) (2.25 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 to enable the adjustment of interest rates applicable to the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme to remove an irregularity. The scheme established under the act provides for a subsidised loan of up to $40,000 to members or ex-memthe bers of the Australian Defence Force for a period related to their length of service. The loans are made available by the National Australia Bank. The bank paid a franchise fee to the Commonwealth to provide loans under the scheme. The subsidy to be paid on a loan in any month is equal to 40 per cent of the average monthly interest to be paid over the life of the loan, calculated on a 25-year period at the benchmark interest rate applying for that month. Essentially, the benchmark interest rate is assessed on a month-by-month basis and represents the lower of the rate offered by the National Australia Bank and the average of the rates offered by the five largest Australian banks. The method of calculating the benchmark interest rate is prescribed in subclause 5.15 of the agreement between the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth, contained in schedule 1 to the act. Section 35 of the act prohibits amendment of subclause 5.15. Subclause 5.15 is currently operating in a manner that was not originally envisaged and which is not desired either by the National Australia Bank or the Commonwealth. The irregularity has. arisen because special low introductory rates for new loans with interest fixed for a period of 12 months or less were not contemplated when the agreement was drawn up. The present wording of subclause 5.15 applies these introductory rates to all borrowers under the scheme, irrespective of whether they are new borrowers, and for as long as those rates are on public offer. These 1994 special introductory rates are significantly lower than the bank's majority interest rate which previously would have applied. For example, from August 1993 to April 1994 the bank's introductory rate was five per cent compared to the majority rate of 9.5 per cent; and from April, 6.95 per cent compared to 8.75 per cent. This irregularity will occur whenever a special introductory rate is offered by the National Australia Bank. This results in a reduction of interest charges to customers and interest receipts by the bank, and a reduction in the Commonwealth subsidy payment for each month that the lower interest rate applies. Potentially, continuation of the present situation would result in the Commonwealth receiving what could only be described as windfall savings of up to $400,000 in a full year, depending on the particular interest rates that apply at the time. The National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth have agreed that subclause 5.15 of the agreement should be amended so that borrowers under the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme have the benefit of the special introductory loan interest rates under the same 'conditions that they are available to the public; that is, the special rates would apply only for new borrowers and for the period that those rates are normally available to ordinary members of the public. Compared with applying the bank's majority rate to all borrowers, the saving to the Commonwealth would be about $100,000 a year. To enable the changes to be路 made, section 35 of the act will have to be amended to remove the prohibition on amending subclause 5.15 of the agreement. The bill achieves this by removing the reference to subclause 5.15 from section 35 of the act. I would like to stress that the proposed amendment of the agreement, as outlined, will still be subject to clause 20 of the agreement which provides that any amendment to the agreement will have no effect unless it is confirmed in writing by the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth. I commend the bill to the House.",34
26,Mr TIM FISCHER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The structure of the legislation to .amend the DefenceForce (Home Loans Assistance) Act . 1990 is most interesting. It is a little unusual in that the main anomaly being rectified is in fact not addressed in the legislation .. The legislation removes a restriction by allowing adjustments to the underlying agreement in order to rectify the anomaly to which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel  It is not often that the parliament considers what might be .described as arms-length legislation dealing with an arms-length agreement-indeed, an agreement in which in another sense the parliament almost forgoes some of its powers to relate to and adjust by virtue of yet another section which the minister referred to in his second reading speech. He stated that clause 20 of the agreement still stands. Clause 20 provides that: ... any amendment to the Agreement will have no effect unless it is confirmed in writing by the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth. Does that mean that the federal parliament can bring on a further amendment in this area of the law and yet that would not apply if the National Australia Bank for its part declined to allow the underlying agreement to be adjusted? I do not believe that we will get to that stage, quite obviously. Equally, I do think that, perhaps in another place,. in the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and other committee processes, there will be some examination of the relationship of this legislation to the responsibilities of the minister, the responsibilities of the government and the outcome of this framework adjustment to rectify an anomaly. On the matter of the anomaly, the coalition has no objection to the thrust as detailed in the speech by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Indeed, clearly it was always intended for the new borrowers and therefore we will not oppose the passage of this legislation. But I. do highlight to the Housethat it is, in a sense, framework legislation. It is removing a caveat in order that that underlying agreement can be adjusted. The bill itself does not address the anomaly. I take note of that fact. It.is very important that we have an adequate Defence Force home loan scheme路路in the broad. One only has to look across to Russia to see the horrific problems it has with its army at the moment as elements of the Russian Red Army come home after many 'years in East Germany or in Latvia. Also, under further agreements, over a period of time the Red Army will withdraw from the Baltic nations, which I am very glad to see, and return to Russia. That is now creating huge logistical headaches in relation to the housing of the Russian army on Russian soil in the Russian Federation. I believe that there is always a morale problem associated with inadequate housing for defence personnel. That in turn results in a breakdown in law and order. As reports indicated overnight, the Russian army for its part is having enormous problems with even maintaining its national service compliance. Perhaps underlying that problem are the conditions, especially with regard to the important matter of housing. Likewise, here in Australia so many defence families are shunted around Australia by virtue of the career stream they take within the navy, army or air force. A soldier can commence his career in Kapooka, move to core training in Singleton, move to the Brisbane cluster of defence units, a few years later move to the Townsville cluster and then get transferred down to the Seymour cluster. In that process there is quite a deal of disruption. By that stage also, that same soldier is starting to look ahead to a period beyond his serVice in the army, his ability to settle down with his family at some chosen location and therefore a路 home of his own, regardless of what he might pick up on the rental market when he gets posted from area to area. Of course, a raft of assistance, removal and otherwise, is provided by the federal government and by the gepartment with regard to these movements. Nevertheless, I do not think we should underestimate what we ask of our serving personnel in the navy, army and air force. It is a particularly disruptive way with a heavy impact on their families and the education of their children. The same might also be said of personnel of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with a raft Of postings around Australia and overseas. These postings often entail very real hardship and, again, a disruptive impact on the families and the educational opportunities of the children. While the coalition is supportive of this curious legislation-curious in terms of路 its structure-we highlight the obligation of this parliament to see that the right thing shall be done by those who serve their country in the navy, army and air force. This legislation should ensure that the right thing shall be done in respect of their housing, be they involved in the mapping and the like carried out by important units of the army located at Bendigo or in the work carried out by units elsewhere around Australia. There has been a lot of concern ainongst defence forces personnel in the last few days following the leaking of a report which suggests that veterans' entitlements will be .cut and that there will be a restructuring of the onus of proof and other aspects of the determining system for ex-service personnelmeasures that are partly encompassed by this legislation. That report is yet to be tabled in the parliament. I challenge the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to do the right thing, table the report and provide a response from the government to ease the burden on veterans, ex-servicemen and women and serving personnel because, as Ben Chifley told this parliament some four or five decades ago, it is the responsibility of this House to see that the right thing shall be done for those who serve their country. It is in that context that I join with my colleagues the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and ,the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator MACGIBBON, in expressing our concern about the way the report suggests that there is wholesale overpayment of disability pension. In sharp contrast, on the very day that that report was leaked I happened to be in Childers, Queensland, with my colleagues the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) of life and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I think this is relev,ant, just in passing, to the debate on this bil1. We came across a veteran who has had a bullet near his spine since World War II and who is receiving only a 10 per cent disability pension. That is what he gets for his service to his country in time of war. This is the complete antithesis of what we were led to believe was the score, with the leaked government report suggesting wholesale cutbacks and 'changes to the determining system for veterans. To be fair, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has not yet had a chance to speak to the House about this. I sincerely hope he does soon because there is no more vigorous network around the community-perhaps there is one other, which I have encountered in recent weeks-than the veterans' network, the RSL, and related organisations. I路 have a great deal of respect for the RSL and war widows. They want to know exactly where the government does' stand on that report and they want to know quickly. an behalf of one veteran who lives in Childers, Queensland, with a bullet near his spine and who has justa 10 per cent disability pension and on behalf of many other veterans I make the plea that the right thing be done for those who served their country in the army, navy and air force in time of war, and that includes in Vietnam, Korea, Malaya, World War II; World War I and the peacekeeping efforts which abound today. As we speak, Australian solders and others are still serving in UN peacekeeping efforts in the Sahara, the Middle East and elsewhere. Finally, some very interesting defence developments are now taking place around the Indian Ocean rim, notably with India and other nations. This country quite properly, in terms of trade, defence and other issues, has been well focused on the Pacific and the Asia-Pacific region. This country helped set up the APEC organisation, which has gathered its own momentum, and I am fully supportive of that. We now need to refocus on the Indian Ocean in addition to, not instead of, the Asiament Pacific region. To do that, we need to look at some very interesting developments with the armed forces of some of the Indian Ocean rim countries and the very sweeping developments taking place in South Africa and elsewhere. I congratulate Nelson Mandela on his election as President of South Africa, and I congratulate F. W. de Klerk on the contribution that he has made to the rebirth of South Africa. I hope that Australia will be very conscious of its Indian Ocean role and responsibilities with these' changes in South Africa, the Middle East, India, Indonesia and elsewhere. In the knowledge that I could well be stretching the friendship of the chair, this bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 in a way which the coalition supports. It is framework legislation, and we are not opposed to doing the right thing by those who utilise the defence force home loans scheme.",37
27,Mr HOLLIS,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I am pleased to speak on the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill. In the second reading speech of the Minister for  the minister said: This bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, to enable the adjustments of interest rates applicable to the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme to remove an irregularity. He went on to say: The scheme established under the act provides for a subsidised loan of up to $40,000 to members or ex-members of the Australian Defence Force for a period related to their length of service. The loans are made available by the National Australia Bank. The bank paid a franchise fee to the Commonwealth to provide loans under the scheme. We all remember the debate at that time. He went on: The subsidy to be paid on a loan in any month is equal to 40 per cent of the average monthly interest to be paid over the life of the loan, calculated on a 25-year period at the benchmark interest rate applying for that month. Essentially, the benchmark interest rate is assessed on a month-by-month basis and represents the lower of the rate offered by the National Australia Bank and the average of the rates.offered by the five largest Australian banks. The method of calculating the benchmark interest rate is prescribed in subclause 5.15 of the agreebetween the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth, contained in schedule I to the act. As has been pointed out, subclause 5.15 is currently operating in a manner that was not originally envisaged and which is not desired either by the National Australia Bank or the Commonwealth. This legislation will allow the variation of the subclause dealing with the calculation of the interest rate contained in the agreement between the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank relating to the provision or subsidisation of housing loans for members of the defence forces. I suppose over the last five to eight years I have seen more defence housing than almost anyone in this House in my role as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works.  lot.",39
28,Mr HOLLIS,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Yes, we move around a lot. Only last week I was looking at some defence housing, as these housing projects always come before our committee. I remember, prior to the formation of the Defence Housing Authority, the appalling conditions under which many of our serving personnel had to live. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said, a peculiar difficulty that defence personnel have is that often they are required to move every two years. In the early period of my chairmanship of the public works committee I saw some appalling housing. There is still some housing that is .below standard, but over the last few years this government has worked massively to improve that housing. Since 1983 the Labor government-first under Prime Minister Hawke, now under Prime Minister Keatirighas had many successes, but one of the real outstanding successes must be the Defence Housing AJlthority. I am sure that, if in the unlikely event there were a change of government, that is one project which would continue because the DHA is such an excellent authority. The Defence Housing Authority was established in 1988 on commercial lines to assume the management of the defence housing stock of some 24,000 lin its, which were in a generally perilous condition due to many years of inefficient management arrangements. It is now required to meet the defence forces' operational requirements for housing. It is interesting that anyone who goes to one of these projects will see the mixture of styles housing and landscaping between private and public housing. ",40
29,Mr HOLLIS,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"First-rate, as"" my colleague the honourable member for Chifley says. The Defence Housing Authority is setting the standards for housing in the community today. I challenge any housing project anywhere in Australia to come up with a more innovative standard than at Wattle Grove in Sydney-an outstanding example of urban housing; an outstanding example of how defence personnel can be mixed with the private sector. It is a credit to the Defence Housing Authority a1).d is indeed a credit to the people. I do not always agree with everything the honourable member for Farrer, the Leacter of the National Party, says but I have to agree with what he said about our investment in the people in the defence forces. III our defence forces in this country, and in any country, we make a tremendous investment in the personnel-in the training of them and in bringing them up to that very high standard which we require. It is essential that they be housed in appropriate conditions. The special regiment at Seaward ViIIage in Perth is one housing project where there is not a mixture because of the very nature of the work that the personnel have to do there. Often they are away from their homes on all sorts of tasks so it is important that we house them in appropriate conditions. I have always felt that the investment we make in the defence personnel is complemented by the investment we make in the housing of these people. The investment that is made in the housing is an investment in our defence personnel. As I have said, the authority has made considerable improvements to the standard of defence housing stock in the years since its inception. Approximately 75 per cent of the . total housing stock was of a substandard quality in 1988 compared with the 75 per cent of good quality stock in our. present position. There are members on both sides of the chamber who have served in the defence forces and we have been very fortunate to have the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for of Groom (Mr Taylor)-each has held a senior position in the RAAF and in the navy, respe.ctively-serving on the public works commIttee. They often contrasted the standard of housing today with the standard of housing that they had to endure in their 20 years or so in the defence forces. The Defence Housing Authority is highly responsive toa repairs and maintenance program. There is a two yearly cycle of nonurgent maintenance, and a survey conducted recently showed that 98 per cent were satisfied with the results. I have state housing in my area and I am yet to find a 98 per cent satisfaction rate with the maintenance and repair of the houses. One of the major features of the authority's operations has been the extensive use of the private sector, which must meet its exacting standards. There has been a renegotiation of the long standing agreements with the states under which much of the defence housing stock has been leased to the Department of Defence from the states and there are joint ventures with private developers which provide an economic supply of serviced lots for the authority's needs and profits from sales of other lots. The authority pl-ces much store on continuous consultation and - feedback from the defence force families to ensure that the organisation is responsive to their reasonable requirements-I 1910w this for a fact. Every time we have a hearing there is always a representative路 of the spouses association present. When we go on inspections, whether it is on new houses or old stock, - we always meet with personnel and the families in those houses. I believe that the Defence Housing Authority takes great stock of what the users of the end products say. In each full year of operation, the authority has exceeded the rate of return of five per cent on assets agreed with the government. The authority, as an organisation that is active in the housing market, has accepted an onus to contribute to the ideals of the better cities program. Recent projects have demonstrated its commitment to urban infilI and careful regard for habitability. It. has developed community facilities as a contribution to the local area. When disposing of poorer housing the authority has made improvements to lift the general tone of the area and reserved part of the stock as display homes. It is really amazing to see exactly what can be achieved with these old houses when they are made display homes. It has encouraged buyers to make further improvements for relatively modest outlays. I will mention a few of the projects that I have recently visited. I have mentioned Wattle Grove before. It is not in the electorate of the  would be a credit to any honourable member to have Wattle Grove in his or her electorate. I urge any honourable member who has not looked at that project to do so. I was recently in the electorate of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) for the opening of Heritage Heights. It is a magnificent project. If I had a criticism, it is that the developers may have been a little heavy with the agapanthus in the landscaping. I have never seen landscaping in a - public housing display or settlement similar to that one. I have mentioned Seaward Village in Perth. We are about to start on stage three there. Streeton Views in Victoria was opened only last week or the week before last. A feature of the Defence Housing Authority's work in these housing estates is landscaping. I was a little lavish in my praise of this Keating Labor government. But a lot of the credit must go to the chairman of the authority, John Graham,and the managing director, Bill路 Kirkby-Jones. Both gentlemen have brought tremendous skill from the private sector into this area. What those two gentlemen have done for defence housing in this country is deserving of great praise. I1istened very carefully to what the Leader of the National Party said about the problems in the former Soviet Union with troops from the many states coming back. Tharis a real problem which it has had. I have spoken with people in defence establishments in the United States and Britain about the standard of defence. housing in this country. No other country has achieved what has been achieved by the Defence Housing Authority in this country. We are world leaders in the way we house olir defence personnel - Some houses still have to be brought up to standard. I have spoken to defence attaches at the various embassies here. I always recommend that they get in contact with the Defence Housing Authority and have路 it show them what 路can be achieved by bringing a realistic approach to housing, by listening to the people who are going to use that housing, by paying attention to them and by, if like, having a mix of the public and the private sectors. No longer do we stick our defence personoffer nel in one area, put a fence around them and say, 'You have to live here.' We mix them into the community. They want that. benefit from it and the community most certainly benefits from it. In. my role as chairman of the Joint mittee on Public Works, I have visited every defence establishment in Australia. I do know how many times I have visited them, but it would be at least three times each. The positive feedback I get from the military personnel about defence housing reinforces everything I have said today. It is one of great successes-perhaps one of the unsung successes-of this government and what we have achieved. Having said all that, no-one is more deservthese ing of this progress than defence personnel. As a nation, we invest. millions into the training of defence personnel. We put great requirements on them. When the situation Somalia came up, we put our defence personority nel there. I suspect that, increasingly, instead of having a less turbulent world, we will a more turbulent world. We will call more and more on our defence personnel to do their duty in various parts of the world. I believe it is only fitting that we should maintain appropriate standards when housing these people. We do that with defence houshousing ing. Some of the housing in some of the barracks needs improving. Last week I was Singleton. I believe that what we have achieved there is first class. I commend this legislation to the House. In gratulate the Defence Housing Authority for what it has achieved and I congratulate successive ministers for defence personnel on the support that they have always given to Defence Housing Authority.  very happy to speak in support of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment ton. Bill 1994. As has been previously mentioned, this really seeks to correct a marketing develto opment that was not contemplated when the original agreement was brought into place. you We are not generally used to banks being innovative, but these days, as a way of encouraging first home owners, they usually a fixed rate housing interest loan at a much lower rate than the current variable rate. Of course, this has led to an anomaly. This is They what the bill seeks to redress. As. mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), whose committee Comhas done such a good job in supervising the plaris for improved defence housing, it is very not important that our serving men and women have access to housing which is at least as good, if not better, given the itinerant nature of their occupation. I think it is fair to say that a ,great deal of good is being done. As a the member of the defence subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I know that the members of that subcommittee take a great deal of interest in matters whenever going around particular bases looking at the latest developments. I think it is worth repeating to the House, particularly since my contribution is gathering in an audience, that the Defence Housing Authcurrently provides some 23,000 houses. After six years of operation, we have more have than doubled the number of good quality houses. I think that is something to be very pleased about. We have halved the number of unsatisfactory houses. I guess it is really a blot on any government-present or, particularly, past-that we should have to classify as unsatisfactory, but we have halved the number. In six years the Defence Housing at Authority has either bought, built or leased something like 13,000 good quality houses and disposed of some 10,600 houses that were doing so, I conof a poor standard. , Defence personnel, of course, do not get a the choice about where they are posted. On . average, they serve in a posting for two years. the For example, if they were ,at Holsworthy and were being posted to Darwin, they would not be given the choice of whether they would like Darwin, Melbourne, Cairns or RockhampMobility is a factor of their lives. Therefore; a lot of them do not have an opportunity actually secure an investment in a private house in the way the majority of other work. ing men and women of Australia do. So the role of the Defence Housing Authority is very important, as is the ability for existing members, and particularly ex-members, of the Australian Defence Force to have assistance to establish themselves in private houses. The honourable member fo- Throsby mentioned the Seaward housing in Western Australia. At the subcommittee's most recent visit we were able to look at that development. Mr SimmonS interjecting member for Calare agreeing with me. - e is a very keen member of the subcommittee. We were able to see at first hand some of the things that the. honourable member for Throsby was speaking about. I think it is also important that the House endorse the policy of the Defence Housing Authority for mixed housing developments. We want to move away from the ghetto. effect that so much of the older style housing had.",40
30,Mr SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Order! Reluctant as I am to interrupt such a tremendous contribution, it being 3.00 p.m. the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order . lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, The honourable member will have .leave . to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",43
31,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Swan-Leader of the House),--I table the roster as at 3 May for this session. The government will vary it路 from time to time in consultation with the opposition. I inform the House that the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. George Gear, is absent from question time today and for the remainder of this week. Mr Gear is representing t.he government at various meetings overseas, all of which I understand the invitations to were addressed to the Minister for Finance. In his absence, questions should be addressed to the Treasurer, the Hon. Ralph Willis. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, the Hon. Gordon Bilney, is also absent from question time this week. Mr Bilney is attendingtninisterial consultations in several South Pacific states. In his absence, I will respond to questions he would answer.",43
32,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker: in the spirit of the consultation with the opposition contemplated by the remarks accompanying the roster the Leader of the House (MrBeazley) just tabled, could I remind the Leader of the House that when the new arrangements were announced the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that the government路had decided 'to institute a fully rostered question time on a trial basis for the remainder of this session'. The words 'this session' . that he was referring to clearly expired at the end of March. We are now, as I understand it, in a new session. When is he going to revise the manifestly unsuitable arrangements as demonstrated by the Prime Minister's failure to be here today after a fouror five-week路 absence in which many important events have happened; including his rather clumsy overseas visit to Vietnam?",43
33,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"In the spirit of the consultation established already, we will let those opposite know when we have thought about it.",43
34,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Yes, that is typical.",43
35,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The session could have meant this session of parliament per se, in which it would be applicable for this entire parli,ament.It certainly is not the intention of the government to review it at this stage. 'QUEST-ONS WITHOUT NOTICE Department of Employment, Education and Training: Fraud .Dr HEWSON-I refer the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to last night's highly disturbing documentary, report on fraud in his department, DEET. Can the minister advise the House how many cases of fraud in DEET have been identified in the last three years? How many convictions for fraud have been obtained from those investigations? How many taxpayers' dollars have been lost in these frauds? Are there investigations for fraud in DEET路 currently under way and, if there are, how many?",43
36,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As to the precise detail, I will respond at a later time. Let me just say that, in terms of the program that was on last n'ight, I can give a commitment to the House in this form: where fraud is identified, we will stamp it out, including the recovery of money that has been involved in that fraud. Mr SincIair-You have been there for six months.",43
37,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"And will be there for a lot longer too, I might add and, more importantly, you will not be coming over. The second thing is that since that case of fraud in 1992, which was identified last night on Four Corners, new procedures have been introduced by my, predecessor, following an internal audit by the department which resulted in some 44 recommendations for change. Of those 44 recommendations,. 40 have already been acted upon. In a report that was tabled. in this place on 18 March. in the autumn sittings of the parliament, the Auditor General referred to the internal audit procedures associated with the DEET' programs. Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition has not bothered to look beyond the Four Corners program. Page 81, paragraph 6.26, of the report reads: A recent performance audit review ofIT systems by the ANAOthe Australian National Audit Officehas confirmed that the Department now exercises effective control over access to its computer facilities and databases. This is a significant factor in providing assurance that the completeness and accuracy of accounts and records are not compromised by unauthorised entries or alterations. . The second thing I can tell the Leader of the Opposition is that steps have already been taken to ensure that the opportunity for fraud is significantly minimised. But we will go further in the announcements tomorrow; and the Leader of the Opposition will just have to wait for the detail of them. What we will be announcing torriorrow will hot just go to additional procedures to catch fraud; it will also improve the delivery of the CES. Whilst I am on my feet, I might say that the essence of that report on Four Corners last night was that, with all the money that the government might be contemplating spending, it is incapable of spending it effectively; That was really the thrust of the report. But Jet tis look at the success rate in what DEET and the CES have achieved to date. In the last three yearS, the total number of labour market programs has gone up from 325,000 to 520,000. The proportion of programs accommodating the long-term unemployed who have been placed there as a result of those programs has gone up from 47 per cent to 67 per cent. As for the positive outcomes arising from these programs,the success rate has gone from 58.6 per cent, in the case of the jobstart program, to 61 per cent. I would hardly suggest that that is a damning case for ineffectiveness on the part of DEET.. I ask those on the other side who think they might be crowing as a result of last night's story to look at what the Chamber of Manufactures had to say today in its press release. It said that the 'CES is fine by them'. It is a large employer organisation that is obviously getting good service from the CES. One letter has been sent to me today in disgust of the way the ABC portrayed the story last night in not talking about any positive outcomes-not even suggesting that there might have been some success in what we have done. Nova Employment sent this letter today. It is written by Martin Wren, who is the service manager. It reads: Attached is our correspondence sent to the ABC following their ""DEET Street"" program. I realise that this letter will achieve nothing and the ABC will sit smugly back and feel it has acted in the public interest but I wanted you to know that the people within the CES,with whom the NOVA program works are dedicated, honest and committed to assisting the long-term unemployed. It is a great shame that the allegations made in this program could not be more effectively dealt with. It was biased nonsense, All I am saying to this House is that the CES is not perfect, but it has been very successful to date. With the additions and new initiatives that we will announce tomorrow, it will be even more effective-because we are a government committed to doing something to ensure that路 the long-term unemployed get a chance in this economy. . ,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS",44
38,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the commerce select committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to those members. Honourable members-Hear, hear! .QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE Pay Television  which is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, relates to the introduction of pay TV. I ask the minister: what progress has been made in setting the digital standard for satellite pay TV? What significance does such progress have for the timing of the introduction of pay TV?",44
39,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the honourable member for Shortland for his continuing interest in this issue. Earlier this year I advised the House that licensees A and B had agreed to a full digital transmission standard to allow the provision of satellite pay television in Australia in accordance with the requirements of the Broadcasting Services Act. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the standard has now received all the necessary legal and technical clearances that are required. The standard was also reviewed by the previous Department of Industry, Technology and Regional. Development to ensure that there is a capacity for Australian manufacturers to get a benefit from the development of the new technology needed to provide pay television into Australians' homes. As all regulatory and legal requirements have now been met, I have today signed a notice for the formal gazettal of the digital standard. The gazettal of the standard will meet the final legislative prerequisite for the commencement of satellite pay TV services. It will permit the licensees to complete their manufacturing arrangements and will encourage the finalisation of industry plans. I have also previously stated the importance which the government places on ensuring that Australians still have access to free vision on events of national significance and of important cultural significance-including, no doubt, matches of the Steelers when they are in the grand final. I also make it clear to the House that it is my very strong intention to take on board the report from the Australian Broadcasting路 Authority into this very issue, this question of siphoning, and I expect that report from the ABA on about 13 May. The honourable member for Shortland might be aware that there has been some speculation that the New South Wales government,or perhaps some people on the Olympics organising committee, might wish to have a pay TV monopoly on television coverage of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. I want to make it clear to the House that it would be my intention to reject any proposal from the New South Wales government to have a pay TV monopoly on coverage of the Sydney Olympics. That is something which I hope would have the support of the opposition as well as my colleagues. Honourable members might also be interested to know that I have given approval to the ABC to establish a subsidiary to look after the ABC's interests in pay television. I have also asked the ABA to consider the ABC's suitability to hold a pay TV licence. We hope it might pass that test. There is also a requirement that a reference be made to the TPC to examine any competition consequences of the ABC being involved in pay television. As to when pay television might commence here in Australia, I understand from Australis, the B licence holder, that it currently plans to offer pay television services to Australian homes by September this year. Department of Employment, Education . and Training: Risk Management Program",45
40,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is directed to the Minist.er for Employment, Education and Training. I refer the minister to DEET's risk management plan and ask: how many of the programs administered by DEET have been assessed as being of high risk of fraud and what are those programs? When was the last compn:-hensive update of the risk to air telemanagement program undertaken?",45
41,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"As I said before, the last comprehensive analysis was undertaken路 in 1992. Since that time, some 40 initiatives that were identified in the assessment have been acted upon. The remaining four require the introduction of a national network, and it is the national network that we will be announcing funding for tomorrow. So I am confident that what we can do is adequately respond to each of those identified failings within the system. But I do .not ask the honourable member for Chisholm to take just my word for路 it. Listen again to what the Auditor General has had to say in a document tabled in the parliament which the honourable member as the shadow spok-sman has obviously not even read. His idea of researching this issue is to watch Four Corners. Let me just say, it has bee.n very interesting to find out because, when I went on to be interviewed by Four Corners on Friday, it was not prepared to tell me in advance the nature of the allegations that were going to be put to air on Monday night. The ABC obviously has an interest in informing .the public, but it does riot terribly much want to have a minister who might be able to get some answers for them on路路 the program coming forward with them on the program. In the case of Mr Evans, whose case was identified, I can go further and say that not only as a re-ult of the initiatives, the 44 that have been identified and the 40 that had been acted upon, Mr Evans has heen prosecuted and steps are well in hand to recover all of the moneys that were fraudulently misappropriated by both he andhis accomplices. To date, significantly more than half has already been recover-. The steps that we have in place involve a preparedness not only to prosecute the person, which will result in gaol if they are found guilty, but also the ability to recover by tapping into their superannuation entitlements or the sale of their house. I believe that the taxpayers'money can bewellproteeted. What we will be able to ensure, as a result of the new initiatives that we are about to announce on top of what has already been done, is that the case of future fraud will be significantly minimised. National Equity Program for Schools Mr SAWFORD....,.My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Ec;lucation and Training. Can the minister advise on progress in the government's strategy to ensure equality of educational opportunity for all young Australians?",45
42,Mr FREE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question and inform him that the news on this fundamental qu.estion of social justice is mixed. Certainly there is some good news. I am delighted to be able to .advise the House, for example, that last week the state of New South Wales Qnally, and some would say belatedly, followed the lead of other states and territories in signing onto the national equity program for schools, or NEPS, as it has become known. With NEPS now in place, schools right around the country cari benefit from a coherent approach which ensures nationally consistent targeting of funds t6 help lift the educational outcomes for disadvantaged students. Under NEPS the Commonwealth provides some $280 million each year to help disadvantaged students 路through a strategically integrated mix of programs. The overall aim of NEPS is to assist the one million students who are educationally disadvantaged in one way or another and whose schooling is therefore less rewarding and less effective than that of their friends. The 1994 equity agreement, signed by the states and the non-government systems,. covers objectives, targets, evaluation procedures, mechanisms for community involvement and the provision of nationally consistent data on outcomes; Under NEPS the statesa.gree to spend Commonwealth school funds provided for equity on agreed programs and also declare their own spending. Around half of the one million students whom NEPS will assist are economically disadvantaged. Others are geographicallyisolated,disabled or are from a non-English speaking background. or an Aboriginal or Torres. Strait Islander background. There are also those students who have experienced family breakdown, violence or abuse, leaving them more likely not to complete year 12. Ensuring that all youngpeople from backgrounds such as. these are given all the help possible is an objective that this government's c()mmitment to social. justice means it must address, because it is not just about ensuring equity in schooling; it is about laying the foundations for equality of access to employment opportunities in later life. Young people who are disadvantaged in their schooling tend to be the ones who drop outof the education system and, as we all know, the inevitable and catastrophic effect of this situation is their prospect of long-term, satisfying and productive work is greatly reduced. Early school leavers alienated by their experiences in formal education are2 Jh times more likely to be unemployed and eight to 10 times more likely to join the pool of long term unemployed. The Commonwealth recognises that funding alon--and certainly its funding-cannot entirely address these equity issues. That is why we are committed to the adoption of the national strategy for equity in schooling with the objective of providing an overarching national commitment. Here the news is not all that good because some of the states represented by the political partners of,my friends opposite do not share the same commitment that we have to ensuring better educational opportunity for disadvantaged young Australians. For example, at last week's meeting of state, Commonwealth and territory ministers, the conservative states used their numbers quite cynically to blight the adoption of a national strategy. They talked about the need for further discussion and about the need for further reports, but the reality of their position is that they would prefer to keep their own lumbering state bureaucracies happy by resisting change at whatever cost to Australia's young people. This government is determined that a national focus will be given to nationally important issues. It will continue to work towards a national strategy, tired arguments about states路 rights notwithstandirig. The agreements which were signed with the states are a significant and important step towards that objeCtive. Department of Employment, Education and Training: Fraud Dr WOOLDRIDGE""'""-My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Given that in his answers to the last two questions the minister has implied past and present fraud, can he now inform the House when this路 fraud was detected and by whom? When was he informed of the existence of fraud? Can he assure the House that the monitoring systems within his department that allowed this to that continue for so long have been reformed and that no similar cases will occur in the future?",46
43,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I can assure the House that the. systems have been reformed and I have just spent the last two answers outlining how. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is a slow leamer, I suggest that he get the Hansard and read it. If he needs some further information he can come around to my office and we will take him through it. As for the assertion that I can give a guarantee, in a program that is alteady spending $1.3 billion a year and is dealing with . 520,000 places, that there will never be any case of fraud, I am not prepared to do that. Mr Downer-So there will be fraud.",47
44,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If those opposite believe that that is the case, they should go and ask the same of every corporate chief executive in this country that operates their businesses. What we are talking about is criminal behaviour. They will be prosecuted and we will ensure that the money is retained. What sort of signal does denigrating the CES and ,saying that we. have路 programs incapable of being implemented effectively send to the people who are looking for increased assistance tomorrow? . Dr Kemp-You sent the signal.",47
45,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"-What sort of signaL do路 those opposite think those people are getting from that side of the House? The reality is that there has .been signi ficant achievement equity through. the labour market programs. The numbers are up, the success rate is up and the numbers of long-term unemployed being accommodated are up. Under the programs we have introduced, through jobstart, we are seeing a 61 per cent success rate-people going through the program and getting a positive placement. Is that a failure? Thetrouble with those opposite is that路they have no capacity to comprehend the importance of these programs because they would have wiped them out. Honourable members should look at what Fightback had to say. would have knocked people' off unemploybasis, ment benefits at the end of nine months, slashed labour market programs and not given any encouragement or opportunity for the people that most need it to get back into work. I just make the further point that I believe that tomorrow we will announce a significant package of measures that does give great and confidence to the unemployed about their ability to find meaningful jobs But we are not going to be helped if all we get is negativism from those on the other What we as a nation need to do at the moperformance ment is pull together behind solid policies, have them bagged on the basis of a couple of examples that they do not even have the or capacity to get further information upon and that they have not even bothered to read the Auditor-General's report upon as to steps taken to date to correct it. Look at the success of the programs and understand that if it ,not for those programs there would be hundreds of thousands of long-term unemwere ployed who would not be in work today. are committed to increasing their chances you will see the outcome of that tomorrow. Economic Growth",47
46,Mr CUNNINGHAM,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the latest national accounts for the December quarter 1993 which show that Australia's rate growth over the year 1993 was four per Can the Treasurer advise the House how this growth rate compares with that of other oped countries? Can he also say what are prospects for economic growth in those countries'in the next couple of years? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point' of order. Clearly,- the last part question of the member for MCMillan is asking for an opinion straight and simple. In that circumstance, it should be redrafted, . ruled out of order.",48
47,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Order! No, it was not a request for an opinion at all. The question in order.",48
48,Mr WILLIS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Our growth rate certainly was, as the member for MCMillan said, four It per cent through 1993. On a year-on-year it was a little less than that, 3.7 per cent, but still a highly commendable rate. It was certainly not far below the rate at which we grew through the period 1984 to 1989""'around 41h per cent-during which time we were about the fastest growing country in the Western world. So we are getting back into that region, and that is very comforting. That hope compares to our budget forecast for GDP growth of 23/4 per cent. Clearly, we are doing in the future. much better than that. If we contrast that with other developed side. countries, we can see just how good our actuaIIy was in 1993. The Internot national Monetary,Flind has estimated that the rate of growth for industrialisedcouritries 'in wit 1993 was not our 3.7 per cent but 1.2 per cent. The OECD estimate for the growth rate in 1993 of its constituent countries was. 1.1 per cent. There are only four countries in the OECD that had growth of three per cent or were more in 1993. They were Australia, Turkey, many New Zealand and the United States. There only seven countries that had growth of We over two per cent-the four countries that I and have just mentioned plus Canada, Norway and Ireland. So the rate of growth, that Australia chalked up in 1993 was absolutely at. the top end of the scale. Indeed, there were 10 countries in the OECD which went backwards in 1993. They of included some of the major economies like cent. Germany. Western Germany went b-ck by almost two per cent. France 'and Italy had develdeclining GDP in 1993. Japan, our major the trading partner, had absolutely minimal growth of 0.1 per cent. So, compared with all of those countries, we have done exceedingly well. There were two countries that diclbetter of the than us in 1993-Turkey arid New Zealand. In the case of New Zealand I think we should bear one thing in min9, and that is th,at and New Zealand has only recently, in '1993, regained the level of GOP that it achieved in 1986. In fact, it is now 4.7 per路.cent above is that level. But.since 1986, when New Zealand previously peaked, our GDP has grown by not 4.7 per cent but 23 per cent. So New Zealand has a hell of a lot of catching up to do. Fortunately for us, our Asian trading part..; ners,excluding Japan:-of course these Asian trading partners I;lre increasingly important to us-,. - have been growing rapidly. That has clearly been of assistance to us. The growth rates have varied from, at the low end, Hong Kong at five per cent to, at the upper end, Singapore at 10.7 per cent and China at an amazing 13 112 per cent. So they are clearly providing rapid growth in markets for our exports and assisting our further development. I am pleased to say that the growth pros.: pects for developed countries in 1994-95 are considerably better than the outcomes in 1993. The United States is expected to increase its growth rate further in 1994 to something in the order of 3.9 per cent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Germany and Japan, which either have been going backwards or have been virtually stagnant, are expected to pick up in 1994 and return to growth of over 2 per cent in 1995. Overall, the forecast for industrialised countries for 1994-95 is that they will grow a little over 2 per cent in 1994 and over 2112 per cent in 1995-considerably faster growth than they achieved in 1993 - . This is very important to Australia. We grew last year at 3.7 per cent with the other industrialised countries growing at 1.2 per cent, so we have been way in excess of these comparable countries. We can grow faster than the rest of the world if we have a capacity to be very competitive and to increase our market share. In a sense, that is what we were doing in 1993 with very strong growth in volumes of exports. Clearly, it helps us if the rest of the world grows faster. It helps us through increased demand for our exports, greater volumes, and it also helps bur commodity prices and in pushing up our terms of trade. We can increasingly look forward to that working for us over the next couple of years. So, in answer to the member for MCMillan, we have very good reasons to be confident that in the next couple of years we will be able to not only maintain the rate of growth that we had in 1993 but also improve upon it. Unemployment Programs: Fraud Risk",48
49,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Can the Minister for Employment, Education and Training advise the House whether all of the programs to be introduced or expanded in tomorrow's white paper on unemployment have ,been subjected to a fraud risk assessment? If the programs have been subjected to a fraud risk assessmerit, will he advise the House whether any have'been designated as being of high risk?",49
50,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I wonder whether there would have been any line of questioning coming from the other side had it not been for an allegation of fraud raised on a television program last night. I would have thought . there would have been at least an attempt in this sort of hard-headed attack that you are supposed to be coming up with today to find out what we can do for the unemployed. We will be developing a policy response that is significant not just in historic terms but also in terms of meeting the real needs of those that require assistance. We will be securing the basis for economic growth. We will be ensuring that we do not constrain that growth by not building our capacity. to skill the country, but most of all we will. be ensuring that in the development of programs we do not leave the long-term unemployed behind. On the back of all of that, we will be ensuring that the CES delivers better and more efficiently. We will be tightening the fraud procedures, but we will be opening up the delivery of programs to outside competition. Wait and see the detail and then try to criticise. Your attack today is pathetic. _",49
51,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"You don't know. Mr CREANWhile the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is interjecting, can I just say that he has got up and asked me more questions today than any other member on the other side has, but they have all been linked to this so-called notion of fraud. The problem with the program last night was that there was no balance.' There was no reference to the success rate that the programs have delivered. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition 'has had a standing invitation from my department since July of last year to go across and learn about the programs. If he is so concerned about the fraud and mismanagement, why has he not taken up that invitation? Women: Violence",49
52,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am very pleased to ask the first question without notice directrespondents ed to the Minister for Human Services and Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Has the minister seen the recent ABS figures on violence against women in Australia? How .were the figures 'compiled, and what do they reflect about this aspect of Australian society? What are the government's intentions in this area?",50
53,Dr LAWRENCE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the honourable member for Bass for my first question. The honourable member is referring to a very important set of statistics, which' honourable members would do well to heed, from the Australian Bureau of Statistics crime and safety survey report which shows, sadly, that we still have very high levels of sexual assaults going unreported. The report says that some 75 per cent of sexual assaults on women in 1993 - ere not reported. Unfortunately, that figure is sadly similar to the figures for previous years. Furthermore, only a small number of those reports resulted in a conviction and 66 per cent of thoSe wh6 were assaulted knew the offender. It is a very serious problem for women in our community, a problem involving offences which have been repeated over and over again. I am pleased to say that women are now less tolerant路 of this state of affairs and vocal about the need to improve these circumstances. The states in particular and the legal profession are taking action. The Commonwealth government, too, is moving toward a women's justice program. I would be interest00 to hear from honourable members opposite about their plans, through their recently discovered law and order program, to ensure that violence against women does not continue at this rate. They might be aware-I hope they are--of a recent survey conducted by the Australian Council of Women. Some 20,000 postcards were .returned in this survey about issues of concern to women. Some 5,000 responses actually mentioned fear of violence and the incidence of violence as major concerns. They also showed concern about the fact that the police generally and the legal system do not appear to take violence against' women and sexual assault seriously, and the survey are very wary. indeed about the responsiveness of the criminal justice system to them. It is most important that we as members here recognise the .need for national action, because some of the states are not pulling their weight in this area; In my own state, for example, one of the ministers responsible for community development has significantly reduced funding for programs designed tQ reduce violence against women. He has said on many occasions that he is totally opposed to the idea of. women reporting violence within the home to the police. So Commonwealth action. is necessary and we will be working with. the various bodies. that I. have mentioned, including the state governments, to establish a national women's justice. program to make sure that those figures that we heard about on Friday night are not repeated.",50
54,Unknown,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Opposition members interjecting,50
55,Dr LAWRENCE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If members opposite feel that this is a matter for interjection and some levity, then I suggest they think again. Department of Employment, Education . and Training: Four Co-ers Program",50
56,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is dimore rected to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer to a路 report made by the minister on Perth radio station 6PR this morning that the Minister thought that the Four Corners program was pretty weak. Could he inform the parliament what aspect of the program he thought was pretty weak. Was it the widespread and long standing fraud, people being unfairly dismissed at the end of training programs, inappropriate shunting of people from one training program to another just to keep them off the dole queue, or mismanagement of his department?",50
57,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"-"":'whilst referring to this radio program in Western Australia today- .. Mr Dobie-Did you hear it?",50
58,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I did, because I responded after Dr Wooldridge. But Dr Wooldridge made another allegation, which is totally without foundation-that I was hiding and that the ABC had tried to get me on the show four times that morning. I had no requests from the ABC and after checking with the ABC-and I suggest that the honourable member do that later if he does not take my word for it-it was confirmed that no such request was made. His cQntribution on that radio program today, in transcript terms, went for a page. It contained one untruth and talked about what he apparently saw last nightlongstanding, widespread fraud being conducted by DEET. Where is his evidence of that? The trouble with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that he has been spending so much time in this place defending his own back that he has paid no attention to policy. In order to lift his stocks when the Liberal leadership is under such strife, he has decided to run with. the first thing that came into his head, and that is all he has to run with. The fact remains that the opposition will have to await the detail of the programs that we will be announcing tomorrow. But, in all the circumstances, the thing that also annoys me about the program that was run last night is the reporting that fed off it. I will go to some of the allegations where the CES' is supposed to have fallen down. The first allegation is this: the honourable member has made mention of the fact that .the CES is falling short of its target. I guess he was relying on some newspaper reports that said: The internal documents obtained by Four Corners show CES was only abl,e to report 122,092 placements for the long-term unemployed to the end of March 1994, only 74.2 per cent of its operational plan target of 164,564. What an amazing revelation: three-quarters of the way through the year we are only three-quarters of the way towards attaining our target. .Does he not understand the stupidity of his position? Mr Richard Evans-What did Conrad Black say?",51
59,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The next allegation in this great report that he is relying on which was supplied courtesy of Four Corners is that less emphasis is being placed on the long-term unemployed. Mr Richard Evans-That is right and it is getting bigger and bigger every day.,51
60,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I have already quoted from the table which shows, WIth an almost trebling of placements under jobstart-'-now targeted effectively to only the long-term unemployed-that more than 70 per cent are now being picked up. Mr Richard Evans-Why don't you give them a job?",51
61,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"In relation to anyone going thrQugh that program, we are achieving an almost two-thirds success rate. In .other words, two out of every three people are today not on the dole queue as a result of these programs. Mr Richard Evans-One out of every 10 unemployed.",51
62,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,To say that there is less emphasis on the long-term unemployed,51
63,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! The minister might just wait for a moment. The honourable member for Cowan is consistently interjecting. I suggest that he sit there and restrain himself.,51
64,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"To suggest that the emphasis on the long-term unemployed is diminishing is absolute rubbish. Not only has it increased and been successful; those opposite will see e-en more emphasis on it tomorrow. .A third allegation that is derived out of this great program is that somehow the CES's success in filling vacancies-those opposite job should understand that it is filling vacancies1:Jas diminished significantly since 1985. What another amazing revelation! Can the oppositionreally compare the middle of a boom with the depth of a recession in making comparisons as to how to fill vacancies? In a recession, the vacancies are not there in the same number. I . find it particularly disturbing that the allegations that fed off this story last night get credibility in the reporting of them. I am less surprised by the fact that the opposition, desperate for a line, has jumped on to it in any circumstance. The other allegation that is made is that 43 per cent of the long-term unemployed are not referred to a job or program. The simple fact of the matter as to why that is so is either because the individual is not job ready-we have all heard how the employers do not want people turning up whom they cannot employ; that is why we will be doing something, about case management tomorrow to correct thator there simply are not enough program placements to accommodate those seeking them. We will be addressing that, too, tomorrow. I suggest that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition start doing some serious research. He is contributing nothing to this debate. All he is trying to do is bolster his failing stocks. He does not deserve to be where he is. I hope his party moves on him. Tourism",51
65,Mr DODD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Can the Minister for Tourism outline to the House the economic benefits provided by tourist shopping in Australia? Can he also outline what the government is doing to encourage this market? ',52
66,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his great advocacy for the tourism industry in his own electorate and the rest of the country. In 1992-93 international visitors spent about $1.5 billion on shopping. Compared to some other export industri-s, that is a lot of export earnings for our country. Average, expenditure on shopping in Australia reached a bit more than $700 for each visitor in the June quarter of 1993. I am very pleased that last weekend's Good Weekend magazine of the Sydney Morning Herald also contained a few interesting comments on this matter, pointing out in particular that a small number of these visitors spend very large sums of money during their visit, particularly on jewellery and designer clothing-which would be of interest to the honourable member for Bennelong and others on that side of the House. This week I released a report on .a survey of international visitors' shopping preferences prepared by the Bureau of Tourism Research. That report will help retailers and also tourism operators to tailor their policies to take advantage of this very important market. Mr Downer-This is the great hope of the Labor Party.",52
67,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Be quiet or you might suffer. Mr Downe,r-Notfrom you, pal; not from you.",52
68,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"-Order! The honourable member for Mayo might restrain himself, and the minister might restrain himself from responding to interjections. Mr Downer-I am only helping him.",52
69,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I do not think he needs your help.,52
70,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Speaker. The report pointed to the generally high level of satisfaction of visitors with the range of goods available. One item which did show up on the survey was that 30 per cent of travellers expressed Sbme dissatisfaction with shopping hours, Thirty per. cent said that they were unable to shop at some time during their visit to Australia, which perhaps is not a surprising thing. The highest rates of dissatisfaction referred to the fact that shops were closed between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. I am pleased to say that I understand that the Queensland government is already implement.. ing further deregulation of shopping hours in that state and that in Western Australia and South Austnilia inquiries into that area are currently under way. ' One of the most interesting things about this survey is how widely spread the benefits of these international visitors' spending patterns are for the economy. On average these tourists spend about $219 per person in department stores, which is more than the ,$124, on average, they spend in duty-free stores-which might be a surprise to some honourable members. When we look at how much is spent in specialty stores like jewellery and handicraft stores, we see that on average it is $343-more than the amount spent in duty-free stores and department stores combined. We can see how many jobs and how much investment tourists are helping to create through their spending patterns. Department of Employment, Education and Training: Fraud",52
71,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Given that fraud and mismanagement have been found in his department-first, in an answer to a question on notice on 21 February this year which took him three months to get back to and, secondly,on Four Corners last night-and given his pathetic statement 'I have only been in the job for five months', what responsibility does he as minister take for this disgraceful tion? Does the buck stop with him or which one of his predecessors is he going to blame, the Minister for Finance or the former member for Fremantle?",53
72,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am not going to blame anyone; I am going to build on the success of what has been introduced to date, ensure that we deliver better progratnS and ensure that the taxpayers' money that is put towards those programs is protected. I have already outlined the means by which that is going to occur. What! am saying to the shadow minister for employment, education and training is that he is on the wrong tram. He might have been in his position a lot longer than the five months T have been in mine, but he is making no impact in terms of this' portfolio's activities. I suggest that one important step that he might take is to pickup that invitation, now of 10 months' duration, go across to my department and try to find out from it what is really bugging him rather than to just ask these inane questions which, quite frankly, getting him nowhere. Vocational Education",53
73,Mr CHYNOWETH,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question' is addressed to the Minister for School-, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister advise. the House of any evidence that the government's commitment to the vocational education sector is meeting business needs? Mr FREE.. As the honourable member for Dunkley and this House both know, the excellent outcomes which continue to flow from the Commonwealth's massive expansion of the TAFE system are a continuing source of great pride to this government. The evidence in this year's enrolmentstatistics make . it quite路 clear that young Australians have heard .the government's message, and that is that university is not the only worthwhile post-schoohraining alternative. Quite simply, a degree is not the only way to get a job. This message is being repeatedly vindicated. Opposition mem bers-'Ooh!",53
74,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! Those on my left!,53
75,Mr FREE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"A survey reported in this week's Business Review Weekly conducted for situa- the Yellow Pages organisation gives the finding that TAFE students are preferred over university graduates as prospective employees by small business-the sector which is, of course, the greatest source of job growth. Some 47 per cent of small businesses in the survey said that they preferred TAFE qualified people compared with only 10 per cent who favoured university graduates. Of the businesses. surveyed, over half employed TAFE graduates while less than a third had recent university graduates on their staff. The reasons the businesses in the survey gave for their preferences are quite instructive. They preferred TAFE students because they. are perceived as having more relevant and practical skills. In contrast, only 40 per cent of those businesses employing graduates thought that their education had equipped them adequately for small business jobs. That is good news for the nation's vocational education system, so good that it seems .are that everybody wants to get in on the act. Honourable members might recall that the Victorian government announced a major funding commitment in last week's economic statement to expand that state's TAFE system. That was a commitment that the Commonwealth should be delighted to commend without reservation. Regrettably, we cannot because much of the funding that was announced by the Victorian government was supplied not by it but by the Commonwealth. Last Wednesday, for example, the Melbourne Herald-Sun reported that the state government was spending $10 million at the Box Hill College of TAFE. In fact, that is all Commonwealth funding that was announced last October. The Herald-Sun also reported that the state government would be spending $18 million at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Mr Kennett and his colleagues were wrong again; the Commonwealth is providing the entire $18 million. The list on and on, with the Victorians claiming no less than $80 million of Commonwealth expenditure on TAFE as its own. The Commonwealth路. is always delighted to see demand-driven growth in TAFE places because .it is meeting business needs but, in this case, the Kennett government seems either unwilling or perhaps, more charitably, unable to allocate credit where it is due. Department of Employment, Education and Training: Judicial Inquiry",53
76,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Opposition! Training. .. Government members interjecting",54
77,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! Those on my success right!,54
78,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, year. for the protection. I refer the minister to documented cases of fraud and mismanlong-term agement in DEET, including major employer subsidy schemes, deliberate stealing of public money, and training programs are totally unrelated to the needs of the labour market. I therefore ask the minister whether he will support the establishment of a full independent judicial inquiry into the fraud mismanagement in his department and, if does not, can he explain to the House exactly what it is that he has to hide? Mr CREAN .......I have nothing to hide as all your questioning today indicates, you have not been able to make a mark. The fact of the matter remains that the only e""idence that was contained in the Four Corners program .last night were the four cases-one of which has been prosecuted and路 where the money has been substantially recovered.",54
79,Mr TUCKEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,-:How many more are there?,54
80,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"As a result of that case, in the review of 1992 we introduced measures that ensure that further cases of fraud are significantly minimised. If the Leader of the Opposition has any specific evidence of his own or from his deputy, that great research fount of wisdom over there bubbling over with information who always has those people working on falsehoods and misinformation, goes why does he not come forward with it-if indeed he has it? The reason why there is no need to support an inquiry is because there is no evidence associated with it.",54
81,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,What about the mismanagement?,54
82,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Leader of the Opposition has asked his question.,54
83,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,But why is not the Leader of the Opposition prepared,54
84,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,:-You created the unemployment.,54
85,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! The Leader of the,54
86,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Why is the Leader of the Opposition not prepared to acknowledge the of these schemes? We are now accommodating some 520,000 placements this We are increasing the success of those the programs, we are targeting even more the unemployed, and we have done路 that abuse of with existing resources.",54
87,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"-' And you do not have an that answer to the problem; . Mr CREAN-Wait and see what the additional reSOllrces which will be announced tomorrow are going to do. I suggest to the and Leader of the Opposition that his attack on he our initiatives had better be a lot better tomorrow than he has made a fist of today. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition, and, who comes into this House expressing concern for the路 unemployed of this country and wanting commitments to full employment, of what he wanted to do in October 1992. He wanted to take full employment out of the Reserve Bank's charter. What mock hypocrisy for him to come in here and talk about his concerns for the unemployed when those opposite,had they been elected to government, would have had no commitment to full employment at all. They would have slashed the programs. They would have been forcing people off any income support. They would have given no encouragement and no assistance to those people who tomorrow will be assisted substantially more than they already have been to date. Mining Industry Mr ADAMS'- My question is directed to the Minister for ResourceS. Has the. minister's attention been路 drawn to reports that Australia's mining industry is running down its exploration and development expenditure in Australia and that Australian mining companies are shifting their exploration activities offshore? Are the reports accurate? What is路 the government's intention in this area?",54
88,Mr BEDDALL,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"-,. It gives me great pleasure to remind this House of how important the mining and resources indus-Ty is to this economy. For those honourable members who need reminding, this is a $30,000 million indl,lstry which is40 per cent of Australia's total exports. As has been stated in the question of the honourable member for Lyons, there has been some reporting recently that Australian mining companies are 'shifting', as it has been said in the press, their resources offshore. Nothing could be further from the truth. I remind honourable members that 20 per cent of every dollar spent in the world on mineral exploration is spent in this country. I also remind the House that Australia's mining industry cannot be compared with anywhere else in the worJd. We are the best of any country at mineral and resources exploitation. . Most Australians do not realise that the largest mining company in the world is Australian. Of course, that company is BHP. Of course Australian companies should be investing money offshore. Why should we explore only in Australia? It is important for Australian companies that are world leaders to ensure that they exploit resources where they can be found. That is not to say that they are using those resources only to explore offshore. In fact, a lot of exploration is still taking place in Australia, ,as I have explained. In the recess I had the opportunity to visit the Carpentaria-Mount Isa mineral province. This is a unique development in Australia. Five major mining companies are working with the Northern Territory government, the Queensland government and the Commonwealth government to develop a region which is great in mineral wealth and which is probably the greatest exploration路 region in this country. The mining companies involved in that mineral province are BHP, MIM, CRA, Placer Pacific and the Western Mining Corporation. Just two of those projects which I had the opportunity to visit offer us enormous opportunity in the near future.CRA's Century mine, which is in final feasibility, could provide one of the world's largest zinc mines. BHP's Cannington mine could provide us with the world's largest silver mine with significant resources of lead. So, whilst Australian mining companies are looking for mineral resources around the world, they are certainly not ignoring Australia. One in five dollars of all exploration dollars spent anywhere in the world is spent in this country.",55

QUESTIONS TOMR路SPEAKER.路 Sub Judice Rule Dr THEOPHANOUS"""":""' Mr Speaker, I ask you a question which has repercussions for the rights of all members of the parliament. I refer to an article in the Melbourne HeraldSun of last Friday, 29 April, in which there is an extensive discussion of a constitutional issue currently before the High Court concerning freedom of the press and the defamation. rights of parliamentarians. In previous times, newspapers would not have路 been able to comment on such issues while they were before the court. However, it appears that a statement by Sir Anthony Mason in November 1991 is now interpreted as permitting a situation where newspapers can comment on matters currently before the High Court. My question is this: is there now an anomalous situation whereby the media can debate the merits of certain issues which are before the High Court while members of parliament cannot debate them in this chamber because of the sub judice rule? What are the limits of the sub judice rule in relation to the ability of members to discuss issues which are before the High.Court, especially whenthese matters have been discussed in the media without the ability of MPs to comment or reply?  is no date set, you can talk about it.",55
91,Unknown,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Government members interjecting about it.,56
92,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! I could have sworn the question was directed to the路 Speaker. Mr Downer-But you don't know the answer again.,56
93,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Is that right? Perhaps we wiIlconsult in the spirit of consultancy. The honourable member for Calwell has raised an issue which I know he has a particular interest in and a great concern about. I will investigate. thoroughly the matters that he has raised and report back to the House. Parliamentary Library .,56
94,Mrs SULLIVAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, the question which I direct to you relates to the Parliamentary Library. Is it a fact that the newspaper clipping service which the library undertakes as a service to members in their research does not cover all states of Australia? Namely, as a cost cutting exercise some little time ago, was a decision taken that the capital city dailies of Queensland and South Australia were no longer to be included in the clipping service? Mr Speaker, was this matter referred to you .by the library and did you approve of it? What action can you take to, perhaps undertake a review of this matter, given that the assumption seems to be that nothing of national significance is ever reported in either Brisbane or Adelaide?",56
95,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,That is a leading question. I will certainly look at the issue that the honourable member for Moncrieff has raised. I see no reason why those particular. newspapers should not also be the subject of the same serVice. I will take up the matter with the Parliamentary Librarian. Standing Order 150,56
96,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, my question to you follows a question that I asked the Acting Speaker in your absence in the last sittings. I refer you to standing order 150 which says in part: If after the expiration of 90 days of a question first appearing on the Notice Paper a reply has not been delivered to the Clerk, the Member who asked the question may rise in his or her place at the conclusion of the question period and request the Speaker to write to the Minister concerned, seeking reasons for the delay in answering. The Acting Speaker assured me and many of my colleagues that he would write to the minister seeking reasons for the delay in . answering. To date I have not heard any of those reasons. You may have heard of them. I again raise question No. 313 asked on 30 August-now seven months ago, question Nos 798 and 807 asked on 17 December, all of which have not been answered and about all of which I have not heard any reasons for the delay in answering.

I would, but I note that in relation to those particular questions to which the honourable member for Wannon refers, letters were written to the relevant minister or ministers, as the Acting Speaker indicated he would.

101,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Labor Government's mismanaged and ineffective assistance for unemployed Australians.

102,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have today attempted to ask the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) questions about DEET's performance. PAPERS Before I start this MPI, let me reply to some of the comments that were made in question time. Firstly, the minister made much mirth about the CES paper that has been leaked achieving only 75 percent of its target three-quarters of the way through the year. If you care to read the DEET report-which you to clearly have not-you will see that it says it is pro rata. It is being done on a pro rata basis for the year, so you do not know what is going on there. Secondly, you have shown that the risk management assessment for your department was last done in 1992. So in spite of the expansion of labour market programs, in路spite of. the increase in case work and long-term unemployment, your risk managel1lent system is two years old. Also, you replied that allegations that you had been hiding were a great falsehood and misrepresentation. Let me repeat on the record: last night you apparently went to ground. We were told by the ABC that it tried repeatedly to路 get you and could not; we were told by Adelaide and Perth radio that they had tried to get you and could not. So it is good that you have come in here to answer the questions. . You路 have made much about DEET's performance data. It is only three months out; it is not a full response from participants. You seem to think that a 60 per cent outcome means that 60 per cent of them got them from DEET. What is happening is that they are churning and churning training programs around. A positive outcome does not mean that they have got a job. Anyone who has done first year statistics knows that 'correlation' does not imply 'causality'., I do not intend to get personal, as has been your only defence; I will talk about DEET. We had a program last night called 'DEET Street'. That has to be' a street of shame. I will talk about the nature of unemployment, how you have attempted to disguise the problem, the feeble attempt of the Labor Party over 11 years to deal with unemploymentthat is an 11-year history of failure-the allegations last night and, the reason we believe that in the end the only way to address t-is is through an independent judicial inquiry. Unemployment is important by reason of its scope in Australia today. There are 903,000 people out of work, 476,000 of them for more than 12 months and 190,000 of them for mare than two years. There are 580,000 people who are underemployed as they can only find a few hours work a week. Those figures are from the ABS survey last year. That is 6.8 per cerit of the work force, which is up from 3.8 per cent at the end of the last recession. There are 160,000 people who have given up. That is half a million people, half a million kids that, whose parents have no work. If we add 903,000 to 580,000 to 160,000, we have 18 per cent of the Australian work force out of work, underemployed or who have given up. But why this has to be addressed and why it is culpable and negligent not to do so are the social consequences. EPAC looked at this some time ago: it looked at divorce, marriage and crime. If we could reduce unemployment by just foqr percentage points, it reckons we would have 800 fewer divorces, 4,000 more marriages and 20 fewer homicides. We have youth suicide in Australia at a world record: a response to desperation, hopelessness and despair. It has been high for most of the last decade. There has been no concerted or coordinated response. ' The AMA has' looked at the health impacts of unemployment. If a man is unemployed, the AMA reckons that his mortality is up 17 per cent,there are 52 per cent who have higher blood pressure, 50 per cent more doctors visits, 250 per cent more mental disorders and 68 per cent more bronchitis. If a wom-m is unemployed, there are 42 per cent with more serious chronic illnesses, 35 per cent more hospital admissions, 80 per cent more outpatient visits and 43 per cent more smoking. Unemployed people have twice as many skin diseases-' nervous diseases and emotional disorders. The AMAhad a look to see whether the sickness causes the unemployment or unemployment causes the sickness. Quite clearly, its conclusion was the latter: unemployment cause,s the sickness. That is the basis 6n which we are having this debate. That is the basis on which we say unemployment is the most pressing social and economic problem in the country. What has been the response? The response has been an attempt to fiddle the figures: if we cannot do anything realistic about it, we will try to make it disappear. So we will have a mature age allowance: if a person is 60 years of age and out of work for more than 12 months, we will slough you off the figures. How many? We do not know; but 30,000 people applied for the mature age allowance. ' Then there is the prospect of young people not being eligible for the dole. There are in 40,000 there who will disappear from the figures. I think back to before the last election t6 the shrill and overblown claims of 'slave wages of $3.50 an hour'. We have had reports of your $3.20, and we will look forward to seeing how that goes. There is a job compact to take some 150;000 to 300,000 people off the figures. There is a much, greater proportion of people on sickness benefits; sickness pensions. There is a massive expansion of the CDEP program whi<;:h takes Aboriginal people off the, figures. There is a very high school retention rate, of which people like to be proud, but a lot of those students cannot find jobs. We are 14 months into this parliament and we now have ,the government's first attempt to do anything of substance about this problem. In 1993, at the opening of the Labor Party's election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that the 'overriding priority for the next three years is jobs'. If we look that, we see the only jobs those opposite appear to be worried about are their own. They have sat on their hands for 14 months and done nothing. We have had reports that it will be January next year before this starts. If this is such an overriding problem, why are we waiting a further seven months? The answer is simple: because nine months from then is September and people will come back on the figures in October so those opposite are clear for an election with them out of the way and having statistically disappeared right up until then. If, as we hear, this is such a pressing social problem, try to explain how it takes 21 months to do anything about it. There is much talk' about research. I have gone back and had a look at some of the promises which have been made over the last 11 years. Those promises put in context what you will put in place tomorrow. At the February 1983 policy launch, the then opposition leader Hawke said: One in ten Australians out of work--':a figure Australian would have believed poSsible a few years ago, and which no Australian Government should ever be forgiven' fot creating. You will not be forgiven, and you cannot hide it. In August 1983 at the launch of the youth employment and skills training program, Minister Willis said that we would have 40,000 places. We did not have 40,000; we had 30,000, of which only 35 per cent were in jobs six months later. In August 1985 we had Priority One: Young Australia. Do members remember Priority One? Ten thousand youth traineeships were going to be created .within the first year. All we had was billboards and lunches with executives. A year later how many had been created? Not one. In 1985 we had the jobstart program. We had a prediction of 85,000 places to be available through a wage subsidy scheme. In fact, only 42,000 were made available. In 1988 we had the job training program for the unemployed. We had the same sort of overblown promises of performance. We had boasts that it was modelled on the Canadian model with a success rate of 60 to 90 per cent. What were you able to achieve? You were able to achieve 18 to 29 per cent sucat cess. In 1991 we had newstart- Do you know what that was going to do? That was going to coordinate Commonwealth employment training and income support services--.:.exactly the same thing you will try to pretend is happening now. It did not happen three years ago; it is not going to happen tomorrow. In August 1991 we had the budget: $200 million more for labour market programs, and this claim that rings very similar to what we hear from you路 day to (lay: 'While the job market is not expected to dramatically improve in the short term, the government's labour. market programs will ensure that, when the recovery comes and employment begins to accelerate, the unemployed will have the skills and training necessary to get back to work.' They certainly have not had the skills and training in the last three years. In the 1991 budget Paul Keating as Treasurer said that we would have a small fall in unemployment. It went from 9.5 to 10.5 per cent. In November 1991 we had a jobs and no training rescue plan. We had this quote: The Government now has a more than comprehensive approach to working to overcome our present labour market difficulties, with initiative in the education and training area further contributing to our efforts to position even 'more people to take advantage of the imminent economic recovery. They are not very well positioned. In February 1992 we had the One Nation statement that was going to 'bring about significant reductions in total unemployment'. Unemployment after that went up to 10.7 per cent. That is the sum total of your 11 years work-overblown promises, consistent inability to meet targets and consistently raising hopes that are dashed. Last night on Four Corners we had an expose on the - Department of Employment, Education and Training. It showed major fraud and stolen government money; internal audits from the Australian National Audit Office and the Commonwealth DPP which suggested that information the government relies on to determine its labour market programs' and whether they are funding and operating properly is seriously flawed, if not corrupt; major abuse of employer subsidy schemes; inadequate record keeping and information technology systems; irresponsible management practices; and DEET programs that are totally inappropriate to the needs Australia's labour market. That is a compreresult hensive criticism of the department for which you are responsible. Earlier in the week we had the leaking of the CES report. In 23 regions in Australia, this is how targets are being met: two out of 23 met their operational plan targets for vacancies notified; none met their job placement targets; five met theirlabour market commencement targets-earlier today we had pendent the minister at the table saying, 'We are targeting the long-term unemployed but not according to that-one out of .23 exceeded job placements ror long-term unemployed; and none achieved their program commencement targets. The minister comes from the ACTU. His primary concern for a long time has been the work force. He has been the minister for nearly six months and only now are these . reports coming路 out. We have to seriously question the commitment to this and we have to seriously question whether DEET has any capacity to deliver the programs being proposed. The minister's defence has been, 'I've been here only six months; you can't blame me.' The fact is that there have been three senior ministers responsible. for the Department Employment, Education and Training: the we are, seeking to get back into work. fonrier member for Fremantle, the. former Treasurer; the present Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley); and the present minister. DEET was created in 1987. It has been going for seven years. It has 15,000 employand ees and there is路 no confidence at all that can deliver these programs.. There confidence at all that it can actually do anything worthwhile to meet the needs Australia's unemployed. We believe that it absolutely crucial to get to how, why and what - ay the government has sought to sources, address these inadequacies because unemploydeveloping ment is clearly the major problem facing Australia. We in the opposition get leaks from .time to time. We had one a while ago which was very telling. It was: 'Watch the white paper because it will try to make unemployment of disappear statistically.' That will be the net of what the government does tomorrow. It will do nothing to create jobs, there will be no growth, lots of overblown promises and lots of overblown rhetoric. As in the last 11 years, all we will see are promises that in the end are not met or kept or that are unattainable. The fact is that there is a long standing history of incompetence, of mismanagement and of raised expectations. In the light of all of this, we believe there should be an inde-' judicial . inquiry into this department, its performance and its effectiveness. There is better'; no alternative ..",57
103,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I say at the outset that I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) that there is no more important issue than unemployment. It .has to be addressed not only for the social reasons he has outlined but also for economic ones. The social reasons are not just the impact on families, the increase in the crime rate and the debilitation of people who just do not see any hope for the future. I agree with him on all of those reasons. I think there are further reasons of an economic nature-:-I. am sure he would agree with me on this:-for not wasting the human resource potential that resides within of the people currently out of work and whom . This is not' a problem unique to Australia. It is a problem being experienced certainly by every western nation, so much so that the OECD has recently commissioned a report a ministerial meeting on' how to address it it. I believe that with the initiatives we are is no announcing tomorrow we will have the potential to lead the world in solutions to the of long-term unemployment problem because we is will be building. on an already successful in achievement rate. By committing more, re- . by targeting delivery a lot better, by case management and by better matching the. needs of would be Amployee-, those out of the work force, with what .employersrequire, I believe we can achieve better outcomes than those that we have stated: already achieved. It路 is suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we have not been doing not anything in the 14 months that we have been in office. His suggestion as to how we solve this mammoth international and domestic problem is to have a judicial inquiry; he did not propose a solution. The judges of this country will not provide the solutions to the long-term unemployed. That is what people elect politicians to do and that is what we be doing tomorrow. In the last three years this nation has expended $3 billion in labour market programs, some $1 112 billion in the last 12 months. On top of that is it substantial commitment to income support in the order of another $9 billion. The challenge-one that I -,elieve we will respond effectively to tomon.Jw-is not only to enhance those resources but also to make the existing commitments work better for us, to make the passive income support proposals work in a more pro-active way and to get better targeting from the existing programs and better matching of the particular needs. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that the government's response to this issue is to try to address it in two ways. One is that we fiddled the figures and the other is that we have done nothing over the past 14 months. On. the question of fiddling the figures, I put on record this letter from the Australian Statistician, Mr Ian Castles. It was written in response to a line reported in one daily newspaper, the Australian Financial Review of Monday 18 April, by Glen Milne. Mr Milne said that essentially what the government plans to do is use the document to alter a raft of definitions covering unemployment-in other words, that our strategy is to define the problem away. This is not what the government is saying; this is the independent chief路 statistician of the nation responding to this allegation of the Deputy Leader of. the Opposition, which he has asserted again today and is now walking away from. The shadow minister should stick this in his research pile and digest it. Mr Castles .I can assure your readers that whatever changes may be made to existing labour market programs, or whatever programs may be introduced, they will give rise. to a change in the definitions of employed and unemployed persons, including that of the long-term unemployed, used by the ABS. In other words, we cannot define the problem away. I have said publicly on many occasions that it is not our intention in the-response in the white paper to define the problem away. People are confusing .the gateway associated will with the job compact with other levels of assistance. In essence, as the green paper highlighted, the compact will offer the opportunity of a placement. By offering the opportunity of a placement, the activity test can be enforced far more rigorously because what we will be doing is offering people a job. That is not to say that those who are not in the compact will not get assistance. Everyone who meets certain levels of criteria will be entitled to differing forms of benefit. The form of benefit will have regard to the extent of disadvantage attaching to the individual in question. In the main, the extent of disadvantage will be defined by the length of time the individual has been out of work. We have looked at other measures by which that can be done, but in the main that will be the definition. But it will not be the sole definition. We are not seeking to define the problem away. The statistician says that we cannot, but I want to assure the House that we are not seeking to. As for the assertion that we have done nothing in the past 14 months, I say that in the past. 12 months the government has created 177,000 jobs. We have increased the numbers of people under jobstart from 150,000 to another 160,000 this year. We have targeted more of the long-term unemployed and we have achieved higher success rates. The fact of the matter is that we have created 177,000 jobs in 12 months. Our election commitment was to 500,000 jobs. We are already ahead of the target only one year into the term, and 120,000 of those 177,000 jobs have been created in the past six months. So our expectation is that we will exceed our target. In other words, not only are we delivering our promise but we will exceed it. Yet the honourable member for Chisholm has the gall to get up and say that we have done nothing. His solution is to have a judicial inquiry so that the judges of the country can tell us about the solution. I go then to the assertion that there has been success in the nature of the programs that the Commonwealth has conducted. In 1991-92 there was a total of 325,000 labour market program placements. Close to 59,000 of them were under jobstart. Under jobstart those days only 47.2 per cent of the long-term proach. unemployed were being targeted, but we were achieving a 58.6 per cent success rate outcomes-outcomes that are measured by internationally recognised standards and which are. better than other countries applying those same standards. That was the position two years ago. We have gone from 325,000 places to a target this year of 520,400 places-in other words, a significant ramping up of effort, significant commitment of resources, but diminution in the success rate, despite the that. we are now more actively targeting the long-term unemployed, the people who are harder to place. We are achieving higher success rates with harder targets. honourable member for Chisholm says that the CES has been ineffective and he bases that ineffectiveness on four stories that were contained in Four Corners last night. I accept that there are examples of abuse. I accept that there can be Circumstances in which significant improvements can be made. But what he cannot deny is the success rate under these programs to .date .. The success rate of the jobstart program is some 61 per cent; the vast majority of people into jobs. The assertion that they are not real jobs is wrong. I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to look again at the statistics that arepublic1y available that confirm view: a 61 per cent positive rate of people now being targeted who are at least 12 months out of the work force and who the employers of the country say they do not want to employ because they are not job ready. We have effectively gotten them job ready because of the labour market program placements. Not only have we got them job ready but we have got them jobs. Two-thirds of people who would still be on the dole queue have got jobs. That has been done with the not way the programs have been run to date with no case management focus-or very little because.it has just commenced in the last month or so. In the white paper tomorrow there will be a significant commitment to the in enhancement of the case management apI believe that not only have we got success in rates to date and not only have we got an effective CES delivering programs but also we can improve it. It will improve for two fundamental reasons. One is that we are to commit more resources to it and improve the delivery mechanism. The second is that we are not going to rely solely on the CES for the delivery of programs. In other words, we . are sensibly going to open up opportunities a for competition for those who are prepared to no commit themselves to the same requirements fact that we believe have been the basis fot successful placement to date; that is, case management, better matching of the client needs, emphasis on training and, importantly, the Yet the commitment to placements.. Let no-one misunderstimd the significance of training in terms of a person's employability. Whilst jobstaTt, for the long-term unemployed, has produced a success rate of 61 per cent, those who have gone. through traineeships have experienced an 85 per cent success rate-81 per cent in jobs. Again, I ask the honourable member to have regard to those figures before he is so quick to denigrate the success of the CES based on certain revelaaCtually go tions last night. I am prepared to accept that we can - improve. I am prepared to accept that the sorts of things that were identified last night are that not acceptable. Where cases of Traudare identified, I repeat what - I said in question time: we will stamp them out. But we have taken significant steps over the last year and a half to successfullycounter those allegations, so路much so that the Auditor-General has given it a tick. In conclusion, as for the honourable member. for Chisholm's reassertion that I have been hiding, I have not. I did a doorstop yesterday. The ABC was not seeking me. I was in a cabinet meeting last night. As for his assertion of the 75 per cent pro rating, that is not the advice that I have been given to date, but I will take him on his word, check it and advise him accordingly. I believe that this House will see a significant program of assistance coming forward tomorrow, one that will give hope but one that will substantially build on the success to date- I urge all honourable members to get behind it in committing the places, committing to training the nation and committing to giving the long-tenn unemployed a chance.

104,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Listening to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) virtually say that all is well in 'DEET Street', one could be excused for overlooking what is going路 on out there. If we just tum to the green paper on unemployed persons who actually went to the CES and looked at the noticeboardfor a job, iUs less than half of the unemployed-49.7 per cent. But what is particularly telling percentage of successful job seekers whq used the CES to find out about jobs that were available. The figure for 1992, the last year that it was available, was 3.1 per cent. One wonders why we have a CES at all. The government is not selling it very well. What we are debating here today is路 the maladministration of DEET. We are debating the rorting and fraudulent practices that were exposed so well on the Four Corners program last night. In particular, we are debating the refusal of this government to accept responsibility for that. We have just had a glossing over of it today in question time and in the MPI. We ate. debating the inability of the minister and the government to satisfy the taxpayers and the parliament and to put down a credible and workable response to the questions that have been raised. What is going on, and what has gone on, in DEET is fairly and squarely the responsibility of this government. It created it back in 1987 and the government is accountable for what has transpired since. It is riddled withinefficiencies, as we as honourable members all know since we get assailed by it in our offices every day. It is riddled with fraud and it has been unable to deliver the goods. One in three of the long-tenn unemployed have had no assistance at all in being directed into a program, let alone being offered a job. Today in question time the minister got up and said that the long-tenn unemployed are not work ready, whatever that means. I do not know how long it takes before someone is work ready. This government was elected in 1983, over 10 years ago. We are in the second decade of this government and we still have nearly one million people unemployed. The government has totally and utterly misread the economic situation in this country in the 1980s. It has put us in a position where the country is out of money. The government is out of ideas and, quite frankly, it should be out of office. If it had even approached anything near the truth in what it told us in the last election campaign, it would have been thrown out. The jobless in this country are. without hope. All the government can offer is a is the multiplicity of promises yet again. More committees are being set up, more papers are being drawn up, and ministerial gobbledegook is being spoken. Tomorrow night we will hear about taxpayers' money being wasted on a scale unprecedented in t-is country. . It is not as if the government has had lightweight ministers administering this department. Before the name change to DEET, Minister Willis was there for four years. Following him for four years was Mr Dawkins. Then there was Minister Beazley for two years, and now we have Minister Crean. Yet we still hear more promises. The solution is to throw more money around and to have a minister mouth platitudes. When we were thrown out of office in 1972-before Whitlam took over and started to wreck this country as we knew it-the number of long-tenn unemployed in this country was something like 1,500. Today, it is in excess of 350,000 people. We have the longest and most educated dole queues in the advanced countries in many ways. The government is not interested in solving the problem. It is only interested in winning elections. The white paper will come out tomorrow night, and there will be a response to it. As the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Wooldridge) said, we will have to wait seven months....;,till next year-before the government's response is put into place. The deputy leader said this is so more people can be taken off the unemployment queues in the run-up to the next election. Another reason is that it would give the government time to print the money on the printing presses that will be rolling to fund these new schemesdubious and dishonest schemes in many ways. It appears that we are redefining long-term unemployment. We will take the under 18year-olds off the dole-30,OOO or 40,000 people. We will take the over 60-year-oldsoff the dole and put them on mature allowances-all churning and refiddling the numbers, and shuffling the dole queues. While this is . going on, what is the government doing to lessen unemployment and create real jobs? It is bringing down industrial relations laws to make it harder to employ people, and it is bringing in extra taxes like the superannuation guarantee charge and the training guarantee levy, which everybody, on both sides of the chamber,now recognises is a farce. The situation is absolutely absurd. Let us look back at what the government has done in the past. In the One Nation statement of February 1992, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, 'After seven years of growth, Australians are now experiencing hard times. Nearly one million people are out of work, and families are worried about the future. This statement explains what the Keating government will do to bring back jobs and prosperity.' We know what happened following that. We had two budgets brought down by Treasurer Dawkins, both of which promised they were all about jobs, jobs, jobs. They spent billions of dollars, and the situation is virtually the same today as it was We will get the same arguments dressed up in different words thrown at us again. The government is exhausted of all ideas. It set this committee last year, which produced this green paper to restore full employment, to bide time. The committee comprised seven academics and bureaucrats-no-one out there in the real world. It was 241 pages long, 26 pages of which were conclusions proposing extra job taxes. The government will draw its response from that. If the minister wanted to do something, he could cure a few of the things that people have been writing to him about. For example, I have a letter here路 from the Municipal Employees' Union, written byJ. Merchant, branch secretary. He has sent out a directive to employers who employ people under the jobskills program and under the LEAP program. In it he says: Dear Sir/Madam, Due to the overwhelming costs involved with administering the Jobskills program, the Municipal Employees' Union as of 1 March 1994, will be charging a fee of $75.00 per participant. There is no reason why the union should be involved in this at all, but Minister Crean has allowed the unions into路 it. Now they路 are charging $75 per participant to do the administrative work in their office in Sydney. They have the gall to say: This fee includes honorary membership fees for participantsif ever there was a bit of twisted English logic in that, there it is- . and will absorb extra costs involved such as site visits; liaising with delegates, counclIs and brokers; assessing job descriptions, photocopying, telephone, postage and facsimile expenses and any other general administrative costs. He goes on to say: It will be necessary to make arrangements with the Municipal Employees' Union to pay the administrative fee per participant before the participant plan is signed. . . What an absolute rort! The minister has received this letter over a month ago, yet he still condones it. This is the sort of thing that he has the gall to stand up here today in question time and say that he is fixing. He then. said that Four Corners was an unbalanced program, that it found one or two things which were wrong and that he already has up. plans under way to fix it. What absolute nonsense! The minister has his fingerprints over this type of scheme and many other schemes that are starting .to bob up in DEET. It is an absolute scandal. DEET itself is so complicated that almost nobody can understand it. It has upped the spending on labour market programs, trying to hide hundreds of thousands of unemployed pepple. It has upped the spending four-fold in the last five years. I would just like to read out a few of the schemes DEET has. It has newstart, jobstart, jobskills, jobtrain, jobclubs, the job education training program, or JET, the employment incentive scheme, the contracted placement scheme, the post-placement support scheme, the special intervention scheme, the accredited training for youth scheme, the LEAP scheme, skillshare, the disadvantaged young peoples services program, the DASU program, NElS, CAP, LAP, TAB....:...it goes on and on. The government should be condemned for what it is doing. (Time expired)",63
105,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and. Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (4.47 p.m.)-I do not think I have heard a more fatuous contribution to an MPI discussion than that which I have just heard. I am being kind by describing the contributions made l;>y both the shadow minister for employment, education and training, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) as fatuous .. To think that they have come in here today and based an attack on the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) on the product of the ABC Four Corners program! As the minist-r has said to the shadow minister, if these issues have been of such concern to him, why has he not taken the opportunity to visit the department and seek some discussions about these concerns? Does he have an answer? He has failed to respond. He clearly knows nothing about the programs or the way in which the department operates. Yet he has decided these things using the vehicle of the Four Corners program, which to me smacks very much of the Alan Jones school of journalism. We all know what happened to Alan Jones. I suggest that the producer of last night's Four Corners program should follow Alan Jones because of the nature of the program. The fact is that the program was an absolute beat-up which looked at isolated cases.. We acknowledge that there have been cases of fraudulent behaviour by agents of the Commonwealth Employment Service and people carrying out programs, but they have been acted upon. When asked to, come up with some evidence here this afternoon about these allegations, the honourable member for Parkes said that DEET is riddled with inefficiency and fraud. I ask him to give us some examples. He cannot give us any examples. He knows very little about the way in which DEET operates and even less about the CES programs, and he has absolutely no idea about labour market issues. The same is true of the shadow minister. But it is worth pointing out that those of us who are involved in the CES-laminvolved in teims of oversighting its programs and activities-know that last night's Four Cornersprogram was not honest about, the fact that most of the cases cited, if not all, were old news and have been acted upon. There has been no reporting of the wide-ranging risk management reforms already put in place. Why not? There has been no recognition, of the .organisation's overwhelming success, which is demonstrated daily through programs such as jobstart. Instead' the media. try to focus on what they see as a major furore about the administration of these programs. There is no major furore. There is no major fraud. The department is not riddled with fraud. The programs are riot riddled with inefficiency. The only inefficiency is on the other side of the House. Those opposite fail to come to terms with what the CES. does, have no comprehension of labour market programs,have no comprehension of labour market issues and have even less understanding of the proposals which were PQt forward last night by Four Corners. . The Four Corners program should have mentioned that there is no recognition, as I have said, of the overwhelming success rate of existing programs, which was rightly pointed out today by the minister. I wonder why the shadow minister will not accept the positives. Perhaps it is the standard of advice he is gett;ng. Why did the Four Corners program fail to mention that in 1992 fraud prevention units were established nationally and in each state to prevent,.detect and pursue fraud in labour market programs? There was no acknowledgment by Four Corners that in 1993 the performance and review division was established in the national office to strengthen the performance by linking fraud prevention, benefits control, internal audit, security, administrative law and legal services functions. Why no mention made of that by the Four Corners program? Why no mention of the 1993 fraud awareness training program for 800 middle managers in 40 locations within the network? Why no mention of that by the Four Corners program? Why no mention by the Four Corners program of the review and reform labour market contracts that were being made by the CES with the assistance of the Director of Public Prosecutions? Why no mention that? Why no mention by the Four Corners program that, in 1993,40 of 44 recommendawhich tions of an internal audit review of the pass system, which is used for processing labour market payments, have been implemented? Why no mention of that? Why no mention by the Four Corners program of the risk assessby ment and fraud control plans that are regularly reviewed and updated for all labour market programs? Why no mention of that? Why no mention of the positive outcomes experienced by the CES? Why no mention of the positive reports and response from employers and job seekers to the service being supplied by the Commonwealth Employment Service? The preliminary results from a January-March 1994. Roy Morgan phone survey of 29,000 employers who had contact with the CES in the previous six mon-hs indicated that 85 per cent of those who lodged a vacancy were satisfied with the overall service-that is above the service standard equivalent of, say, 75 per cent. We have 85 per cent satisfaction from employers, and there was no mention of that by Four Corners or by the opposition. There was no mention by the opposition that 90 to 93 per cent of those surveyed were satisfied with the timeliness, accuracy, relevance and ease of understanding of advice and information provided by the service. No mention of that when the service standard required 75 per cent. The survey also indicated that 51 p-r cent had their expectations met and a further 25 per cent had them exceeded. Why no mention of those things by the Four Corners program, or acknowledgment of them by the opposition spokesperson responsible for this matter? Why no mention of them? Why the ignorance? Why no mention that job seeker satisfaction with the service provided by the Commonwealth Employment Service is as high as 75 to 80 per cent? Why no mention of that? Why no acceptance of the successful outcomes of programs delivered by the Commonwealth Employment Service? Why no acknowledgment of the structures of review of the Commonwealth Employment Service put in place by this government? Why no mention of that? Fundamentally because of Four Corners was too ignorant and decided that on the eve of the magnificent statement the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will make tomorrow it would create some contention with absolutely no acceptance of the positive things that are currently being done as a result of initiatives by this government, this minister, and by the management of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Why no mention of the fact that we have publicly acknowledged that we think the CES ought to do better and can do better? Why no mention of that? Yet the honourable member for Chisholm came in here today and asked for a judicial inquiry, for goodness sake. On the basis of what? What evidence is there to support the accusations that there needs to.be a judicial inquiry? Absolutely nil. We have seen an inept attempt by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge); assisted by the previous speaker-whom I have to mark. Where would you put him for someone with some knowledge of the CES? I know a lot of people in this country. I have visited a lot of Ccimmonwealth Employment Service offices and I have spoken to a lot of our clients. Every one of them has a better understanding about how the Commonwealth Employment Service operates and the labour market programs than the honourable member for Parkes, yet he has been asked to make a contribution to an MPI. This is a matter of public importance. He is supposed to know, but he has absolutely no idea. Yet those opposite seek to denigrate the Commonwealth Employment Service. Implicit in that is a denigration of the effort put in by the officers in the Commonwealth Employment Service. There is absolutely no evidence of the mismanagement being clairried by the opposition.路 . It is true that we have to improve. It is we will improve. It is true we can do things better, and my goodness we will do things better. Let me suggest to members of the opposition that they ought to be concentrating on how to get people back in jobs and how to provide the long-term unemployed with opportunities. We should get them to support the proposals which this government has put in place and will continue to pulin place; get them to honestly acknowledge the success of many of these labour market programs; get them to honestly acknowledge the integrity of the officers of the CES instead of blackguarding them as they have done; get them to acknowledge the intentions of this government in relation to the white paper. Let there be no doubt that the white paper is the most important statement on employment since 1945. In terms of the significance of this employment statement to this government, it ranks with Mabo and that is what rankles the opposition. We are doing things properly and we will get the answers.

106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion has concluded. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Punch; ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. DEFENCE FORCE (HOME LOANS ASSISTANCE}AMENDMENT BILL .. 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.  want to speak for too much longer but I say again that I support the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill. I note that in their contributions both the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and. the honourable member for true Throsby (Mr Hollis). made a fairly wideranging contribution. I want to return to an important theme that relates to housing-that is, the conditions of service of the serving men and women in our ADF. I. remind the House that no other so-called work force can be compared to the ADF. Its members are subject to unquestioning discipline, are taught to carry out orders strictly and promptly and not to argue the point. ANZAC Day was not so long路 ago. It is a reminder to the nation of the contributions that our serving men and women have made in wartime, when so many of them paid the ultimate sacrifice,and in peacekeeping operations. They can at very short notice be sent anywhere overseas. They can without choice offer up their lives in defence of this nation and our ideals. Why am I making all these points? I am making them because of their type of employment and their requirements for mobility, of which they have no say. I am pleased to see women serving in the defence forces. It is not unusual for both husbands and wives to have a career in the ADF. Posting becomes even more difficult in that situation. They are required to be mobile. They should have access to decent housing. I am very pleased that what was a scandal is being rectified. I have made the point that the defence subcommittee is really delighted to see progress being made in this respect in a very bipartisan way. I disagree with one of the recent changes that the government has made as far as the ADF is concerned, which is in the area of additional family payments. I think theADF provides unique occupations. A housing rental subsidy is an absol-tely fundamental aspect ofADF employment. As I say, Defence Force personnel do not have a choice as to where they serve; they are posted. .It is really unfortunate that, when it comes to additional family payments, people are now suffering in the ADF. More ridiculously, it is the only government family payment that is being implemented on the basis of a person's STD area code. For example, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) represents the Northern Territory.' Those living in one part of Darwin get one allowance while those living in another, part of Darwin get a lesser allowance. So two people of the same rank and seniority in the same occupation doing the same thing are receiving different money. . I notice that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who takes a great interest in these matters, is nodding. My good friend the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) highlighted this problem to me. Frankly, I do not have any Defence Force bases in my electorate. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for  have seemed intent on removing the remaining ones in or near it. Those living in subsidised rental accommodation at Holsworthy get one form of payment while those living in another part get a lower payment. It is all based on whether one is in the metropolitan area or just outside it. I think the approach by the Department of Social Security is very wrong. I believe that the ADF provides unique occupations that cannot be compared with路 the occupations of anyone else .. In particular, I believe that the rental subsidy provided to our serving men and women should not be encumbered in this way and lead to these anomalies. I sincerely hope that either the committee-that is, the defence subcommittee of which I am pleased to be a member-or perhaps even the ministers will have an opportunity to revisit this issue and its impli.:. cations. I know that it will be a matter of interest to the minister at the路 table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. I support the bill. I notice that the opposition supports this common sense change. It is good to see that we are getting bipartisan support for this change in another area of defence. The sooner this legislation is passed, the better;",67
107,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to rise in support of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill, which is currently before the House. I support the comments of my colleague the  who spoke previously, particularly in relation to the former family allowance supplement, which is now referred to as the additional family payment. I know that the minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science  . the concerns that have been raised.路 As the minister has only just taken over that portfolio, I know that he will be making an effort to deal with the concerns that have been raised by. defence personnel. This bill seeks to amend section 35 of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, which deals with the calculation of the interest rate contained in the agreement between the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank relating to _the provision of subsidised housing loans for members of the Australian Defence Force. Clause 3 of the amendment aims to amend section 35 by removing the prohibition on revoking or varying subclause S.15 of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the National Australia l3ank. This will enable the adJustment of interest tates applicable to the defence home loans assistance scheme in order to allow ADF members to take advantage of the latest trends in home loans. It is always a pleasure for m- to speak in support of legislation that is designed to ease the burdens of defence service life for the members of the ADFand their families. I am speaking as an honourable member who has a large air force base in my electorate. I refer to the Amberley air force base, whiCh is the largest air force base in Australia. I particularly appreciative of the opportunity support these amendments and make a few , period. brief statements about the current conditions of RAAF service life, the personnel involved and their families. It is a very important for our defence people. As the honourable member for Chifleysaid before, on ANZAC Day we are reminded of contribution that our defence forces - have made to this nation. I certainly had the great pleasure of participating in it in my electorate and had the privilege to represent the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the dawn service Brisbane. The services were very well attendsubsidy. ed. ANZAC Day serVices appear to be more and more well attended on these days, parserved ticularly by younger people. It was amazing Yugoslavia. to see so. many young people in Brisbane attending the services on ANZAC Day-it was a glorious morning-at that early hour. those reasons, I am always pleased to have the opportunity to support our defence people in any way in this place. I return )0 the housing question. I do not thinkvery many people would disagree when I say that the defence home loans' assistance scheme has made the goal of home ownership more relldily accessible'to ADF families. the benefit of honourable members unfamiliar with the operations of DHLAS, it was set by this government in 1985 to provide subsiclause dised home loans to eligible members of ADF who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985. ADF members who joined prior to this date are covered under a previous scheme for defence housing loans. There has been assistcalculating ance given, very much through a bipartisan approach, for many years to assist people in the defence area in-the housing. The aims of the current scheme are to attract ADF personnel, to encourage home ownership during service life as a cost effectwo tive alternative to rental assistance and to assist in the re-integration of ADF personnel into the community on return to civilian employment. Under DHLAS, members of the ADF who have served a minimum of six loans years are eligible to receive a subsidy on home loan of between $10,000 and $40,000, the amount of the subsidy being 40 per cent am of the average monthly interest payable to calculated on the loan and being for a 25-year The subsidy is payable for a period equal to area the number of years of service completed after a six-year qualifying period. The subsidy is generally available for a maximum of 20 years. Special rules apply for certain groups the of ADF personnel depending on where their service has been. For example, those involved in operational service do not have to serve the six-year qualifying period. Those who served in the Gulf War in bperational service also in have a minimum 16-year entitlement to the Similar special provisions also exist for members of the Defence Force who have in Somalia, Cambodia or the former The loans available under DHLAS are For provided by the National Australia Bank under an agreement contained in the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990. Since this agreement was finalised there have been a number of changes to the range of housing loans available as a result of the strong growth in the economy and sound policy decisions of this government. These For new home loan products have included ,the appearance of discounted rates for the initial up period of a home loan. Unfortunately, sub5.15 of the agreement between the the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth in the act cannot be varied at present, meaning that no account of the new trends in home loans can be taken into account when the interest on rates applicable for defence home loans assistance scheme loans. The amount of subsidy payable to the National Australia Bank under the agreement is calculated in accordance with subclause 5.15 and at present is based on the lower of figures. The first is the average of the variable rate offered by the five largest banking groups路 that provide home loans,. with loans provided before 1 April 1986 where the maximum interest rate payable is capped and with a fixediilterest rate for over 12 a months excluded. The second is the lowest home loan rate provided by the National Australia Bank, with loans with a fixed interest rate for over 12 months excluded. These terms of the agreement reflected the路 conditions in the lending market that prevailed at the time when the agreement was made. At that time,路 interest rates were high and fixed term loans were available with a lower interest rate than the general variable rate. Now, due to the strong growth in the economy, and in the. housing sector in particular, there are perceptions in the community that interest rates may rise, so at present fixed interest rate home loans have higher rates than variable loans. The introduction of discounted rates for an introductory period to new borrowers combined with the wording of subclause 5.15 mean that the rate of interest used to determine the amount of subsidy payable to the National Australia Bank is based on the discounted rate offered for introductory periods, as this is the .lowest rate offered by the National Australia Bank. This rate is used for all home loans provided under the DHLAS. As the explanatory memorandum indicates, this will result in reduced payments by the Commonwealth which are estimated to total $300,000 per year. This does. not reflect the intention of the Commonwealth and the National AustraHa Bank at the time the agreement was made, so I am glad to say that the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank have agreed to change the way in which the interest rate is calculated for the purposes of the subsidy. to allow for this, section 35 of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act .1990 needs to be amended to allow a change to subclause 5.15. Clause 3 of this amendment legislation seeks to do this by amending section 35 of the act. The welfare of the members of our defence forces and their families, particularly the RAAF, is one of my important concerns. The amendments to the Defence Force .(Home Loans Assistance) Act will provide muth needed help for ADF families in purchasing a home. The current level of home ownership in the ADF is estimated to be less than 25 per cent. This has. been attributed to factors affecting ADF families, such as constant transfers. The honourable member for Chifley referred earlier to the mobility factor and the likelihood of disruption to the schooling of children in ADF families caused by frequent moving. I believe that problem in the schooling area needs constant addressing by both the Commonwealth and the states. Having equity between our schooling . systems is raised with me frequently by defence people, particularly the wives and. mothers, who are the ones who always路 have the biggest problemin handling the children's educational problems. It is for these reasons that lam pleased to have had the opportunity to support this legislation. In more recent times the Commonwealth has put a big emphasis on housing for our defence people. In my own electorate there has been a huge influx of capital-up to $30 million-in moving defence people into a new housing estate. I hope that in the near future the minister will have the opportunity to visit that new estate. It is going particularly well and it is a great credit to the defence people themselves who have put these matters forward to us. The Defence Hous.ing Authority isa very effective operation that this government developed. It manages .those new'housing estates extremely well. It is providing much needed, better quality housing than wa:s available in the past. It is a very expensive area, but I believe that, because of the impact the mobility factor has on defence people, moving around from time to time does create extra problems for them. Having' previously worked in the banking industry, lilI occupation in which I was subject to transfer-although it was only within the state and noWhere near the extent to which our defence pe()pl- are moved:-I do have some sympathy for them. The bill before' us brings further assistance in recognising the changing interest rates in the market and addtesSessome problems; I am sure defence people will welcome it. For some time the principal. impediment tG路 home ownership in the ADF has been the inability to accumulate a sizeable,deposit because they are paying rent all the time. The defence home loans assistance scheme certainly helps those people. I am particularly pleased to have the.opportunity this afternoon to support these amendments to the act..I commend them to the House. I am pleased that those opposite are lending their support. I believe that if there is one area where we should have a bipartisan approach it is the welfare of our defence personnel. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day. for the next sitting. NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 February, on motion by Mr Lindsay: That the bill be now read a second time.",68
108,Mr JULL,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 comes about as a result of initiatives taken last in the 1993 budget and has to do with the changes of excise levied on avgas and avtur, which are used for the operations of general aviation aircraft and of pure jet passenger aircraft in Australia. It is proposed in this legislation to reduce the excise of avgas from O.25456c per litre to 0.224436 per litre, which gives an overall reduction of about 3.013c per litre, effective from 1 July last year. This has been part of an ongoing process by the government. It partly had to do with the arrangements under the airport local ownership scheme, whereby local. airports were handed over by the Commonwealth to local councils and local organisations to undertake their operation, leaving the Commonwealth government free of that responsibility. That process is now completed. This obviously has given the opportunity to reduce those sums on the cost of avtur and avgas. However, there were also some changes in the cost recovery arrangements for the provision of firefighting services by the Civil Aviation Authority and, similarly, with the provision of meteorological services by the Bureau of Meteorology. There is no doubt that the industry has welcomed those moves. However, this budget initiative last year also proposed to increase the excise payable on avgas by 0.264c per litre and, for the first time, introduced excise of 0.264c per litre on avtur. Part of the idea of this was to meet the government's requirement-which it announced in the 1991 budget-of looking towards cost recovery in the provision of safety services by the Civil Aviation Authority. The reductions in the level of duty relating to the changes to the ALOP, the firefighting services and meteorological services are quite unexceptional, but the increase in the rate of duty on avgas and 1994 the new duty on avtur to fund aviation safety are frankly more controversial. It is true that the government will continue to fund 50 per cent of these costs up' to .a limit of $22.8 million a year, while the phased-in cost recovery program is due to commence from September 1993. This has been a bit of an ongoing feast because it was year hoped that the full cost recovery. would 00 completed by' 1 July 1995. However, there was such uproar and discontent Within the aviation industry over the government's original proposal that it had to be withdrawn. I think it is true to say that, within the aviation industry as a whole, there are some concerns about what is happening within this piece of legislation. The general view within the aviation circles is that the government has not been prepared to meet the costs of setting up safety standards and ensuring compliance, and there is some objection to the fact. that the industry. is expected to meet half the cost of these services. However, I think it is true that, if we are going to go along that path, the bill is a reasonable method of recovering those moneys. The industry has expressed some concern that the method being used is not based on a fee for service and that the process places no obligation on the Civil Aviation Authority to . maximise the efficiencies of its operation. industry also complains that the costs are not identifiable and that any decline in the level of compliance will increase surveillance costs. It believes that these costs will have to be borne to a disproportionate extent by the more diligent operators, esp-cially the scheduled airlines. We really do have a philosophical argument as to how the safety requirements of the CAA should be funded,路 but the one thing that is coming through is that there is certainly a state of confusion within the aviation industry as to just how far the government is prepared to go and what is happening in the Civil Aviation Authority's administration of these procedures. In recent weeks, we have seen examples of what can happen if we are not absolutely sure and correct in making these particular regulations appropriate and up to date for the times. I cite as one example the incident that happened on 24 April, when a DC3 charter aircraft made a forced landing into Botany Bay. Thank goodness there was no loss of life, but that could have been a very serious accident. What is even more frightening are reports that appeared in today's press that no air safety regulations governed the operation of that particular DC3's flight from Sydney to Norfolk Island. Over recent years, there have been provisions within aviation regulations to cover the flight of two-engine aircraft across oceans. There have always, been rules and regulations that aircraft flying over .water should be within a one-hour range of an alternative landing field. It would have taken that. particular DC3 about seven hours to fly from Sydney to Norfolk Island. Obviously, the entire flight is over water and that must raise some concern as to just what is happening in the overall administration of provisions. It is my understanding that, while most aircraft built' after 1968 would be covered by the aviation safety regulations, those regulations would not apply in the case of the DC3. We can argue that the DC3 has a tremendous safety record and is still one of the most reliable aircraft flying in the skies today. If we go back over the history of the administraThe tion of Australian aviation, we see that a DC3 was never allowed to operate to Norfolk Island. Back in those piston days, Qantas used to provide the service with a DC4, which was a four-engine aircraft. It would seem from the best of our investigations that there is absolutely no provision there to cover such a situation. It was interesting to see that a spokesman for the CAA came out and said that, had there been an application for that particular flight to be made to Norfolk Island, it may well not have been granted. I suppose that is all right in hindsight, but the fact is that that flight took off with 25 people on board to go to Norfolk Island as part of the ANZAC Day ceremony proceedings there and did not get much further than the end of the runway in Botany Bay before it. was路路 forced to turn back and make that remarkable landing at the end of the new. third runway complex. I think the industry is saying that we have reached a situation in Australia where there must be some direction as to how we handle all areas of air rety regulation and, in particular, aircrafl er 20 years of age. Just last weekend then. ras another incident near Maitland that was even more tragic thanthe forced landing of the DC3. A Tiger Moth built in the 1920s crashed in front of quite a crowd of onlookers. Nobody would deny that the vintage aircraft business is a most appealing one and has great public support, but we have to make absolutely sure that every conceivable measure is taken to ensure the safe operation of a lot of those vintage aircraft. We are seeing more and more of them being used in Australia. A number ofth!!rn are bt1ing used in joy flights as part of the tourist infrastructure around Australia, and they will continue to be used while that the safety particular operation takes off. I think two other major air incidents have probably been very much in our focus .at the moment: the crash of what I suppose can literally be called a mail charter off Sydhey a couple of months ago, in which 'an ageing aircraft was involved, and the horrendous Monarch Air Services crash in southern New South Wales. My colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr SharP) will be making some comment about that when he addresses this legislation a little later in the evening. We have now reached a stage in the administration of aviation in Australia where some tough decisions have to be made and some real leadership has to be given as to just how far we are going to. go to ensure the safety of passengers and pilots alike, especially in relation to aircraft more than 20 years old. It is obvious that we have not got thoseprovisions in place. It is something that must be addressed pretty soon. I would hope that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who has been in that portfolio for some time now; has the intestinal fortitude to take on the Civil Aviation Authority to make sure that those regulations are brought up to date and that we do have regulations that cover the entire operation of these aircraft around Australia. This will ensure that the tremendous reputation that we have enjoyed in Australia as a leader in aviation safety is not going to. be prejudiced in any way. . The opposition parties have no real objection to this bill. We do waive the fact that the industry' is not completely happy with the method of collection. We. understand that there is yet more legislation to come in on a customs tariff bill which will further extend the increases in these aviation cbstsand lead further down the track to the self-funding of aviation safety in Australia. The opposition will not oppose this bill but we warn the government that something must be done very soon to ensure that the administration of civil aviation in Australia, especially th- safety components, is up to its .usual world standard.",71

110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Rocher)'Thank you.,73
111,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, which gives effect to excise tariff proposals Nos 2 and 3 of 1993. ExCise tariff proposals are an area for the aficionados, but they do reflect important policy in ,other areas. I think that an overview of those important PQlicy areas is important. In a sense, it is an unusual bill as it proposes both an increase and a decrease in the same measure at the same time, and that of itself is worthy of comment. Honourable members would be aware that excise is a duty or a tax levied on goods which are produced inside Australia in contrast to .customs duty which' is levied on .imported goods. Honourable members would be aware that the constitution vested the Commonwealth with the power to collect duties of excise on locally produced goods, such as beer, spirits and tobacco, which were commonplace at the tum of th,ecentury. In more recent times, petroleum products have. been. added to the list whi-h we now find. in the tariff excise schedule. Currently, excise, duties are payable on consumables such as beer, spirits, tobacco, refined petroleum products and, to a lesser extent, crude oil. I referto crude oil because that' is found in the North West Shelf in my own state of Western Australia. In the normal course of events, excise duty is adjusted regularly in line with the CPI. That ensures that, in real terms, the 路Commonwealth's revenue receipts. keep pace with inflation. ,That part of the tariff exise schedule which isimporta.nt to this particular bill falls in the area of refined petroleum products. A range of refined petroleum products fall to' be considered, two of which are dealt with in this particular' measure. Refined petroleum products relevant to excise tariffs include motor gasoline; automotive diesel oil; industrial diesel fuel; marine diesel fuel; lighting kerosene; power kerosene; heating and fuel oil, the two with which this particular measure is. concerned-aviation gasoline, or avgas, and aviation turbine kerosene, or avtur. Imported refined petroleum products attract customs duty at the same rate as that which applies to the equivalent locally produced excisable product. As far as Australian refined petroleum products are concerned, there路 is a range of refineries in Australia. The one which is important to Western Australia's economy and industrial base is the BP refinery in Kwinana. I nowiefer to the. budget papers. It was said to me on the路 occasion of my entry to this place that the Bible of members of the House of. Representatives is in many respects the budget papers. I think that is right. I refer to chapter fourof Budget Paper No. 1 from last year's budget. At page 4.19 there are two columns headed 'Outcomes' and 'Estimates'; If we look at taxation revenue, we find that in 1992-93 we raised $9.2 billion by way of sales tax and that we raised just over $7.3 billion by way of excise duty-and this can be found under. the heading 'Petroleum products, crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas'-and under the heading of 'Other', we raised $2.3 billion. They are large figures. To put the revenue路 effect of this particular measure in context, we need to move on to the detailed tabulation of excise duty. Table 11 on page 4.31 contains a breakdown of the 1992-93 cQllection as far as excise duty is concerned. Under the heading 'Petroleum products' we find three breakdowns: 'Motor spirit', which raised just under $4.5 billiQn; 'Diesel', which raised just over $2.5 billion; and 'Other', which raised $89 million. The 'Other' is particularised to include aviation gasoline, aviation turbine fuel, fuel oil,. heating oil and kerosene .. So in this area excise duty has raised about $89 million, and that includes more than avgas and aviation turbine; it also includes fuel oil, heating oil, kerosene and the like. When dealing with policy, one often looks to the revenue side, as I have just done, but it is equally important-if not more important-to look at outlays. Page 3.149 of Budget Paper No. 1 considers transport outlays. It reads: Despite some fluctuations between years, there has been a significant downward trend in air transport outlays over the ten years to 1993-94, principally as a result of the Government's policy of commercialising its involvement in aviation operations through the establishment of FAC and the CAA ... In respect of the underlying trend over the forward years ... outlays are expected to decline by 21.7% in real terms, principally because of reduced payments to the CAA for - fety regulatory functions and the Commonwealth withdrawing from its involvement in civil airports not owned by the FAC. We are beginning tp get to the heart of the matter in terms of the policy approach which is behind this particular measure. Under the heading 'Air Transport' on page 3.152, a range of significant comments is worth drawing attention to. The section reads: The Commonwealth's aviation policies aim to promote the operation of safe, secure, efficient and competitive air services within, to and from Australia. To foster increased competition, the Government has: deregulated the domestic aviation market (ending the two airline policy); commercialised its involve-ent in aviation operations through the establishment of the. FAC and the CAA; enabled Australian carriers other than Qantas Airways Ltd to compete on international routes; allowed Qantas to operate domestically; and announced moves directed towards achieving a single aviation market with New Zealand; In respect of a particular measure that is directly relevant to the bill before the House, it makes reference to the aerodrome local ownership plan. That section reads: The Government announced its intention in the 1990-91 Budget to transfer the remaining Gommonwealth (non FAC) aerodr-mes to local ownership and. to encourage local authorities to asSume full financial .responsibility for airports previously jointly funded by the Commonwealth under the ALOP. To facilitate路 the program of transfers and withdrawals, the Government has provided transfer or withdrawal grants (to bring airports to good condition on transfer) and one-off capitalised subsidies to smaller, remote communities (to assist in meeting future operating costs of these aero. dromes). The other section relevant to this particular measure relates to the area of air safety. It reads: The Government announced its intention in the 1992-93 Budget to achieve 50% cost recovery of the CAA's safety standard setting and surveillance functions by 1 July 1995. The Government will continue to fund 50% of these costs up to a limit of $22.8m a yea:r. Phased recovery of the balance of safety standard setting and surveillance costs from the aviation industry will commence from 1 September 1993. The CAA is moving toward (by 1994-95) full recovery of the costs incurred in implementing safety standards. Th- following section is then directly relevant to the路 bill before the House. The heading is 'Avgas and avtur duty paid to the Civil Aviation Authority'. Here we have the heart of the policy which drives the excise proposals currently before the House. The section readS: . In 1993""94, all of the duty on aviation gasoline will be appropriated to the CAA to contribute towards recovering the costs of enroute and terminal navigation services where no specific charges apply. From 1 September 1993, the avgas duty also include a component to assist in recovering cost of the CANs safety standard setting and surveillance functions in 1993-94. Avtur duty will also be appropriated to the CAA from 1 September 1993. Commencing 1 July 1993, the avgas duty was reduced by two cents per litre to reflect the introcharged duction of user charging by the Bureau of Meteordecrease ology and the CAA (for rescue and fire fighting services). In view of the impending completion of the aerosal drome transfer program, a further one cent per ... of avgas duty was removed from 1 July 1993. (This amount was previously retained by the Commonwealth to offset the costs of operating and maintaining Commonwealth (non FAC) airports and the Commonwealth's contribution to the ALOP.) So in the budget papers we find the policy heart of these, in a sense, technical proposals in the Excise Tariff :Amendment Bill which are before the House. I now wish to deal specifically with the bill which implements, as I have mentioned, two excise tariff proposals. Excise tariff proposal No.2 (1993) was made public and gazetted on 19 August 1993 and excise tariff proposal No.3 (1993) was dealt with similarly on 30 August 1993. Both路 those proposals emerged shortly after the budget of that .year on 17 August. . Excise tariff proposal No. 2 proposes a decrease in the rate of excise duty payable on gasoline for use in aircraftavgas-by just over 3c per litre, and that decrease takes effect from 1 July 1993. As the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister fOr Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) makes clear, there are two sources for this decrease: firstly, as I have referred to by way of the budget papers, the government's decision to transfer Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local oWnership; and, secondly, a portion of the excise duty collected on avgas is to be used by the CAA to perform services on behalf of the .aviation industry, namely, provision of safety through firefighting services and meteorological services In terms of the carve up of those measures, of the just over 3c per litre reduction contained in the bill, just over lc per litre is will . attributable to the aerodrome transfer prothe gram; 0.7c per litre is attributable to firefighting services; and a reduction of 1.3c per litre is attributable to the cost of meteorological services provided by the Bureau of Meteorology.. Whereas the CAA used to pay for those services, they will now be directly to airport operators. That outlines the in the rate of excise duty payable. The increase is found in excise tariff propoNo. 3 where it is proposed to increase the litre rate of excise duty on avgas and avtur for use in aircraft by 0.264c per litre. As the budget papers make clear, this increase is to take effect from 1 September. Again, as the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech makes clear, the purpose of this increase is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of air safety regulation from the aviation industry. On 18 August, the day after the budget, the then minister for transport and comrimnications announced that the government had decided that the cost of aviation safety standard setting and surveillance would be jointly met by the government and the aviation industry. The government would meet 50 per cent of the costs up to an index limit of $22.8 million. The cost recovery would commence in 路the 1993-94 .financial year and would be phased路 in over a two-year period. The minister announced that the government had also decided that full cost recovery for the implementation of standards would continue to be phased in by 1994-95. The minister indicated that the proposed increase in 199394 was an interim measure as the CAA was currently in the process of developing a long term funding strategy for aviation safety regulation. That is reflected in his media statement of August 1993. I draw the attention of the House to the final two paragraphs of that statement which read: Safety regulation cost recovery arrangements for 1994/95 and beyond will depend on a funding strategy to be developed over the coming months. The CAA will examine the implications for the industry of possible mixes of charges and aviation industry specific taxes. The minister stressed that the CAA's funding strategy will be developed in close consultation with all sectors of the aviation industry and he encouraged their active participation. That meets the point of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who spoke before me and who indicated that certain sections of the industry might not be overwhelmed by the increases in avgas and avtur. The opportunity is there-this has come from couple of the large airlines'-for them to be involved in that ongoing process to bring about a final conclusion to the government's proposal for 10ngterm funding arrangements commencing in 1994-95. The reason for the reduction in the excise duty is essentially twofold. Firstly, there conclusion of the aerodrome local ownership plan which has seen the successful transfer of over 230 local aerodromes around Australia to local owners, which gives local communities a major opportunity to develop . local infrastructure and to cater for ""their specific local requirements. Secondly, the reduction in the duty helps ensure the more efficient delivery of services and more appropriate charging arrangements for the services that the CAA provides. Those reductions will be well received by the aviation industry andby the ultimate beneficiary-the travelling public. I made the point through reference to the budget papers that behind these excise proposals there have been some major policy changes. Aviation reform has, without question, been one of the federal government's great achievements in the area of microeconomic reform. The net economic benefits of airline deregulation-with record numbers of passengers, increased tourism and trade and lower air fares-'-are well established. Another aspect of that micro-economic reform to which attention is not often drawn is the cost savings achieved by the CAA which have contributed to a more competitive aviation industry. Although, in a sense, it . . might be self-serving, the CAA itself byway of a media statement in June 1993 announced reductions in airway charges of over $100 million in real terms to the aviation industry. That continued a trend of lower charges by the CAA to the industry since its formation, which I think is a worthy achievement The CAA has indicated that it will continue to seek efficiencies in the delivery of services to the industry. It will do that in a manner which the government believes is appropriate, namely, that services provided ought to be essentially based on the notion of user pays and that that notion, together with the deregulation of the aviation industry which the a government .has effected, will ensure that what in many respects was regarded 'as a regulated moribund' industry has had. the opportunity of growing in the course of the last decade and has the opportunity now to flourish even further. I conclude where I started. The excise tariff is the proposals are very much in the nature of proposals before this House for aficionados but they do very much reflect major policy changes which have come before. I have no hesitation in welcoming the indication by the opposition that it prop,oses to support. these measures and I have no hesitation in wholeheartedly endorsing the measures and supporting them in this the chamber.",73
112,Mr SHARP,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to talk about the air safety regulation aspect of the Export Tariff Amendment Bill and I do so with the full knowledge of my colleague the shadow minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). I will talk in particular, as he has foreshadowed, ab6utthe Monarch Air air crash that took place last year. On 11 June last year a Monarch Airlines Piper Chieftain VH-NDU crashed at Young in New South Wales, kiIling all seven people on board. All the passengers were known to me and were, in the main, my constituents- I later learned that Monarch Air was a disaster waiting to happen. It was technically bankrupt and had to resort to irregular methods to obtain fuel and purchase spare parts. It had consistently breached civil aviation regulations over a number of years and was flying NDU with its autopilot illegally removed the time of the accident. Essential instruments on the pilot's panel had been removed, makthe ing it extremely dangerous for the aircraft be flown. The plane was flown by a casually engaged pilot and an unpaid co-pilot. Moreover, Monarch Air had at least twice been the subject of a recommendation.within the Civil Aviation Authority to be grounded. The latest of these was less than two months prior to the accident, for serious safety breaches involving the very plane that crashed and involving the very instrument that seems likely was instrumental in the cause the crash. Not lc of compensation to the families of these victims has been paid by the insurance company.. Let me start by saying that Monarch Air could only be described as a shonky operator with路 a track record that should have set off alarm bells throughout the Civil Aviation t i o n s . 路 Authority. Those alarm bells did not ring because there is a culture operating in the Civil Aviation Authority that puts the safety of passengers second and the commercial interests of the airline operator first. My reason for saying this is that Monarch repeatair. edly failed to observe air safety regulations and was known throughout the industry for this. It was twice recommended for groundger ing, yet the CAA let it fly. A clear example of this can be seen in the details of the Bureau of Air Safety Invesconfirmed tigation's interim report on the crash. It found important instruments rendered in1991. operative by the removal of the autopilot for service on 31 May 1993. This is a very serious matter. However, that is not all the story. On 19 April 1993 a ramp check revealed a number of violations and four serious breaches were found of Monarch's aircraft. Following the ramp check, the recommendation was that Monarch Air should be asked to show cause why its air operators certificate should not be varied, suspended or cancelled. Howoperators ever, the airworthiness inspectors could do more than recommend that the operator be grounded. The actual delegation to do rested with the flight operations manager. But no such decision was taken by the at regional flight operations manager, Maurie Baston, which seems extraordinary, given that aircraft had continued on the next stage of to its scheduled service that same day with five passengers on board, despite the aircraft breaching safety regulations. I have since learnt that, no matter how s-rious a breach, a recommendation to ground an operator never seems to be acted upon by flying operations managers. In fact, an airworthiness inspector who recommended such an action against Western Airlines-which thankfully closed it down last year-operating out of Wagga of Wagga and who argued the point when the recommendation was rejected is now sidelined within the authority for his actions. On 2 May 1993 a special audit of Monarch Air was recommended within the CAA because Monarch was operating without the coverage of a licensed airworthiness maintenance engineer. This is also a serious infraction of the regula. At each point, action should have. been taken to ensure that obvious habitual offenders were brought to book, but CAA's emphasis seems to have been on keeping them iri the It is dangerous in any area of transport where lives are at stake to be giving second chances-and this is especially so in passenaviation. But this was much more than Monarch's second chance. One of the facts that my FOI request has is that Monarch Air was already identified as a serious offender by November The maintenance register for a newly acquired aircraft was amended without authorisation by Monarch's manager, Richard of MACLean-on his own admission-to include regular public transport. The very same regional flying operations manager, Maurie Baston, who declined to .act on the recommendation to ground Monarch in April 1993, was involved. On that occasion also a CAA airworthiness inspector recommended that Monarch's air certificate be suspended or cancelled no until its standards for airworthiness maintenance were satisfactory. Despite the admission so by the manager of Monarch Air, Richard MACLean, that he fraudulently wrote additional words on the maintenance register and the recommendation to ground Monarch; the CAA's response was to sit on its hands. Monarch Was given a deadline of 29 November 1991 to convince the CAA that it was capable of satisfactory maintenance control in accordance with its air operators certificate. However, by 29 November eight items of non-compliance with maintenance requirements were listed against Monarch-but, amazingly, Monarch continued to operate, despite a growing number of complaints about .its operations made to the CAA and to the New South Wales Air Transport Council. Ho- manyt/mes did ithave to be told? Here we have two documented examples of how Monarch had breached the safety requirements resulting in recommendations from airworthiness inspectors to close it down, yet senior management refused to act. Monarch 'sprecarious financial situation was also brought to the attention of the CAA and the New South Wales Air Transport Council. In '1991 Monarch Aviation Pty Ltd, the then owner of Monarch Air, showed a shareholders deficiency of $789,059. Monarch's reputation for its inability to pay ensured that it was unable to obtain fuel or spate parts on credit and had to pay cash or resort to measures such as having agents pay for fuel purchased on its behalf from the takings for ticket sales. This situation led Monarch flying without sufficient fuel because it could not buy it at many airports. It ran ,out of fuel on at least one occasion that I am aware of andtnade an emergency landing at Hoxton Parkin early 1993 with a full load of passengers. Monarch's bankrupt status also led to habitual overloading and the, industry was with stories of Monarch overloading by 200 to 300 kilograms as a matter of course. One pilot refused to fly an overloaded Monarch Chieftain with nine passengers, resulting in Monarch's chief pilot, Brad Wilson, angrily calling in a second aircraft to carry the passengers' baggage. The pilot's service with Monarch was terminated shortly after that incident. On a Monarch scheduled service to Bathurst a pilot refused to fly on safety grounds, causing an overnight stop. On this occasion he invoked the anger of Monarch's management, despite the fact that the passengers were in agreement with the pil()t's decision and were content to stay overnight. It was six months before the pilot was given another flight. I have documented evidence of a case where Monarch solved overbooking by putting two adolescent schoolgirls in the same seat. The response of the CAA to complaints about Monarch's insolvency was, 'Well, insolvency of an operator is not aprfme concern of the CAA.' However, Monarch's insolvency was obviously adversely'affecting the safety of its operations. The CAA'sprime responsibility is to ensure the safety of air operations-yet it excludes an operator's financial situation from its assessment of whether the airline operator has the capacity to carry out proper maintenance and maintain proper flying procedures. It was apparent in 1991 that Monarch Air was a problem, that it was broke and was also breaking safety requirements. Somehow or other, that did not seem to concern the CAA. In the United States the financhil viability of an airline is a mandatory criterion in approval for its entry into 'the market. The same applies in the United Kingdom. However, that does not seem to be part of the to criteria applied by the CAA in Australia. Finding out just what criteria the CAA did consider in its decision路 to allow Monarch to continue operating proved to be difficult. In a response to my FOI request for information regarding recommendations made by officers of the CAA for the suspension of Monarch's a:ir operators certificate, the CAA rife legal counsel identified a limited number of documents. Despite its best attempts to hide information through my FOI request, the FOI claim proved that the documents which were already in my possession were correct and that the CAA's路knowledge of Monarch Air's consistently unsatisfactory operations was also correct. By1993 nothing had changed about Monarch' Air, except that it had gone through an amazing number of nominal changes of ownership through an elaborate paper trail of two..dollar companies designed to hide its ultimate ownership and protect it from the consequence of its irresponsibility, but still with the same person as the ultimate owner after each change. The paper trail finally led to Mr Greg Scarf, a one-time and present-day director of Aviation Operations I,-td. Scarf's ultimate ownership of Monarch- . second place. throughout its history from 15 December 1989 and his directorial responsibility at the outset when Monarch was setting t!P the shabby exception operations that would characterise it-is indisputable. But after the crash Monarch's owner, Greg Scarf, simply shut up Monarch's flying operations, with seven people dead. The paper trail of ownership gave the insurers a way of wriggling out of their liability and ensured that the actual owners of this aviation operator with its appalling reputation go scotfree. For the people responsible for Monarch fares. there are no repercussions for their gross violations of aviation regulations. The consethe quencesof their activities are being the families of the victims. The CAA's airworthiness inspectors' are quite properlyrecommending that operators in contravention, or in the case of Monarch in repeated contrathe vention, of the very regulations on which aviation safety depends are grounded, but those inspectors have been given no authority to do anything other than to recommend. The authority to act on that recommendabut tion was given to the flight operations side the CAA. Flight operations inspectors are pilots and are required to maintain their flying hours in order to be current licensed pilots. As a result they often become dependent on the very operators they are supposed regulating for access to flying time in order to maintain their licences. This leads to a situation where corruption is possible and indeed does take place. I have been told of how problems have been finessed where the operator offered free flying time in expensive aircraft to CAA inspectors in return for lenient treatment when a breach of regulations has been discovered. . There is an in-built conflict of interest here. It is simply wrong that this club-like atmosquently phere can exist between regulator or policewith . man, as the CAA people are, and the air operators, the people they are supposed to regulate. By sidelining airworthiness criteria as'路 the primary requirement for continued operation, the operator has become the client, whose commercial interests have become Mr paramount, putting passenger safety into Through my investigations it became apparent that the Monarch crash was not the but was just the one where potential disaster was realised. My office has h-d many calls from people in the aviation industry, including pilots, who are very concerned that safety has become the poor relation. They tell me that there are many operators who regularly .operate well below the safety margin and who are constantly risking the lives of their unknowing passengers. Operators are intent on keeping their planes in the air and earning The risk is that the first things to go in that process' are the stringent standards that travelling public believe exist in the carried by Australian aviation industry. Monarch Air's NOU was co-piloted by a young man who, it is believed, was not working for pay but had been picked up on spot and was flying so that he could notch up his hours and get experience with a commercialoperator. I have also been told of pilots waiting at Bankstown to get a chance to. fly a route-and not only not getting paid having to pay the operator or someone in of management to be allowed to do so. Under these circumstances, pilots are unlikely to be able to exercise the responsibilities that are demanded of them and will be very reluctant to take a stand and refuse to fly a plane, even to be when they know it has a defect. The penalties they suffer for exercising their responsibilities can be severe. A pilot flying for an operator, Seaview Aviation, which flies from the north of New South Wales to Lord Howe Island, claimed that he was sacked on the spot for refusing to fly a plane in which the autopilot was out, the same problem in the incident with the Monarch plane. Notwithstanding the pilot's notification of the defect to the operator, he claims that the pilot subseoperated the plane unchanged and no notation of the defect on its maintenance release. Moreover, according to local reports,the operator continually operates that aircraft overloaded. The CAA has been aware of the situation for some time and, once again, nothing has been. done to stop that operator from risking the lives of the unwitting passengers despite a CAA airworthiness inspector's recommendation that the operator be grounded Another pilot has given me information detailing accidents in which he was involved caused by safety breaches by the operator for whom he worked, Blayney Airfarmers, an operator who also failed to report an accident after which repairs were done by a nonlicensed engineer with unapproved materials: Although the pilot reported these circumstances and abuses, such as flying with tachographs disconnected; to the CAA flight operations manager, Mary O'Brien, and despite the fact that officers' from the CAA had arranged to meet with him, they did not attend at the appointed time and have not followed this matter up at all. There are many other examples that time does not permit me to go into. It is clear these cases that the Monarch air crash is simply the visible tip of a very large and potentially very destructive iceberg. The CAA has obviously fallen down in itS prime responsibility to conduct safety regulation of civil air operations in Australia. It has no excuses. The CAA has been given the teeth. The problem is that it is路 not using them. My constituents, through no fault of their own, flew in an aircraft that operated and that the CAA knew was likely to be operated in breach of air safety regulations and were the victims of a fatal accident. To make their families' pain and grief even greater, they seem to be denied access to insurance. The irony is that the very breaches of the regulations by the airline operator that led to .the accident are being used as the escape from liability by the insurer. Insurers know that they can use such methods of evasion. Even if challenged in court, the legal challenge will be a long, stressful and costly experience for the claimants. Insurers apparently use every means to evade their liability and are unmoved by the distress of the fami:lies or victims. The passengers on the Monarch aircraft assumed, as do most Australians, that they were covered automatically. by insurance similar to the third party insurance that covers all travellers on the roads. That is not the case, however, and the plight of the families of the victims of the Monarch crash is not an isolated case. On 12 June 1992 another Piper crashed at Moorabool in central Victoria. Five people, including the pilot, were killed. The owner has had his insurance claim on the plane paid, but the insurance company-it happens to be the same one involved in the Young crash-is not only backing away from payment of the claims. by the widows of the passengers but has not even responded to their correspondence. The families of the victims are suffering great deprivation, financial as well as emotional, and have been abandoned despite confirmation from the owner of the plane that he held insurance. The insurance company has not denied that a policy exists, but simply refuses to discuss it. Again, it is the victims' families that are from placed last in the list of priorities. The families are given this low priority in the Air Navigation Act, which not only does not require that insurance be compulsory' for these aviation operators at all but, even if insurance is taken' out, also limits the liability of both operator and pilot for death or injury to $180,000. The CAA requires no proof of insurance before issuing an air operator's certificate for charter or for regular public transport. Although this' is a requirement for registration by the New South Wales Air Transport Council, it need only be sighted on the first application and in practice need not be sighted from that day forward. This is an inequitable situation and demands correction. There is' a lot that needs to be done to put civil aviation ona proper footing in Australia. The Monarch crash and the information I have been given about other crashes and potential disasters lead to some inescapable conclusions. The CAA has clearly lost sight of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of air safety above all other consider,: ations. Operators are permitted to continue carrying passengers even when it is obvious that their financial status will no longer enable them to carry out the required maintenance.. Also, operators have taken advantage of the failure by the CAA to properly regulate air路 safety to take short cuts and to dodge expenses. .. These investigations also led me to con.elude that Australians are unwittingly flying with third level路 operators, unprotected by proper safety regulation and unprotected by adequate insurance. It is an outrageous situation that must not be allowed to continue and I will be approaching the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) with the details of the cases I have discussed today and I will be proposing that he initiate an immediate investigation of the regulatory needs of civil aviation, especially at this level of operation, and of the adequacy of insQrance protection to passengers when they travel with these operators. I suggest to the minister that the following measures are essential. The government must review the priorities of the Civil Aviation Authority. The government must investigate the association between flying operations inspectors and airline operators to ensure that no opportunity for corruption can occur. Viability must be included as a mandatory criteria when the Civil Aviation Authority is considering an air operator's certificate. The viability of a particular route should be a consideration before licensing more than one operator for a particular route. Insurance arrangements should be changed so that unscrupulous insurance firms cannot weasel their way out of their obligations by claiming that the operator breached safety regulations, thus voiding the policy' at the expense of the victims. Insurance should be compulsory for all air operators and checked regularly to ensure that it is up to date. The upper, limit of liability of $180,000 should be lifted. Why is an injury or loss of a human life more valuable if it occurs in a motor accident than if it occurs in an aeroplane? The upper limit of $180,000, is a fraction of the compensation that motor vehicle accident victims receive. People such as Greg Scarf and Richard MACLean must never again be allowed to operate an airline or an air charter service because they lack the required character, as proven by their operation of Monarch Air, and should not be placed in a position where they can put people's lives ahead of money. The people at CAA who refused to act on the recommendations to ground Monarch, made at least twice, should be brought to account and made to explain why it was that, despite two recommendations to ground Monarch and numerous incidents thafshould cause concern, they allowed Monarch' to continue to fly. If these actions are not taken, we will see more people killed on commercial airlines. The crash of a DC3 at a Sydney airport last week shows how inadequate the CAA is and how lucky we are that more Australians have not gone to their graves, as my constituents did on 11 June last year at Young. 1 seek leave to table documents that add further to those claims.

113,Mr LINDSAY,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert.,.. - Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (6.06 p.m.)-in reply-I thank the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) for their contributions to this important debate. The main purpose of r the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is to incorporate excise tariff proposals Nos 2 and 3 into the Excise Tariff Act. Accordingly, the subject of the bill is quite narrow in dealing with these revenue matters. I take this opportunity to comment on some of the matters raised by honourable members during this debate. The honourable member for Fadden raised the matter of the recent crash of a DC3 into Botany Bay. In relation to the circumstances surrounding the crash of the DC3 referred to by the honourable member, including the regulatory framework for the particular flight that he referred to, I wish to assure him that this is subject to investigation by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. I expect that, as a consequence of that investigation, the facts will emerge as to where the cause of the crash lay and whether or not any person or persons can be held account for any acts of negligence that may be identified with respeCt to that particular flight. The details of the bill were outlined in my second reading speech on 9 February this year. Indeed, the honourable member for these matters are currently the subject Perth has also at路 some length analysed the circumstances of the increase and decrease of these proposals. I make a couple of other observations with respect to the charges that themselves. The first point to make is that the recovery of safety regulation airline industry through duty on avtur should be viewed in the context of the significant savings the Civil Aviation Authority has delivered to industry over recent years. Airways charges were reduced by $109 million in 1993-94,. following a decrease $94 million in 1992-93. Because of the low rate of duty, the 1993-94 arrangements are expected to result in any significant financial impact on any particular aviation industry sector. I say this having regard to comments made by Qantas and Ansett. As the honourable member for Perth has mentioned, the Civil Aviation Authority developing a long-term funding strategy aviation safety regulation, which will apply with effect from 1 July 1995. This process particular will involve extensive consultation with the aviation industry. Indeed, I am informed that the general aviation sector has indicated to the House. support for these measures contained in the bill. I acknowledge that there has been resistance from Ansett and Qantas against these particular measures. However, let me assure the House that the travelling public are the major beneficiaries of forthwith. safety regulation, and fuel tax is a reasonable proxy for a direcnax on passengers. I know that Ansett and Qantas are strongly opposed third time.路 to the introduction of additional industry taxes such as a passenger ticket tax. So I would be intrigued to know of the proposals, particularly by Ansett and Qantas, as to how these funds should be raised without being an impost directly on the government. I am informed that the cost of applying aviation safety standards in Australia order of $60 million annually. I believe, as to would every honourable member of this House,路 that the maintenance of the highest aviation safety standards in this country is absolutely.essential: In respect of the crash of by me the Monarch aeroplane referred to by the honourable mell'Jber for Hume (Mr Sharp), or an investigation by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. The issues raised by him are of serious concern. I would like to assure him the matters raised by him in his contribution to this bill will be taken into account by costs from the the government. One other matter I want路 to refer to is the issue of the tax itself. There has been a lot of discussion over a long period as to how these costs should be shared. I believe that there is consensus on both sides of the House that the of cost sharing arrangements proposed in this bill and that are ongoing in the aviation not industry have the general support of both adverse sides of the House. In respect of the economic issue, the safety the implications and the impacts of the possible mixes of charges and industry specific taxes on the aviation industry, the CAA has enis gaged Andersen路 Consulting, assisted by for Swedavia, which is an arm of the Swedish Civil Aviation Authority, to advise it 路in on the issues that I have just raised. I am pleased that the. bill is receiving the support of the opposition. I commend the bill Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leaye granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a CRIMES (CHILD SEX TOURISM) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 23 March. Second Reading",81
114,Mr KERR,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Denison-Minister for Justice) is in the (6.15 p.m;)....:...I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The 'principal aim of this legislati<?nis to provide a real and enforceable deterrent to the sexual abuse of children outside Australia by Australian citizens and residents. It is unfortubeen nate that a minority of Australian citizens and residents are now known internationally as major offenders in several Asian countries. They exploit the vulnerability of children in foreign countries where laws against child sexual abuse may ,not be as strict, or as consistently enforced, as in Australia. The bill aims to ensure that cowardly crimes committed against children outside Australia which are not prosecuted in the country in which they were committed can be prosecuted effectively in Australia. The bill also focuses on the activities of .those who promote, organise and profit from child sex tourism. Provided they operate from Australia, or have a relevant link with Australia, they too will be able to be prosecuted for their contribution to the abuse of foreign children. Some may wonder why the Australian parliament should enact laws to protect foreign children from sexual abuse and ask why the foreign country should not protect its own,children. It is true that the primary responsibility for protecting children from sexual exploitation rests, as it should, with countries where the children are exploited. The Asian countries which I have visited are indeed taking measures to do so but are confronted by social and' economic factors which make their task' difficult. They welcome any assistance in kerbing the trade in children's bodies that other governments can give. Some other, countries have already enacted, or plan to enact, legislation similar to that which is now before the House. Apart from the fact that Australia is gaining an unenviable reputation in the world press on this issue, we also have international obligations .to protect children, whatever. their nationality. Australia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 17 December 1990, and. this imposes an obligation to protect children, at both the national and the international level, from sexual exploitation and abuse. Australia played a key role in the development of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Australian government is committed to pursuing the aims of that convention. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, has asked to prepare a draft protocol to the convention specifically addressing the problems of child prostitution and other forms of abuse and sexual exploitation of children. As I indicated in my address to the First World Congress on Family Law and Children's Rights in Sydney on 4 July lQ93, it is clear from the recent. World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna that children's rights. are high on the international, agenda. That conference highlighted the need to develop effective and independent international machinery to ensure that abuses of children's rights are identified and that tangible measures are taken to remedy those abuses. The bill aims to achieve these ends by creating sexual offences, relating to conduct outside Australia, which will be punishable in Australia and offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism which may be committed in or out of Australia and will be punishable'in Australia provided there is a relevant link with this country. All these offences will have substantial penalties, the ranging from 10 to 17 years imprisonment, or correspondingly high pecuniary penalties if a company is involved. The bill should send a clear message to child sex abusers and those who profit from their activities that the government and the community condemn their behaviour and do not intend to tolerate it. The bill has the support of all Australian jurisdictions through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. State. and t-rritory jurisdictions not only support the Commonwealth measures but will enact any necessary or desirable supplementary legislation to close any perceived gaps and,to ensure that the measures are effective. The bill creates prescribed sexual offences committed overseas against children under the age of 16 and aggravated sexual offences where children are under 12 years. The prescribed sexual offences are: (1) engaging in sexual intercourse; maximum penalty, 14 years imprisonment-17 years for the aggravated offence; (2) inducing children to have sexual intercourse with others in the person's presence, 14 years imprisonment-17 years for the aggravated offence; (3) committing an act of indecency on, or in the presence of, a child in the prohibited age ranges, 10 years imprisonment-12 years for the aggravated offence; (4) submitting to an act of indecency committed by, or in the presence of, a child in the prohibited age ranges, 10 years imprisonmerit-12 years for the aggravated offence; (5) inducing children to commit, submit to or participate in, or be present while a third person commits, acts of indecency in the presence of the person, but which are not committed by or on him or her, 10 years imprisonment-12 years for the aggravated offence; (6) inducing children in the prohibited age ranges to be present while others engage in sexual intercourse in the presence of the person, 10 years imprisonment-12 years for the aggravated offence; and, (7) engaging in sexual intercourse in the presence of a child in the prohibited age ranges with the intention of deriving gratification from the presence of the child, lO.years imprisonment-12 years for the aggravated offence. There are further offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. There are some aspects of the bill that I draw to your attention. The intention has been to strike the correct balance between the need to minimise the enforcement difficulties that always arise where overseas evidence is required, and which are exacerbated when child witnesses are involved, and the need to ensure that the rights of the defendant receive a similar degree of protection as would apply if the offence had been committed in Australia. The legislation must be more than mere window-dressing. I am concerned to see that it is practically enforceable, as it must be if is to have the deterrent effect for which I have aimed. However, while I am determined to achieve this, I will not do so by com promising the defendant's right to the protection of the usual rules of evidence and procedure:-to the traditional rights, privileges and defences which would have applied if the conduct alleged had occurred within an Australian jurisdiction and not in a. foreign country. There will inevitably be some differences in the procedural and evidentiary framework of these路 offences from that which applies to similar state and territory offences. These are needed to accommodate the international aspect of the enforcement process, but there are none which d9 not already occur in Australia in an age of increasing internationalisation of many offences, and none which will operate unfairly to the. defendant. I will now outline the features of the. bill which may call for further explanation, particularly as this subject matter, sexual offences, is unusual in a Commonwealth bill. The age of consent is the factor which creates the difference between the freedom to conduct one's personal life as one wishes and the commission of the criminal offence of child sexual abuse. On this point such offences are offences of strict liability, in this bill and in all Australian states and territories, whether code or common law jurisdictions. . Within Australia, the age of consent varies among jurisdictions, and overseas the range of variability is even greater. The Convention on the Rights of the Child sets the age at 18 years. However, most Australian jurisdictions have chosen 16 as the appropriate age, and that is the age which I consider appropriate in the present circumstances. There is also some variation in Australia regarding the age at which an aggravated offence ,of child sexual abuse occurs. In most jurisdictions that age is 10 years. I have chosen 12 years as the age of a victim below which an aggravated offence is committed. My choice of that age was influenced by a proposed defence of mistaken belief in the age of a child-that is, a belief that the child was over 16 years-together with a belief that the child consented to the it relevant acts. Ido not think it appropriate to extend that defence below 12 years. It is true that this means that an Australian might sexuaily abuse, overseas, a child of an age that, if the conduct had occurred in his or her home state in Australia, an offence would not have been committed or would not have been an aggravated offence. However, in my view, there is路 no more reason for legitimate grievance on the defendant's part than if his or her conduct had taken place in an Australia:n jurisdiction where similar age limits applied as are provided in this bill. .. This milY be a convenient point to deal with the proposed defences, which have unusual features not duplicated in any Australian jurisdiction. The first is a defence of mistaken belief in the age of the child, It is available only in relation to offences involving children between 12 years and 15 years. Its first element is a belief that the child was 16 years or over. This,or its equivalent, is usually, though not always, the only element路 of the defence in. Australia. Its second element is a belief路 that the child consented to sexual intercourse. In some Australian jurisdictions, a similar two-element defence is available at the upper level of the prohibited age range. The belief test, in both cases, is a subjective one, based on what the person actually believed, though in determining whether the person actually held that belief the jury is entitled to take into account whether the claimed路 belief is reasonable in the circumstances. In relation to the belief in consent, the defendant's belief is negated if he or she kriows that the child's consent was caused by any of the circumstances listed in proposed section 50CF .of the bill, such as violence, threats of various kinds, coercion, or any form of intoxication or incapacity; nor is mere passivity on the child's part to be taken as grounds for a belief in his or her consent. Although - nusual, in this legislation the requirement of a belief in consent is necessary to avoid an unacceptable result where a defendant satisfies the jury of his or her belief that the child was 16 years old or over - and under most Australian laws would, therefore, be entitled to an acquittal-but the evidence shows unequivocally that the child did not consent and that the defendant had no belief that the child did consent. If the conduct had occurred in an Australian jurisdiction, the person, though not gUilty of a child abuse offence, would be convicted of rape. Under this .legislation, he or she could only be acquitted of the offence charged- Any rape trial would have to路. take place in the country where the conduct occurred and would depend on a request from that country for extradition of the accused, which may not be forthcoming. It is simply not feasible for the present proposal to extend to the creation of an offence of rape in a foreign country. That would be way beyond its scope. So the element of belief in consent is the only way to avoid such anomalous results. . The second defence, which is available where the child is under, as well as over, the age of 12 years, is that of avalid and genuine marriage between the accused and the alleged victim. The defence extends below 12 years because marriage customs vary considerably throughout the world. I would not wish to exclude from its ambit any valid and genuine marriage, although I would expect such marriages with children under 12 years to be rare. This defence, too, has an unusual element: the. requirement that the defendant satisfy the jury, on the balance of probabilities, that a formally valid marriage is also genuine. This requirement .is to avoid deliberate abuse of the availability of the marriage defence to defeat the legislation. Marriages celebrated in foreign countries where one of the parties is under 18 years are generally not recognised in. Australia. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that an Australian citizen or resident who came to Australia from a foreign country; or whose parents did so, might return to that country to marry according to its customs. I have no intention, in multicultural Australia, of rendering any such person vulnerable to conviction for a criminal offence on returning to Australia. That would be an entirely different matter from simply not recognising the marriage. In Australia, the formal validity of a marriage is proved, prima facie; by production of a marriage certificate. It would not be difficult, particularly in countries where poverty and corruption are widespread, for paedophiles to obtain marriage certificates which would preclude their conviction of child sexual abuse offences if the marriage defence did not place an onus on them to satisfy the jury, on the balance of probabilities, of the genuineness of the marriage. Courts have some experience in dealing with a requirement for proof of genuineness of a marriage because it features in immigration law, which could similarly be Circumvented by nongenuine marriages. In spite of my concern that Australians from other ethnic backgrounds are not prejudiced by this legislation, I cannot accept that a genuine marriage alone should provide a complete defence if there is evidence that the child did not consent to sexual acts. The same belief in consent, and the same negating factors, will apply to this defence as to the mistaken belief in the age of the child. This is consistent with the policy behind Australian laws which do not condone路 rape within marriage. Some may consider that the defences provided in the bill, placing both the evidential and the persuasive bnus of proof on the defendant to satisfy the jury on the balance of probabilities that such a defence is made out, as being contrary to the principle that the prosecution must prove every element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. However, the offences are proved by the prosecution satisfying the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the prohibited acts with a child of the relevant age. The child's lack of consent or marital status are not elements of the offence. The defences are true defences providing a means of exculpation for the accused and are matters required to be proved to the civil standard and are matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused. Therefore, it is appropriate for the of proving them to rest on him or her, rather than that having the prosecution forced to undertake the difficult task of proving negatives beyond a reasonable doubt. Let me now move to the offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism. These offences are required because the usual ancillary offences of aiding and abetting, counselling, procuring and being knowingly concerned in the commission of a substantive offence would not suffice to catch the promoter, organiser or advertiser of a child sex tour. That is because those offences depend on the commission of a particular offence to which the promoter, organiser or advertiser would have to be. directly and knowingly linked. This would not usually be possible when he or she is remote in time and place from any specific child sexual offence. Possibly the ancillary offence of inCitement could be committed, since it does not require the . actual commission of a particular; or indeed any, offence but the penalty for inCitement is only 12 months imprisonment. I consider that the intentional acts of encouraging or benefiting from the sexual abuse of defenceless children in foreign countries, whether or not any specific offence with a particular child is contemplated, must be prosecutable and must be punishable by'a substantial penalty, in this case a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. This is an indictable offence and will aUract the confiscation and forfeiture provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, which should provide a powerful detefTent to any business enterprises which have been profiting from knowingiy facilitating child sex tours. There remain two more matters that I wish to mention. These relate to the conduct of the trial and arise from the difficulties that are assoCiated with pmsecuting offences committed outside Australia. I am determined that the legislation will provide every opportunity, consistent with fairness, for evidence to be made available to the jury, despite the fact that in many cases it will be evidence from a foreign country where records may not be kept in the same comprehensive manner as in Australia and where the ability of investigaonus tors and the court to use coercive powers to obtain evidence and to compel the attendance of witnesses is severely curtailed. The6rst of these is. a provision which, where the age of a child cannot be determined by the usual means, allows the jury. to estimate the age of the child, taking into account whatever evidence is available, such as the evidence of relatives and the child's appearance and demeanour. This is not without precedent. It is based on section 411 of the Crimes Act 1958 of Victoria. I would expect it to have the most relevance not in borderline c.ases where the defence of a mistaken belief in the age of the child would be expected to prevail but in .cases where the child was obviously well within the prohibited range. It would serve the purpose of preventing an accused from evaqing punishment completely because of the lack of documentary evidence of age. The second is the provision for the use of video link so that overseas evidence can be presented to a court in Australia. Video link has already been used effectively in major trials in Australia, including one of the war crimes trials. The legislation guides the judge in the use of the technology by providing two levels of relevant factors to be taken into account. The first level permits the judge to direct the use of video link if he or she is satisfied that the witness, who cannot be the defendant, is willing to give the evidence from outside Australia; that the facilities are available; and that it is in the interests of justice that the evidence be taken by video link. The second level requires the judge to direct the use of video link. He or she must do so if, in addition to a willing witness, other than the defendant, and the availability of technology, he or she is satisfied that the attendance of the witness in Australia would cause unreasonable expense or inconvenience, would cause the witness psychological harm or unreasonable distress, or would cause the witness to become so intimidated or distressed that his or her reliability as a witness would be significantly reduced and, in addition to those matters, is satisfied that it would not contrary to the interests of justice to do so. I believe that these provisions strike the correct balance. The interests of justice remain. the deciding factor, but the judiciaJ discretion is guided to give maximum weight, consistent with those interests, to ensuring that the evidence of foreign witnesses is before the court in the most convenient and useful form. It is increasingly the trend in Australian jurisdictions to spare children who have been victims of sexual abuse the trauma and the ordeal of appearing in the witness box in the intimidating atmosphere of the court. Even in Australia, it is frequently. the case that the jury views thechiId's examination and cross-examination by means of. video. The fact that the child itself is in a distant country rather than in a nearby room may pose some problems for the court . and for counsel that might not arise when the evidence is taken in close proximity to the courtroom but none, I believe, that cannot be overcome. My expectation is that the use of satellite and. communications technology, where that is available, can be used to approximate conditions comparable to those which can already occur in some Australian jurisdictions. .If, in.a particular case, the judge forms the view that the use of vi,deo link would be contrary to the interests of justice, he or she is not compelled to direct its use. It is not anticipated that the bill will occasioll any additional costs tn the government. The costs of any prosecutions will come from the budgetary allocations for the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which will conduct investigations and prosecutions un-er the proposed legislation. . Before I conclude, I might mention that earlier today I had the opportunity to have a brief discussion with the shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), who raised with me the fact that the opposition was concerned that there would be an. occasion for close examination of this bill by a committee of this House. This is an unusual procedure.路 In the past, this House has not been well disposed to that practice, but I have taken. the opportunity on be this occasion to have discussion with representatives of the Democrats in the Senate, who have indicated that it is not their intention to refer this matter to a Senate committee and the matter will be dealt with directly in the Senate without referral. In those circumstances and in the circumstances of other discussions which I have had with the shadow Attorney-General which relate to the time scale so this bill will not be delayed, I propose at the conclusion' of the second reading debate to seek leave to m9ve for the suspension of standing orders to allow this bill to be placed before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration and advisory report back to this House by 30 May. I obviously will be very interested in the way in which that process operates. It is somewhat novel in this House. I think the goodwill of all those involved in the process will be a matter of considerable attention. There is a real community interest that this matter be proceeded with expeditiously and these important measures are brought into Australian legislation without delay. I am certain that the shadow Attomey-General will attend the deliberations of that committee with goodwiII, as he has indicated to me in his discussions. I believe that the proposed .legislation achieves the challenging task of ensuring both enforceability and fairness in the prosecution process for offences committed overseas which are known to be difficult to prosecute even when committed in Australia. I commend the biIl to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Williams) adjourned. NA Selection Committee",82

MrWILLIAMS (Tangney) (6.40 p.m.)The Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 provides a needed step in the direction of preventing Australian citizens from exploiting children in other countries for sexual purposes. The bill is directed principally to activities in South-East Asia, and notably in Thailand and the Philippines. Regrettably, reliable statistics on the extent, of the problem are not availabie. In a book to which I, will refer later the number of child prostitutes worldwide is estimated at one million. The extent of the unreliability of information on the subject is provided by a further reference in the book to the fact that one survey has estimated that there are 10,000 children engaging in prostitution in Thailand while another survey suggests that there are 800,000. Even given the minimum numbers estimated, this is unacceptable to any civilised person or country. In Thailandand the Philippines, at least, it is quite clear that some of the exploitation is undertaken by Australian citizens. The exploitation of children for sexual purposes in those countries by anybody is unacceptable to Australians. Indeed, the conduct of those who exploit children in this way is regarded by all reasonable persons as abhorrent, reprehensible and disgusting. The extent of the sexual exploitation of children overseas and ,the fact that Australians are invoived are factors that must weigh heavily in detennining that this , parliament should act in this matter. However, legislative action by the Australian parliament is not supportable just because activities of Australians overseas would be a criminal offence if committed in Australia. This parliament does not regularly act to regulate the activities of perSons outside the Australian jurisdiction, although there are precedents. Acts such as the Extradition Act 1988, the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 and the Crimes at Sea Act 1979 all relate to the activities of persons outside Australia. Generally, it will be for the government of the country where the offence is committed to take action. However, in this situation, a significant factor to consider is the practical ability of governments of the countries where the exploitation is occurring to takeappropriate action. For instance,.in Thailand, despite government detennination to stamp out the problem, the incidence of the offences, their institutionalised nature and the limitation of resources make this difficult. ' Australia's assertion of sovereignty is justified in this situation because the main impact of the bill will be in countries whose governments have requested the introduction of such legislation. Significantly, the legislation is also quite consistent with Australia's obligations at international law. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by Australia on 17 December 1990 and came into force on 16 January 1991. It provides that countries shall 'take multilateral measures to prevent, amongst other things, the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices. ' It is to be noted that the Commonwealth does not have a general constitutional responsibility in the area of criminal law. However, the bill is constitutionally authorised by the external affairs power, which allows the government to legislate with respect to matters occurring outside Australian territory that genuinely affect Australia's international relations. There must be a connection between Australia and the matters regulated. The nexus in the case of this, bill is that the offences created are committed overseas by Australian citizens, Australian residents or companies incorporated in,or carrying on activities principally within, Australia. The implementa-: tion of the international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child by means of domestic laws provides another constitutional peg through the external affairs power. The coalition has had considerable difficulty with the use' of the external affairs power by recent Labor governments, which have engaged in the practice of entering into international treaties and using those treaties to expand the reach of Commonwealth power. I am pleased to say that in this case the coalition has no such difficulties. As I have explained, constitutional validity is not dependent upon the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, although it provides an important additional justification for the introduction of the legislation. The bill is supported by the more fundamental reach of the external affairs power. Most significantly, the objects sought to be achieved by this bill are supported by the states and territories. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) mentioned in his speech the support for this legislation by the standing committee of Commonwealth and state Attorneys General. It was' considered at a meeting of SCAG in February this year. The call for legislation of this nature has come from a number of quarters, including the National 'Conference on Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism held in 1993 and the inaugural World Congress on Family Law and Children's Rights held in Sydney in July 1993. The United Nations Special Rapporteur to Australia made similar proposals. In addition, 'an active group named End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism has lobbied extensively for the introduction of this legislation. ECPAT now operates in 13 countries, incl--ing the Philippines and Thailand. Apart from Australia, there, are ECPAT organisations within the United States, Canada and some European. countries where' tourists, to ,Asia come from.' ' . ' With all those considerations in mind, in the coalition's view it is very appropriate for Australia to introduce legislation intended to deal with offences occurring overseas. Australia is by no means the first country to enact such legislation. Legislation preventing nationals from engaging in sexual activities with children in foreign countries has been passed by legislatures in Germany, Sweden and Norway. The coalition offers full support for the objects of this bill. However, in our view, it is necessary that we get the legislation right. That involves determining whether thelegislation is appropriately drafted in order to achieve its' objectives. As' the minister has pointed out, it is also fundamentally important that the basic rights of Australian citizens to the true rights of the presuinption of innocence and to a fair trial are not overlooked in the pursuit of other worthwhile objectives. In the coalition's view, there are a number of potential difficulties with the bill' that I believe need to be examined in more detail. Some of these difficulties have been endorsed by those who are most supportive of the thrust of the bill. I acknowledge in this respect the assistance that has been received from Mr Richard Read, a prosecutor of the Queen of Victoria, and Professor David Lanham, the Sir Kenneth Bailey Professor of Law, at the University of Melbourne. Both me- ar<e active supporters of the legislation. I dwell on this point because I do not wish it to be suggested or thought even for a moment that well-intentioned substantive criticism of the contents of this bill constitutes a criticism of its fundamental purposes or a deflection from, the pursuit pf them. Demonstrative of the intention of commentators in this regard, Professor Lanham ref{!rs to a book by Mi Ron O'Grady; The Child and the T()urist, which describes the nature and the extent of the sexual exploitation of children. Professor Lanham il)dicates that he read, the book 'with interest and anger'. He prefaced his written comments on the bill with this: As a small contribution to the fight against the disgraceful exploitation of children, I offer some comments on the bill which I hope will. make it more - orkable. Mr Read is also an active supporter of the government's action and already has been an active lobbyi-t for the legislation. Some of the comments I will mention are derived from comments made by Professor LaIiham and by Mr Read. I believe that the full and constructively critical examination which I suggest should take place can be done effectively by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As I indicated earlier, I applaud the. minister's agreement that this is an appropriate course of action to take. . First, before pointing to some of the difficulties, let. me summarise some provisions of the bill. In general, the bil1 creates a range of offences involving sexual activity with children committed by. Australian citizens or Australian residents outside Australia. As the minister has pointed out, it also creates offences relating to the organisational promotion of child sex tourism. The路 intention is to create specific offences which relate to children in two age groups. The first is those less than 12 years old and the second is those who. are between the ages of 12 and 15; that is, not yet 16 years old. That second group would comprise 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year颅 olds and IS-year-olds. The specific offences are,. first, sexual intercourse with a child; secondly, inducing a child to engage in sexual intercourse; thirdly;. sexual conduct involving a child, including. acts of路 indecency; and, fourthly, indpcirig a child to be involved in sexual conduct in the presence of the offender, which also includes acts of indecency. An inclusivdefinition of sexual intercourse is provided in the legislation,and it is very wide in scope. The term 'act of indecency' is not defined in detail. As would be expected, maximum prescribed penalties for offences against children under 12 years of age are greater than路 those against children in the older age group. The bill provides for specific defences, including defences based on a belief about age and consent and a defence based on the existence of a valid genuine marriage and a belief about consent. Certain factors will operate to cause the defendant's belfef about consent to be disregarded; for example, if the consent was caused by the effects ofa1cohol. . The bill provides for the offence of benefiting from or encouraging路other offences. This part of the bill is intended, it appears, to catch tour operators and organisers. The term 'encourage' is defined widely and includes 'organising an arrangement that faciJitates an offence against this part'. The bill faciJitates the taking of evidence by allowing evidence to be taken by video link. The bill allows for. the jury to estimate the age of the victim, taking into .account the person's appearance, demeanour and other relevant matters as well as whatever evidence is available. I tum now to some of the particular difficulties with the bil1 as currently drafted. I emphasise again that these are offered as constructive criticisms. I mention also that they are offered as a selection of comments from those which have路 been made. They are by no means exclusive; they are intended only to demonstrate the need for a detailed review of the bill which could be conveniently and expeditiousl):' done.. A general comment which is appropriate is that some of the language is vague and the possibiJity of tightening it should be pursued. I referred earlier to the definition of the act of encouragement which is in section SODB. The definition is very wide in scope. Given the severity of the penalties involved, the drafting needs to be considered most carefully. There are concerns with proposed section SOFA, which allows the jury to estimate the age of the alleged victim. It can be foreseen that there may路 be difficulty for a jury, likely to be largely of European extraction and living in Australia, to determine'the age of ari alleged victim, likely to be of Asian extraction arid normally Jiving in Asia; This will be made more difficult, as I am sure the minister has路 foreseen, in cases where the alleged victim will only give evidence to the jury by way of video- thereby probably giving the evidence from Asia"" or by means of a photograph. ' It is potentially urifair where an estimate is being made' of the age of a child where the child's age appears to be at the borders of one of the age categories. In the case of an alleged actof sexual intercourse, the determination of whether a child is 15 Or 16 will involve th- difference between,' on the onhand, a conviction and a potential penalty of 14 years and, <;m the other hand, an acquittal with rio penalty., Similarly, in the C!lse of an allegation of sexual intercourse where the question is whether the child is 11 or 12, the difference between conviction of one offence as against ',another will' involve different maximum penalties of 17 years and 14 years respectively; There is scope for injustice under the arrangements proposed in the bill on this particular point. A technical point r!lised' by ,Professor Lanham showS, that the bill may provide an unnecessary loophole for those who are chargeq pursminUo the legislation. The point is that there appears to be agap in the scheme which results from the way the age limits are specified. Sections 50BA and 50BB can be taken as an example. Those, provisions provide that iUsim offence to engage in sexual intercourse with a person who is under 12 and with a person who is at least 12 but under 16, respectively; , If evidence before a jury were 'such that it was clear that the child was either 11 or 12 but it could not be determined which, the jury could' not, reasonably determine beyond reasonable doubt that the child wasIl or was 12. In that event, the jury would pioperly be forced to acquit the accused of an offence under both seetions,--that is, 50BA and 50BB. That Clearly is not an inteqdeCI result. While some juries might take a pragmatic approach and conviCt the accused on the lesser offence, it would not btf doing its job according to the law if it were to do so. The jury .would be in a difijcuIt situation, where {it, would feel morally compelled to act otherwise, than in accorqancewith its duty; Legislation should not present a jury with such dilemma. A similar issue,arises in relation to a number of other provisions in the bill. A ,solution suggested by Professor Lanham in relation'to the example provided may be to' make it an offence under clause 50BS to engage in sexual intercourse with a child under 16. A provision could then be inserted that if there is a conviction under section 50BA then 'there may-not be a conviction under section 50BB in respect of the same set of circumstances. Another question arises in relation to defences based on ,the belief. of the alleged offender as to the age and consent of the child. ,Section 50CA provides that the subjective belief concerning age and consent constitute a defence, and under section 50CB a valid gen'uine marriage plus a beliefin consent are sufficient to provide a defence. Under section 50CD, the jury may take into account whether the belief was reasonable in determining whether the defendant hadthe subjective belief. It should benotedthatthe defence is not excluded if the defence is not reasonable. In other words, there is no requirement for the alleged offender to establish that the , belief was reasonable. It has been noted that' this may cause problems- particularly in relation to situations where intoxication is' an ',' element. Under Australian common law, the' fact that the defendant was intoxicated must be taken into account in ""interpreting this, legislation and determining whether the defendant believed the alleged victim was of a certain age or consented. A view has been' expressed that the bill should be amended to provide that the belief must be a reasonable one. ' It is nolin'appropriate to suggest that the title of the bill is unnecessarily emotive. The term 'child sex tourism' used in the currerit title is colloquial but, in my submission,' it is also inappropriate and even misleading because the subject matter of the bill is not, as the title, suggests, limited to exploitation of children by tourists. The view of the coalition, is that the bill could be more appropriately titled the Crimes (Overseas Exploitation of Childreri) Bill 1994. The issue of enforcement is crucial to the success of the bill. Although the bill sends ,out an important message to the community, it is important that it have teeth. The successful enforcement will depend upon the establishment of specialist law enforcement units with trained investigators. Exchange of intelligence needs to be undertaken between Australian bodies such as the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service and state police forces. Also vital will be the relationships路 developed between Australian authorities arid thqse in countries where the activities a-e occurring. That may involve the negotiation of mutual assistance treaties or the application and expansion of existing treaties. Examination of the bill at the committee stage will enable important information concerning the government intention in these regards to be made known. As indicated earlier, examination will also enable the review of the bill's provisions to ensure that they are workable. I repeat that the coalition strongly supports the objectives of the bill. For its part, the coalition will do whatever is necessary to expedite a detailed review of the bill by the standing committee in order to ensure that its objectives路 are achieved. It must be an enforceable and effective statute when enacted. The coalition commends the government for its resolute intention to deal with the dreadful practices which have given rise to the bill. I commend to the Hbuse the motion proposed to be moved by the .minister to路 suspend standing orders in order that the bill may be referred to the standing committee for review and report.",88
116,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I think the House and the general Australian community will be gratified by the action of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) in movipg expeditiously to deal with a problem which has long vexed many sections of our society. I think they will be heartened by the fact that the opposition has responded to this legislation in keeping with its spirit, and I commend the view that the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, at the minister's initiation, go to a committee of this House. Having said that, I do not want to delay the House in its consideration of this bill, and I have only one matter which I believe should be considered. If one goes to those Asian countries where prostitution involving young women and children under age is practised, in almost all cases those young women and children are being exploited or being managed by someone who benefits from that act of exploitation. We are not simply dealing with an individual paedophile operating, as it were, on the chance of meeting a child in the street and proceeding to seduce him or her. We are路 dealing with what is clearly a well-organised racket which basically operates with children and underage people-people under 16 years of age-who have no rights. They are the objects of defilement and exploitation, and they have no choice about the matter. That being the case, under clause 50CF, which relates to when belief for consent must be disregarded, it is not difficult to imagine that those who are unscrupulous enough to exploit children and profit from this路 industry-which is what it is, whether they be AuStralian paedophiles gratifying their perversions or whether they are running those children for profit-will also, to maintain some level of defence, provide either false certificates saying that children are over 16 years of age or written statements provided by the children themselves saying that they are qver 16 years of age. That, on the basis of a payment or a fee, becomes a let-out for the paedophile. I hope that the committee when considering this matter will look at the issue in this context. I believe that if there is a monetary inducement-no matter whether it is paid directly to the child or to someone who is running the child-or a monetary transaction for the procurement of the child, the belief about consent should be disregarded. Those who are involved in this gross exploitation are people who, in order to pursue their sexual practices, not only are prepared to go overseas to commit what they know would be offences if committed in Australia but also are pre-. pared to go to extraordinary ends to indulge their gratifications. I believe we have to see this as a practice that goes essentially to the fundamental rights of the child. I commend the minister for his actions. I believe he has acted in a very sensitive way on this issue. The bill shows the great work and great scholarship that has taken place by both him and his department, and I commend them for it. I also commend the opposition for the spirit in which it has received this legislation. I am certain it will do some good in the broad general community to know that there are issues in this parliament about which members on both sides agree. I commend the bilI to the House and commend both the minister and the opposition for their attitude towards it.",93
117,Mr FILING,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I support the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, although I acknowledge the comments made by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), on the need for the bill to be referred to either the House or Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the need for some amendments to tighten up some of the areas that are either vague or difficult to define within the bill. There is no doubt that the growth' of the child prostitution and tourism indusfry is a matter of serious concern to the Australian community. It has become much more prevalent in recent years and, of course, is becoming more and more, the subject of grave concern to the countries themselves that are subject to those visits by predominantly European males or people of European descent to engage in prostitution or sexual acts with' juveniles in that country. It is interesting, in the first instance, at the need for the legislation: Clearly, there are a number of significant reasons for the legislation to be enacted. When one looks overall at the background of the growth in the child prostitution industry, one needs to consider the circumstances under which child prostitution has grown. I suppose the most important of those reasons are the financial rewards and the conditions under which some of these juveniles or children have been forced, induced or persuaded into prostituting themselves to foreign, visitors. It is quite clear that there is no single cause for child prostitution and, as a consequence, there is no simple, solution. There are a variety of reasons for child prostitution, as I have already mentioned, such as terrible poverty, lack of job' opportunities and the problems' of debt. As a consequence of indebtedness on the part of the children's parents or guardians or the children themselves, they are forced into bondage-almost a form of child slavery-prostitution and brothels. We know that at times parents, guardians or families are forced or tricked into selling their children into sexual slavery. We, also know that, in the predominant areas oqhis activity, tourism is of great importance to the host countries. Because of debt or the desire to earn greater foreign income, tourism tends to take on importance over the welfare of those particular youngsters who are involved in these disgusting forms of activities. The desire to encourage tourism on the part of the countries that are the principal areas of this activity often 'leads to officials turning a blind eye to the activities. In some instances they are actually 'encouraging the trade or being involved in the trade, as some evidence has shown to be the case, particularly, in Thailand. Cheap sex and a small likelihood of punishment are not insignificant inducements or incentives for those who are looking for that type of activity to - isit those countries and gratify their peculiar sexual desires, on the local population, including the local children. I am indebted to an article, in the publication entitled Reform written by Justice Elizabeth Evatt and Jenni Millbank. They are not to look commentators that I would often be sharing views with; nonetheless, iri this particular instance they have identified some important factors in this peculiar and disgusting trade. One of these is the power of a western tourist who is visiting one of these countries. The opportunity is presented by the fact that they are adults and the fact that, because of their income, or the amount of money they have brought with them, they are relatively wealthy compared with the people who are the subjects of their grati fication. Hence, they have an enormous amount of power-both economic and physical. So it obviously will be difficult to prevent this type of activity from going on without having the opportunity to punish or provide a great disincentive to those people who seek that type of sexual activity, particularly in Asian countries. There is a systematic form of exploitation in those countries. .. In Thailand and the .Philippines, child prosti-ution involveSrriostly young girls who are sold ,into domestic service in the city. major. issues there are abuse in the home, poverty, trickery and fraud on the parents and girls. by the procurers who manage to get them into that particular trade. There is an opportunity for that type of inducement or procurement to be reduced by better educational exchange programs to demonstrate to those victims, the hapless villagers and their families who are involved, the tactics that are used by procurers and tricksters. Poverty is hard to overcome, but I think education, training and employment might help to lessen the dependence those children have on their employment in order to provide a source of income for their parents, families or others who may have been tricked, procured or induced into this trade. There is evidence that, as demand for child prostitution increases, there is a corresponding increase in fraud and outright abductions to get girls away from their villages to the cities and, increasingly, to other countries to meet this demand. There needs to be a quite substantial campaign to reduce the serious inroads that this type of activity has on those areas in the countries that are affected by terrible poverty or that are ignorant to the tactics and trickery used by the procurers in order to induce them to allow their girls to go into brothels in the cities. In Sri Lanka, the other major area of this activity, the situation is somewhat different. The predominant type of child prostitution involves teenage and younger boys. Some of these boys are lured into brothels by adult pimps. Many of them act in gangs or alone and solicit part time to supplement their income. When faced with the problem of child sexual exploitation, the natural response by most is that there ought to be a law against this and something ought to be done. Many of the countries with child prostitution have laws making prostitution or procuring or exploiting child prostitution illegal. Some countries have introduced laws specifically directed against foreign tourists who sexually exploit children. The difficulty is in enforcing these laws in the country, particularly where the perpetraThe tors are foreigners who are wealthy by local standards. By local standards those tourists, who are wealthy by comparison, and those procurers, who are. often very wealthy,. often are able to bribe their way out of trouble. An additional difficulty is presented by the fact that the children may be breaking the law in their own country, even though they are being exploited by someone else. Therefore, there is a natural fear of being prosecuted oneself. That makes it more difficult for the country to successfully prosecute relatively wealthy tourists who are availing themselves of that particular type of activity. As I mentioned earlier, against that background we have the legislation that has been described here by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), the shadow minister and others. It is a very necessary piece of legislation that attempts to provide circumstances within Australia which create the disincentive necessary to try to get at the source of the problem. One of the sources of the problem is the people who are looking to participate in these offences: the tourists themselves-the paedophiIes who are going overseas, either individually or in groups, and participating in some of this behaviour. . I have been concerned for some time ab()ut the problems associated with .paedophile networks in this country. It is quite c1eaTthat, in relation to the visits overseas by. paedophiles who are availing themselves of child prostitutes and paedophile activities, the network of information that appears to be available to them within the country is a matter of some concern. There has been .some quite prevalent comment about paedophile networks in Australia. Iri the recent report 'of the review of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, there were references to paedophile networks and some recommendations arose from them. In particular, in reference to organised paedophile networks, paragraph 472 of the report stated: In the路 past few years information has emerged about the existence of networks of paedophiles operating in this country. Inquiries conducted by a number of police services have given rise to allegations that these networks are involved in the production and distribution of child pornography, share in successful seduction strategies and personal details of potential victims, organise child sex of Third World countries and possibly sponsor the migration of children from overseas. There has also been evidence of these networks receiving protec"" tion by corrupt police. The matter of concern is contained in paragraph 4.73, which states: Paedophile networks have not been the subject of proactive law enforcement primarily because of a lack of resources. As a consequence, the extent of the networks and their activities remain unknown. Nevertheless, the illegal activities of groups such as these have the capacity to generate profits and there is evidence that they are organised. Following the finding of the report of the review of Commonwealth law enforcement ple agencies, one has to be critical of the until Commonwealthgovemment in taking so long to come, in part-way, to trying to deal with what is a very serious social problem. The fact that there is little known about paedolesser phile networks within Australia is a matter some significant concern. The fact that reagainst sources have not been properly allocated in order to combat the perfidious influence paedophile networks and their activities in promoting information and in encouraging people to participate路 in child sex tours matter of even more note. If one were to critical of the Australian government, would have to be one of the points worth criticising. Denis Lenihan, the former chief executive officer of the National Crime Authority, wrote what I consider to be a very constructive and helpful article in the Sydney Morning Herald. He was concerned about the recommendation that the NCA's functions and activities be fused with those of the Australian Federal Police. He mentioned in particular that if the recommendations were accepted the NCA would no longer have its own telephone interception surveillance information technolminister ogy and corporate support facilities. That also a matter of concern. Combating the activities of organised paedophile networks quite obviously necessitates the availability on a national basis of extensive facilities and resources. Clearly, with the sort of technology that is available at the moment-bulletin boards and information tours exchange technology-this problem requires a national strategy, but that is something which many of the state forces that are trying to deal with child abuse and other activities of paedophiles find beyond their means. That is where the Commonwealth government has a very important role to play. In the time remaining to me I will deal with some of the problems that arise from the legislation. If one were talking about the importance of the offences, this would probably seem a little bit inconsistent. However, as a person who has always respected the importance of the onus of proof resting on the prosecution-in other words, the basic princithat a person is considered to be innocent proven guilty-I find it a bit difficult to understand the requirement that there has to . be a defence. Let us say that there is a requirement for a person to prove, even on the standard of the balance of probabilities of in the defence to a prosecution for an offence division 2 of the bill that, at the time of the act, there existed between the defendant of and the person in relation to whom the offence was allegedly committed a marriage that was valid, or recognised as valid, under the is a law of the place where the marriage was be solemnised, the place where the offence was that allegedly committed or the place of the defendant's residence or domicile. That issue would be of some concern to anybody who is concerned about the preservation of that important legal principle that, in criminal offences, a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. I would not like to see that standard, that onus of proof, reduced. Division 5 of the bill relates to the video link-up that is proposed in order to facilitate the taking of evidence in cases involving the child victim, the other party, who would become a witness in their own country. The says in the explanatory memorandum is to the bill that minimum outlays would be required in order to be able to pay for the running of this particular legislation, and could come from the AFP's budget and the DPP's budget. The provision of a high standard of communication between the country where the offence took place-where the witness is-and Australia is going to require an enormous amount of expenditure: The other problem is the maintenance of the standard of quality of evidence and the opportunities for the defendant to be able to properly .cross-examine the person who is making the allegations against him or her. . 'The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has already mentioned the problem relating to the estimation of age. I have some concern with that matter because the estimation is a matter that is material to offence and the subsequent punishment in event of a person being convicted. If a perSon is near the borderline of 12 years old, the difference between the two levels of analysis. punishment is a matter of two years imprisonment, there is the opportunity for a jury to be overly influenced by the emotion of' a case. Let us face it, most of these cases are enormously emotional; nobody is unmovedhy stories of the sexual abuse or sexual exploit:' ationof children. I think any reasonable citizen is going to be moved emotionally by that. Under circumstances where there is no evidence of age available in the evidence-inchief it would be difficult for a jury to make a decision in a rational way, perhaps uninfluis enced by the emotions of the case. I would caution the minister to look at that aspect the legislation. If the Senate does refer this legislation to. the Standing Committee Legal. and Constitutional路 Affairs for review, that is one area I would like to see looked A further area of concern is the double jeopardy aspect of the legislation. One of the fundamental principles of criminal law in Australia is that a person is not able to punished twice for the same offence. The difficulty with clause SOFD of the bill is a person cannot be charged or convicted in Australian court if they have already been dealt with in the courts of the country in which they have committed the offence. That is a problem. It may .well be a loophole through which some crafty offenders may try sity. that to get out of being properly prosecuted in their own country. If we are looking at the sources of the requirement for that sort of legislation, one is the fact that it is difficult to sustain prosecutions in the host country-the country where the offences have taken' place. In relation to double jeopardy, a person who is wanting to avoid perhaps the higher standard .of prosecution, a more serious punishment, and the lesser opportunity for influencing the witness, may well choose to try to get themselves prosecuted in another country and be able to influence the outcome of that prosecution. I commend the legislation to the House.' I age also commend the comments made by the the honourable member for Tangney. I urge the the government to support the referral of the legislation .to the legal and constitutional where affairs committee for review and further Debate interrupted. NA",94
118,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Council Elections",97
119,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"This the first opportunity I have had since the local government elections held in Queensof larid on 26 March 1994 to set the record straight on the characters of six' dedicated on councillors from the Burnett region; This place has been used prior to by-elections and at. the Brisbane City Council election and in relation to the performance of the Victorian government to pursue political agendas. I will not step into that mire. But fair play demands that justice be done to the six in question. I be refer to councillors Kevin Hockey, Peter Webster, Doug MCIver and Bill Roberts and that former councillors Alec MCIntosh and Walter an White. Early in 1990 these men made appeals, as ,one might expect of people holding such office in local government, for increased road funding. Their appeals were sincere in intent and quite reasonable, even benign, in intenFor their temerity, they were accused by my predecessor in Hinkler, through their alleged complicity, of being agents of what he described as the 'corrupt and discredited Nati'onal路 Party government' - as honourable members of that era will remember, one of his constant themes. Florid language was used, including such terms as 'fool', 'liar', 'rip 'detriment to ratepayers', 'skilful manipulation', et cetera.Thdr supposed membership of the National Party was the basis of their alleged lying and neglect. This, in tum, came from their accuser's interpretation of their stance on the Self inquiry into local government financing. Of course, even if we accept this convoluted interpretation, it was no justification for so vile an attack-and certainly not for one which enjoyed the privjIege of this House. I will not reflect further on my predecessor, but it is appropriate that this injustice be righted. These men, as of election day, had the extraordinary collective record of 150 years in local government service and 99 years shire chairmanship. It is an incredible record, probably unequalled in any other subregion of Australia. They were not old fogies but practitioners with voracious appetites for work in and dedication to their communities. On the retirement of Councillor MCIntosh on 26 March, he concluded 24 years as shire chairman and 33 as a councillor, to say nothing of his service to the South Burnett Hospitals Board, the electricity board, the ambulance committee and six years as State Vice-President of the Queensland Local Government Association. Not a bad record! His contribution is indicative of the contrihospital butions of the other five; They too had paralleled records of service to hospital boards, ambulance committees, fire brigade boards, Red Cross, Rotary, Lions, grower and grazier organisations, RSL, retirement villagbeds es-and so. the list goes on. The attack their characters was interpreted by many as smear. It was hurtful and aimed at denigrating them in their communities. To their credit, they rose above it, and the attack路 earned ire of their towns and the local government association. Returning to my opening theme, these men needed no veiled promotion by me in this House prior to the local government elections. Indeed, the four continuing in local government were returned as shire chairmen-or mayors as they are now called in Queensland-unopposed. I stress to you, Mr Speaker, off', and to honourable members that all four were unopposed. This;路 the fact of being elected unopposed, is the acid test and a measure of the respect in which they are held in their communities. Their personal and collective contributions need to be recognised and the slur on their characters removed. Hospitals: New South Wales",97
120,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on a subject which I know is near and dear to you, Mr Speaker. Since I have been in this House, 1I have had to attend a vast number of meetings about public hospitalsin New South Wales. In fact, I have attended meetings at Kiama, Berri, Nowra, Ulladulla, Wollongong and Port Kembla. Mr of Speaker, as you would be aware, these meet. ings are about the total inadequacy of public funding to hospitals in our area. There is one crime all these hospitals have in common: hard they lie within Labor or Independent held seats. It is outrageous that in a previous sitting of this parliament people on the other side determined that funds which were allocated for sporting grants were wrong on the basis of a supposed and alleged-which is totally wrong-favouritism to the Labor Party. In this instance, the only two hospitals in my whole region that have gained any money are in the seats of Russell Smith and the Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey. Kiama was closed, despite Mr Greiner, prior unto becoming Premier, categorically denying that after the election he would close it down. He cannot be trusted. Thirteen beds were transferred to Shell harbour and six of those are left. The children's wards in Shellon harbour hospital have been closed down. a There is no children's ward in Milton-Ulladull a hospital. At the Port Kembla hospital, which services one of the greatest industrial the areas of New South Wales, it is being discussed that the casualty路 unit be taken out. I suggest this is an absolutely outrageous dereliction of duty by the state government. It has absolutely no regard, no respect,. for the health wishes and needs of its people. I represent a 'large number of elderly people. I would like to relate some personal experience I have had. I had close family with the Kiama hospital prior to its.closurein that two people who were near and dear to me, two of my grandparents, died there. was Mr W.E. Knott, my grandfather on my father's side, and the other was Ethel Griffin, would be: my grandmother on my mother's side. Both of those people died in that hospital with some dignity. I particularly related to my subvention grandmother because she lived with us for long. She was a part of the community. She was in the position of having her mates and family able to come and visit her. I suggest that much路 of the health and recovery from illness of our elderly populacurrent tion hinges on access to their family, and partners. They usually do not have access to public. transport. In our area they do have access to public transport, as you would well understand, Mr Speaker. The absolute and total disregard for the needs of the people of New South Wales, absolute sham in the allocation of resources and the vote catching and pork-barrelling Premier Fahey in putting money into his own . electorate and into Smith's electorate in and then bleeding all the other h6spitalsdry is an absolute scandal of outrageous proporunless tions. I asked for three things-three things will continue to stand for-when I spoke over 600 people in Ulladulla. First, a 24-hour service by doctors-they will not give that service in our neck of the woods-secondly, bulkbilling and access to bulkbilling; and, thirdly, adequate funding for public hospitals. When we get those three things, we can look forward to those people who are starting to enter their mature years and who are concerned about their welfare and futuregood they are concerned more about their healtherode having some security. We as a population should look after the people who have looked after us for years. Mr Fahey has no regard and no respect for them, and I suggest that should give the game up and leave running this country to people who will do the right thing by the elderly of this community. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Pay Television",98
121,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"In ties response to a question in the Senate on 1 March 1994 about the ABC's involvement in . pay television, Senator MCMullan, representOne ing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), stated that the ABC's pay TV ... fully commercial and involve no risk to the Commonwealth, that there be no further budget to cover operating costs, and that there so be no detriment to ABC free to air services. This raises some serious questions regarding the prospects for the survival of the ABC in its current form: The initial ABC pay TV service is planned to comprise a riews and affairs channel, and a second channel mates for fine drama and children's programs. Where will the money to start these channels not come from? Will the ABC float further loans beyond the approximately $200 million it has already? Are fine drama and children's programs to be now only available to those who can pay for it? Is the H.R. Nicholls Society the alive and well and living in the ABC? Competition from the ABC's pay TV drama of . channel will certainly siphon programs and program resources currently available within Bega the ABC away from free to air TV. Viewers will be resistant to paying for ABC TV drama its programs are either commercial or I of high quality. In any case the incentive will to be to provide cheap drama for free to air TV to attract viewers and advertisers. Under this new regime, pay TV ratings will be revenue useful, - nd free to air ratings revenue useless. The ABC will be placed in the position of having to devote current resources away from free to air programming to pay TV programming to bolster its future pay TV ratings and future revenue stream. Conversely, having quality programs on free to air will the advertising and sponsorship rates for pay TV. As ratings must be the yardstick, ABC pay TV will be allocated more resources to produce programs that tend in style and he content towards the commercial networks' programs, while ABC free to air has fewer resources with which it is expected to be more innovative. Pay TV will inevitably eat up resources to create a high-rating product that is indistinguishable from commercial products. This will be opposed not only by traditional ABC viewers but also by commercial television interests for using government funding to trample into commercial programming territory, threatening their ratings and advertising revenue. The commercial networks will soon understand that they face the prospect of their revenue falling as numbers of both their viewers and advertisers reduce. The viewers will come to realise that the proposal threatens the quality and variety of TV programming and their access to, it. Alarmingly for the ABC's editorial independence, the proposal presents serious .dangers. It has been mooted that ABC pay TV will be set up under a separate corporation from that for free to路 air services. However, with a common board and managing director it will be practically both possible and desirable for sponsors of pay TV programs to influence free to air programming and they will certainly try. In the real world there will be all sorts of spill-over effects. A separate subsidiary company as is proposed is pure newspeak. If pay TV is to be a success in its own right and if it is to be self-funding as a fully fledged commercial operation, it would be much more preferable to establish pay TV under a completely separate company with a separate chairman, board and managing director. But if this were the case what would be the point in any ABC involvement? The ABC was set up as a public broadcaster, run with aims that are intentionally distinct aging. from those of commercial broadcasting. There is no way the quality and variety' in Australian TV broadcasting could be improved by threatening the ABC's free to air TV, .its budget allocation and its programming freedom. On the evidence of the last few years there has'been an inexorable ratcheting of the ABC towards commercialisation and a white-anting . of its charter. Senator MCMullan's Senate comments are superficial and inspire no confidence. No case has been established in the public interest for the public broadcaster to involve itself in pay TV. Indeed, it goes right against the fundamental purpose for which the ABC was originally founded. It is an extreme form of economic rationalism to deprive the less well off of fine drama and news and children's programs because they cannot p-y. Federal Airports Corporation",99
122,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to support the government's decision to examine theprivatisation of some of the assets of the Federal Airports Corporation within the framework of national and regional competition policies. As we know, market competition between Australia's infrastructure providers is required to sustain higher productivity, lower costs and benefits for consumers . Market competition makes transparent the conflict between the short-term sectional interests of producers and the long-term public interests of consumers. This trade-off in public policy is integral to the challenges facing this government in public enterprise reform. The competitiveness of the Australian economy relies substantially on the acceleration and extension of competition policies across the public sector, and the government is strongly supporting the recommendations of the Hilmer report. Without competition, ownership issues are hardly relevant. Corporatised public monopolies are unable to compare their rates of investment return with private sector equivalents. It is difficult, for instance, to judge whether the FAC's performance is competitive or un competitive. The recent evidence, however, is not encourThe Prices Surveillance Authority has been highly critical of the FAC's pricing policies and investment criteria. Large capital outlays on, aeronautical projects such as terminal expansions are driven more by engineering and service standards than by full economic evaluation. In most cases, private monopolies are no more productive than public monopolies. This of course makes absurd the FAC's suggestion on. the basis of its Standard and Poor's credit rating that full privatisation to a single buyer is preferable to breaking its assets into competing airports, some of which could then be offered for sale. If the trading performance of an airport in Australia cannot attract credit arrangements, then it should not receive capital funding other than by transparent and accountable government subsidies.  viability of its 13 smaller unprofitable airports under a regime of partial privatisation. It would be much better advised to act on the recommendations of the 1993 PSA report.  each of its 23 airports, irrespective of local demand and cost factors. Investment and trading strategies hinge on floored crosssubsidisation practices. The lack of transparency for subsidies between airports and between aeronautical and non-aeronautical activities makes the financial performance of each airport difficult to examine. The grouping of cost and revenue information for seven airports-Hobart, Cambridge, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Bankstown, Camden and Hoxton Parkmakes an external evaluation of their performance impossible. By breaking up the FAC and its monopoly practices, the government Can achieve a more rational allocation of airport resources in Australia. F\lll cost pricing. can tum around the financial position of s.,maller airports and enhance their attractiveness for privatisation, or at least establish a proper basis for community service obligations. So privatisation should be seen not as an end in itself, which is the policy of the opposition, but as the best means for establishing airport competition in Australia. Even though the potential for direct competition is limited to major centres such as Sydney, Melbourne and south-east Queensland, private ownership can broaden the concept of market competition around airports. In competitive nations such as the United States,' partS of Europe and East Asia, airports are seen as not just for the arrival departure of planes; they are used in regional and economic strategies as路 catalysts for industry clustering, economic land development and tourism marketing. Private enterprise has a vested interest in turning airports into economic success stories. In Australia the FAC, with its monopoly charter, undertakes no such dynamic planning. We only have to read the recommendations of the recent MCKinsey study to show that private sector development of airports, or at least non-FAC development such as the Cairns airport, is an important catalyst for regional strategies. The absence of airport competition in Sydney, Melbourne and southeast Queensland will continue to restrict the quality of aviation services and economic development. The development of an international airport at Badgerys Creek in Sydney's west, for instance, has been prejudicial to the FAC's monopoly and commercial charter. Tomorrow's white paper should correct that prejudice, and should lead to the creation' of tens of thousands of jobs in Sydney's west and south-west-the largest regional economic development project in Australia this decade-through the development of the international airport, the development of the transport links and substantial land development around the airport site for manufacturing and tourism purposes. We should support this, along with the, competition agenda of路 the Minister. for Transport (Mr Brereton). (Time expired) Tourism: Glasshouse Mountains",100
123,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to expo,se scandalous, actions by the state Labor government in Queensland which could destroy the booming tourism industry in the Glasshouse Mountains area of my electorate. Honourable members would be aware that the Sunshine Coast hinterland is where these beautiful landmarks are situated, and that they were so named by Captain James Cook in 1770 because, from the sea, they reminded him of glasshouses. They are blessed with rich soil, and are the centre of a highly productive horticultural industry. In fact, various tropical fruits, including pineapples, and bananas, pawpaws, custard apples, strawberries, passion fruit, kiwi fruit and citrus fruits, as well as macadamias, are. grown there. In addition, dairying, poultry, vegetables and tobacco are other industries. Increasingly, the Glasshouse Mountains area is a mecca for visitors, in many 'cases day trippers from the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane, and also those who want to stay longer, including many eco-tourists. They are attracted by the scenic beauty of the area, available adventure and sporting pursuits, and many wish to enjoy the warm hospitality of residents. Increasingly popular are rock and mountain climbing and abseiling. Normally all of this would present the area with a prosperous future and many employment opportunities. However, the state Labor government has banned commercial tourist operators from the national parks which cover most of the area. This means that mountain and rock climbing, abseiling, camping and, in many cases, even photography in the Glasshouse Mountains are now baniled because some Aboriginal groups have approached the state government. Among these is a group which has made a Mabo-style claim over most of Caloundra, the Pumicestone Passage, the Glasshouse Mountains and Bribie Island. In my experience there are very few, if any, resident Aborigines in the area. I have also seen reports that the National Parks and Wildlife Service officers have withdrawn brochures promoting the Glasshouse Mountains area from national parks offices. I understand the reason this is happening is that they want to reduce recreational and tourist activity in the area. To me this situation is absolutely unbelievable. Today I set out to check the facts. After many unsuccessful attempts to contact Bruce Gall, the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service-I suspect he was dodging me-I finally spoke to Mr Daniel her MCGreevy, senior ministerial policy adviser to Molly Robson, the minister. that a management plan was under consideration, that a draft plan would be released that public comment would be invited. He also said that he was not aware that the policy of banning commercial tourist operators was in fact in force. That might reassure some people. Later I spoke to Des Boylan, the southment eastern regional director oftheDepartment of the Environment and Heritage. He confessed to me that, although there was no management plan in force and alth9ugh no draft management plan had been prepared for public comment, for the past 18 months commercial operators had been banned because of discussions with local Aborigines. I put to him that this action by his department pre-empted any management plan. He said, 'Well, that could be your view.' In my view, what the department is doing makes an absolute sham of the consultation process. No announcement was made of the change of policy. Indeed, the government has changed the policy in this area by stealth. I have received very many complaints from local Glasshouse Mountains residents and from local business people,and I agree totally with them. The Glasshouse Mountains belong to all coast residents and other Australians. To discriminate against them on racial grounds is unjust. Why on earth should the state Labor government risk killing off eco-tourism, local tourism, tourism which has the capacity to take the area out of recession and to create jobs? It is absolute madness. The Glasshouse Mountains growing tourism industry could be devastated. Jobs will be lost and the local economy hard hit if the government does not reverse Its crazy policy forthwith. Smith, Sister Olive",101
124,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with a great deal of pleasure and a certain degree of humility that I rise this evening to speak about a remarkable woman. In March this year I was lucky enough to attend a dinner held in order to pay tribute to Sister Olive Smith of the Blue Nursing Service in Ipswich in my electorate on the occasion of retirement. It was a terrific honour to be able to salute such a great pioneer of health He told me. care in Queensland. Sister Olive Smith has the distinction of and being the original Blue Nurse. When she was known as Sister Crombie, she started the Blue Nursing Domiciliary Service in Brisbane in August 1953 as a full-time sister. At that time there was no guarantee of wages beyond the first three weeks; nor was there any governsupport. However, the community responded to the need expressed in this pioneering venture and the service expanded rapidly. From that humble beginning, the Blue Nursing Service has grown into the diverse service it is today, consisting of some 510 full-time equivalent registered nurses from 63 centres state-wide who will travel some eight million kilometres to care for 25,000 patients in their own homes. In addition, the service has .39 nursing homes, 50 hostels for the aged, 47 respite centres for aged or disabled persons, 1,200 retirement units and nine day therapy centres across Queensland. The Ipswich Blue Nursing Service in my electorate commenced operations . in 1954. Sister Smith joined the Ipswich service in 1978, becoming director of nursing in May 1981,. In a period spanning inore than a decade; Sister Smith has provided stewardship to a service which is now the second largest in Queensland and which has earned the widespread support of the Ipswich community. Through her unswerving路 devotion to the cause of nursing and unassuming, .gracious manner, she has endeared herself to the hundreds of clients served by a loyal and devoted staff. I am pleased to be able to say that the government recognises the importance of the work begun by Sister Olive Smith and carried on by the Blue Nurses today. Last Friday I had the great pleasure of forming the Blue Nursing Service in Ipswich of an increase in its funding grants under the home and. community care, or HACC,program. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) recently approved an increase of $13,751 for the Blue Nursing Service Ipswich Respite Care Centre, bringing total HACC funding for this facility to $135,347. In addition to this, the nursing service will receive $1,120,975 in HACC funding to enable it to expand its vital work, allowing for an extra 20 hours per week of home respite care provided by visiting ""Blue Nurses. I applaud the minister for her actions in approving the grants for the Ipswich Blue Nurses. Sister Olive Smith has provided expertise to the Ipswich service as well as making a significant contribution to many community and government organisations operating in related areas. On a personal level, Sister Smith has given special dedicated support to a son with a disability and to the organisation Crossroads, a group established to support people with disabilities. Her dedication, loyalty and spirit of service to Blue Nursing Service patients and staff led .to her nomination in 1987 by the Rotary Club of Ipswich North for the pride of workmanship award. In 1993, Sister Smith was given further recognition in the Queen's Birthday honours when she received the Medal of the Order of Australia for service both to people with disabilities and to nursing. Sister Smith's spirit of service and high calibre of contribution to society over such an extensive period has a dual significance of outstanding merit in its own right and as a symbol of the. commencement of the Blue Nursing Service throughout Queensland. Sister Smith's retirement marks an historical moment in the delivery of health and caring services in the community in Queensland. It is a great honour for me to be able to be here to inform the House of the remarkable achievement of Sister Olive Smith. I wish her and her husband a long and happy retirement. Western Australian Police Force",102
125,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise on in- a happy note. In recent years the Western Australian police force, of which I was formerly a member, has received a fair amount of criticism. It is a general feature of discussion about law and order and law enforcement that police forces have received a路 fair number of brickbats; So it is a pleasure to be able to rise to offer some praise for the efforts of Western Australian police force officers. In particular, I want to mention Detective Sergeant Peter Coombs, a former colleague of mine, who went through the Western Ausin- tralian police academy with me in 1979. He was part of a team that broke the back of an Italian organised crime network with the conviction on Monday of Bruno 'The Fox' "". Romeo. "" Mr Romeo路 was named in a 1965 crime intelligence report as a South Australian leader of L'Onorata Societa, the Calabrian equivalent to the Sicilian mafia. Despite the report's findings, Mr Romeo has managed to elude authorities for almost 30 years, until a Western Australian detective took up the hunt and refused to let go. I am indebted also to the reports by Robyn Cash and Tamara Hunter from the West Australian newspaper. Robyn Cash has been a long time hound-to use a term-on the trail of the organised criminal elements within Western Australia and elsewhere. In fact, at one stage, she was involved in newspaper reporting in Griffith in New South Wales. I suppose if a person wanted to uncover organised criminal activity, particularly the drug trade, Griffith is not one .of the best places to do that. It probably provides plenty of material but, at the same time, it is probably dangerous-as Donald Mackay found out all those years ago. Detective Sergeant Coombs, who was seconded to the National Crime Authority, was in the District Court to see his quarry plead gUilty to cultivating cannabis and conspiracy charges. Mr Romeo will almost certainly spend his twilight years behind bars which, in the interests of the Australian community as well as the Western Australian community, is a good thing. The Crown Prosecutor, Mr Stone, told Judge Hal Jackson: This is a case of sophisticated, organised crime extending over four years and on a very large scale. He said that Romeo, an Adelaide businessman, had been a hands-on operator within the well-organised, Australia-wide crime syndi-cate which had plotted the cultivation of cannabis on two Western Australian sheep stations for sale on the eastern seaboard. He had financed the syndicate's operations, including the purchase by front men of two remote properties, KalIi station near Cue and Mount Elvire station near Southern Cross, on which three cannabis crops worth $8 million were grown and another worth much more was planned. Mr Romeo has been remanded in custody for sentencing on 31 May. He was the first man arrested in Operation Cerberus, which has been a national drive by the National Crime Authority against Italianinfluenced organised crime in Australia. That reference was given to the National Crime Authority on June 1992 as the details of Mr Romeo's activities were unfolding in a marathon drug trial in the Perth District Court. Ten men, allegedly co-conspirators of Romeo, are on trial for growing a string of cannabis crops on outback sheep and cattle stations in Western Australia. Mr Romeo was named as the ringleader, but the jury heard that he - had escaped arrest despite a national and international man-hunt. At the time, trial judge Robert Keall said: These offences have the chilling hallmarks of organised crime, transcending the boundaries of the State of Western Australia. As honourable members would know, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. That body too has received its fair share of criticism over the years and very little praise or plaudits for its work. I would like to pass on my congratulations to the aqthority's chairman, Mr Tom Sherman, and of course to those men and women who have been involved in Operation Cerberus, in particular, my former colleague, Western Australian police officer Detective Sergeant Peter Coombs.",103

127,Mr CONNOLLY,INFORMATION,"Mr Speaker, upon notice, on 23 Match 1994: Are modifications being made to the radio and television studios next to the National Media Liaison Service; if so, (a) what modifications, (b) why are they being made, (c) what is their cost, (d) who uses the studios and (e) which agency has day to day use of the studios and responsibility for booking them.",104
128,Mr SPEAKER,INFORMATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. An existing small television studio on the ground floor of Parliament House, adjacent to the Members Hall, is being refitted as a radio production control room and editing suite and a more workably sized television studio is being built alongside. (a) In respect of the enlarged television studio, the modifications are: the removal of some walls and carpet to form an enlarged television studio; - 'the removal of' the ceiling and installation of a lighting grid and acoustic treatment; the laying of hard-surface flooring suitable camera pedestals; and .. th- supply of additional ancillary. services including additional power and air conditioning. In relation to the conversion of the existing small television studio into a radio production c-ntrol room, themooifications are: . reinstallation of the ceiling; acoustic treatment to the walls; and a new raised floor platform for cabling. (b) A larger television studio is requiredto provide more effectively for the live and delayed television coverage of question time from both chambers which, although transmitted nationally by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is produced for the ABC by the .Sound and Vision Office. The improved studio will also enable senators, members, parliamentary committees' and ministers to record video material and to participate in two way television interviews or video conferences. The old television studio provided accommodation .for only one person with one fixed set. There was insufficient room within the studio to allow additional people, such as committee members, . committee' staff and .personal staff of senators, members and ministers,.to be present. The refurbished radio production control room and editing suite is required to house new audio equipment used to produce the edited question time which is replayed on the parliamentary broadcast radio network following the rising of the House being broadcast live,' (c) Design .................... $14,300.00 Construction ............... $91,561.00 Variationsduring construction .... $9,382.15 Total Project Cost at 29.3.93 - $115,243.15 (d) The studios are used presently by the Sound and Vision Office of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, with some very limited use by senators, members, ministers' and office holders. The enlarged television studio will allow greater use by senators, members, parliamentary committees, office holders and ministers. The studio will also be suitable for press conferences, video conferences or for hire by the electronic media. (e) The Sound and Vision Office of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff.

(2) Has his attention been drawn to an article entitled 'The ASIO enigma', by Mike Steketee and Deborah Cameron, which appeared in the Sydney Morning' Herald of 30 November 1991. (3) Further to statements made in the article referred to in part (2), is he able to say (a) who was the CSIRO scientist who called upon the Special Minister of State when the latter was the NSW Attorney-General, (b) whether the CSIRO made bombs for ASIO on several occasions, (c) whether ASIO had ordered two bombs from the CSIRO in the weeks preceding February 1978 and (d) whether ASIO's specifications for the bombs ordered required that a benign substance be substituted for some of the explosive in the detonator mechanisms so they were disarmed. (4) Has he or his predecessor queried the Special Minister for State concerning the statements referred to in part (1); if so, with what result; if why not. (5) Is the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security inquiring into a complaint against ASIO received on 20 August 1991 relating to the presence of ASIO agents within the Ananda Marga organisation contemporaneously with the Hilton bombing; if so, when will his report and findings be made available. (6) Are other inquiries or investigations concerning ASIO (a) being, conducted or (b) proposed to be conducted; if so, in each case, (i) what is the nature of the inquiry or investigation, (ii) who is conducting it and (iii) what are the terms of reference.",104
129,Mr LAVARCH,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA (1) If the statements referred to by the Honourable member are those appearing in the article referred to in (2) below, yes. (2) Yes. (3) (a) No. It is possible that the man's identity is known to a NSW authority-see my answer at (4) below. I have been advised by the Chief Executive of CSIRO, Dr John Stocker, that CSIRO does not know the name of any CSIRO scientist who might have called upon' the Minister for Administrative Services when he was the NSW Attorney-General in about 1980. (3) (b) (c) (d) I am further advised by Dr Stocker that CSIRO is not aware of any arrangement with ASIO to make bombs of any description or specification and that CSIRO is willing to c()operate with the police in any investigation of this matter. It is Dr Stocker's view, which I endorse that any evidence that CSIRO's facilities were used inappropriately should be referred to the pOlice. The Director-General of Security is not aware of ASIO having sought advice or assistance at any time from the CSIRO for the purpose of making bombs. (4) I have spoken to the Minister about the statements referred to in (1). The Minister's recollection of events some 14 years ago is as recounted in the newspaper article. (5) Yes. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is inquiring into a complaint relating to the knowledge of ASIO of events surrounding not, the Hilton bombing and the Yagoona incident, and its use of the information which it held. The Inspector-General is now preparing his draft report which, in accordance with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986, will be forwarded to the Director-General of Security for comment. Once ASIO's comments are received he will prepare his final report. (6) The Honourable member will be aware of the Prime Minister's announcement of an inquiry concerning ASIO but relating to matters other than the Hilton bombing. Also, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is investigating a number of complaints against ASIO. Details of these inquiries will be published in his annual report.

Views were received from Members of Parliament and other organisations, some in response to the information sent to them, but except where they took the form of a letter, no records were made. (2) The Department was asked to do this only for New South Wales in 1992-93.

(20) Is NATSIEA registered and approved as a fund under. the Superannuation Guarantee Act; if so, (a) what trust controls its funds and (b) who are the (i) trustees and (ii) underwriters. Mr Tickner..,-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A response to this letter was forwarded on 4 January 1994. (2) MCCHS is an incorporated body under the Co-operatives and Other Societies Act 1967 and as such is governed by its constitution and controlled by an elected board of directors. (3) Membership as stated in the Mackay Coloured Co-op (whose incorporation is under the Cooperatives and Other Societies Act 1967) amended rules and constitution is as follows: The qualifications for membership of the Society shall be as follows: ""any person who is an Aboriginalor an Islander or who,. is descended from an Aboriginal or an Islander or who is the spouse of an Aboriginal or Islander and who is a permanent resident in the Mackay area. A person is deemed to be resident in the Mackay area if he permanently resides within 50 miles of the Mackay Post Office. (No definite definition of ""Islander"". Could mean Torres Strait and/or South Sea) . 2. Applications for membership, shares and additional shares shall be lodged at the registered office in or to the effect of the prescribed form, with payment in full or unless otherwise approved. by the Board with a deposit of at least one tenth of the value of each share applied for. Every such value of each share shall be considered by the Board and if approved by it, the board shall allot the shares applied for and the applicants name路 together with the number of shares allotted, date of allotment and any other information required by regulation shall be entered in the register of members. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the allotment and of the entry in the register and he shall thereupon be entitled to the privileges of membership. 3. The board may at its discretion refuse any application for membership or share and need assign no reasons for such refusal. Upon refusal the applicants deposit shall be refunded without interest."" (4) No, my attention has not been specifically drawn to (a) expulsions from membership of the Co-op and (b) irregularities in the conduct of the Co-operative. The Mackay Coloured Co-operative Society is incorporated under the Queensland Cooperatives and Other Societies Act and the Queensland Treasury Department is the appropriate body to investigate such matters. (5) ATSIC has no jurisdiction or obligation to enforce the Mackay Coloured Co-op to operate under and observe the requirements of the Cooperative and Other Societies Act (1967) legislation.This is the exclusive responsibility of the Queensland State Registrar of Commercial Acts. (6) Please refer to Question 4 and Question 5. (7) MCCHS owns the building but it is secured by a mortgage to the Commission. (8) MCCHS, through ""its housing rental returns. (9) As at the 30th of November the diseharge balance on the loan was $219665.32. There is no tenancy agreement as MCCHS OWns the building. (10) The building was originally required to accommodate the following organisations: Mackay Coloured Co-op, Mackay Aboriginal and Islander Health Service, QED Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporatiori for Legal Aid Service. My advice from .ATSIC' is that the lease costs were rather high and that they were unhappy with some aspects of the tenancy situation. Currently, only the Mackay Coloured Co-op operates out of the building at 60 Victoria Street. At present, the QED Legal Service is under liquidation and no longer operates out of the premises. The Mackay Health Service now operates out of it own premises, located at 37 Milton Street in Mackay. Refer to Question 7. (11) Refer to Question 7 and Question 10. The health service was unhappy with the level of rent being paid and moved to other rental premises. Subsequently, it moved to its own building. (12) Refer to Question 2. MCCHS recently provided acquittal documentation for 1990/91 which had been outstanding. This has yet to be assessed. (13) No, ATSIC last funded MCCHS in 1990/91 for (1) Community Worker-$39,523, (2) Sports grant B.Darby-$2,OOO. These grants have not been acquitted in accordance with ATSIC's ""conditions of grant"". Acquittal of grants is being pursued, as explained in 12 above. No further funds have been provided to MCCHS. (14) This unpaid account for $972.67 is currently included in the list of debts of the QED Legal Service (QEDLS) which is in the hands of appointed QEDLS Liquidators, Mr Ivor Worrell of Worrell Whitehill Chartered Accountants, GPO Box 2228, Brisbane, Qld, 400 I. Funds have recently become available to pay outstanding QEDLS creditors, and these should be released to the Liquidators by the end of March 1994. Ampol should approach the liquidator for payment in the near future when the funds are released to Mr Worrell. (15) No. This account relates to the Mackay Aboriginal and Torres St-ait Islanders Corporation for Sport, an organisation which has disbanded and is now defunct. The creditor should seek legal advice on recovering the debt. (16) In January 1992, a group of people including Regional Councillor Irelandes convened a Mackay Community meeting which purportedly elected a new board to replace the existing ATSICrecognised board of the Mackay and District Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation for Legal Aid Service (MDLS). They then succeeded in influencing the Commonwealth Bank to freeze the Legal Service's bank account. They took similar action in respect of the Mackay Health Service and the Central Queensland Aboriginal Land Council, having the manager of the National Australia Bank suspend the accounts of these two organisations. The police were called but elected not to intervene. (17) No., Neither the Minister nor the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) control The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employer Association (NATSIEA). NATSIEA is an autonomous private organisation which was established with funding and assistance from the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) ,and ATSIC. The organisation continues to receive ;grant funding from ATSIC in accordance with ;usual procedures. (18) The main objectives of detailed in their Memorandum of Association are: to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employer organisations in all matters relating their obligations as employers to promote greater awareness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage general i-dustrial relations arena to assist member organisations in all relating to industrial relations and provide the general support and services as provided by other employer representative organisations. (19) (a) The Chairman is Mr Tony Irelandes. (b) The Directors are:路 Marlene Edith MCArthur, 2 Norman Albert Brown, James Arthur Morrison, 3 Ronald Wayne Allen, Thomas Slockee, Phillip James Del-la-cruz, MoogiPatu, Leslie Arthur Cook, Phillip Brian Cooper and Debra Ann Reid. (c) - The General Manager (referred to as Chief Executive Officer) is Mr Gary S Rolf. (d) The secretary of NATSIEA is Norman Albert Brown. (20) NATSIEA has established a superannuation fund named ""Freedom Super"" and is cited Freedom Super Co-ordinator in their promotional literature. The literature also Cites Jacques Martin Hewitt as the Fund Administrator. The fund is not registered or approved as a fund under the Superannuation Guarantee Act. (a) The trust that controls the funds is Freedom Super Pty Ltd. (b) (i) The trustees are directors of NATSIEA and one other. (ii) The underwriter who provides the risk (Death, Disability cover) is Citicorp. Community Grants (Question No. 722)",118

(c) Ms Clement was advised that her concerns had been referred to the Australian Statistician. Cable Television (Question No. 769) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 December 1993: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports Sydney Morning Herald and Australian for 15 December 1993 that the ABC has commenced discussions with the Packer-Murdoch-Telecom (PMT) consortium regarding the possibility of transmitting the ABC's services on the consortium's proposed cable distribution network. (2) What discussions or correspondence (a) has the ABC entered into or (b) wiHit enter into with (i) the PMT consortium, (ii) its representatives or (iii) any other person regarding the possibility of transmitting the ABC's services on the consortium's proposed cable distribution network. (3) Does the ABC propose to establish financial or other dealings with commercial television networks in Australia; if so, what dealings. (4) Will the ABC be required to avoid conflict, or the appearance of conflict, between its duties under its charter and any commercial interests or responsibilities which it incurs through agreements with commercial television networks; if so, how will conflict be (a) avoided and (b) resolved if it occurs. (5) Will the ABC enter into any agreements with the PMT consortium or commercial television networks in respect of the two C licence pay television channels granted to it. (6) Are there risks that the ABC's independence would be compromised by entering into arrangements with large commercial media organisations; if so, what is the nature and gravity of the risks. (7) Will he require the ABC to make public the nature and content of any agreement it enters into with the PMT consortium or commercial television networks; if so, (a) when and (b) through which channels will it be made public. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The ABC has advised that discussions on a continuing basis have occurred with a wide range of parties interested in the delivery of subscription television broadcast services in Australia. Those discussions have included substantial media companies based in Europe, the United States, Asia and Australia and encompass such groups as the consortium generally known as PMT. (3) The ABC has indicated that it proposes to seek independent finance for up to 49% of the dedicated financial interest in the company to be established for the delivery of Licence Csubscriptionbroadcast services. I understand the ABC is . continuing to explore options. (4) and (6) An important consideration for the Government .in reaching a decision on ABC participation in Pay TV was that any such participation should not adversely affect the ABC's in the achievement of its Charter responsibilities or impinge on the independence of the ABC. Accordingly, the terms of the Government's decision included that Pay TV activities be undertaken by the ABC on a fully commercial basis, and that there should be no detriment to the free-to-air services. These requirements have been reinforced through the legislative condition that the ABC establish a separate corporate structure to operate and manage its Pay TV activities. Arrangements include pro.vision for a transparent charging and accounting regime to further safeguard the ABC's free-to-air services. The ABC has indicated its acceptance that free-to-air services will be quarantined in an editorial, program and financial sense from any relatio)1ships with commercial partners in Pay TV. (5) Any commercial agreement in relation to Licence C will need to be consistent with licence conditions being developed by the Government. The ABC has indicated it is continuing to explore options in relation to the provision of satellite Pay TV services under Licence C. As ABC participation in Pay TV is on a fully commercial basis, primary responsibility for the extent and nature of ABC involvement rests with the ABC Board within the context of the regulatory framework. (7) The ABC has undertaken, within the confines of commercial obligations to financial partners in the delivery of subscription television broadcasting services, to make such arrangements public through comprehensive reporting and audit processes as required under the terms of authorisation from the Minister and in the normal course of parliamentary reporting and review mechanisms.

149,Mr WILLIS,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: All departmental purchases undertaken by the Treasury are recorded using appropriate accounting procedures. (a) The Department uses the Financial Efficiency Strategic Planning System (FINEST), as its financial management and accounts processing system to record all domestic purchases. Where it is necessary to purchase an item directly from an overseas supplier, the Department uses a form FA521 or a form OA2, which is processed through an overseas post. Details of overseas purchases are kept on a manual register. (b) All purchases made by the Department are recorded. (c) Records are accessible, both on-line and in report form, to auditors, departmental officers and other officials depending upon the access requirements that are deemed necessary for them to effi7 ciently carry out their duties.

Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable .. member's question is as follows: The Department of Communications and the Arts was formed as a result of administrative arrangements announced by the Prime Minister on 28 January 1994. It comprises components from the former Department of Transport and Communications and the former Department of Arts and 1994: Administrative Services. All purchases of goods and services are made in accordance with proper accounting procedures and all with directions issued. by the Secretary, Department . of Communications and the Arts for the communications related activities and the Secretary, Departwhat ment of Administrative Services for the cultural components of the Department.

(3) Were any other costs incurred in the exercise; if so, (a) for what items and (b) what was the cost in each case. Mr Lee-The Minister for Science and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) A 'self-sealer' envelope notice was sent to all operative diesel fuel claimants which gave advice of changes proposed by the Government. It was qualified at the time, by indicating that the proposed changes were subject to the passage of legislation. (a) Approximately 138 500 self-sealer notices containing the advice were distributed to claimants. (b) To all operative diesel fuel rebate claimants. (c) Under deferred delivery/area bundle arrangements through Australia Post lodged by Disk Deed Printing Technologies Pty Ltd, contracted by Customs to supply and print the self-sealer envelope notices. (d) Total cost for printing and mailing of the notice to claimants was $72 415. (e) An estimated 4-5 days.

(b) To operative diesel fuel claimants who have recently lodged claims for rebate and who will have lodged a claim within the 6 months period. (c) As an additional one page enclosure in claimants' payment advice notice printed and posted by Customs' contractor in the normal course of service delivery procedure.

151,Mr RUDDOCK,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 8 February 1994: (I) Did his Department undertake any procedures to inform its clients of a possible delay in the payment of benefits and allowances as a result of the Australia Day holiday falling on a Wednesday in some States; if so, (a) what procedures were undertaken and (b) were clients advised, (i) verbally, (ii) in writing or (iii) through media notices. (2) If no warning of a possible delay in payments was given, why not. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (a) Regional Offices and Teleservice Centres were advised. (b) Those clients affected were about two in ten of Newstart and Job Search Allowance recipients. Half of these could not lodge their fortnightly renewal form until the following day so their payment was delayed by one day. Funds for the other half of clients were in their bank accounts and accessible through Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs). Some of those clients would have faced a one day delay due to the closure of the banks. JSA/NSA clients are the group most often affected by such closures because their 'staggered' paydays fall on each working day. (i) Verbal advice was provided by Regional Offices and Teleservice Centres; this would usually have been in response to enquiries. (ii) In accordance with normal practice, Regional Offices put up posters stating the details of office closures. At Area or Regional discretion, some signs may have been displayed notifying the specific impact on affected clients. Most of the clients involved are required to personally lodge renewal forms each fortnight and would have been in a position to see such posters. While inserts have been included in the normal fortnightly mailing of renewal forms to this group at particular holiday times in the past, mailing of advices to other clients is generally not done because of the high cost of a special mailing and the confusion it is known to cause for some of them. (iii) Some local coverage may have resulted from Area/Regional media liaison. General media advertising is not considered appropriate in a situation like this where a relatively small number of one group of clients is affected. (2) See (1). The Department is reviewing the Processing Guidelines and, as part of the review, is paying special attention to possible measures to improve the notice to clients affected by national or local holidays, especially by standardising the inclusion of inserts for fortnightly mailings. This is the most targeted way of reaching those affected. In the meantime, where delays are likely to cause hardship, the Department's regional offices are sympathetic to requests for immediate payment made after the public holiday. Sentencing of Offenders in Western (Question No. 889) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 February 1994: (1) Has his attention been directed to Research Report No. 10 published on 8 November 1993 by the University of Western Australia Crime Research Centre concerning the Crime (Serious and Repeat Offenders) Sentencing Act 1992 (Western Australia). (2) Did the Whitlam Government secure the passage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 in order to override the provisions of Queensland legislation which were in breach of international conventions. (3) Has the Keating Government considered the introduction of legislation to override the provisions of the Western Australian Act which are in breach of international conventions; if so, on what occasions and with what result?",133
152,Mr LAVARCH,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am aware of the report. My Department is currently examining it. (2) Yes. (3) It is this Government's responsibility to ensure that our international obligations are properly met. Part of that responsibility involves consulting States and Territories before international conventions are concluded to ensure that all States and Territories have in place the necessary legislation or practices to allow us to conform to the treaty obligations. Accordingly, States and Territories should not find themselves in breach of international obligations. However, should路 a State or Territory enact legislation which plainly puts Australia in breach of its international obligations, it would be this Government's responsibility, to engage in a process of consultation with that State with a view to remedying that breach. In relation to the West Australian legislation, I understand that that State is reviewing the laws in question and it would be pre-emptive for the Commonwealth to act in such circumstances.

MrBEDDALL-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Australian Safeguards Office (ASO) does not keep a separate record of expenditure for this activity. ASO has however estimated the annual costs associated with administering the bilateral network of agreements and administrative arrangements set up to monitor the flow of Australian obligated nuclear material in the international nuclear fuel cycle at about $280,000 (in 1993-94 dollars).

(1) Was Dr Greg Woods, QC, given a consultanc::yor contract by the Minister or the Minister's Depat:tment in 1987 to visit Fiji as an observer; if so, (a) what was_his role, (b) what sum was he paid, (c) how long did the consultancy last, (d) who recommended him for the role, (e) what were his relevant qualifications and (f) who (i) approved and (ii) had input into his appointment. Mr BilneyThe Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: There is, on the basis of an examination of the consultancy and contract records of DFAT, AIDAB and DAS; no record of ,the engagement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs or his Department of Dr Greg Woods; QC on contract or. as a consultant in 1987 (or at any other time), nor of any payments to him by DFAT/AIDAB. Sheep Breeding Companies: Taxation Arrangements (Question No. 917) Mr Andrews asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 February 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article entitled ""Superior sheep project fails"" Times of 2 February 1994. (2) Have the taxation arrangements of (a) Embryo Technology (Australia) Pty Ltd, (b) International Breeding Technology Services Pty Ltd, (c) the Hay Rural Partnership, (d) Australian Rambouillet Sheep Breeding Company Pty Ltd or (e) Rambouillet Nucleus Company Pty Ltd been investigated or audited by the Australian Taxation Office.",137
156,Mr GEAR,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that due to the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act he is unable to say whether the taxation arrangements of the listed entities been investigated or audited. Mature Age Allowance (Question No. 924) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice,on 22 February 1994: (1) Is it a fact that persons who receive sickness benefits but have been unemployed for more than 12 months and are 60 years of age ()r older will not be eligiJ)le for Mature Age Allowance. (2) How many persons receiving sickness benefits may be eligible for the Mature Age Allowance. (3) Has his Department expreSsed conc-rns to him over the introduction of the Mature Age Allowance in relation to applicants receiving sickness benefits. . MrBaldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Persons' who are aged 60 and over and who have been in receipt of SicknessAIIowance or some other payment for more than 12 months may qualify for Mature Age Allowimce. The normal requirement that a person must have been registered at the CES for the 12 months immediately prior to the claim for Mature Age Allowance can be waived under the legislation at the discretion of the tary, where the failure to register is beyond the person's control. In exercising this discretion; a relevant factor could be that the registration with the CES has lapsed due to illness. For example, where a person was registered as unemployed at the CES 13 months ago but transferred to Sickness Allowance 12 months ago, the person may be able to qualify for Mature Age Allowance. (2) There are 311 clients currently receiving Sickness Allowance who may be eligible for in the Weekly Mature Age Allowance. (3) No. United Nations Specialised Agencies (Question No. 925) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Eoreign Affairs, upon notice, on 23 February 1994: (1) Was Austtaliain arrears in its contributions to the, Food and Agriculture Organisation at any time during the period when Australia was campaigning for the position of Director-General.

Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs.has provided the following answer to the - onourable member's question: (1) Australia's asseSsed contribution to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) for each calendar year is paid on 1 July of that year. Australia was not in arrears during the period' when Australia was campaigning for the position of Director-General. "" (2) Australia has not been in arrears for'the Food and Agriculture Organisation' (FAO), th- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT);' the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/GATT (lTC), the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (lFAD), the International Labour , Organisation (lLO), the International Maritime Organisation (lMO), the International Monetary Fund (lMF), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, (UNESCO), the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV), the Universal Postal Union (UPU), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the World InteIlectual Property Organisation (WIPO), and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), In 1993, exchange rate variations resulted in a shortfaIl in Australia's Secrecontribution for the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) of approximately $295,000 which has not been made up in the 1994 contribution. Road Accidents: Fatalities (Question No. 926) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 February 1994: Is there a discrepancy between the statistics provided in Table 2.11 on page 28 of Report CR 105 of the Federal Office of Road Safety entitled Fatal Crash Types-Analysis of 1988 Fatality File, dated March 1992, and those provided in the answer to Question No. 2053 (Hansard, 17 December 1992, page 4277); if so, why.",138
157,Mr BRERETON,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to' the honourable member's question is follows: Two different methods of defining the cause of death are used in the Federal Office of Road Safety CR Report 105 (table 2.11) and the answer to Question No. 2053. The methods used to define the cause of death in the answer to Question No. 2053 were more highly developed than those used for the preparation of the earlier CR Report 105. CR Report 105 used the judgments made by coroners who investigated fatal crashes. The answer to Question No. 2053 used the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) to define the cause of death. The latter method is now being used by researchers internationally to obtain a more accurate and consistent assessment of the particular injury which caused death. Injuries classified as ""severe"", ""critical"" or ""maximum"" have been given as the cause of death where no other injuries of similar severity have been suffered. Coroners tend to attribute deaths to multiple injuries. Two consequences of using the new method are that not all cases can be coded (autopsy reports available in some instances); and a lower proportion of 1988 deaths were ascribed to head injury. Official Establishments: The Lodge (Question No. 929)",139
158,Mr CONNOLLY,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 23 February 1994: Has the Official Establishments section of his Department commissioned a report from Australian Construction Services on possible works upgrades for the Lodge; if so, (a) what works are under consideration, (b) what is the estimated cost of the works and (c) when will they commence.",139
159,Mr KEATING,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. Consideration is currently being given to works involving resurfacing of The Lodge driveway but proposals have not yet been finalised and it is not possible to give an estimated cost nor a commencement date at this stage. DAS: References to Christmas (Question No. 930),139
160,Mr CONNOLLY,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"the Minister for Ad. ministrative Services, upon notice, on 23 February 1994: Does the Minister's Department follow a procedure of not including, or has it issued any instructions to remove or not include, references to Christmas from departmental and Government material including Christmas cards, ceremonies such as the interment of the Unknown Soldier or other situations; if so,what procedure or instructions.",139
161,Mr WALKER,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Home Equity Conversion Scheme (Question No. 934) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 24 February 1994: Is it a fact that under the Home Equity Conversion Scheme both partners of a married couple must satisfy the pension and age criteria; if so, why is it not sufficient for the partner who is the sole owner of the residence to satisfy the criteria. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Both partners of a married couple must be pensioners and be aged at least 60 in order to be not eligible for a Home Equity Conversion Loan. These requirements are in place to protect the interests of pensioner clients while maintaining the commercial viability of the scheme. Under the scheme, a loan does not become recoverable until the surviving partner of a couple dies or vacates the home for 12 months. In addition, a minimum' residual equity of $20,000, indexed according to movements in the CPI, is preserved in the home. In order for these provisions to be met in a commercially viable way, having regard to actuarial considerations, both the value of a property and the age of the borrower are of prime importance. If a Home Equity Conversion Loan was made to a couple and one member of the couple was aged under 60, there is a substantial risk that the balance of the loan could approach or exceed the value of the property by the time the younger member of the couple died. To protect against this, it is necessary for both partners of a married couple to satisfy the age criteria of 60 years. Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council (Question No. 935) Mr ,Tim路 Fischer asked the. Minister for Housing路 and Regional Development, upon notice, on 24 February 1994: How many Ministers have been appointed to the Albury-Wc:xlonga Ministeri!ll Council by the (a) Commonwealth, (b) New'South Wales and (c) Victorian Governments since the Council's incep"" tion ..",139

Universities: Number of Bankruptcies (Question No. 962) Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 2 March 1994: (1) Is it a fact that a number of universities will become bankrupt; if so, what action will the Government take to prevent this happening. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) There is no evidence that any publicly funded university is in danger of becoming bankrupt. (b) No action needs to be路 taken to prevent institutions becoming bankrupt. Total Commonwealth funding to the university sector in 路1994 is $4.9 billion. Recurrent resources are allocated on a rolling triennium basis with allocations known three years in advance.

(2) Who will determine whether the level of training given or achieved by the Department of Social Security staff meets standards set by his Department in other areas of Australia. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Financial Infrastructure Partnership is a mechanism for coordinating Commonwealth and State support from existing programs for the establishment of credit unions in rural and remote areas from which banks have withdrawn. The term ""partnership"" should be read figuratively not literally. There are no legal obligations imposed on any of the parties. involved. The FIP seeks the cooperation of the parties only. Within the Partnership the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) will be responsible for the range of programs it now administers. The Partnership entails no additional responsibilities. The only training requirements arising from the Partnership are those associated with training the staff of newly established credit unions. This does not involve DSS staff and no training will be provided to them by DEET. (2) See (1) above. Ministers' Homes: Security Systems (Question No. 977)",144

Telecommuting (Question No. 984) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: (1) Has the Government assessed the potential impact of telecommuting on urban and regional development in Australia, particularly in reduced costs to all levels of government for a range of functions, especially transport. (2) Is the Governm-nt considering measures to assist the growth of telecommuting in the public and private sector.",145
180,Mr HOWE,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:' (1) The Department has commissioned a research study on the relationship between urban development and technological change which will include consideration of the existing and possible impact of telecommuting on urban and regional development. The study, entitled ""Technological Innovation and Urban Form"", is being carried out by Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd, whose final report is expected later this year. Other government agencies that might have an interest in conducting research on this topic are the Department of Industry Science and Technology, the Department of Industrial Relations and the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. (2) The Government will examine the report carefully and consider appropriate action, which may include subsequent actions to explore the growth of telecommuting. Local Government (Question No. 985) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: (1) Has the Government produced an estimate of the costs which could be removed from the business sector nationally if the performance of the development approvals system in local government was raised to best practice standards; if so, (a) what potential savings have been identified and (b) how were they calculated. (2) Will the Government introduce competition policy into local government through benchmarking standards and promoting best practice; if so, what administrative means will it use.",146
181,Mr HOWE,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In 1989 the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs commissioned a study to provide an overview of Australia's systems for the regulation of land and building development. The study was entitled ""Local Government Regulation of Land and Building Development"". The study identified potential savings of $1 billion per annum to the development and building industry should substantial improvements be made to councils' development and building procedures. This figure was reached after examining the total direct and indirect cost of the approval,s process to developers and estimating the cost of delays in the approval process etc. The study identified the following potential areas of savings to the industry: (a) Reduced delays associated with approvals processes. The Report estimates that some $3SOm$4S0m could be saved per annum; (b) Modifications and improvements to approvals process. Some $300m-$400m savings per annum could be made if the approvals time could be reduced by an average of 20%; (c) Regulation reform, best practice in residential controls and a comprehensive approach to development. It has been estimated that this could lead to savings of $ IOOm-$ IsOm per annum. (2) The Government is working with Local Government and the States to encourage and assist in micro-economic reform in local government. It is doing this principally through: (a) The National Awards for Innovation in Local Government (b) The Local Government Development Program (c) The Integrated Local Area Planning Program (d) The Local Approvals Review Program All these programs are essentially concerned with the promotion of best practices and the adoption of more efficient and effective processes in local government. . In addition, as part of the review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 a discussion paper released on 4 February has foreshadowed as an option the possibility of using benchmarking techniques to allocate part of the general purpose grants to councils. Comments <?n this. paper have been called for by 15 AprIl. Following. receipt of comments the Government will make a deCision on this and other options that have been put forward. Transport Infrastructure (Question No. 991) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: Has the Government undertaken a strategic assessment of the importance of transport infrastructure to Australia's international competitiveness particularly with respect to (a) the importance of transport relative to the determinants of competitiveness, (b) the relative importance of rail, road, sea and air modes of transport and (c) strengths and weaknesses in Australia's transport system; if so, (i) when was the latest assessment made, (ii) what means were employed to make the assessment, (iii) what was the outcome of the assessment, (iv) how has it influenced Government transport and fiscal policies and (v) what findings did it reach regarding (A) Australia's unique trading position as an island continent and (B) the importance of transport infrastructure.",146
182,Mr BRERETON,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is'as follows: These matters are being considered as part of the deliberations of the National Transport Planning Taskforce, which was set up in 1993 to examine the adequacy of both transport infrastructure and operational systems to meet Australia's future transport needs.

Coal: Sales to Japan (Question No. 993) Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: Will the Government enter negotiations with Japan on coal sales. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Budget Deficit (Question No. 996) Mr Cadman asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: Will the Government consider increases in revenue to achieve a reduced deficit in the 1994-95 Budget.",147
183,Mr WILLIS,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I refer the honourable member to the 1994-95 Fiscal Framework document released on 1 March 1994. In that document I noted that 'The introduction of a jobs levy, involving a temporary addition to income tax whilst the long term unemployment problem is so acute, has been suggested as a means of accommodating the increased expenditure pressure without prejudicing the deficit reduction program. Whilst the Government has not rejected the suggestion it would prefer to meet its objectives without having to introduce such a measure.' Council of Australian Governments (Question No. 998) Mr Cadman asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: Did the Council of Australian Governments at its February 1994 meeting announce a water resources policy; if so, what (a) are the benefits of the policy to the States, the federal Government and all Australians, (b) community consultation will occur on its implementation and (c) financial resources will be required to facilitate the structural adjustment and asset refurbishment which will be necessary as part of the policy and how will they be provided. MrKeating-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Council of Australian Governments, at its meeting on 25 February 1994, endorsed a strategic framework for the路 efficient and sustainable reform of the Australian water industry and agreed to its implementation. (a) Once implemented the strategic framework will benefit the States and Territories by more clearly delineating responsibilities for resource management, regulatory oversight and service delivery within the water industry, reducing financial pressures on budgets and ensuring that future water investment is subject to stringent econ,omic and ecological tests. Because the Commonwealth does not have any major direct responsibility for the water industry there are limited benefits flowing to it from the reform package. To the extent that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission does, however, become self-financing in terms of the costs associated with future maintenance, refurbishment and/or upgrading of the headworks and other structures under its control there will be a lessening in demands on the Commonwealth Budget. For the nation as a whole the framework is intended to: change prIcing arrangements in situations where some classes of water service consumers currently pay more for their services than they need to; achieve more effective water resource utilisation, including switching water to higher value uses, for example, from broad-acre agriculture to horticulture, with a consequential favourable impact on national income, result in better water service delivery; and improve environmental outcomes in terms of less natural resource degradation and reduced salinity. (b) The Council has agreed that where change and/or new initiatives are contemplated involving water resources by government agencies and service deliverers that public consultation will be embarked upon. The Council also agreed that where public consultation processes are not already in train in relation to water pricing, water allocations and trade in water these will be instituted. (c) At this stage no .firm estimate can be placed on the cost of structural adjustment and asset refurbishment that will result from the water reform framework endorsed by the Council. Council of Australian Governments (Question No. 999) Mr Cadman asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: Did the Council of Australian Governments at its February 1994 meeting propose gas industry reforms; if so, (a) what are the benefits of the reforms to the States, the federal Government and all Australians and (b) who will be responsible for administering the reforms.",147
184,Mr KEATING,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Council of Australian Governments did propose gas industry reforms at its February 1994 meeting as set out in the Communique issued following the meeting. (a) Questions regarding specific benefits to the States are best put to the individual States. However, the States will also share from the benefits that will accrue to the national economy and to consumers from the Council's decisions. The - nefits of such reform include: consumers and producers in any State or Territory to buy or sell in any other State or Territory on normal commercial terms; leading to the best possible use of Australia's gas resources and the lowest possible prices for gas consumers; stimulating the gas industry by' increasing the market area into which gas can be sold and facilitating exploration and development of production, transmission and distribution facilities. The Industry Commission has estimated that the effects of productivity improvements in natural gas distribution alone would lead to an increase in real GDP of $1.5 billion (in 1989-90 prices) overldO year period, a nine per cent fall in gas prices and a two per cent per annum increase in industry output. (b) Heads of Government asked the COAG Working Group on Gas Reform to report, by the next Heads of Government meeting, on' the implementation details necessary to achieve free and fair trade in natural gas by I July 1996. Heads of Government also noted that the question of access to esSential facilities. was also being considered in the context of the Hilmer Report on National Competition Policy and that any legislation arising from decisions in this context would be able to cover gas pipelines. Council of Australian Governments (Question No. 1000) Mr Cadman asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: Did the Council of Australian Governments at its February 1994 meeting consider reform of' the electricity industry; if so, what are the benefits and cost effectiveness which will'be achieved for the States, the federal Government and all Australians through the reform.",148
185,Mr KEATING,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: At their meeting on 25 February 1994, Heads of Government noted the significant progress made since their commitment at the June 1993 Council of Australian Governments meeting to introducing a competitive electricity market from I July 1995, including progress in structural separation in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, and the Snowy Mountains Scheme corporatisation. The Council agreed to a uniform regulatory framework for the electricity industry, and supported the principles of a uniform, cost-reflective approach to network pricing and of vesting contracts to manage the financial impacts of transition to a competitive market, with the aim of completing the transition process by no later than 1 July 1999. Heads of Government also agreed to confirm allowing gas their commitment to the concept of inter-jurisdictional merit order dispatch in eastern and southern Australia while ensuring that each jurisdiction is . provided with an agreed level of system reliability. The Council asked the National Grid Management Council (NGMC) to provide further reports to Heads of Government in advance of its next meeting on a number of key路 matters including franchise customer thresholds, grid pricing mechanisms, and progress towards uniform pool arrangements and any refinements necessary to market trading arrangements in light of the NGMC market trial which commenced in November 1993 and involves participants in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. Thebeilefits of electricity reform were identified in a report released by the Industry Commission in 1991. It was found that annual gains of around $2.25 billion could flow from the introduction of t>etter production practices and the elimination of cross. subsidies. Significant progress in achieving this level of benefits has already been attained by the industry over the commercialisation phase of reform. For example in the five years to 1991-92 there was a 60 per cent increase in labour productivity and a faJl in the real price of electricity of about six per cent. Both the Industry Commission and overseas experience, however, indicate that further benefits in the form of further price reductions to consumers and industry can be achieved from the dynamic effects of introducing competition which Heads of Government have supported. CountryUnk Program (Question No. 1005) Mr Truss asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 22 March 1994: Did the Government recently distribute a package of information to country-dwelling Australians advertising the CountryIink Program; if so, (a) how many copies of the package were distributed, (b) to whom were they distributed, (c) was the package distributed in provincial cities and (d) what was the total cost of the mail-out. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Government is in the process of distributing an information package to country-dwelling Australians as part of a campaign to promote awareness of the Country link Program. (a) the number of packages sent as at 6 April 1994 during the 1993/94 financial year was 586,534. (b) the packages were sent to households in nonmetropolitan areas. (c) Yes, the package was distributed in provincial cities. (d) the total cost of the mail-out as at 30 March 1994 for the 1993/94 financial year was $94,331.80. CDEP Participants: Consensus (Question No. 1007)",148
186,Mr NUGENT,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 22 March. 1994: (1) Did the report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) for 1992-93 Claim that a national census of participants in Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) would be completed by January 1994. (2) Was the census completed by January 1994; if not, when was it or will it be completed. (3) If the census has been completed, (a) what percentage of participants were not receiving social security benefits they were entitled to, (b) was there a particular benefit that was commonly not claimed, (c) what action has been taken to ensure all entitlements are claimed, (d) what overall level of 'double dipping' by census participants was recorded and . (e) what action is being taken to prevent 'double dipping'. (4) Will the results of the census be publicly available; if so, when. (5) Has the trial of an automated system for managing CDEP participant data been completed; if not, why not; if so, what were the results. Mr Tickner-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (1) The annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) for 1992-93 stated that 'the census is running according to schedule and is expected to be completed by January 1994.' (2) The national census of participants in the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) was completed in January 1994. The CDEP Administration Section is currently analysing and reconciling the results with the CDEP Partici' pants Schedule data base. It is expected that the reconciliation will be completed by 30 June 1994. (3) (a) The analysis of the census data to date shows that the percentage of participants who were not receiving social security benefits to which they were entitled to was approximately 12%. (b) Yes. Analysis of the census data to date shows that the Department of Social Security Health Care Card was the most commonly unclaimed benefit. (c) The matter of unclaimed DSS benefits has been referred to the Department of Social Security for action. Where a DSS Officer was present at the census remedial action was initiated at that time. (d) The analysis and reconciliation of the census data to date for those participants interviewed indicates that the percentage of participants involved in double dipping was approximately 12%. (e) New participants must provide proof of identity before they are entered on to the schedule and complete a New CDEP Participant Certificate. The certificate includes a DSS Liaison Advice Form which is forwarded to DSS to alert that department that the individual has joined CDEP and any Job Search or New-start benefit should be terminated. (4) National census data results will be available on the 30 June 1994. (5) As of July 1993, participant details are entered onto a National CDEP Participant data base and amended each quarter. The system has been designed to allow tracking of participants between CDEPs to prevent duplications. The data base has been modified to correct problems identified in the early 'trial' stage and is currently managed in Central Office. Additionally, action is being taken to provide all Regional Offic- with an automated system using EXCEL that will enable faster and more accurate checking of Participant Schedules. Where feasible this system will also be provided to CDEP communities. The existing capacity of the National Participant data base is currently being improved so that it can export data to EXCEL and through EXCEL by electronic mail between Central and Regional Offices. If this can be achieved delays and duplication of effort at Regional Office and Central Office level will no longer occur.

188,Dr LAWRENCE,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes, the Prime Minister did make such an announcement-in light of the Government's wish to make use of all available health care resources. The Prime Minister's commitment was confirmed by Cabinet in November 1993. After consultation with State Health authorities, from December 1993 to February 1994 the Department wrote to private hospitals and day surgery centres in all States and Territories seeking proposals for the treatment of patients on public hospital waiting lists in specialties and regions where there are long waits for elective surgery. Proposals have been received from private hospitals in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. Selection of private hospitals to treat public patients under this program is currently being considered jointly with health authorities in those States. As further information is required from most hospitals before decisions can be made, it is likely to be late May before an outcome is known. Medicare: Casemix Development Program (Question No. 1012) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 23 March 1994: (1) Did the Government enter into a 1993-98 Medicare agreement with each State which includthe ed implementation of the Casemix Development Program; if so, what progress and plans have been made to implement the program. (2) Is the Minister able to say what benefits the casemix approach has brought to the public hospital system in Victoria.",151
189,Dr LAWRENCE,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Commonwealth Casemix Development Program (CDP) aims to provide the health care industry with a nationally consistent method of classifying all types of patients, their treatment and associated costs for the purposes of appropriately measuring and. paying for health care services. In 1993-94 progress has been made in the following major areas: release of the Australian National Diagnosis Related Groups (AN-DRGs) Version 2 classification system; finalisation of national cost weights based on six months data which correspond to AN-DRG1; finalisation of national cost weights based on 12 months data which correspond to AN-DRG2; work on the development of AN-DRG3; commencement of four national service weight studies in the areas of critical care, theatre, radiology and pathology; and development of the National Casemix Education Series. A Strategic Plan for the five year period 94-1997-98 has been developed to guide the further implementation of the CDP. The Plan was developed by the Casemix Implementation Project Board following widespread consultation; it has been endorsed by the Australian Health MinisterS' Advisory Council. It builds on the work that the CDP completed during the period 1988/891992/93 in building a national casemix infrastructure. Three priority areas have been identified for .on-going work: classification, costing-pricing, and payments. Supporting activities in the areas of quality of care, education and training, and information technology will continue. (2) The Victorian Government introduced casemix-based funding for acute inpatient treatment in public hospitals from I July 1993. Public hospitals are now funded by a mixture of grants and casepayments. This latter method of payment was introduced at the same time as hospital budget cuts. To date, a definitive study of the Victorian casemix approach has yet to be undertaken. The Commonwealth, however, is committed to the efficiencies that casemix promotes and as such broadly supports the Victorian reforms. In order to establish what have been the outcomes of case payment in Victoria, the Commonwealth has called for tenders to conduct an independent as.sessment of the implementation of casemix in that State. The three main areas that will be considered are: the Victorian policy, the implementation of the Victorian policy, and its impact. The project is expected to start in April 1994, with a final report scheduled to be submitted at the end of October 1994. Private Hospital Beds (Question No. 1013) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health,upon notice, on 23 March 1994: Has the Minister's Department made an assessment for each health region or area health service in Australia of the availability of surplus private hospital beds compared to public hospital waiting lists; if so, what did the assessment show.",151
190,Dr LAWRENCE,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department has not undertaken a formal assessment of health regions to ascertain the availability of private hospital beds. However, Australian Bureau of Statistics publication, '1991areas. 92 Private Hospitals Australia' (issued September 1993) cites an average occupancy rate of 64.4 .. percent. Occupancy rates in the States vary from 58.2 percent in Western Australia to 68.6 percent 1993- in South Australia and the Northern Territory (combined). (Table 3) Private hospitals which are located in geographical areas with significant public patient waiting lists and which are able to undertake relevant procedures generally have higher occupancy rates and are unable to undertake significant additional work. Health Funding (Question No. 1014) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 23 March 1994: (1) Has the Minister's Department made an assessment for each health region or area health service in Australia of imbalances between population shares and the share of public health resources allocated to that region or service; if so what are the worse imbalances in each State. (2) Were matters of regional health funding inequity considered during negotiations for the 1993-98 Medicare Agreement with each State.",152
191,Dr LAWRENCE,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department has not undertaken such a study, rather, as part of the Incentives Package (Schedule E) under the Medicare Agreements, the Commonwealth is funding a number of the States to undertake demonstration projects that tackle this issue. For example, in Western Alistralia, a project is . being funded to develop a resource allocation method that takes into account the unique geography and population distribution in that State. The project aims to improve the assessment of the health needs of specific groups in a given area, and to match a cost-effective mix of health services to these local needs. This is one of the stated aims of Medicare's Area Health Management. program. Other States are also undertaking projects with these objectives. The Department has been aware for some time of an imbalance between urban and rural areas in terms of expenditure through Medicare: Clearly this does not include an assessment of State health resources directed to country areas. In the 1992-93 Budget, the Rural Incentives Program was announced as part of tIle General Practice Strategy with funding of around $15m per annum the to attract and retain medical practitioners in rural As part of this Program the Department has been working collaboratively with the States and the Northern Territory to identify up to 50 places across Australia where an annual grant of around . $50,000 would make a difference in the recruitment and retention of general practitioners. (2) Yes, the Commonwealth under Schedule E of the Medicare Agree,tTients proposed to commit funds to several incentive programs to promote structural and micro-economic reform in the hospital system. Specificlilly, the Area Health Management program promotes the development of resource allocation' methods that focus on population-based health planning, Aged Pensioners (Question No. 1017)",152
192,Mr RUDDOCK,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 23 March 19-)4: (1) What is the annual volume. of outward correspondence from his Department to its clients. (2) Did recent correspondence from his Department to age pensioners contain a threat in the terms ""if you don't send it back (within 14 days), we might stop' your Australian pension""; if so, did he approve the form of the letter and its content. (3) Has his attention been drawn to anxiety and confusion created in the community, particularly among elderly citizens, by the number of inquiries from his Department. (4) Will he review the quantity and quality of outward correspondence from his Department. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In 1993 my Department sent in the vicinity of 70 miJlion pieces of correspondence to its clients, excluding cheques. (2) In the case of the recent correspondence to which you refer, letters' were sent to selected pensioners which invited them to test their pension entitlement' in their country of birth. These letters did contain the wording indicated. I did not approve the wording of the letter. I have since approved a change to the reminder notices that are to be iSsued to about 20,000 pensioners who did not reply to the initial correspondence. (3) I have been made aware that some elderly citizens are concerned by the number of inquiries they receive; I recently arranged a consultative meeting between officers of my Department and the Australian Council on the Ageing (ACOTA) and the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation (APSF) about the way in which my Department ,communicates with the aged. Several issues raised by ACOTA and APSF relatirig to the language, style and tone of correspondence sent to age pensioners are currently being examined by my Department and I expect that there will be further improvements. Recently, the Department trialled advising pensioners of the CPI increases through Age Pension News rather than .individualised letters. Our initial assessment of reaction to this change is that most pensioners see this as a positive step. (4) lam aware that there is scope to improve the quality of letters sent to my Department's clients and also to reduce the volume of letters which are sent out. The Department has initiated a ""review of clientadvices"" which is examining all types of outward correspondence. In addition, I am aware that with elderly pensioners in particular, it is important to be as clear as possible in correspondence, so as not to cause concerti. Departmental Purchasing: 1992-93 (Question Nos 1021-40) !\1rProsser asked all portfolio ministers, upon notice,' on 23 March 1994: (1) What, sum did the Minister's Department spend in 1992-93 on purchasing goods and merchandising for Departmental use, including furniture,' motor vehicles, stationery and office equipment. (2) Does the Minister's Department record whether goods and services are purchased from Australian manufacturers and suppliers; if so, what percentage are made in Australia; if not, why not.",153
193,Mr KEATING,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"I provide the following answer, on behalf of all portfolio ministers, to the honourable member's question: (1)-(2) As I said in my answer to the honourable member's question numbers 639-657, information .in respect of the matters referred. to is not readily available. To collect and assemble it would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of money. and effort involved in assembling such information. Departmental Purchasing: 1992-93 (Question No. 1041)  notice, on 23 March 1994: . . Further to ,the answer to questions Nos. 639-657 (Hansard, 13 December 1993, page 3901), which he provided on behalf of all Ministers and in which he stated that information relating to Government purchasing was not readily available and that he would not authorise the assembling of the information, do all Departments record alI their purchases on computer management systems; if so, (I) are the details made available to departmental officerS and the Australian National Audit Office, (b) why did he say that material was not available and (c) why does he refuse to authorise its release.",153
194,Mr KEATING,BYASC ETC TRAVELLING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (al See Minister's answers to questions 836-855 of 1 February 1994. (b)-(c) Agencies are not required to enter on their purchase recording systems where items are manufactured, whether they were purchased from Australian suppliers or to distinguish between goods/merchandise and services. The gathering of this information would, at the very least, examination of each invoice and/or relevant supporting documentation. Growth in Gross Domestic Employment: Result on Unemployment (Question No. 1067) Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 24 March 1994: (l) What will the 5 per cent growth in gross domestic product mean for the (a) short term and (b) long term unemployed. . Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The forecast of 5 per cent growth in real gross domestic product for the 1994 calendar year was made by Westpac Bank and is not the official Government forecast. That said, the Australian economy is currently growing at a rate sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate. In the recovery, short term unemployed people are likely to find it easier tdgain employment than long term unemployed people. The long term unemployed face greater difficulty finding employment for a number of reasons. They suffer a loss of skills and, in some cases, a loss of motivation. They may also be less attractive to employers as a result of their length of unemployment. For these reasons, long term unemployed pec;>ple need assistance to compete on an equal footing with those who have been unemployed for shorter periods. A Job Compact, as propoSed by .the Committee on Employment Opportunities, would enhance the prospects of individuals ing the attractiveness to potential employers and reducing the 'stigma' of being long term unemployed; (b) restoring skill levels; and (c) improving self-esteem and job-search motivation. Improving the attachment of the long term unemployed to the labour force would not only benefit the individuals concerned but also produce flow-on benefits to the require an economy and the community as a whole. The Committee on Employment Opportunities projected the unemployment rate under a 43/4 per cent economic growth scenario. Under this scenario, the unemployment rate was projected to be around 5 per cent in 2000-01. The number of long term. unemployed could be expected to decline substantially if economic growth at around 5 per cent per annum was to be maintained. This decline would be greatly accelerated by the impact of the Job Compact. . World Constitution and Parliament Association (Question No. 1069) Mr Beale asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 1994: (1) Have any approaches been made to the Australian Government by an organisation known as the World Constitution and Parliament Association (WCPA) since 1984; if so, (a) what were the approaches, (b) when Were they made and (c) how did the Government respo!,!d. (2) Has the Australian Government initiated any contact with the WCPA; if so, what are the details. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following as'Ver to the honourable member's question: (I) Following inquiries within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Departments, I am unaware of any approaches made to the Government by the WCPA either before or> after 1984. > (2) The Government has not initiated any contact by: (a) increasWith the WCPA.",153
