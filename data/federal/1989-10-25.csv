It has not been a considered attack in the context of making a qualitative difference to the debate or indeed in trying to ameliorate the conditions in which Aboriginal people live. In fact, it has been quite the been an exercise in head kicking and character assassination. It has been an exercise in trying to undermine every program which this Government has put in place for Aboriginal people. Mr Hand-And the programs they have put in place.",106
1,Mr SNOWDON,ZZZZZ,"Indeed, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has said, programs they have put in place. I will come to one of those mentioned in the Opposition's document in just a moment. I raise this matter in the context not only of the document but also of the importance of that expenditure to regional economies in Australia and, in particular, in this instance, to the Northern Territory. It is no secret now that the Opposition's strategy, through this Economic Action Plan document, is to kick the needy. It has decided, through its wisdom, that it will go for invalid pensioners, supporting mothers and Aboriginal people. In that contextMr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to a point of order. From my observation of the Notice Paper, this piece of legislation is entitled the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1989 and relates to the issue of the provision of funds to the States. I draw your attention to the fact that the honourable member for the Northern Territory is not speaking in a manner which bears any relationship to the Bill. Mr Hand-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I note that the honourable member for Mayo took a point of order as soon as you took the chair. The person who occupied the chair before you would no doubt be able to tell you that the honourable member for Mayo-Mr Downer-This is a frivolous point of order.",106
2,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,Mr Mountford)-Order! The honourable member for Mayo will resume his seat. He has made his point. Mr Hand-The point I am making is that the debate thus far has ranged across the issues that are being raised by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Mayo constantly used that portfolio area as a reference in the opposite. It has general debate. Mr Downer-As a result of your continued and irrelevant objection-MONICA,106
3,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"Order! I am trying to consider the point of order the honourable member has raised. Mr Downer-May I submit that I might be able to assist you with your consideration, Mr Deputy Speaker?",106
4,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,The honourable member for Mayo has made his point. The Chair is placed in the position of having just come into relieve the previous occupant of the chair-Mr Beale-But that does not make any difference.,106
5,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,It does in that I will now have to listen very carefully to what the honourable member is saying and refer to the legislation so that I can determine whether he is being relevant. I ask the honourable member for the Northern Territory to speak to the legislation.,106
6,Mr SNOWDON,ZZZZZ,By way of explanation-MONICA,106
7,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,There is no need for explanation. I ask the honourable member to continue speaking and to be relevant.,106
8,Mr SNOWDON,ZZZZZ,"I am, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I want to make it very clear to the House that I am doing so. For your benefit, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will go through my introductory remarks again. The honourable member for Mayo during his speech ranged across a number of subjects, including the Opposition's Economic Action Plan and government expenditure, particularly in relation to the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. It is within that context that I have raised these issues. The Opposition speaker said that the coalition has an economic strategy that is encapsulated in its action plan. The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill relates to a number of issues. In this instance it relates specifically to the Northern Territory. In the context of what the honourable member said, the Bill relates to expenditure in the area of Aboriginal affairs and the impact upon the community of the Opposition's policy, which it would introduce if it were in government,as part of an overall economic strategy, taken in conjunction with its policy of fiscal restraint on State and Territory governments. That is the context within which I am addressing the House. I reiterate that it is important in this bate to understand the nature of the Opposition's economic strategy and what it is all about. As the honourable member for Mayo obviously Jcnows, although he does not like to hear it, the Opposition's economic strategy is about alienating the poor and the needy, about perpetuating disadvantage. During his contribution to the debate, the honourable member for Mayo referred to the budget of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and made extensive comments about the expenditure in that budget for this financial year. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable member for Mayo said that, in the context of the Opposition's expenditure proposals for Aboriginal affairs, it would show 'every humanity and compassionate approach to give these people opportunity and choices'. Mr Downer-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: My reading of this legislation reveals that there is no reference to the Commonwealth's allocation to Aboriginal affairs. Once again I draw your attention to the fact that this is the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, not a Bill related to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.",106
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,"Mr Mountford)-I have had the opportunity now to read the Bill and the second reading speech, and I do not agree with your point of order. I believe that the honourable member for the Northern Territory is in order.",107
10,Mr SNOWDON,ZZZZZ,"I reiterate what the Opposition 111ember said during the course point of order. of his speech, to remind him of it. He said that in government the coalition would every humanity and compassionate assistance to give Aboriginal people opportunities and choices. He was very clear; it w'as part the debate, and I would like to address the Budget proposals of the Opposition in the context of that speech. The Opposition proposes to cut social advancement programs in the area of Aboriginal affairs by $22m, including the community development support scheme and the community infrastructure scheme. Mr Downer-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Whilst I recognise, with due deference, that you have now read this legislation and the second reading speech, I de- submit to you that there is no reference in this 1egislation-MONICA",107
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,There is no point of order; Mr Downer-I have not finished my point of order.,107
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"I have given the ruling that there is no point of order on relevance. Mr Downer-On a further point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: When a member raises a point of order, that member is erititled to state the point of order. I have not even finished my sentence-MONICA",107
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"But you are going 'on with exactly the same point of order that you raised on two previous occasions. Mr Downer-No, I am not.",107
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"I am asking you to resume your seat. Mr Downer-I have a further point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",107
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"What is the further point of order? Mr Downer-My further point of order is that the coalition's Economic Action Plan is of no relevance to this piece of legislation. I know you have read the legislation and the second reading speech, and there is nothing in either about the coalition's Economic Action Plan.",107
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,There is no,107
17,Mr SNOWDON,ZZZZZ,"What we are seeing show from the Opposition member and the Opposition generally is an inability to grasp the nettle. 'They are not prepared to have their of Economic Action Plan debated as they seek to debate it in the context of their contribution to this debate. I repeat: what the Opposition is proposing in the area of Aboriginal affairs and the area of showing every humanern ity and compassion, is to cut community development support and community infrasmeet tructure programs by $22m. Only last week I announced $3.5m-worth of expenditure community infrastructure in the Northern Territory. Let me remind the honourable member what that expenditure entailed. entailed expenditure for sewerage, water ticulation, some housing and some other capservicing ital items. If the honourable member is saying that the Opposition's action plan, which he spoke about at length during the debate, showing every humanity and compassionate assistance to Aboriginal people by virtue cutting those very important infrastructure programs and community development supmulating port programs, I will go he. There is absocuss lutely no doubt what the Opposition is on about. It will cut $100m off the Aboriginal affairs vote. The honourable member for Mayo knows it, and knows what it means. servicing It will not show compassion or give these people opportunities and choices. It will not do that at all. It will take away any chance of a reasonable choice for these people because it condemns them to poverty. I would like to return to the fiscal policy that has been promoted by the Opposition. There has been some argument tonight from the honourable member for Mayo that the responsibility Commonwealth Government's fiscal policy has not been what it ought to have been. Let me make very clear that the reductions in payments and borrowings that are the subject of this legislation have been part of the Government's strategy to ensure that all levels of government in Australia contribute to fiscal restraint-something that is essential in order to reduce pressures on domestic demand and the current account deficit. The honourable member for Mayo, while he here, talked about the need for State and Territory governments to show greater ciency. He talked about them not being volved in enterprises which should otherwise be the province of private enterprise. . I wonder whether he has bothered counsel the Northern Territory Government. I wonder whether he wanted to talk to Northern Territory Government about its atpenditure titude to feeding funds into privately owned tourist resorts in the Northern Territory. wonder whether he is aware that the NorthTerritory Government is now talking of a mini-Budget because it will not be able to its commitments. You might be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Northern Terfor ritory Government subsidises the Darwin, Alice Springs and Yulara Sheraton hotels. The cost of subsidising the Alice Springs It Sheraton blew out to $5.8m in 1988-89 of rewhich only $2.3m was budgeted for. Debt in the Northern Territory will cost taxpayers $119m in 1989-90. It is the highest per capita debt servicing level in the country. is I wonder whether the previous Opposition speaker or the shadow Treasurer, the of honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has taken the trouble when for this Economic Action Plan to diswith the Northern Territory Government its overall economic strategy. The Northern Territory Chief Minister has said that he does not believe, despite the massive debt it has, that there should be a fixed humanity, or limit for borrowings. Let me make it very clear: The attitude adopted by the Northern Territory Government in this area is grossly irresponsible. This sort of attitude that has been perpetuated by the Opposition in this debate, especially by the previous speaker, indicates that that iris a mirror of the irresponsibility which is being exercised by the Opposition. Not only is the Opposition saying to Aboriginal people and other people on unemployment benefits or welfare recipients that they are the ones that will take the brunt of any attack which it might visit upon them but the Opposition is also saying to the Northern Territory Government, 'You do as you like. Do not worry about what you do'. But the Opposition and the Northern Terwas ritory Government are not acknowledging the impact of the other aspects of this action effiplan on the Northern Territory economy. inThe Northern Territory economy survives on the basis of expenditure coming out of this place. Eighty per cent of the Northern Terto ritory Government's budget outlays come from the Commonwealth. It relies heavily on the Commonwealth Government program exincluding in the area of Aboriginal affairs. In 1988-89 that figure was $44m. If I the Opposition cuts $100m off the Aboriginal affairs budget, as it proposes if it were in government, it would have a devastating effect on pockets of the Northern Territory economy. I might remind honourable members opposite that, as a result of a study which was discussed in Alice Springs earlier this year, it was shown that the Aboriginal economy contributed one-third of the total central Australian economy. That economy is largely based on expenditure from the Commonwealth in areas which are designed as part of an overall strategy which encapsulates a social justice approach to economic development and economic management. That approach talks about getting Aboriginal people, other people who are welfare recipients and unemployed people back into the work force so that they are less dependent upon the public purse. It is not an approach which is being adopted by the Opposition. In fact, the approach that the Opposition is adopting is completely to the contrary. Let me just say that the $100m in cuts the Opposition proposes to make to Aboriginal affairs expenditure will ensure that those labour market programs which this Government put in place, which seek to make Aboriginal people less reliant on the welfare system, would not work because, as the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) said previously, those people would be in the poverty sink. By the proposals in the action plan, the Opposition will pull out the plug in that poverty sink. In no way is it responsible for the Opposition to adopt that firm approach. This is not the only area. The Opposition has shown that it despises rural and remote Australia. The Opposition is cutting out programs which have been in place to service rural and remote Australia. It proposes to cut out programs which have been put in place to serve rural and remote Australiathe Countrylink program, the rural education access program, the marketing skills program, the innovative rural education and training program, the rural community-based education program and the rural women's access grants program. All these programs are designed to help people who live in remote communities. What is the Opposition doing through its Economic Action Plan? It is saying that remote areas do not matter. The Northern Territory Government, by its acquiesence to this sort of approach, is sug_· gesting to the Northern Territory community that it also agrees with that approach. It does not understand the nature of the Northern Territory economy, just as the Opposition does not understand the nature of the Australian economy. For all the rhetoric and hot air that the Opposition has come up with, it has not come up with one constructive program, nothing new which 'Would indicate to the Australian community an interest-MONICA",107
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,Mr Mountford)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,109
19,Mr BURR ,ZZZZZ,"Lyons) (1O.01)-ln light of the contributions that have been made in this debate tonight, it is worth reminding the House that the Bill before the House is the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill and it is about time that the debate concentrated on the purposes for which the Bill was tabled. To date, the debate has, quite frankly, disgusted me. It is about time that the standard of debate was lifted and honourable members concentrated on lifting the standard of their performances in debate in the House. I intend to limit my time in this debate in order to allow my friend, the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl) to make his contribution, particularly in view of the now limited time we have available for this debate. The Bill that we are debating tonight centres on the grants that are made by the Commonwealth Government to the Statesthe reimbursement of taxes that are raised by the Commonwealth Government and then redirected back to the States. The main achievement that the Government boasts of in this particular Bill is that the grants reimbursed in the 1989-90 Budget to the States have been reduced by $550m. One could question whether that is an achievement that the Commonwealth Government should, in fact, boast about. I think it could probably be compared to the other boasts that the Government makes as to the major feature of the 1989-90 Budget; that is, that it has a surplus of $9 billion. I think that we need to remind ourselves that the purpose for which taxes are raised from the taxpayers of Australiais so that those taxes can be spent on behalf of the population of Australia. It seems to me that if the Commonwealth Government has raised from the Australian people $9 billion more than it intends to spend, something is wrong with the economic management of this country. Clearly, if that has happened taxes are too high. Alternatively, if the Commonwealth Government maintains that it must have such a taxation regime, other measures of economic management must have failed. I suggest to the Commonwealth Government that it review its whole economic strategy. I want to concentrate particularly on the way in which the Government, not only in this financial year but also in previous cial years, has been unfair and has used grants to the States in a very cynical political exercise. This cynicism and the expediency in the way in which these grants are being used are quite apparent. I will concentrate on the way in which Tasmania, in particular, has been singled out for treatment by the Commonwealth Government over the previous years. I will quote some figures of grants that have been made to Tasmania. The House might recall public statements made by the previous Premier of Tasmania, Mr Gray, about the way iri which the Hawke Government has treated Tasmania by reimbursement grants from the Commonwealth Government. Despite the treatment that has been given by the Commonwealth Government to Tasmania, Mr Gray was able to maintain a balanced Budget. He balanced his Budget every year that he was in office, despite the treatment given by the Hawke Government. The figures I shall quote are net figures for reimbursement to Tasmania, starting with the year 1985-86. In that year, Commonwealth Government reimbursement to Tasmania was $876.6m. In 1986-87 it was $890.6m, in 1987-88 it was $854.4m and in 1988-89 it was $896.6m. The increase in grants to Tasmania over those four years totalled a mere $20m, or 2.28 per cent. As all of us in this chamber would realise, that goes nowhere near the level of infilltion. Clearly, there was a. massive cutback by the Commonwealth in grants being made to Tasmania over the period of the Gray Government. During the same four years, the increases to the other States were as follows: In South Australia it was 6.02 per cent; in Western Australia it was 13.22 per cent; in Queensland it was 13.98 per cent; in Victoria it was 11.26 per cent, and in New South Wales it was 9.81 per cent. But to Tasmania it was a miserable 2.28 per cent. Despite the real cutback that was being made to the Gray Government and to the Tasmanian people, Mr Gray managed to maintain a balanced budget. But the cynicism of the Hawke Government has come through in the current financial year. We might recall that it was Mr Gray who represented Tasmania at the most recent Premiers Conference and Loan finan- Council meetings. At the 1989 Premiers Conference the Hawke Government allowed Tasmania only about a $5m increase in dollar terms. over last year. But immediately after the Loan Council meeting, Tasmania had an election. As a result of that election the Field Government came to office. The Field Government, as we all know, is a coalition between the Green Independents and the Labor Party in Tasmania. Immediately after the Field Government took office, Mr Hawke called Mr Field and said, 'I will give you a special package to get you out of trouble'. He immediately offered Mr Field a $50m package over and above what had been agreed to at the 1989 Loan Council meeting. That effectively gave Tasmania an increase in grants of over 6 per cent for this year over last year. Over the previous four years it had been only 2 per cent. So I charge the Hawke Government with sheer cynicism and with the manipulation of taxpayers' money for its own political expediency. I guess it is just another example of the Hawke Government looking after its mates. It has a history of doing that, whether it be in government or in business. The Labor Party a.nd the Hawke Government, in particular, look after their mates. As a Liberal, I am not one to ask for government handouts. This country has to get away from the mentality of looking to governments for handouts. Along with the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer), I am certainly one who would advocate to the Parliament cutting back both tax raising and tax reimbursements at whatever level of government. But I remind the Hawke Government and the House that not only has the Hawke Government been cutting back on grants to. Tasmania, but also it has been very seriously inhibiting our prospects of being able to develop our own economy in Tasmania. To date we have 25 per cent of the land area of Tasmania and its resources locked up in national parks that have been declared by the Hawke Government. In addition, the Hawke Government has intervened to stop the development of our natural resources. I note in particular its intervention in the Wesley Vale development project. On the one hand, we have the Hawke Government intervening to prevent the development of our private economy in Tasmania and, on the other hand, we have it cutting back on direct grants to the State from the Commonwealth coffers. I do not mind which way we go about it. If Australia, the Hawke Government, all of the Australian people and all of the other States decide that Tasmania is of such pristine beauty that it needs to be preserved for the rest of Australia in the form of a national park, that is fine, but the rest of Australia has to pay the cost. It is not fair to the people of Tasmania to stop them from developing their natural resources and at the same time to choke them off in the form of Commonwealth grants. I say to the Commonwealth Government, all members of this Parliament and all Australians, 'If you want Tasmania to be a national park, if you want to stop the development of our natural resources, you must pay, but do not expect the Tasmanian people to cop it from both ends'. The way in which Commonwealth grants have been manipulated by the Hawke Government has been nothing short of political cynicism, political opportunism and political expediency. I hope that by next year, by the time of the next Loan Council meeting, we will have a new government in place, a Peacock-led government, which will approach Commonwealth-State relations in a much more open and balanced way than has been the experience under the present Government.",109
20,Mr NEHL ,ZZZZZ,"Cowper) (l0.l1)-It is eight weeks until Christmas. I think that over that period most Australians will be looking forward with a great deal of anticipation to a time of festivity and joy. I look forward to the next eight weeks leading up to Christmas with some degree of fear and trepidation because I happen to represent the electorate of Cowper, which is a beautiful natural area on the north coast of New South Wales between Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour. It is an electorate which has its own San Andreas fault called the Pacific Highway. In the weeks leading up to Christmas we can expect probably two people to die every week on that highway. Therefore, it is with some fear and trepidation that I look forward to the next eight weeks. In the five years to December last year there were 433 fatalities on the Pacific Highway between Hexham and the Queensland border. I know that it will come as no surprise to honourable members that I should speak on this because ever since I was elected, and even before, I have become perhaps a trifle boring on this subject. But I do not hesitate to be boring if I am going to take the line and advocate the saving of Australian lives. As I said, in the last five years 433 of our fellow Australians have died on that particular piece of highway. As of now for 1989 the death toll on the Pacific Highway stands at 85. That includes the death last week of 20 people involved in that horrendous collision between a bus and a semitrailer near Grafton on the New South Wales north coast. I take this opportunity publicly to extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of those who died. I do so with the firm and total conviction that those deaths were needless. The Pacific Highway is a nineteenth century road which is trying to serve the twentieth century and, indeed, twenty-first century traffic. I have said continually-and I will continue to say it-that the road between Hexham and the Queensland border must be a fourlane, dual carriage, divided highway. I make no comment about where the blame should lie for last week's very tragic accident. That is for the coroner's court. However, there is one point which is absolutely clear and obvious to anyone who looks at the situation, and that is despite all the debates about driver tiredness and driver training-for goodness sake, we need far better driver training-and whatever arguments are advanced as a cause of these accidents, it is clear and unequivocal that when we change an ordinary, narrow, two-carriage way highway into a four-lane, dual carriage, divided highway, the number of accidents reduces enormously, by something like 82 per cent. The other factors may stay. the same but that is the most significant factor. Funding by successive governments, State and Federal, has been inadequate over decades. The Pacific Highway is the most used highway in Australia and, as I say, there have been 433 deaths on it in the last five years and 85 deaths already this year. Mr Cowan-The evidence is there.",111
21,Mr NEHL,ZZZZZ,"As the honourable member Frankly, for Lyne says, the evidence is there and my heart bleeds as I know of the evidence that he is talking· about. Analysts say that the enormous. death toll for the Pacific Highway is expected to be between 90 and 100 by the end of December 1989. So, realistically, we looking at another 15 or 16 deaths between now and the end of the year. That is why say that in the next eight weeks we can expect another two people to die every week on that highway. That is a very depressing and sad prediction. But how can the analysts be so sure? The reason is that the road itself is . totally predictable. I know, as do the honourable members for Lyne ( Mr Cowan), Page ( Mr Ian Robinson) and Richmond ( Mr Blunt), because we all drive on that highway night after night, week after week. and month after month. At one time one Qsed to find two or three semitnlilers together. Recently I counted 16 semitrailers in convoy, nose to tail, charging past me. I drive from. Port Macqu-rie, Kempsey or Wauc/:lOpe four or five times a week at 12 and 1 o'clock in morning and, quite frankly, I am not ashamed to confess that it is t-rrifying. every time one travels on that highway, one is centimetres from death. The hig\lway is a total time bomb. Quite frankly, I think we have been lucky that we have not had even more deaths. I had the horrific experieq.ce only on Frilian lives. day of the .long weekend in October of being quite .close behind a fatal accident on the riageway today? Pacific Highway near Karuah. It. was not a pleasant experience. I am very pleased that the recept fatal accident was not in my elecgreat torate. It fell to the honoQrable member Page to attend the accident and do what he could to help with the bodies that were laid out in a row on the side of the road. As I said, the reason for these accidents is that people who travel on the highway are only centimetres from death. Buses, trucks, semitrailers and caravans are using this road, and swimming pools, demountable school rooms and houses are being transported up and down a road that is inadequate. It is a nineteenth century road. What we have to have is a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway. All the statistics from Australia and all over the world demonstrate quite conclusively that this is the way to save lives. to be fairly mercenary, one can save money too because the cost to society of the maiming, death and destruction is absolutely I must say that I was very pleased that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipare ping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) agreed with the recommendations of the New South I Wales Government that the Pacific Highway should become a national arterial road. A national arterial ro-d is one which serves to increase the competitiveness of industries producing goods for export, or goods that compete with imports or is a road which will facilitate tourist travel. I would put forward the proposition that there is no other road in the whole of Australia which facilitates tourist travel more than does the Pacific Highway. I am not seeking to have this highway upgraded for my benefit or for the benefit of the people whom I represent, although we would· cheerfully accept it. But that road serves Australia. It is the major artery between Geelong, Sydney, Newcastle and the Brisbane. It serves the whole east coast. I am delighted that there is an allocation to the road of $118m over the next five years, but it is less than $24m a year. I have continually said to the Minister that he must accept the principle, the concept and the reality that this has to be a four-lane, dualcarriageway divided highway, to save AustraMr Tim Fischer-How much is dual carMONICA",112
22,Mr NEHL,ZZZZZ,"Two kilometres, which was a start, and I am very grateful for it; but for I know from first-hand experience just how dangerous it is. I will nQt go into the detail of how much money is going on bridges and bypasses, but it is not enough. If the sacrifice of those lives last Friday-and it should not have happened and it would not have happened on a divided highway-can achieve anything, at least, surely, we in this place can unite in a bipartisan fashion and accept that this road must be a four-lane, dual carriage way, divided highway and that there must be acceptance of a special case for special funding so that we do not spend just $24m a year. Mind you, to get the road to where 1 want it, it would be a 20-year program anyway, but we have got to make a greater commitment and have greater expenditure so that we do achieve a four-lane, dual carriage way, divided highway. As 1 said, the result that 1 want is in the interests of all Australians, because the great bulk of us will use that road at some time or other and, if we are lucky, we will not die on it.",112
23,Mr COWAN ,ZZZZZ,"Lyne) (10.22)-1 regret that we have not the time to deal with many of the important issues contained in the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. 1 must restrict my remarks in order to finish by 10.30 p.m. Naturally, 1 fully support what the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl) has said. He has been most sincere in every word that he has spoken in the Parliament since becoming a member. I am sure that he has brought to the notice of' the Parliament and to the people generally the responsibility of extra funding for the Pacific Highway. 1 will certainly give him and other members all the support that 1 can to see that the funding is actually provided for that particular roadway. The Opposition will not oppose the legislation before the House because it is a Budget Bill. All the details have already been worked out at the Premiers Conference. We now follow on with this legislation before the House. There are one or two things concerning the Constitution and the responsibility of the States that 1 would like to say. It may be that this is the opportunity to say it. Whilst 1 support the federal system entirely, 1I have been concerned for some time that the States in Australia should have their own taxing powers. They should not have to come to the Commonwealth once a year cap in hand and say to the Commonwealth, 'Right, these are our responsibilities for financial spending. These are programs that we have'. We must remember that in this country it is the States that basically have the responsibility for development. There is need for a certain amount of coordination between the States and the Commonwealth in all the major funds that are spent. It is very important, and it is good to see, that there is competition between the States. At the present time the State Government in New South Wales, realising its indebtedness, has had to adop,t certain measures in order to bring its balance sheet back to a reasonable situation. As a result, it has been forced to increase many charges. These charges, of course, fall not only on the State but also on what we recognise as the third tier of government, that is, local government, which also has to provide the services. Only recently the Premier of New South Wales approached the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) for assistance in funding the cleaning up of the sewerage schemes around the metropolitan area. He was told that it was a matter that the consumer has to pay for. 1 suppose that is right in a way. I am saying this just to reiterate the fact that the States have a tremendous responsibility for the development of their areas. 1 think it is a shame that consideration cannot be given to giving back to the States their right to tax. Certainly they can tax in certain fields, which they are doing. The iniquitous payroll tax, which is unsatisfactory to business, particularly to small business and industry, is not fair and should never have come into being, but it is there and the States are at present very dependent upon it for revenue. We have to appreciate the fact that Australhi is still a developing country. It will be many decades before we reach a situation similar to those of many countries in the Western world. The honourable member for Cowper has said tonight that roads are one of our greatest responsibilities. It is a decision for the States as to whether they use the railways to a greater degree or whether they use the roads for transport. 1 recognise that roads are perhaps the greatest problem within my electorate of Lyne. 1 continually get up in this chamber to make claims for additional funding for roads and bridges not only for the Pacific Highway, but also for the main arterial roads, and the rural and urban roads. This country today is dependent on roads for transport. It is a major factor in retail prices and the manufacturing cost of our goods. In fact, we are told that it represents up to 15 per cent of the retail cost of most of the commodities that we buy in supermarkets. Given the responsibility our producers have in getting their goods to market, it is essential that more money be made available for the building of new roads and bridges, of major roadways and highways, as the honourable member for Cowper has said. I suppose that the Pacific Highway is one of the busiest roads, if not the busiest, in Australia today, serving a developed part of this country, and it will continue to do so because of its geographical situation and the tourist industry. That responsibility is there. It disappoints me to hear the Government now say that the petrol tax is just another form of revenue for the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The motorists, in the country particularly, will not accept this because know that the purpose of this tax is the return of moneys to fund the road costs of the Commonwealth. They will always say that the petrol tax has been imposed for that particular purpose. It is no use the Minister coming into the chamber and telling us month after month that the tax is imposed for general revenue purposes. We know that only about 5c out of the tax of about 23c on a litre of petrol is returned to the roads of the States. I make a plea not only on behalf of our councils and the States but also on behalf of the people, who recognise that our roads are inadequate and need extra funding. As the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer) said earlier, we hope to see not only the public sector but also the private sector closely involved with the development of this country. The Commonwealth, the States and local government must give every encouragement to private sector involvement. I reiterate my support for the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper and what has been said about the Pacific Highway and the need for road funding. I have said what I believe the rightful powers of the States should be in terms of our taxing responsibilities. Debate interrupted.

24,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Yesterday the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) raised, as a matter of privilege, actions of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in connection with the 1989-90 national health survey. As I understand it, the substance of the honourable member's complaint is that misleading information was provided by the Australian they Bureau of Statistics in relation to certain questions about women's health. The honourable member said, if I understood him correctly, that, contrary to information given to the House, certain areas of questioning in the main-compulsory-survey referred either specifically or indirectly to topics which are included in the voluntary area. May cites as examples of contempt or breaches of privilege: the making of a deliberately misleading statement to the House; the presentation of false, forged or fabricated documents to a House; and conspiracy to deceive either House. In such matters, the question of intent is obviously a vital element. In a document presented to the House in May 1989 in connection with the national health survey, the ABS said that it had developed, in consultation with certain persons and agencies, a separate proposal for the collection from women respondents of information on a range of women's health issues. It appears that this has happened, so the ABS statement was not false. It could, however, be argued that there was a tendency to mislead the House because the impression may have been gained from the ABS statement not only that there would be two separate surveys but also that there would be no overlap between them. Whilst I recognise this line of thinking, the documentation available to me leads me to the view this was not the conclusion the reader should draw. In those circumstances I am unable to find that a prima facie case of contempt or breach of privilege has been made out.",114
25,Mr COBB ,ADJOURNMENT,"Parkes) (1O.32)-A recent decision of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) declared that public broadcasting stations in Australia will in future not be allowed to accept sponsorship in the way that they have in the past to generate income to run their stations. Public broadcasting in Australia has been in existence since 1972. These are largely independent, non-profit, non-commercial stations. To a large extent they complement the commercial and national broadcasting sectors. There are 84 public broadcasting stations operating in Australia, with licences pending for another 22. Usually, sponsorship makes up about 25 per cent of the income that they use to run their operations. However, in future, because of this decision, stations will be able to mention the sponsor's name and telephone number only once. This means that because sponsors will not get a fair go for their money, they will cease to sponsor these stations. The choices left for the public broadcasting .stations are to clos.e down, drastically restrict their programs or, even wors- in many aspects, ask for more government help to keep going. The Public Broadcasting Association of Australia is going to challenge this· decision in the High Court. That will probably cost it $100,000 and, quite frankly, I do not like its chances. I would like to direct my comments tonight to Western Education Broadcasting in my electorate, a public broadcasting station with the call signal 2WEB, situated at Bourke.. It operates out of an almost' brand new building which cost $300,000 to erect, of which I note that $200,000 was raised privately. It has a $75,000, five-kilowatt transmitter and operates on frequency 585. It employs 12 staff. It is one of the biggest employee,s in Bourke and puts about $7,000 in wages into that town every week. It covers remote towns, apart from Bourke, such as Brewarrina, Byrock, Coolabah, Girilambone,Louth, Enngonia, Barringun, Fords Bridge, Yantabulla, Hungerford, Wanaaring, Weilmoringle, arid towns in the electorate of the honourable member ·for Gwydir ( Mr Anderson) such as Goodooga, Lightning Ridge and Walgett. Apart from a translator relaying Sydney Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio and some Orange ABC radio into the :' area, no other radio station is broadcasting into that area and there is virtually no local content whatsoever. The nearest commercial station in my electorate is 2DU Dubbo, which is almost 400 kilometres away; therefore, 2WEB is not competing with any other commercial station in the area. 2WEB is the only local station for most of that area and it derives all of its sponsorship locally from small business and community groups. If this ABT decision is applied, it will kill off this radio station. In fact, sponsorship constitutes more than 50 percent of 2WEB's income and the rest of its income is raised locally through concerts, outside broadcasts, the sale of T-shirts and stickers, as well as government grants for specific projects. 2WEB covers a vast area-about 60,000 square kilometres-which has a population of about 40,000 people. One could fit the 24 central Sydney electorates into that area 18 times over. It is an isolated area with a hot, dry climate, an area that earns export income and has few or no services. People in that area struggle to maintain a quality of life. Eighty per cent of the people in that area listen to 2WEB-it is their stationand this Government is going to make it unviable. It has local news, rural news, Aboriginal programs, education programs and community programs. It has a high percentage of Aboriginal people and it acts to unite all the people in the area and give them. that feeling of oneness and a quality of life. If this decision goes ahead, that could well be ended. I appeal to the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) to allow the status quo or at least to allow 2WEB to go commercial. I urge the Minister to look again at this totally inappropriate ABT decision. If he will not reverse the decision, at least he should amend the legislation to allow remote area public broadcasting stations to be able to survive.",115
26,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,115
27,Mr LEE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Dobell) (10.37)-1 would like to associate myself with the remarks made by the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl) tonight when he extended his condolences to the families of those people who were killed in that horrific accident in the town of Cowper on the northern coast of New South Wales. Of course, that accident occurred on the Pacific Highway and tonight I wish to draw attention to another trouble spot on the Pacific Highway within my electorate. At the intersection of the Pacific Highway and Elizabeth Bay Road there was a double fatality at this time last year when two elderly residents of my electorate were killed in an accident with a heavy vehicle. In recent years there has been a massive increase in population in the Lake Munmorah and Chain Valley Bay area and, as a result, there has been a rapid increase in the number of people using this intersection. In addition, because of the sealing of the rutile road from Budgewoi to Lake Munmorah, people who are heading north from Toukley are increasingly using this Pacific Highway and Elizabeth Bay Road intersection and, as I have said, there was a double fatality there at this time last year. In recent days the local residents have been campaigning for the installation of traffic lights at this intersection. Unfortunately, the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Baird, has decided that the intersection does not deserve traffic lightshe is against traffic lights on the Pacific Highway-and he is proposing to spend 9,ver $100,000 on alterations to the road and the installation of new medium strips, even though an equivalent amount of money could be used to install traffic lights; the long term solution to accidents at this black spot intersection. What upsets me is that while Mr Baird says that there is no money to overcome this traffic problem at Lake Munmorah, he found $2m at the drop of a hat to overcome a problem with traffic noise in the Hornsby area simply because a few influential people living in Liberal electorates in that part of Sydney complained of some noise once the new Hornsby bypass was opened. It was no problem for Mr Baird to find $2m to overcome a traffic noise problem but there is not $100,000 to install traffic lights in the Lake Munmorah area. Several weeks ago more than 200 local residents. of the Lake Munmorah area attended a public meeting and called on Mr Baird to inspect personally the intersection so that he could see for himself the danger for local residents, and in particular the school children who attend St Brendan's and the Lake Munmorah public school. While speaking on the question of safety on the Pacific Highway, I also wish to make a few comments on the safety of heavy vehicles on our highways and roads at the moment. Earlier this year I made a few speeches in this House about my view that tachographs should be made compulsory for heavy vehicles so that there is a permanent record of the speed history of trucks if they are involved in an accident or picked up for speeding. There was a tragedy at Cowper last week, a near miss on the Pacific Highway yesterday and I understand that tonight there was another fatality somewhere near Bathurst and, unfortunately, another serious accident between Yass and Gunning OQ the Hume Highway. I believe all of this is strong evidence for the need to install tachographs so that the truck drivers know that there will be a permanent record of the speeds at which they are travelling. I acknowledge that the Minister fo( Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) is pushing very hard and""accelerating the requirement for speed limiters to be installed on trucks and heavy vehicles. I accept that that will ensure that some of the cowboys cannot exceed the 100 kilometres per hour speed limit which should apply to heavy vehicles. I believe that, in addition to the speed limiters, we need to consider the installation of tachographs. We should make it compulsory for the owners of heavy vehicles to pay that little bit of extra cost to install tachographs on heavy vehicles. Mrs Sullivan-And buses.",115
28,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"And also buses, as the honourable member for Moncrieff interjects. Most responsible bus lines these days have already installed tachographs. I believe that they should be made compulsory for all heavy vehicles and buses so that we can make sure they travel at safe speeds and do not put other motorists at risk. I commend the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support for doing his best to extend speed limiters . MONICA",116
29,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,117
30,Mrs SULLIVAN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrieff) (10.42)-1 support what has just been said by the honourable member for Dobell ( Mr Lee). In Queensland, where the speed limit is 90 kilometres per hour, it is an absolute farce when it comes to vehicles like semitrailers and buses on highways and the speeds at which they travel. Nevertheless, I am constrained to say that the need for much greater expenditure on our roads is now becoming urgent. One of the criticisms that have been made in relation to the recent bus tragedy is that it happened on a notorious stretch of road. A bus and semitrailer both travelling at speed in opposite directions is a recipe for disaster at any time on that road, which is in urgent need of upgrading. Tonight 1 want to raise a. matter which has been brought to my attention by a constituent of mine who is a taxation accountant. He recently received a letter from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in relation to the 1988-89 construction industry survey. 1 want to read part of that letter into the record. It said: While the ASS has extensive lists of businesses, some do not come to our notice. Because we want the survey to be representative of all businesses in the construction industry, the ABS has obtained a list of names and postal addresses of businesses from the Australian Taxation Office. These details have been supplied to the ABS in accordance with Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. However, for a considerable number of businesses, the postal address provided is merely care of the accountant or tax agent. The purpose of this letter is to obtain more complete contact information from you for the business( es) shown on the attached list. Some of these businesses may later be included in the sample of businesses asked to supply statistical information. Would you please complete the attached list by providing details of the business (not accountant's) address, contact name, telephone number and a brief description of the main business activity. Where applicable, details of any trading name or trustee company name should also be provided. My constituent expressed the following concern to me in the letter I received, which states: The letter states that the ABS has obtained information from the Australian Taxation Office in relation to a number of my clients and requests that I supply further details in relation to those clients. My constituent expresses this concern: The information requested is not of a particularly sensitive nature, being related to business addresses, phone numbers and the type of activity carried on by the client. However, I am concerned that this request would be followed by further enquiries which may be more intrusive. In any case, I am not comfortable with the situation which appears to intrude upon the confidentiality of my dealings both with my clients, and with the Australian Taxation Office. In . answer to a telephone enquiry, I was advised that my compliance was not compulsory, and I certainly will not be answering the request unless my clients agree. Whilst I agree that it is necessary that these surveys be carried out from time to time, I consider that this method of obtaining information sets an unacceptable precedent for further encroachments on the rights of citizens. I am also alarmed that the letter requesting this information does not state that there is no basis in law for the request or that compliance is not compulsory. As compliance with most of the requests by the ABS for information is compulsory, it would be understandable if the information requested were supplied simply because of a belief that it is legally required. I totally agree with the view put to me by my constituent. The honourable member for Moreton ( Mr Donald Cameron) has consist"" ently raised in this place concerns that he has about the method of approaching surveys that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has adopted. It has become heavy-handed and almost bully boy. Having read the letter from t-e Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1 agree with my constituent that it does not give, any indication that the approach is made on any basis other than compulsion. The letter should state that compliance is not compulsory. Instead, it reads very officiously. 1 also agree with the concern expressed by my constituent about the Australian Taxation Office supplying apparently extensive information to the Australian Bureau of Statistics about businesses in Australia. It is very clear that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has an enormous list of businesses in Australia. It is now also very clear that that comes from the Australian Taxation Office. This is reprehensible and the Australian Bureau of Statistics should be pulled into line quick smart by the Government.",117
31,Mr BLANCHARD ,ADJOURNMENT,"Moore) (10.47)-I wish to join with the previous speakers in respect of the recent tragic deaths on our roads. But in this adjournment speech I wish to refer to another series of tragic deaths that are occurring internationally. 1 want to highlight the scandalous abuses by multinaat tional companies in the marketing of baby milk formulas. In some overseas countries companies such as Nestles are ignoring the recommendations of the World Health ganisation and the United Nations Children's Fund to refrain from dumping free supplies. and samples of baby milk products in clinics and maternity hospitals. The question must be asked: Why attack the generosity of such companies? The reason is simple. It is an attempt to hook both mothers and babies an artificial form of feeding. The· medical evidence is clear: breast ing is superior to artificial milk for at least nine out of 10 children. According to Byers in the American Journal of Epidemiology, the risk of breast cancer is higher in women who breast feed for less than a month, this risk decreases progressively with increased breast feeding duration. In the 13 gust 1988 issue of that eminent British medical journal, The Lancet, there was an article by Dr Davis which shows that chilthem dren who are exclusively breast fed for at least six months are half as likely to develop breast cancer as are children not breast fed. When specific cancers are considered, risk of developing lymphoma is 5.6 times higher in artificially fed compared with breast fed infants. A number of other studies relevant to Third World countries show how dangerous it is for these large multinational companies to peddle these artificial milk supplies to hospitals and health authorities. In Gabon children between one and two years of age still receiving breast milk have a 29 per cent parasite infection rate while artificially children of the same age have a 66 per infection rate. If we look at the serious of malnutrition in Brazil, we see that 80 per cent of infants three months or older still being breast-fed have normal nutritional staing, tus, but only 43 per cent of bottle-fed infants have normal status. In southern Brazilian cities diarrhoea becomes a problem. Babies who receive no breast milk are 14.2 times more likely to die from diarrhoea than fed babies. What has this to do with Australia? Oversurface seas experience has shown that some very subtle marketing techniques can be used the multinationals to get a foot in the door maternity hospitals. It is clear that this is happening in Australia. We must ensure that women are able to make a choice about how they are able to feed their babies and are Ornot influenced by commercial pressures. I am also concerned that in some isolated Aboriginal communities where access to fresh water is a problem, bottle feeding could be the prescription for death that it has proven to be in Third World countries. On an international level, Australia cannot bring presto sure to bear on developing countries to protect their people from unscrupulous. forfeedmula companies if we have done nothing to keep these practices out of Australia. The boycott of Nestles products by Australian consumers could be an effective way of encouraging that company to cease its notoand rious marketing operations.",117
32,Mr TIM FISCHER ,ADJOURNMENT,"Farrer) (10.52)AuTonight I want to cover a couple of subjects. Firstly, a number of honourable members have touched on the road toll. I join with in expressing my sympathy to all those involved in the road toll, directly and indirectly, during this period of great carnage on our highways. In the most recent tragedies, the this has been caused too often by heavy trucks and semitrailers. This is a matter which our shadow Minister for land transport handIes very capably. I am sure that he would the want me to say in this context that part of the equation is the standard of the roads, quite apart from any other factors involved. As he has pointed out in a paper which I have before me, there is a direct correlation, and that relates to the question of road funding from the Federal source. Clearly, that is· fed a matter which will be pursued on another cent occasion. But as a number of honourable issue members have raised this matter, I remind the House that, over the past six years, there has been a reduction in Federal road fundand we are going to pay a price for that. I also remind the House that it is ironic that although we have had a very wet winter, and that put a lot of pressure on our road system, the real breakdowns in many sections breastof roads and highways have actually occurred as the soil underneath the bitumen has dried out. Weighted vehicles have caused section- o- road .to collapse. For exby ample, the Rivenna HIghway has actually . been worse during the drying-out period than during the middle of this year's extremely wet winter. These are matters which the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) will pursue. I wanted to clarify that. Secondly, last night the right honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair) referred to the magnificent events in Tenterfield to mark the centenary of the speech by Sir Henry Parkes in relation to the federation of this great nation. I commend all those who were involved with the ceremonies that took place in Tenterfield-the running of the very last train to Tenterfield, the re-enactment of Sir Henry Parkes's speech by Leonard Teale, the opening of the ball by the right honourable member for New England and all the related activities. I understand that it was a very successful weekend. I want to highlight to the House that the focus of the build-up towards Federation during that lO-year period from 1889 to 1899 and the referendums and subsequently 1901 when Federation actually occurred moved around Australia a great deal. In 1893, at Corowa on the New South Wales-Victorian border, the first of the key meetings took place to pave the way for Federation and the referendums and the other negotiations and discussions which took place. The Corowa Shire Council and I and others have had preliminary discussions with regard to commemorating in 1993 the centenary of that first Federation meeting at Corowa. It will be an important occasion as we build towards the centenary of Federation in Australia. I am pleased that the Tenterfield commemoration was so successful. I am sure that the Corowa centenary Federation commemoration-in a town where we have had a very successful Federation festival for many years-will be equally successful in 1993. Further east of Corowa is the city of Albury. I take this opportunity to comment on a magnificent booklet entitled 'A Memorable Life: the Historical Ramblings of Albury's longest serving Mayor'. That is Cleaver Ernest Bunton. Few people in Australia have contributed more to the city in which they live. This incredible man was the mayor of the city for three decades, a member of local government for five decades and secretary of more than 40 organisations. He played a decisive role in breaking down many barriers across the border and between religions. He had an involvement with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, with the famous KLM aircraft incident at Albury, and the like. I take this opportunity to salute Cleaver Ernest Bunton, a man who also served in the Senate for a brief period in 1975, for the huge contribution he made to the city of Albury, the region beyond and around Albury, the State and the nation. His contribution is one that deserves acknowledgment particularly in his role as father of the great city of Albury and his key local government leadership, which has helped pave the way for Albury to become the modern city it is.",118
33,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,119
34,Mrs HARVEY ,ADJOURNMENT,"Hawker) (10.57)-ln the few minutes I have I would like to address some criticism which has been levelled recently by various people, including members of the Opposition, at the Government's labour market programs, specifically the training programs which are being carried out through Skillshare and the Australian traineeship program and administered through jobs, education and training, Newstart and other programs. The Opposition in its recently announced policy has proposed a cut in funding for these programs and it is clear why. It thinks they are worthless. That is what the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly) implied in this House yesterday and what he and other members of tRe Opposition have said on other occasions. Perhaps I could recount to the House my experience of this matter in my electorate. In many factories and businesses in my electorate there is a shortage of people with certain skills. These skills include industrial sewing, dry cleaning, word processing and attendant care-attendant care being the care given to the physically and intellectually disabled people living in the community. What has the Government done about this? Through programs such as Skillshare it has put more than $lm into my electorate to train long term unemployed people in these and other skills. That has worked. People are graduating from these courses and getting jobs in the local area. Next to my office there is a Commonwealth Employment Service job club where long term unemployed people undertake three-week courses in how to apply for a job. They are given the confidence and the personal and communications skills which will enable them to apply successfully for employment. The success rate has been phenomenal. The vast majority of those taking the job club course are in permanent full time jobs within a week or two of finishing the course. The best part about these programs is that they are done as a result of close cooperation between employers, various levels of government and community groups. The Opposition wants to cut funding for these courses. It says that the long term unemployed should be in work, but it would cut funding for the very programs which are getting them into jobs. Its policy is quite contradictory' and counterproductive. The most reprehensible aspect of its attitude is that it scoffs at these courses and these people and at the qualifications they are gaining. The honourable member for Bradfield said yesterday that these qualifications are worthless, that they are not proper qualifications. They are skills which are needed in the work force and which are getting people into jobs, but according to the Opposition they are worthless. Being a trained word processor, dry cleaner or industrial sewer is worthless. How many members of the Opposition can do industrial sewing? How many of them know how to care for the physically or intellectually disabled? I doubt that any of them do. Yet they pour scorn on people who as a result of this training can do these things. ' These people should all go to technical and further education (T AFE) colleges, says the Opposition, and get proper qualifications. It may come as news to some members of the Opposition that not. all people are able to do a T AFE course or want to do a TAFE course. Why should they when our work force needs people with skills that are not necessarily taught at a TAFE college? To say that the skills I have been talking about that are imparted by Skillshare and similar courses are worthless smacks of the worse kind of intellectual snobbery. '",119
