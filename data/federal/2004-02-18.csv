I feel very sorry for those in the upbringing of their children. Sometimes are making decisions. When a man enters into a relationship, a man thinks that he is doing the He goes forward and becomes the hunter and gathhead. He provides the money for the children to whole host of livelihood reasons, the man in the and he thinks he is doing the right thing. decide that they are unable to live together man being disadvantaged because of the opporNA tunities that he has provided for his family working two jobs. He is then discriminated against not been there spending so-called ‘quality time' able to spend the average number of hours that sions are made that penalise that male parent that he possibly could for his family. So I do feel sorry for him. I think the system except to order him to continue to play that his children, whom he no longer sees. No real time that a dad comes home, maybe late at children's bedroom and see his sleeping children belonging and attachment to those children that in every relationship with a child the best a child has woken up early in the morning and have gone to sleep at night and look like a small replace when it is taken away from you. So my answer to that question is that I certainly where this has happened-men who want more life that they led prior to separation and the them and penalise them. Then, in the future, life is some limited contact The next question that I am asked is: do you for the women as well. Some women are doing adequate child support. Forty per cent of payers range, regardless of whether there is one child That payment of $5 a week makes it significantly family and provide her family with what they the earth not to pay child support at all. They current partner's name so that their estranged they will go to every length that they can in they have brought into a relationship prior to men. Some men say, ‘That is because we are people who have been denied contact, but primary roles of breadwinner and full-time carer contact when he promises the children he will. offences for any partner-whether male or come for contact when they have promised the withholding contact from the non-resident parent. own right. So there are significant areas of concern their life with their former partner may not disruption in their life. I do have concerns The next question is: do I feel sorry for the for anybody else. Children did not ask to be by working consistently-and maybe sometimes at the time of separation, because he has with his children or because he would be unwould be required with his children. So decifor having provided comforts or the best living does not recognise the role that a dad plays, role by paying child support-child support for consideration is given to the fact that at the night from work, his solace is to walk into his and to watch them and get a sense of love, as they sleep in their beds. There is no denying thing about it and the most loving time is when is at their lovely sleepy-eyed best or when they angel. That is a great feeling that nobody can do feel sorry for men in separated families contact but cannot get it, simply because the work hours that they had discriminate against their only form of involvement with their child's and the payment of child support. feel sorry for the women? Yes, I do feel sorry it extraordinarily tough and are not receiving of child support are within the $5 per week or four, five, six or 10 children in that family. difficult for a woman to be able to raise her require. Also, some dads will go to the end of will hide their income: they will put it in their partner is not able to access that income and order to not be responsible for the children that separation.
