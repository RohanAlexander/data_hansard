1,Mr FINLAYSON,TRAD E RELATION S WITH,"'Will the Prime Minister inform the House as to the progress of the negotiations with Canada for reciprocal trade relations, and whether there is a possibility of the early resumption of direct steam-strip communication between the Commonwealth and the Dominion ? .",14
2,Mr FISHER,TRAD E RELATION S WITH,"Communication s with Canada have taken place through the Minister of Trade and Customs, who will be able to give the honourable meinber, later, more detailed information than I have at present, but I am able to say that Canada has expressed herself in favour of improved trade relations. The most recent cable from that country is to the effect that further time is desired to consider the matter, and a personal interview between parties representing both countries concerned has been asked for.",14
3,Mr FINLAYSON,TRAD E RELATION S WITH,I desire to repeat to the Minister of Tirade and Customs the question I have already asked the Prime Minister. Can the Minister of Trade and Customs inform the House as to the pro-gress of the negotiations with Canada for reciprocal trade relations?,15
4,Mr TUDOR,TRAD E RELATION S WITH,"The Minister of Customs for Canada wrote to me early this year on the question, and expressed a desire that we should exchange lists of the articles on which we were prepared to give each other the best Tariff arrangement. I forwarded to him a list embracing such commodities as meat, butter, fruit, wool, hides, and skins, and so forth, and told him that I was anxious to hear from him. No list, however, has been forwarded from Canada. My letter was acknowledged by cable, and about a fortnight ago I cabled asking for the list. The reply was that the Canadian Minister of Customs was engaged on the Imperial Trade Commission, and that my cable would be repeated to him. That is how the matter stands at present-w e have forwarded a list, but no list has been sent to us. IMMIGRATION.",15

10,Mr FISHER,TRAD E RELATION S WITH,"Parliamen t always has the fullest opportunity to discuss questions dealt with in the Governor General's Speech. As to the Government's intentions, their' policy in respect to Commonwealth railways has been settled.",15
11,Mr CHANTER,TRAD E RELATION S WITH,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the statement in this morning's press that the Government of New South Wales is not favourable to the construction of lines in the Riverina on the Victorian gauge. Will he communicate with the Governments of all the States, in order that an arrangement may be arrived at for the adoption of a uniform gauge for Australia?",15

38,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable Will and learned member for Ballarat is reported in the Age of the 12th inst. to have said, speaking of the provision of sinking funds for loansHe must content himself with a bare allusion to several linancinl matters. They must see to a sinking fund accompanied every loan. e Labour Government never had any loan.",17

42,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It passed a Loan Bill.,18
43,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am helped towards an answer by the interjection of the honourable member for Ballarat. We have borrowed no money for defence purposes, and I presume the statement was an error.",18
44,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Government passed a Loan Bill, not for defence, but for . £ 2 . 5 0 0 , 0 0 0. Mr FISHER. The answer to the question is-No , we have passed no Loan Bill for defence.",18
45,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hear , hear; I did not say so. COAL VEND JUDGMENT APPEAL.",18
46,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to call the attention of the Attorney-General to a statement which appeared in the daily press on nth June attributed to the honourable member for Ballarat. The statement is as follows: The Coal Monopoly had a judgment standing against it in the High Court. It was curious that the representative of the Labour Government assented to an application of the parties fined as monopolists when they made application for their case to be postponed for a considerably long time. I desire to ask the Attorney-General whether there was anything ""' curious "" or improper in the postponement.",18
47,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,This has reference to an application by the defendants in the Coal and Shipping Combine. The answer is that there is no truth in the statement of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.,18
48,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I ask the Attorney General if it is not a fact that, on the day mentioned, application was made for an adjournment by the counsel on behalf of the Coal Vend, and that it was concurred in by the counsel representing the Commonwealth.",18
49,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The facts are as I have st cited,18
50,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether it is not a fact that, during an application heard before the High Court in Sydney by certain shipping companies concerned in the case, for the further postponement of the hearing of their appeal against the Coal Vend judgment, Mr Bavin, representing the Government, did in that Court acquiesce in the application. Further, I desire to know whether the Chief Justice of Australia did not say, in the Court, that to grant the application would put off the hearing of the case for another year.",18
51,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That it might put it off.,18
52,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"And , thirdly, whether it is not a fact that the Chief Justice recognised the case as being one of such urgency that he refused the application so supported by the Government representative, Mr Bavin.",18
53,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I suggest that a question of this kind might very well be given notice of.,18
54,Mr FULLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,In view of what the Attorney-General has said?,18
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Attorney General gave the lie direct! Mr FISHER. - I can only appeal to the good sense of honourable members.,18
56,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I must ask honourable members to try to control themselves. When such interjections pass across the chamber it is not possible for me to control the House. .,18
57,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,May I be permitted to say,18
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to rise to a point of order. I ask your ruling, Mr. Speaker, as to whether it is in orde'r for the Attorney-General, in answering a. question, to answer in this particular way. The Attorney-General said, ""there is no truth in the statement"" alleged to have been made by a member of the Opposition.",18
59,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Attorney-General was quite in order in using the words he did. A question was asked as to a certain statement alleged to have been made outside; and, now that the matter has been raised, I may say that I do not think there should be such frequent necessity for me to intervene in regard to the form in which questions are asked. Honourable members are stating what they say are facts, and, by putting the questions in the form, "" Is it not a fact,"" they technically bring them within the category of questions that may be asked. When honourable members know that certain things have been reported, as set out in the newspapers, I do not think it is necessary for them to ask a question on the point. In this case, the Attorney-General was quite in order in answering in the - way he did. I did not understand him to say directly that what an honourable member had said was untrue.",18
60,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"B y way of explanation, I desire to point out that I did not ask whether the Government had consented to a postponement.",18
61,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That was my question.,18
62,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The question I put to the Attorney-General was whether, as stated by the honourable member for Balto a question. larat, there was anything "" curious or improper ' ' in the application.",19
63,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"My desire was to the Attorney-General an opportunity to correct himself before it was too late. My statement, as all the House heard, was - distinctly that an application - was made - on behalf of the defendants in the Coal Vend for a postponement of the hearing of their case, and that the counsel for the Commonwealth concurred in and agreed to the application. I was told that my statement was absolutely untrue.",19
64,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable mempeal ber for Bourke asked me, so I understood, interjecting. whether the Crown had been responsible for instigating the delay?",19
65,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No . Mr HUGHES. - The honourable memment ber for Ballarat now states the matter true? quite differently.,19
66,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I appeal to Hansard.,19
67,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable meming. ber for Ballarat has stated the matter quite differently from what the honourable memlated ber for Bourke did.,19
68,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I made my own plain statement.,19
69,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I understood that what took place was as follows : Application was made by the defendants for a date to be fixed for the hearing, and it was stated they could not be ready before a certain date. The Court then said that the appeal would either have to be heard on the date mentioned by the Chief Justice, or stand over until the new year. The Crown re fused to assent to that, but was willing, think, to agree to the appeal being heard some time in August. The Chief Justice wished to put it down for hearing, I think, late in July. It is, therefore, quite true to say that the Crown is, in any sense Of the word, responsible for the delay, that it has concurred in any delay, beyond that which the circumstances required.",19
70,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The statement now made by the Attorney-General is really an affirmative answer to the question that I put, which he, in the first place, answered in the negative. What I stated, as Hansard will prove, was that counsel for the Commonwealth concurred",19
71,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! The honourable member must not debate an answer,19
72,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I ask the Attorney General whether he does not now absolutely give retract all that he first said ?,19
73,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I retract nothing.,19
74,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! The honororable member for Ballarat is now going beyond the mere asking of a question.,19
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I rise to a point of order. Several members interjecting,",19
76,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"There appears to be some excitement in the House, and I apto honourable members to refrain from",19
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On a point of order, sir, do I understand you to rule that it is quite in order for an honourable member to say in this chamber that the state of another honourable member is not If that is your ruling it is a serious departure from precedent.",19
78,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I gave no such rulThe honourable member must distinctly recollect that the question asked reto something alleged to have been said outside this House. Any honourable member who declares that a statement made in this House is not true will be promptly called to order.,19
79,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to ask the Attorney-General whether his attention has that been directed to a report, which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17th May last, of an application made to the High Court on behalf of the shipping companies interested for a further postpone- ment of the hearing of the appeal? In I this report Mr Ham, who appeared for the appellant shipping companies, said that it was an application for a postponement, and it was alleged that the necessary printuning would not be done in time for the hearing of the appeal on a particular date. or Further, has the Attorney-General read in that report the intimation made by the of the case Chief Justice thatWhen the matter was brought under his notice in Melbourne he had advised the parlies that if they really wanted to have the matter heard it should be set down early in the list for the next sittings. It had been accordingly set down, and there was only a short case before it. That would give the Court weeks to dispose of it. If it were not dealt with then there would be very little chance of it being finished during the year. Has the Attorney-General read the further statement made on that occasion by the Chief JusticeI must say that it is absurd to say that a the Court. period of six months is required for that poseThat is the purpose of printing-and the statement made by Mr Justice BartonAn application was made to me and I stood Mr Bavin, who appears for the Crown, the Ageto say that the Crown could not be ready by July 29th-the date fixed for the next sittings. Has the honourable gentleman also read the further statement reported to have been ment made by the Chief JusticeI think that the real reason applications which come before the Court is that somebody or other has found it inconvenient to deal with the matters earlier. The alternative is to take the case early next sittings, or to have it stand over to the following sittings. To which, according to this report, Mr. Bavin, counsel for the Crown, replied thatThe appellants could not get the necessary printing done by 20th July. He suggested that a date should be fixed late in August or early in September. . To this the Chief Justice'repliedThe appellants have still two clear months and two weeks, during which time enough printing could surely be done to cover all the cases heard in this Court for years. Finally, has the Attorney-General seen the further statement made by Mr Bavin, who represented the CrownShould it suit the convenience of the Court, the .Crown is willing lhat the case should stand over until the end of August. I ask the Attorney-General, who a moment or two ago made an exactly contrary statement in the House, whether he will direct his attention to the report, and explain why counsel for the Crown in that case supported the nppl'cation of the representative of the shipping companies ?",19
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,This Government is simply dying to get at the trusts.,20
81,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,And the honourable member is dying to get at the Government.,20
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I should think soa Government of that sort.,20
83,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Order ! I appealed to honourable members a minute or two ago to cease interjecting, and I must insist on their refraining from making further interjections across the table.",20
84,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"There are two wholly different points to be decided. The first of these is as to what took place in the Court, while the second is what took place outside the Court. I was asked by the honourable member for Bourke what took place outside What took place outside the purCourt, according to the honourable member for Bourke, was this: On n t h June the honourable member for Ballarat, at Ballarnt, in the course of a speech, made the folunderlowing remarks, according to a report in The Coal Monopoly had a judgment standing against it in the High Court. It was curious that the representative of the Labour Governassented to an application of the parties, fined as monopolists when they made application for their case to be postponed for a considerfor many of these ably long time. The honourable member for Ballarat said it was curious that this happened, and the inference drawn from that has been used many times since the application was heard.",20
85,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! I must ask the honourable member not to debate the question.,20
86,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not wantlo make a speech, but there has been made upon the honour of the Crown, and upon my Department, - a reflection under which I decline to sit, and it has been made in the form of a question which, with your permission, I propose to answer. I shall confine myself strictly to the question put, and the remarks made, and the subsequent extracts read by the honourable member for Wentworth. The inference drawn by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is that what happened was a '' curious ' ' thing. Now, what precisely dees that mean ? There is nothing legally curious about it. Nothing on earth is more common. Therefore, it must be meant that it was curious from a political stand-point, and from an honourable stand-point, and, therefore, that there was something rottens in it.",20
87,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! The honourable member is now going beyond answering the question. He must not take that course.,20
88,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I presume there will be a further opportunity of dealing with this very ""curious"" matter. I shall content myself by saying now that the instruction! given to the counsel for the Crown by me,  State, was that under no circumstances was any proceeding to be delayed, or he to be absent from this country upon the first occasion on which the case could come on. I shall lay on the table of the House the correspondence which passed between me and the Crown Solicitor, by which his absence from this country will be shown to be clearly contingent upon his return upon the first day upon which this case could be heard. Those are the clear and unmistakable facts. I see nothing "" curious "" about them.",20
89,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I should like to ask the Attorney-General upon what date Mr. Powers returned to Australia.,21
90,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have already said  his letter to me, written prior to his departure, stated at that time that there was a probability of some of the defendants not appealing. In fact, there was a probability at that time that none would appeal. Since then all the defendants have given notice of appeal, and some propose to go on with it, but I be must be back here in time for the appeals whenever they would be heard, and counsel for the Crown had no instructions at all to do anything other than what I have said.",21
91,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"May I invite the Attorney-General to reconsider the very serious statement he has made about the counsel representing the Crown- a statement which is not called for or warranted by any question that we have put? The issue as to where counsel obtained his authority for concurring in the proposal an adjournment, or why, is an entirely different thing. We have not raised it. My statement; which the Attorney-General contradicted, was that counsel for the Crown had publicly concurred in an application for an adjournment. The honourable ancl learned gentleman has now admitted it.",21
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hear , hear! Better not put the honourable member for Bourke up again.",21
93,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable and .learned member for Ballarat says that some of my remarks were not warranted by the question, but this question cannot stand by itself. It was a question asked really for political purposes. During the election at Werriwa, statements on the same lines were repeatedly made which could bear only one inference, ancl that was that the Crown was corrupt in this matter.",21
94,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have to repeat the question which I put to. the Attorney-General, and which he did not answer. Has [3]  if not, on what date is he expected to land in Melbourne?",21
95,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have already answered that question.,21
96,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The - honourable member has not answered it.,21
97,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I may not have given the answer which the honourable member wants.,21
98,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Perhaps I have not made myself clear to the Attorney-General. The answer I want is not whether any arrangement was made as to the return of Mr. Powers. What I wish to know is whether he has returned to Australia; and, if not, when we may expect him to return.",21
99,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have already answered the honourable member, but he has omitted to take notice of my remarks. I  mentioned the date-whic h I cannot recall - o n which it was probable that the case would be heard, and said he would make his arrangements to be back on that date. ' I said that, whether the case came on upon that date or any other date, he would have to be back in Australia when it did come on. He has been cabled that the case, is set down for July, and he is returning accordingly.",21
100,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to draw your for attention to the remark of the honourable member for Parramatta, to the effect that the Attorney-General ought not to put me up again; and to ask whether it is parliamentary to make such imputations. I am not the jumping-jack of any party on this or the other side.",21
101,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I did not hear the honourable member for Parramatta make the remark; but, if he did,, he must withdraw it.",21
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think the remark I made was that they should not put the honourable meinber for Bourke up to ask such questions as those. I withdraw it. I am sure this Government would not think of putting any of their supporters up to ask a question. Mi. SPEAKER - I must ask the honourable member to withdraw the remark unreservedly. Mr. JOSEPH Coo^c - Most certainly, unconditionally and absolutely. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is the Attorney-General in a position to inform the House as to the date on which Mr. Powers is expected to arrive back in the Commonwealth ?",21
103,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"At present, I do not  ship he is on; but I shall supply the information asked for tomorrow.",22
104,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I wish to ask the Attor monwealth; and if not, on what date will he arrive?  the Commonwealth. He has gone to London. He is engaged on business of the Crown in London. Does the honourable member want to know what that business is?",22
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Certainly .,22
106,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member has, during the recess, assumed the shape of a note of interrogation. SUGAR INDUSTRY.",22
107,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member for Ballarat is reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 30th May to have said at Murrumbeena that the Labour party left the sugar industry in the hands of a monopoly without lifting a finger. Is lhat statement correct?,22
108,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.,22
109,Mr GORDON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if the wireless operator of the steamer Wakool was forbidden by the Government station at Melbourne to speak with another vessel of the same line that was at sea, and whether the Government station refused to send to the vessel at sea the message which it was desired to send from the Wakool.",22
110,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is true that the operator on the Wakool was ordered to cease communicating with the Commonwealth, another vessel belonging to the same line; but it is not correct that he sired the Melbourne Government station to communicate with the Commonwealth, and was refused.",22
111,Mr GORDON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Is it the policy of the Government to prevent vessels at sea from communicating with other vessels in harbors where wireless communication is not provided by the Government ?,22
112,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"When the Government has a wireless station open for public business, vessels in Australian ports will not be allowed to send communications on a commercial basis which could be sent by the Government station. If a vessel moored to a wharf in one of our ports were allowed to communicate with another of the same line, or of any other line, it would interfere with the revenue of the Government wireless station. The Commonwealth could easily have been communicated with from Melbourne had the Government station there been asked to send a message to her.",22
113,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Is it not a fact that a steamer which was lying at Adelaide wished to communicate with another vessel of the same line which was at sea, in order to ascertain when she would arrive, and that she was prevented from doing this, although there was no Government wireless station nearer than Melbourne.",22
114,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; but the Melbourne station could have got into communication with the vessel at sea and conveyed the message, in which case the Government would have obtained payment for the service.",22
115,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Would it not be a fair parallel if the Government refused to allow a man to send a letter by an office boy or messenger from his office to his private house, and required him to buy a stamp, and send the communicationthrough the post, so that there might be no loss of revenue?",22
116,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not think so.,22
117,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Hav e the wireless stations at Sydney and Fremantle been taken over by the Government on a working basis ?,22
118,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No ; but the Department has been informed that the Pennant Hills station is ready to be handed over. COMMONWEALTH BANK. Mr. JOSEPH COOK' - Has the Prime de- Minister any objection to laying on the table all the papers connected with the appointment of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank ? I desire to know the terms and conditions of the offer and acceptance of the appointment.,22
119,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have no objection. I think that one sheet will convey the information. NA LONDON.,22
120,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,Hav e the plans for the Commonwealth offices in London been received ?,23
121,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,Yes .,23
122,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,"Will the Minister, before accepting them, have them carefully examined by competent-persons, so that the buildings may be up-to-date, constructed in accordance with modern requirements, and suited to the London climate ?",23
123,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,The plans were drawn by a competent English architect. What more does the honourable member desire?,23
124,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,T am informed that the ideas of English architects are not always abreast of modern requirements.  date!,23
125,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,"Evidentl y the Minister of Home Affairs thought so in connection with the Capital site designs. Before the Minister of External Affairs accepts the plans for this important and expensive building in London, will he see that all modern requirements are met? It is well known that a large number of the buildings recently erected in London have been designed, by architects living in other places, who have been able to provide for the requirements of the city better than London architects.",23
126,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,"We left it absolutely to the High Commissioner to choose the ablest and most gifted architect in the United Kingdom. We have confidence in his choice, and db not think it necessary to go beyond him.",23
127,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,"Will the Minister of - External Affairs, before finally accepting the plans, give the House an opportunity to review and consider them ?",23
128,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,I cannot promise the honourable member that.,23
129,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,That is being done in the case of the. Capital site designs.,23
130,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,I cannot give that promise to the honourable member.' Ministers are prepared to take full responsibility for anything they may do in connection with the matter. PEA-RIFLES.,23
131,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,"In view of the large number of accidents arising out of the use of so-called pea-rifles, I wish to know if the Minister of Trade and Customs will [ 3 ] -* .consult his experts as to the advisability of prohibiting the importation of cheap rifles which are not provided with effective checks upon accidental discharge?",23
132,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,"This matter has been under consideration for some time. It was mentioned, I think, before the Tariff Commission, of which the honourable member for Perth was a member. The desirableness of having some test of these pea-rifles was suggested, but I am afraid that if we start to prohibit everything that may give rise to accident, we shall have to go much further than pea-rifles. NA ON BILL S. Messages were received from the Senate asking the House to resume the consideration of the following Bills at the stages reached last sessionCommonwealth Banking Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill.

133,Mr FOWLER,RESUMPTION OF PROCEEDINGS,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice Whether any decision has been arrived at with regard to the use of steel or of wooden sleepers in the construction of the Transcontinental railway? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answer to the honourable member's question is:The matter is still under consideiation, but it is almost certain that the bulk of the sleepers will be wooden ones. WERRIWA ELECTIO N ROLLS.",23
134,Mr KELLY,RESUMPTION OF PROCEEDINGS,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticeWill he lay upon the table of the House his telegram from Crookwell to the Chief Electoral Officer for New South Wales with iefe> ence to the use of the 'old roll in the Werriwa by-election, together with any subsequent correspondence bearing upon the said telegram? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answer to the honourable member's question is :I did not telegraph lo the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for New Soutli Wales. It was represented to me that the old roll contained names which were not embodied in the new roll, and I gave instructions with a view to the old roll as well as the new one being utilized, but, upon further inquiries into the matter, I found that such a course could not legally be adopted, and accordingly withdrew my instructions.

GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY. Debate resumed from 19th June (vide page 37), on motion by Mr BENNETTThat the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House.",24
137,Mr DEAKIN,RESUMPTION OF PROCEEDINGS,"Ballarat) [3.32] - I did not propose to do so but it has been suggested that the proper course, as I intend to conclude with an amendment, is to put the Prime Minister at once in possession of its terms. I propose to move That His Excellency the Governor General be informed that the Government merits the censure of this House and the country for its failure to realise its national and constitutional obligations, for the flagrant neglect of its duties to secure industrial pence and good order, and to uphold the law within the Commonwealth; for its maladministration of public affairs and public Departments; for its grossly partisan actions and appointments, and its reckless irresponsibility in the financial affairs of the Commonwealth.",24
138,Mr FISHER,RESUMPTION OF PROCEEDINGS,"Wide Bay-Prime - Minister and Treasurer) [3-33] - Following well-founded custom nnd usage in regard to a - notice of this kind by the Leader of the Opposition, I think we ought to take time to deliberate 'over it. I have only to say that, in accordance with the statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Parramatta, at the end of last session, the Government refrained from taking Supply beyond the end of the financial year. It may, therefore, be necessary, before the close of the debate upon the Address-inReply, to obtain one month's Supply. Subject to an agreement to give Supply, if desired, on the basis of the old Estimates, I shall be prepared to at once agree to the resumption of the debate tomorrow, and will afterwards move the adjournment of the House.",24
139,Mr DEAKIN,RESUMPTION OF PROCEEDINGS,"Ver y well, I ask leave to continue my speech tomorrow. Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 3.36 p.m.",24
