2,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.31] -(B y leave) - A little before theluncheon hour the Government received the sad intelligence of the sudden death of the honourable member for Echuca, Mr Albert Clayton Palmer. We, and his friends in the House and in the country, had been aware that he had fallen a victim to the prevailing epidemic and was having a very hard struggle, but wo were all hopeful that the end would be otherwise. The Government desire that the House should pay its respect to the work and memory of the - honourable member in the appropriate and customary way adopted by all British' Parliaments. Speaking for a moment or two in a personal vein, I may say that it was my privilege to know the honourable member for many years prior to his entrance into public life, and that it is well nigh years since I first became acquainted with him. There are many of his older friends in this House and elsewhere who entertained for the deceased gentleman a feeling of high respect and esteem. He played a very prominent part in the developmental life of the districts of Victoria with which he was associated prior to his entrance into the wider field of public activity. In municipal life he was [435]- 2 a conspicuous figure and had intimately associated himself for well nigh two score years with the interests of the producers, which he was .afterwards called upon to represent in the Parliament of his country. His parliamentary career stretches from the year 1906, over thirteen years of busy, active, useful service, and he represented the important district of Northern Victoria in five Parliaments.  strongly, expressed them plainly, and, while he had a wide circle of friends, I regret to think that he made, as we all do, by the expression of our candid views on politics and other matters, many enemies. But we have learned in this country to know that, after all, a man who has not a few enemies has not played perhaps his most useful part in life, and that it sometimes fjoee to the credit of a man that his enemies have been made by the frank expression of his own mature convictions. The honourable gentleman's wide circle of friends and acquaintances will mourn his death, with his sorrowing family. He lived a clean public and private life, and devoted himself with unmistakable success and effect to the performance of 'his ,public work - In the districts with which he was associated his representation of the people in this Parliament will be remembered with pride and pleasure. I think that both the publio and private life of Australia are the poorer fox the untimely death of the honourable member, and we hope, Mr. Speaker, that in the tribute which we tender, as colleagues who have laboured with - b-irn in this vineyard; there will bo found not only ah expression to the people of Victoria of our appreciation of his worth, but what solace comes from such an expression to his sorrowing wife and family. I m o v e That this House records its sincere regret at thirty the death of the honourable member for Echuca (Iifr. Albert Clayton Palmer), and expresses its appreciation of the zeal with which he devoted himself to his public duties, and its profound sympathy with his bereaved wife and family in their great Borrow.",20
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [2.35] - I desire to express the sincere sympathy of honourable members of the Opposition with the relatives of the deceased gentleman. Many of us disagreed with: hia views, but in a Parliament. comprising members holding many divergent views we must give the honourable member credit for the sincerity of his opinions. I feel sure that just as we believe bhat we are entitled to our own opinions, so we are prepared to extend the same right to others. Although we differed from the honourable member, we are none the less sincere in our expression of sympathy to those whom he .has left behind. Question unanimously resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. . Motion (by Mr Watt) agreed to' Tbat Mr Speaker be requested to transmit to Mrs Palmer the foregoing resolution and a copy of the speeches delivered thereon. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.",20
