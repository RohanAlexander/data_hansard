1,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether you had the authority of the House, whose servant you are, for the introduction of strangers not authorized by any rule of the House during question time yesterday, and for the continuance of their presence in the Parliament to the great inconvenience of members for an inordinate length of time?",11
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I received a request from two sources-the Department of Information and an English moving picture producing company-that the proceedings of the House should - be recorded on a film. The writer of the letter pointed out that the object of making the picture was to explain to world audiences the method of the Australian Government.,11
3,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,It needs explanation.,11
4,Unknown,Unknown,"Opposition members interjecting,",11
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am astonished that members of the Opposition should show such gross discourtesy to the Chair. The letter asked for permission to film the proceedings at any time when the House was in session and speeches were ""being broadcast. On receiving that request I thought that the leaders of parties ought to he consulted, and so I immediately communicated with them. They all readily consented to the making of the film. Before the pictures were taken I also saw the persons in charge of the operations, and pointed out that as there had been some discussions of previous films made while the House was in session I wanted their assurance that similar treatment would begiven to honourable members on both sides of the chamber. That, assurance was readily given. The honourable member for Batman desires to know whether I consulted the desires of the House in the matter. The negotiations took place when the House was not sitting, but I thought that members of all parties had confidence in .the judgment of their leaders in a matter of this kind, and as I had consulted the leaders of parties who readily gave their consent to the making of the film, and obtained assurances that both sides of the House would be treated in the same way, I thought that nothing more was necessary on my part. I am sorry that the honourable member for Batman was unduly inconvenienced, and when my attention was drawn to the fact I immediately asked the people concerned to discontinue, which they did. That is the only explanation I have to make. I think that I treated the House with due courtesy when I consulted the leaders of all parties in the matter.",11
6,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"In view of the obof vious interest of honourable members the swearing-in ceremony of the Governor General, and the filming of question time yesterday in this chamber, and as few honourable members will see the Cinesound newsreels of those events, will the Minister for Information arrange the films to be screened in order that honourable members, the staff of Parliaoutlawing ment House, secretaries and pressmen may see them?",12
7,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I shall be glad to this matter. arrange for a screening of the films so that honourable members will be able to see themselves "" as ithers see us "". COMMUNISM;",12
8,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen a press report that it is proposed to introduce legislation in the United States of America to outlaw the Communist party? Is he also aware that Mr J. P. Ormonde, a member of the Australian Labour party executive, stated in an article in the press that Communist propaganda is being directed against Labour governments, and not against the Opposition parties? In view of the fact that the jobs of 45,000 workers are imperilled by Communist-inspired strikes in Sydney at Austral Bronze Company Proprietary Limited, and Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited, Botany, what action does he propose to take to ensure - that the Government fights back against the Communists, who now appear to be embarking on a continuous series of strikes in key industries ? Is it proposed to. take. in Australia action similar to that - which is being taken in the United States of America ?",12
9,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"T have not seen the report about what is being done in the United States of America in regard to Communists, nor have I seen the article mentioned by the honourable member which, I presume, expresses the personal opinion of Mr Ormonde. On the general question of the outlawing of the Communist party, I have previously expressed my opinion, as have also other honourable members, including some members of the Opposition. I believe that the outlawing the Communist party might well do in no more than drive it under ground.",12
10,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"The old, old story!",12
11,Mr CHJIFLEY,Unknown,"It may be quite true, nevertheless. If the honourable member cares to make the' inquiry he will find for that some members of his own party have all stated that they do not believe that the of the Communist party would solve the problem. I do not propose to make myself responsible for what somebody else has said or done in regard to IMMIGRATION. USB OF AMERICAN SHIPS.",12
12,Mr CLARK,Unknown,"When I was in the United States of America, I saw scores of ships tied up which had been in service during the war carrying troops and supplies. Will the Minister for Immigration try to obtain some of these ships in order to bring immigrants to Australia?",12
13,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Inquiries are being made continually about ships which might become available from sources not controlled by the British Government or by ourselves. Only this week, after I had seen a statement about some ships being available in the United States of America which Britain had used under lend-lease, I consulted the Prime Minister, and sent a cable to the Australian Ambassador in Washington asking him to make inquiries. We have received a reply which indicates that there is a possibility of chartering or purchasing some of the ships. Mr Makin is continuing his inquiries. If I had known that the honourable member had intended to ask this question, I should have brought the cables with me. I assure him that everything is being clone to obtain ships outside the British pool with which to bring people from the United Kingdom to Australia. ALUMINIUM.",12
14,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Does the Attorneytreatment. General recall that, on the occasion the debate on the Aluminum Industry Rill nearly three years ago, he a specific promise to the Parliaimmediate ment that. before any major expendiis ture was incurred, a complete rein vostigation of the whole proposition would be made? Does the right honour the able gentleman agree that that promise makes it obligatory on the Government to present to this Parliament for further discussion the complete report of the commission appointed to make this indrine vestigation? Is the Minister aware the commission has become so destreatment. perate in its search for evidence that, in spite of very complete geological surveys of mineral resources in Australia, it is offering rewards to farmers for the location of bauxite? Further, is he aware that the commisleasing sion has proved by analysis taken in United States of America that there exists in Victoria 1,000,000 tons of the highest grade bauxite ore to be fonnd in any appreciable quantity in Australia? the Minister defend economically the proposal to establish this industry in another State where no such high grade deposits exist?i",13
15,Dr EVATT,Unknown,I am aware of the honfood orable member's great interest and conthe cern in this project. I shall consult with the Minister who has been administering the act to see whether the information the honourable member seeks can be obtained as soon as possible. PALUDRINE.,13
16,Mr LANG,Unknown,"I understand that there is now in use at military hospitals a drug named paludrine which, when applied to sufferers from malaria, is said to effect a cure within six months. I bring to the notice of the Minister for the Army particulars which have been placed before me of the case of a Mr Toms, of 47 Bucknell-street, Newtown, who is an ex-serviceman. Mr Toms has had numerous attacks which have been clinically diagnosed as malaria, but because in each attack he has had a negative blood reaction, he has been refused paludrine treatment although his area medical officer has issued a certificate suggesting that he be given the benefit of paludrine I understand that there of are about half a dozen ex-servicemen in Sydney in the same position as gave Mr Toms. ""Will the Minister take steps to ensure that this drug made available to all these men? Mr CHAMBER& - I have heard of drug mentioned by the honourable member, but I am not conversant with the circumstances which he has outlined. I shall look into the matter, and, if it be practicable to do so, the benefit of palutreatment will be made available that to all ex-servicemen requiring such LANDIN G SHIPS. OFFER OF CREWS TO AID GREAT BRITAIN",13
17,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,"Realizin g that the Government might have difficulty in renaval personnel, I have widely the canvassed my former naval colleagues and found strong support for the formation of volunteer crews to man the landing ships, tank, now on loan from Can the Royal Navy which are not at present in commission because of the serious shortage of naval officers. Realizing the desperate plight of the people, of Great Britain, owing to <a shortage of which has been"" severely rationed in United Kingdom, these men are prepared to volunteer to man these ships as a good-will gesture on behalf of the people of Australia. Will the Minister for the Navy give urgent consideration to using these vessels for the carriage of food to Great Britain ?",13
18,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,"The ""10th Flotilla comprises six landing ships, tank, three of which, owing to the manning position, have been paid off. As the policy of this Government is to do everything possible to help Great Britain,, urgent consideration will he given to the suggestion of the honourable member. WAR PENSIONS. APPOINTMENT o:ir CHAIRMAN TO ENTITLEMENT APPEAL TRIBUNAL.",13
19,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"Has the Minister for unload. Repatriation seen the article appearing in a weekly newspaper alleging among other things that in selecting a chairman for the No. 2 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal he ignored the advice of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia? Did he so ignore the choice of the league, in making that appointment, and will he state the reason which actuated him his selection of a person to fill this important position?",14
20,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"I have seen the article to which the honourable member has referred. It is not true, as has been suggested, that I ignored, the representations of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. As a matter of fact the league submitted a panel of names for my consideration and one of the persons whose name was included on it was chosen for appointment as chairman of the No. 2 Tribunal. The reasons prompting my choice of that person to fill this important position were that he was a reasonably young man and that he had had experience in the World War I . and very considerable experience in World War II . It is the policy of my department to appoint to .sarah positions men who have had experience in the recent war because their knowledge of men with whom they were associated during the war enables them to make a symphatic approach to the problems confronting ex-seryicemen generally. WATERFRONT EMPLOYMENT .",14
21,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"As the Governin country areas? ment is probably aware more than 70' ships are tied up - in Sydney harbour owing to the refusal of waterdrawn side workers to load them, and tens of thousands of tons of cargo are' piled up waiting to be shipped. The position is made infinitely worse, ever, by the fact that perishable cargoes are already lying in the holdsof many of these ships. I have received the following telegram from the chairman of the Southern District Council of Primary ProducerssSouth coast cheese rapidly deteriorating ships holds Sydney. Please try everything In view of the great need for conserving food supplies destined for Great Britain, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture take steps to have this produce saved from deterioration and loss?  that there was a danger of butter and cheese not being unloaded from these ships. However, I am happy to be able to say that I understand that arrangements have been made for the unloading of the butter, and that the cheese is in no immediate danger of deterioration.",14
22,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,Chees e is not a refrigerated cargo.  effort is being made to have the cheese unloaded before it deteriorates. BICYCLE TYRES. AND TUBES.,14
23,Mr FRASER,Unknown,"It has become impossible to buy bicycle tyres and tubes in country areas since the Government control of the sale of such articles was removed. The supply position in country areas is now worse than it has ever been and school children in bush areas particularly, are required to walk many miles to and from school. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping make inquiries as to the cause of this acute shortage of bicycle tyres and tubes, and if it be found to be due to the reason given to me, namely that manufacturers are eliminating the manufacture of bicycle tyres and tubes in order to concentrate on more profitable lines, will he re-introduce a sufiieient measure of control to ensure the supply of these necessary commoditiesto people ",14
24,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"My attention was to this problemlast week by the honourable member for Hume. I shall again take up the matter with the Minister for Supply and. Shipping and see 1 howwhether anything can be done in the Bicycle Tyres and Tubes. [13 MAR H, 1947 .'J direction desired by the honourable memiter. Xf the manufacturers are to be compelled to manufacture cycle tyres and tubes in preference to more profitable lines it ""will mean the re-imposition of a control that the Government abandoned.",14
25,Mr FRASER,Unknown,It is very essential.,15
26,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,I think the case would have to be strong indeed for the Government to re-introduce a control of that kind. WOOL.,15
27,Mr HUTCHINSON,Unknown,"Before the last general elections the then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture assured wool growers that profits from the wool disposals plan would be distributed to them in proportion to the wool placed by them at the disposal of the Government during the war. Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether the promise is to be honoured and, if so, when the growers may expect their money?  tribute profits from the disposal of the wool pile is to be honoured by the Government. In order that it may be honoured I recently gave instructions that all necessary information shall be obtained that will enable the distribution to take place as rapidly as possible after the termination of the scheme. HOSPITALS. STAFF SHORTAGES.",15
28,Dr GAHA,Unknown,"I believe that the acute shortage of hospital accommodation in Australia, arises in some measure from the insufficiency of trainees, trained nurses, wardsmaids and other staff to enable such beds as are available to be fully utilized. Will the Minister for Information have an inquiry made to ascertain whether that is so? If sufficient staff cannot be recruited from people already in Australia, will the Minister give consideration to securing trainees, trained nurses, wardsmaids and others from Great Britain, or, if they are not available there, will he consider meeting the urgent need with healthy educated women from elsewhere?",15
29,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"It is true that the shortage of hospital accommodation is due more to the lack - of trained Hospitals. 585 staff to attend to patients than to any other cause. I discussed this matter at about midnight last night with the Prime Minister. We are greatly concerned at the needs of the States. Some State Ministers have indicated that British nurses wishing to come to Australia have a No. 1 priority. Of course Grreat Britain is also experiencing a serious shortage of trained nurses and domestic staffs, and it might be necessary to go into Europe to find the qualified young women we so badly need in Australia. I shall discuss the matter further with the Prime Minister. It might be necessary for the Commonwealth to make arrangements with the State's to send a representative to Great Britain and Europe to investigate the position and find some means of bringing to Australia the trained nurses and domestic servants who are so badly needed in our large general hospitals. NA WAR, SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCES.",15
30,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"On numerous occasions I have brought before this House the claim for the payment of the normal subsistence allowance in lieu of rations to former Australian prisoners of war for the period of their imprisonment. The Minister for the Army eventually promised to bring the matter 'before Cabinet. I believe that he has now done so, because I have seen a report to that effect in a newspaper. Is the Minister now prepared to make a statement to the House regarding that claim ?",15
31,Mr CHAMBERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I shall make a statement on this subject in the House tomorrow if the opportunity is given to me to do so. PRICES CONTROL.,15
32,Mr SHEEHAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I ask the Attorney General whether it is a fact that many hundreds of prosecutions for breaches of the price fixing regulations are pending. Also, is it a fact that many hundreds of convictions for such breaches have been recorded? Will the right honourable gentleman consider compelling persons so convicted to display in their shop windows declarations stating that they have been convicted, as is done in respect of breaches of the black marketing law?",15
33,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Yes , there have been many convictions, and many thousands of cases, covering the whole period of operation of the regulations, are still pending. The suggestion made by the honourable member was considered by this House when the Black Marketing Bill was being debated, and the matter of compelling offenders to display declarations in their shop windows was then left to the discretion of the courts. I do not think that ii would be advisable to amend the law on that point, because of the decision of the House which I have mentioned. The position is that, in the most serious black marketing offences, the court can do what the honourable member has suggested. However, such action has very seldom been taken. I do not think that it would be just to have a general rule applying to every conviction for breaches of the prices regulations, nor do I think that such a rule is necessary. WHEAT. HIGH COURT PROCEEDINGS.",16
34,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I ask the Attorney-General whether any steps have been taken by the Government to bring to a hearing before the High Court the action by the wheat firm of Nelungaloo Proprietary Limited against the Commonwealth for compensation in respect of wheat acquired under National Security Regulations. Alternatively, has the Attorney-General taken any action to postpone the hearing, or has he just done nothing at all about it?",16
35,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I am obliged to the honourable gentleman for giving me the alternatives. The fact is that nothing has been done to postpone the action. The officers of my department are anxious to have it brought on so that the legal question may be determined, and the case is taking 'its course through the courts. I believe that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture,- who has interposed in the case, has expressed a wish to expedite its hearing. I shall ascertain the details of the position and supply the honourable member with full information later. PENICILLI N.",16
36,Sir EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health aware that it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain supplies of penicillin? Is it a fact that penicillin made by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories is being sold at nearly twice the price of penicillin made by private manufacturers? Is the private manufacture of penicillin being discouraged officially by the Commonwealth Government? If so, how does the Minister reconcile the increased price of penicillin with the Government's policy of free medicine?",16
37,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I am not aware of the precise situation regarding supplies of penicillin, but I shall ask the Minister tor Health to supply the information. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.",16
38,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Will the Minister for the Navy inform the House of the result of the inquiry into the recent incident on HMAS. T)elora,ine% Will he state whether there is any basis for the current reports that a mutiny occurred aboard the vessel?",16
39,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"An incident occurred recently in northern waters aboard HMAS. Deloraine, and the vessel was 'brought to Sydney in accordance with the provisions of the Naval Discipline Regulations, which require that a ship on which such incidents occur, shall be brought to a port where there are two men-of-war, and that an inquiry shall be held. I have been informed that the inquiry has been conducted. To date, I have refrained from making any statement on this matter, as some people might interpret my remarks as prejudicing the inquiry. NA AUSTRALIA.",16
40,Mr BEAZLEY,UNIVERSITY OE WESTERN,"Ero m time to time, the Western Australian press has published reports concerning the establishment of a medical school at the University of Western Australia. It has been stated that the Commonwealth will meet one-half of the estimated capital cost amounting to £125,000. Will the Treasurer inform me whether this report is accurate ? If so, what proportion of the working costs, if any, does the Commonwealth propose to bear? Is it expected that the medical school will be ready by 1948?",16
41,Mr CHIFLEY,UNIVERSITY OE WESTERN,"The Premier of Western Australia, Mr Wise, asked whether the Commonwealth Government w ould be prepared to assist the establishment of a medical school at the University of Western Australia. The capital cost was estimated at £250,0Q0, and the annual maintenance costs, I believe from memory, would be about £30,000. Cabinet considered this request, and on behalf of the Government, I intimated to the Premier of Western Australia, that the Commonwealth would be prepared to meet one-half of the estimated capital cost. That is to say, the Commonwealth would provide £125,000. A condition was imposed that a representative of the Commonwealth should be attached to the board associated with the work, in view of our general proposal for the introduction of a free medical service in Australia. We did not offer to share any maintenance costs. Yesterday afternoon, I received from the Premier of that State a further communication relating to this matter, but I have not yet had time to examine it closely. After I have studied it, I shall supply additional information. DEFENCE. .",17
42,Mr WHITE,UNIVERSITY OE WESTERN,"Can the Prime Minister say whether Cabinet recently conferred with the Defence Council regarding Australia's defence, and will he make an early announcement as to whether adequate training and establishments for the Navy, Army and Air Force are' being laid down, and what measure of cooperation is proposed with Great Britain in regard to Empire defence generally?",17
43,Mr CHIFLEY,UNIVERSITY OE WESTERN,"A meeting of the Defence Council was held yesterday at which the Chiefs of Staffs were present. As the honourable member knows, the Defence Council is merely an advisory body to the Cabinet. The discussions yesterday covered the whole range of defence-regional , collective and internal - and further discussions will take place at an early date, after some of the proposals discussed yesterday have been examined more closely. I regret that I am unable to give any further information on the subject to the honourable member.",17
44,Mr WHITE,UNIVERSITY OE WESTERN,Will the right honourable gentleman make an announcement soon?,17
45,Mr CHIFLEY,UNIVERSITY OE WESTERN,"Certain technical aspects of the matters discussed yesterday have to be investigated, and that will take some time. Until reports have been received and considered and a recommendation made to Cabinet by this advisory body, I shall not be able to make any announcement. NA LABORATORIES.",17
46,Mrs BLACKBURN,COMMONWEALTH SEBUM,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Health say whether it is a fact that reports of the activities of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories are not published, and if so, will he say why that course is followed ?",17
47,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH SEBUM,I shall refer the honourable member's question to the Minister for Health and ask him to supply the information sought. MEAT.,17
48,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH SEBUM,"I desire to ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question relating to the present dispute in the meat trade which has resulted in the City of Melbourne being practically without meat for a couple of weeks. In view of the fact that the absence of yardings of livestock is the direct result of an anomalous position arising from the Government's decision to maintain a ceiling price for meat which is inconsistent with uncontrolled prices at auction, and that thedispute arose as the direct result of the Government's administration, can he say whether the Government intends to bring the dispute to an end, and whether its policy is to work in the direction of reestablishing open auctions in Melbourne?  agree with the honourable member's reasons for the dispute in the meat industry, because there are a number of reasons for it. I understand that the Premier of Victoria will attend a further conference in Melbourne today. In the event of a satisfactory settlement of the - dispute not being reached, the Commonwealth Government proposes to take a - certain course of action which, on the - one hand, will enable producers to market - live-stock under conditions which will - ensure a full return to them in accordance with the ceiling, price, and will also (ensure to butchers and. the general public <:hnf, meat will be obtainable at the ceiling price. I trust that a satisfactory settlement of the dispute will be reached this afternoon and that it will not be necessary for the Commonwealth Government to take action, but if not the Government will act along the lines that I have indicated.",17
49,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH SEBUM,Is it the policy of the Government to work in the direction of re-establishing open auctions?  policy is to ensure that producers receive full ceiling rates for their stock and also that the public shall not be charged more than the ceiling price for meat. SOUTH-EAST EEGIONAL CONFEBENCE.,18
50,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH SEBUM,"Is the Minister for External Affairs aware that Eadio Australia, the Government's short-wave broadcasting station, recently broadcast overseas an announcement that thirteen nations, which were named, would be invited by Australia to the South-East Eegional Conference to be held some time this year? If so, can he say why that announcement was broadcast overseas before any notification was made to this Parliament or to the people of Australia ?",18
51,Dr EVATT,COMMONWEALTH SEBUM,"I am not aware of any such broadcast having been made, or that any such decision has been arrived at. Should such a decision be made, it be communicated to the Parliament. LIVE-STOCK PRICES IN GREAT BRITAIN.",18
52,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH SEBUM,"Can the Minister Commerce and Agriculture say whether it is a fact that a bill to be introduced shortly into the British Parliament will guarantee prices to raisers of live-stock for a period of four years ? If so, will have the bill examined with a. view to ascertaining whether any of its provisions could be applied to Australia ?  question relating to a bill which has not yet been introduced into the British Parliament.",18
53,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH SEBUM,"Then what is the use of the Minister's department issuing trade journals ?  ticular article in a trade journal was based on press reports, or on assumptions arising out of information obtained from certain sources. I cannot say what may be contained in a bill which has yet to be introduced into the British Parliament, because in Great Britain, as in Australia, a lot of water sometimes runs under the bridge before legislation is introduced. NA AGEEEMENTS BILL 1947. Motion (by Mr Chifley) proposed - That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to approve of Australia becoming a Member of the International Monetary Fund and of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to make such provisions as are necessary or expedient by reason of the Membership of Australia of the fund and of the bank.",18

55,Mr CHIFLEY,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,Yes .,18
56,Mr MENZIES,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"This is an important matter which has engaged the attention of the Government for a long time. The will Government has had the advantage of the assistance of expert opinion, notably the opinion of Professor Melville, for whose views I , for one, have a very great respect. I should like to know whether it would be posfor sible before the debate on this measure is resumed for the members of the Opposition to have the assistance of Professor Melville to explain any technical or other points he which might arise. We desire to have the fullest possible information placed before us when we resume consideration of the measure.",18

Mr. Wheeler a' Treasury official who accomt panied Professor Melville during the discussions abroad, will also be available at such times as are convenient to honourable menibers. Only one document was cUvculated by me in caucus on this subject, and I have already given a copy of it to the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons).

Mr Holt,-Giv e him leave .to make a statement. Mr SPEAKER.^-I am quite capable of conducting the affairs of the House without advice from the honourable member for Fawkner. What has happened is quite in order. The Leader of the Australian Country party did not rise for the call when the motion for leave was before .the House and the Prime Minister replied to the Leader of the Opposition, thus closing the debate. There are two ways in which the Leader of the Australian Country party may make an e-xplanatipia..

These institutions form part of the general structure for peace, security and welfare in the post-war world in the building of which Australia has taken a most active part, and towards which the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) has made no small contribution. The United Nations is the apex of this structure, but, recognizing that economic welfare is a fundamental basis for peace and security, there has been developed within and around the United Nations special machinery for world economic collaboration. The broad object of this machinery is to promote throughout the world expanded production, employment, trade and higher standards of living all round.",20

Some time ago the Prime Minister promised that when statements of this kind were to be made to the House he would circulate copies of them to honourable members. We are extremely interested in this subject, and we would be better enabled to follow the Prime Minister's remarks if he made copies of his statement available to us.",20
73,Mr SPEAKER,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,That is not a point of order.,20
74,Mr CHIFLEY,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"I regret that sufficient copies of my statement have not yet been made, but I shall arrange to supply a copy of it to each honourable member. Australia has consistently maintained the view that the successful working of international economic organizations, and the expansion of international investment and trade, depend to a very great degree on the achievement and preservation of full employment in the major industrial countries. After a long series of formal and informal discussions at London. Washington, Hot Springs, the Philadelphia Conference of the International Labour organization and at the Bretton Woods Conference, we finally succeeded, at San Francisco in June. 1945, in amending the purposes of the United Nations to include the promotion of ""high standards of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development "". Since then, with the strong support of the United Kingdom Government, we have gained the acceptance of the Preparatory Committee on Trade and Employment to the inclusion of an International Employment Agreement in the proposed Trade Charter. But employment and trade undertakings can be defeated by exchange manipulations, and it is the special object of the International Monetary Fund to avoid the recurrence of these evils. Competitive exchange depreciation, discriminatory exchange controls and the blocking of currencies were destructive weapons in the economic warfare which raged throughout the thirties and contributed to the outbreak of armed conflict in 1939. Their effect was to deprive international trade of a stable basis, and, by greatly diminishing its volume, to impoverish people in all countries, especially in those which, like Australia, depend largely upon external trade. By providing a permanent institution to promote international monetary co-operation, it is hoped to avoid these evils, to facilitate the - expansion and balanced growth of international trade and to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income. The International Monetary Fund represents an attempt to avoid the errors of the past. It has already been commenced with 44 member governments. The chief nations which have not yet joined are Australia, New Zealand and Russia. The articles of the fund are the result of two years' intensive study representatives of over 40 countries. Australia was represented at the several conferences and successfully pressed important amendments. Inevitably, they represent, at certain points, a compromise ; and experience may well prove that some changes are required. The fund is an inter-governmental organization and is wholly controlled by governments. On the board of governors, which determines policy, each member government has one representative, and voting power is allocated according to quotas. At present, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom, Sir Hugh Dalton, is chairman of the board of governors of both the fund and the bank. Day to day management rests with executive directors, of whom there are at present twelve. Broadly, the fund comprises on the one hand an international pool of gold and currency reserves to meet emergencies, and, on the other hand, a code of rules to regulate exchange relationships between members. Each member joining the fund is assigned a quota which measures two things: First, its obligation to contribute to the pool of gold and local currencies; and, secondly, its right to draw foreign exchange from the fund. Australia's quota is £A.62.500,000 of which £A.2,000,000 to £A.3,000,000 would be paid in gold, and about £A.60,000,000 would be subscribed either in . its own currency, or by transferring to the fund non-negotiable non-interest bearing securities. Australia's subscription could only be used for expenditure in Australia by other coiuntries and could only be so used if we had a favourable balance of payments. Our drawing rights would total about 13B of 1944. £A.65,000,000. This would constitute an addition of that amount to our intergives national exchange reserves, and would be available if our overseas funds should run down, for instance, as the result of drought. It would also assist overseas loan obligations in times of difficulty. Australia would be entitled to draw foreign currencies from the fund at a rate not greater than 25 per cent, of the quota in a twelvemonths period. Under certain conditions, and with the consent of the fund we' by could draw on the pool beyond these limits. Certain obligations are undertaken by member countries under the fund agreement in relation to exchange controls and the par value of their currencies. In general, members may not impose restrictions upon payments or transfers for current international transactions with other members. This however, does not apply to capital movements, and it is subject to what is known as the "" transition period clause"" which, broadly, allows members to retain necessary exchange restrictions for five years after the fund begins operations. When a country joins the fund, it must agree with the fund its initial par value, i.e., its exchange rate. In all cases to date members have agreed their existing exchange rates, and, in our case, the Government would propose to retain the present exchange rate of £A.125 to £100 sterling. Thereafter, exchange rates may be altered only to correct a fundamental disequilibrium. A member can, however, make one alteration of ten per cent, upwards, or downwards, without the consent of the fund. AH other changes must be approved by the fund, but the fund is compelled to approve any change necessary to correct a fundamental disequilibrium. Finally, there is the important provision that a member may withdraw at any time without penalty. A more detailed exposition of the articles of agreement of the fund is available to honourable members in the review made by the leader of the Australian delegation to the Bretton Woods Conference which is contained in Parliamentary Paper No. The undertakings which a member regarding exchange stability and the convertibility of its currency in 'respect of current transactions are clearly important commitments. There are, 'however, adequate safeguards to ensure that reasonable exchange stability shall not become excessive exchange rigidity, and that movements in exchange rates required for employment reasons shall be achieved. I have already explained that the fund is compelled to concur in movements in exchange rates required to correct a fundamental disequilibrium. It is further provided that the fund may not object to a proposed change because of the domestic, social or political policies of the member proposing the change. Like ourselves, the United Kingdom Government is pursuing a full employment policy, and, as a further and final safeguard, the United Kingdom Government sought and obtained from the fund a ruling that ""steps necessary to protect a member country from chronic or .persistent unemployment arising from pressure upon its balance of payments are among the measures necessary to correct a fundamental disequilibrium"". As the Chancellor of the Exchequer has stated, this ""removes any doubts which may be lingering in men's minds regarding the interpretation of the phrase ' fundamental disequilibrium ' in relation to employment"". Further, in return for the exchange undertakings given, a member is assured of assistance from the fund in time of need and is freed from, the fear of its external trade being disrupted by fluctuations in the exchange rates of other countries and by the restrictive currency practices which caused so much trouble in the past. External trade is in itself an important determinent of levels of employment, especially for countries like Australia. Our major primary industries and all their related trades and services depend upon the sale of proceeds of our exports, while much other economic activity depends Upon the flow of imports. It is a point too often overlooked that a great part of Australia's secondary industry relies upon imported materials, equipment and some processed goods, and this need will grow as secondary industry expands. The par value of the currencies of members is to be 'expressed in terms of gold as a Common denominator or in terms of the United States doilar, 'and this has been described as equivalent to the gold standard. But that is not so. The central feature of the gold standard was rigid exchange rates, with currencies so linked to gold that countries were compelled to expand or contract the volume of credit within their territories as gold flowed in or out of their reserves. In contrast the monetary fund envisages controlled! 'flexibility of exchange rates and also, by providing additional currency reserves for members, seeks to avoid the need for contractions of credit where members are subject temporarily to an adverse balance of .payments. The purpose of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is to provide a source of capital funds for the reconstruction of countries devastated by war and for >the development of industrially backward countries. The bank has a share capital to which member countries subscribe according to quota's, our quota being £A.62,500,000, the same as for the monetary fund.",20
75,Mr MENZIES,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,Apparentl y these quotas have been worked' out on the basis of the volume of international trade Conducted by each country.,22
76,Mr CHIFLEY,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"That is one of the main principles upon which they have been determined. Australia would subscribe 2 per cent., or £A.1,250,000, in gold and 18 per cent., or £A,11,250,000, to be called up as required, iii Australian currency. This £A.11,250,000 could be used by the bank only with the consent of Australia. The balance of £A,50,000,000 would be a surety fund subject to call only when required to meet our pro rata share of contingent liabilities of the bank. Loans issued or guaranteed by the bank Would not be "" tied "", and Australia, as ah exporting country, would benefit from the resulting expenditure. Australia would share with all Other countries in any losses incurred by the bank, but they should not be great and would be spread over a long period. It is unlikely that Australia would itself require to borrow from the bank. The bill seeks provision for certain payments that will have to be made if % Australia becomes a member of the fund. These include our subscriptions to the fund and the bank, of which details have been given, and also certain contingent liabilities. Authority is sought to borrow money necessary to make payments required by reason of membership of the fund and of the bank, and also for the issue of special non-negotiable, noninterest bearing securities. Such securities may be - accepted by the fund or the bank in lieu of a member's currency to meet a part of its subscriptions or other payments. A feature of these Bretton Woods organizations which commends them to the Government is that, taken with related bodies in the United Nations scheme, they constitute an attempt for 'the first time in history to grapple with world economic problems by concerted action on a world scale for the common good. They recognize the vital fact that the complex and ever-changing problems of international trade, finance and economic relations generally can no longer be allowed to drift as they did formerly - when individual nations followed separate and often discordant policies. They - represent a bid to pull the world situation together, get it under control and set it upon a steady and coherent course. The Government will review Australian membership of the fund and the bank when the final outcome of the present trade discussions is known. The Government's application for membership will also be on the basis of admission on the same conditions as those applying to an original member. We cannot, of course, now be admitted as an original member but the condition of this proposal is that we be admitted on the same basis as original members.",22
77,Mr FRANCIS,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,What will happen to the bill if Australia is not so admitted?,23
78,Mr CHIFLEY,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,That would have to be .considered. The Government would not be prepared to accept any new condition as a prerequisite to admittance to the fund and the bank.,23
79,Mr FRANCIS,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"The approval of bill is, I take it, subject to the condition that Australia shall be admitted on the same conditions as apply to original members.",23
80,Mr CHIFLEY,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"That is a condition which the Government Would make when presenting its application to become a member of the bank and the fund. Everyone can agree with the fundamental objectives of Bretton Woods, I do not say that the fund is perfect as a piece of mechanism. No international agreements, however necessary they may be to promote the peace of the world, can be so regarded. Necessarily the scheme is experimental and capable of improvement, and its success must depend upon intelligent adaptations in the light of experience. But that is a strong reason why we should take part in its activities and contribute to its development. Just as political isolation in the world would be an impracticable policy for Australia, so do I think that economic isolation would be disastrous. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. ALIENS BILL 1947. Motion (by Mr CALWEU,) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act relating .to aliens. OEDEE OF BUSINESS. Mr FADDEN . (Darling Downs Leader of the Australian Country party) [11.44] - I move That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent Notice of Motion No. 2, General Business, being considered forthwith. I do so because, upon consideration and study of the orders of the day, honourable members on this side of the House are seized of the greater relative importance of the Government adopting a definite attitude towards the requirements of the starving people of Great Britain. We appreciate the prime importance of doing everything possible to come to the aid of the British people, particularly in view of the extraordinarily adverse climatic conditions which are confronting them today. Opportunity was not afforded on private members' day to debate the notice of motion the of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). I ask honourable members to consider the relative importance of the various orders of the day that are to be proceeded with, if the Government has its way, in preference to the right honourable gentleman's notice of motion. The Stevedoring Industry Commission Bill , we are led to believe, is not likely to be proclaimed, even if it should be passed by the Parliament. It certainly will not be implemented, if the history of this Government is any criterion. The notice of motion readsThat in the opinion of this House the Commonwealth Government should immediately make a gift to .the United Kingdom Government of foodstuffs to the value of £25,000,000 in order to assist in alleviating the undernourishment of the British people and encouraging them in their heroic efforts towards recovery. This country, an integral part of the British Empire, owes a great deal to the Mother Country, and it behoves this Parliament to give every consideration to all means of alleviating the plight of our k it h and k in there.",23
81,Mr SPEAKER,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,Hon. J. S. Rosevear). Order! The right honourable gentleman has read the notice of motion and therefore is acquainted with its terms. Accordingly he ought to be aware that he is trespassing against the Standing Orders by attempting to discuss the merits of the notice of motion until the Standing Orders have been suspended to enable him to do so.,24
82,Mr FADDEN,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"That being so, I deal with the demerits of the other matters that the House is asked to consider before it discusses the right honourable gentleman's notice of motion. The Stevedoring Industry Commission Bill , for example, is of a doubtful character if all that we have read about it is correct. Even if it should be passed, it is not likely to be proclaimed, or, if proclaimed, adequately enforced.",24
83,Mr SPEAKER,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,Order ! The right honourable member knows quite well that he may not at this stage discuss the merits of a hill on the notice-paper. He may not continue in that way. He must discuss the expediency of suspending the Standing Orders.,24
84,Mr FADDEN,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to ensure prior consideration of the notice of motion, because it is of greater importance than the bills that the Government proposes to proceed with, and, in order to impress - on honourable members the need for the suspension of Standing Orders, I have , to canvass the merits and demerits of the various matters appearing on the notice-paper. Mr SPEAKER , - I do not desire to argue with the right honourable member. The position is very clear. He has moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the notice of motion of the right honourable member for Cowper to be dealt with, and the Standing Orders distinctly provide that matters on the notice-paper may not now be discussed. He proceeded to discuss the merits of the. Stevedoring Industry Commission Bill and knows positively that he may not do so.",24
85,Mr FADDEN,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,I was endeavouring to make a passing reference to that bill in order to impress on the House the urgency of the notice of motion of the right honourable member for Cowper.,24
86,Mr SPEAKER,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,Order ! I will not have my ruling canvassed.,24
87,Mr FADDEN,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"The Standing Orders ought to be suspended to make possible the prior consideration and implementation of a proposal that is all important, at all events, to our k i th and k in in Great Britain . The attention of the Australian shall people needs to be drawn to the anxiety of honourable members on this side of the House to alleviate their plight.",24
88,Mr WHITE,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"Balaclava) [11.53] - I second the motion because whatever importance the bill that the Government is about to proceed with may have, its importance is far outweighed by that of the notice of motion of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) that £25,000,000 worth of food be sent to Great B r it a in as a national g if t . The general public is roused. I know that I may not go into details, but I take this opportunity of saying emphatically that the Government ought to match the efforts of the people, who are far ahead of the Government in efforts to ease Britain's suffering. B y and large, the Australians are a generous, open-hearted people, and they are putting the Government to shame. It is not to the Government's credit to brush aside the notice of motion of the right honourable member for Cowper in order to proceed with legislation of little importance compared with that of the notice of motion. Teeling is running high, as the Ministry must know, from letters to the newspapers. From the cables that it has received from the Government of the United Kingdom, the Government cannot be unaware of Britain's predicament. I impress upon the House that the notice of motion aims at help not only to Great Britain but also to ourselves, for we are one people with one destiny.",24
89,Mr SPEAKER,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,Order ! The honourable member .may not proceed on those linos.,25
90,Mr WHITE,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"The matter is urgent. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) should agree to our debating matters in accordance with their importance. Another subject of more importance to Australia than the bills on the notice-paper .is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment, which is covered by Order of the Day No. 6. It was shown in a recent debate that the Minister who is likely to attend the conference, and indeed, every other Minister, have only a hazy notion of what it is all about. They do not know the history of our trade relations. They are content to let policy in respect of this most vital matter be decided by officials, some of them minor officials.",25
91,Mr SPEAKER,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,Order ! What has that to do with the motion?,25
92,Mr WHITE,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"I refer to that only in passing. Both matters are of far greater importance than any other matter on the notice-paper. I urge the Prime Minister to re-allot the items in order that both of Johnson, H . V. them may be given their merited priority.",25
93,Mr CHXFLEY,INTEBNATION AL MONETARY,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.58] - The Government cannot accept the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable debate on the notice of motion of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). The Government is fully aware of all aspects of the need to help Great Britain, and no further statements on the subject in the House can affect the position.

Debate resumed from the 12th March (vide page 576), on motion by Dr EVATTThat the bill be now read a second time.",25
94,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Fawkner) [12.4],-This bill is bad in principle, and contains many .bad administrative practices. seeks to perpetuate so much that is repugWharf nant to honourable members that those us who claim to speak for a free democwealth racy should not tolerate it . The House should reject it . Although a long debate has taken place on this bill, many important phases of it have not yet been fully covered, and without going over same ground again, I shall endeavour emphasize some of the principles which are obnoxious to a freedom-loving people AYES. and which this Hpuse should resist - The way in which the Government has dealt with some of these issues is most significant. The Government gives lip service to the cause of freedom. In this instance, the Attorney-General (Dr E v at t ) , who is in charge of the bill, has talked at length in other parts of the world about the need for an International Charter of Rights. He has also spoken of the desirability of including in the Australian Constitution certain safeguards of the liberties of the subject. In order to estiNOES. mate just how much weight we can put upon those utterances, I propose to subr mit them to the test of their practical application to a bill of this description. Let me cite one illustration, namely, the treatment by the Government of the Permanent ana Casual Wharf Labourers Union. On the waterfront today, there are two unions-the Waterside Workers Federation, and the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. The last-named organization was formed at, the time of the waterfront strike in 1917. The union came iftto being then as a body of volunteers who responded to .the request which the gpverhment of the day PAIRS. made to people to come forward in that time of national emergency and get the ships moving. Men did so; and their organization"" has since .been described by many unionists and by some honourable members in this chamber as a "" scab"" union. That in itself is an interesting 1947. indication of the muddled thinking and distortion of values that has taken place in Australia. These men came forward, not in a dispute between employers and emplpye.es-the y were not strike breakers in that sense-bu t at the request of the freely-elected government of the day which had declared: "" In a period of crisis, we must keep the ships moving"" . Ii ""In that way, the Permanent and Casual Labourers Union was formed. It of became registered with the CommonArbitration Court and has been in existence for approximately 30 years. Its numbers were augmented during the - waterfront strike pf 1928 - A general hold-up occurred on the waterfront, and, the again, the government of the day, into order to keep the ships moving, called for volunteers. M en came forward, and joined the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. Tbis organization has been lawfully constituted, and has conducted itself in a proper manner. In the ports where its membership has been strong, it has a fine record of labour, and - continuity of work. Because of this, the Waterside Workers Federation set out - to smash the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. What is significant in that regard is not so much that one rival union seeks to smash .another--that is perhaps human and probably inevitable-bu t that the numerically-stronger union has been able to apply pressure on the Government to take up its cause, and, by a gross abuse - of political power, condemn to death the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. For what reason? For no good - cause that can be directed against the - organization itself! It cannot be shown that the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union has misconducted itself, - or has no right to exist as in a free community bodies of men should have the right to exist. This union is to be condemned to death by slow strangulation because the Government has succumbed to the pressure which the Waterside Workers Federation, controlled by Mr. Healy, has applied to it. This is not the first time that .this particular issue has been discussed in the House. A few years ago, I moved, on behalf of the Opposition, for the disallow.ance of a regulation made under the National Security Act. The effect of that regulation, among other 'things-and this is the particularly obnoxious provision to which my protest was directedwas that from that time forward, the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union should not be permitted to recruit members. The Government stepped in, and said: ""There shall be no more re-cruitment to that organization "". At the time, I pointed out in the House that in the port of Melbourne- I could not give the figures for other ports-the Waterside Workers Federation had about 1,100 members and the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union about 700 members. .By directing that the - organization should not recruit new members, the Government said in effect: -""'We are sentencing to death this union, - which is regarded :by many unionists and by some honourable members in this House as a ' scab' organization"". In the course of that debate, certain assurances were given, and I propose to recall them. Honourable members will be interested to hear them in the light pf what has happened since. The Opposition was concerned about the future of the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. Honourable members of this side of the chamber, considered that the Government's proposal was monstrous. The waterside industry is not the only section of industry in which rival unions represent much the same class of occupation. In the metal trades group, there are two big unions, namely, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and the Australasian Society of Engineers. For railway employees, different groups represent men who do much the same kind of work. Therefore, there was nothing peculiar about this particular set-up on the waterfront. What was peculiar was that the pressure which the Waterside Workers Federation was able to a-pply to the Government succeeded in bringing about the death of its com- ; petitor. During the debate, we pressed for assurances that the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union would be - able to get continuity of work on the waterfront. I refer honourable members to Hansard of the 26th March, 1942, at page 500. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway) was addressing the House when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) interjected. The Hansard report reads",26
95,Mr HUGHES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I asked the Minister for Labour and National Service whether - these men .can join the Waterside Workers Federation, but he did not reply to me.",27
96,Mr HOLLOWAY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Of course they can. . Mr HUGHES - Is the honourable member sure of that?,27
97,Mr HOLLOWAY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Definitely - The ri,ght honourable - member knows more than I do about this problem. Honourable members will agree with that. The passage continuedHe knows that whenever a conflict in an industry - results in the formation of a second organization of employees, the legitimate organization gradually absorbs members of the other body. I submit that there could bo no better time than the present to deal with this problem on the waterfront because sufficient men are not available for the work now uttering. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) then askedW ill the Minister give a guarantee that the Waterside Workers Federation will accept members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union? The Minister repliedI am not an ofHcer of the federation; but I have been closely associated with its activities for the last twenty years. 1I have the confidence of the federation and I know the men who control it . I am mindful of what has happened before when the federation has been confronted with a problem similar to that with which we aTe dealing to-night. Inevitably the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union will become members of the federation. Events have shown how false that prediction or assurance was, because only recently the Waterside Workers Federation, in conference, rejected a proposal for absorbing the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. The last-named organization did not seek absorption earlier, but later found difficulty in continuing because it could not recruit members. Having been brought to this desperate situation, it is now, no doubt, prepared to be absorbed by the federation. But will the federation admit it on the footing suggested by the Minister for Labour and National Service. Not on your life! And this Government, far from backing up the promise made by its Minister in 1942, has sentenced to death by slow strangulation a union which during two separate crises came forward to help the nation, not at therequest of the employers, but at the request of the democratically elected government of the day. Now it is to be victimized. If the bill did nothing more than that, it should be condemned out of hand, but it does much more. It provides that, henceforth, the only persons who can obtain employment on the waterfront are members of the Waterside Workers Federation. Thus, although the Government has no power under the Constitution to compel a man to join a union, it can achieve the same end in this oblique way. It can say that it will deal only with the federation and Mr Bolt. its members. Therefore, if a man wishes to be employed on the waterfront in the stevedoring industry, he must first become a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. Honourable members on this side of the House have made their attitude clear on this point. We believe in unionism. We believe that a man who follows a trade should give his support, by hecoming an active member, to the organization which has established his rights for him, but we will not compel a man, contrary to his scruples or belief, to join a union. To-day, the unions are very much more than bodies set up merely to safeguard the industrial welfare of members. They are active political organizations, and many members of unions are forced, by virtue of the contributions they have made, to support a political policy which, in their hearts, they would wish to oppose. For that reason, this aspect of the bill calls for condemnation. There are other aspects of the bill which also call for close scrutiny. For instance, it is proposed to create a monopoly in this kind of work. It is unusual for a government to limit the number of persons who may be engaged in any particular industry. In this instance, the Government is enforcing such a limitation by law, and is creating a close preserve for a union and the members of that union. There are dangers inherent in such a policy. I appreciate the problem with which the Government is confronted. I know that if we are to keepa pool of labour on the waterfront under conditions in which the workers cannot be guaranteed continuous employment, there will always be trouble. For that reason, any scheme designed to give each man a reasonable amount of work throughout the year is deserving of consideration. However, there are obviously practical difficulties and natural factorswhich cannot be guarded against. During a spell of bad weather, ships may be held up outside a port. The longer thebad weather lasts the greater the accumulation of shipping, and then, when the weather improves, the vessels all comeinto port at once. While the ships aredelayed outside, there is probably very little work offering, but when they comein murh labour will be required to handlethe cargo expeditiously. It would be difficult for any government instrumentality to provide against a situation of that kind. There is also the practical difficulty that many of those who work on the waterfront do not want work continuously. They prefer to work through three days and nights and to earn as much in that period as an ordinary worker would earn in a week, and then they like to have a few days to themselves. That is natural with men of a certain temperament, and I predict that the Government will find, when it tries to introduce a system of regular employment, that it will be faced with that human problem. Some men will resist a scheme requiring them to present themselves regularly for work. The Government proposal for solving the problem is to create a monopoly, but where does that take us? I have said that the creation of a. monopoly establishes a vested right. There are, of course, comparable situations. Quite obviously, there must be a limit to the number of employees working locomotives in a railway system. There must be a limit to the number of persons employed in a police force and in a fire brigade, and this limitation is usually enforced by government restrictions. However, if we examine these occupations it will be found that considerable obligations are imposed upon the persons employed. It would be impossible to run a fire brigade efficiently if half the employees did not turn up when called, and the same applies to a railway system. A considerable measure of discipline is imposed, and men are required to present themselves for work when called upon. Those who do not perform their duty regularly, and in a proper manner, are dismissed, and places are found for somebody else. Therefore, if men are to be given a monopoly of work on the waterfront, they must be prepared to submit to a high measure of discipline, and to present themselves for work when required. I may be told that the bill makes provision for this. I do not care what the bill says, but I know what has been the practice in the port of Sydney in recent years under a system which, for all intents and purposes, is practically the same as that for which the bill provides. I have here some figures which I elicited in answer to a series of questions which I asked of the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley). I asked how many members of the Waterside - Workers Federation were registered in Sydney by the Stevedoring Industry Commission, and I was told that the number was 5,424. I asked whether there had been any shortage of waterside workers on any day, and if so. on how many days did this occur from 1st October last. I had no particular reason for mentioning that date, except that the House was sitting at the time, and I wanted the figures to be as up-to-date as possible. I was told that between the 1st October and the 20th November there were shortages on 42 days. When I asked what was the average daily shortage, I was told that, between the 1st October and the 20th November, the average daily shortage was 2,044, but this figure included the period from the 14th October to the 24th, inclusive, when the port of Sydney was idle due to members of the federation not offering themselves for work. It is clear that a big proportion of those who are registered and enjoy this monopoly right do not present themselves when required, and also that on 42 days of the period mentioned the shortage of labour on the waterfront averaged about 2,000 men. If the scheme covered by this bill is to be a success there must be a rigid enforcement of the obligation on the men to present themselves when required for work. But there is an even more serious aspect^ namely, (the power which this legislation will give to the unions. If only those men who are members of the Waterside Workers Federation can be employed on the waterfront, obviously the federation will be able to exercise tremendous power over its members, because expulsion from the federation would deprive a man of his livelihood. A situation could arise in which a union could exercise tyrranous control of its members. I do not need to enlarge on that possibility; honourable members have enough knowledge of trade unionism and its methods to realise what a tremendously powerful weapon this bill will place in the hands of a union secretary who may have enemies in his union-me n who have opposed him and his policies. What guarantee is there that unionists will, in future, he free to express their views frankly and courageously in opposition to recommendations submitted by the executive of the union? In no country which claims to follow the principles of freedom and democracy should such power be vested in an uncontrolled union executive. If men may be expelled from a. union, and thus be deprived of their livelihood, their expulsion should be possible only with the authority and approval of the Government through its own. administrative instrumentality. There is no provision in the bill which guarantees members of the union against a tyrannous exercise of authority. The next aspect of this bill which I propose to mention has already been dealt with by other speakers. I should not have referred to it had not the Minister who introduced the bill shown clearly how ineffective Opposition protests had been. Therefore, we on this side must continue to emphasize our views because we believe that they are sound and, indeed, represent the only proper policy for this country to adopt; I refer to the preservation of the arbitration system. In our opinion, this measure is another link in the chain of Communist policy in this country. This bill is a direct attack on the arbitration system. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), than whom few members have more experience of industrial matters, drew attention to this fact. He wanted to know why it is thought necessary to appoint other tribunals to regulate industry when we have an Arbitration Court to deal with industrial issues. That criticism has not yet been answered effectively by any spokesman on behalf of the Government. This bill is a continuation of the policy of "" divide and smash "" advocated by Communists in - their determination to destroy our arbitration system. Having pressed for a similar control of the coal-mining industry they are now carrying their policy to a further stage. This approach to industrial disputes ignores a fundamental aspect of our arbitration system, namely, consideration of the public interest. It is not right to say that there Mr Holt. are only two parties to an industrial dispute. Most people consider only the claims of employers and their employees, and forget that the general public is deeply concerned in every industrial dispute.. The real strength of the case for the arbitration system is that it is the only system which preserves the public interest. We are told that the conciliation aspect of a dispute is to be emphasized in the future. We agree that there must be conciliation. What is the usual practice when a dispute arises, or threatens, in ari industry? The parties meet together in conference and discuss what concessions can be made by each side. Generally, some adjustments are made, and thus the field of dispute is narrowed to those matters on which the parties cannot agree. When that stage has been reached there must be arbitration. I have not known the arbitration system to fail when a union has had a genuine desire to improve conditions for its members and to ensure continuity of employment for them. If the representatives of a union attend a conference in good faith, setting out clearly what conditions of their employment should be improved and what alterations should be made, the arbitration system will succeed. But if the men attending a conference say, "" To hell with the arbitration system; we are out to smash it "", all the courts of conciliation and all the conciliation commissioners in the world will not preserve industrial peace. That is the issue which confronts the Government today. And so I come back to the point that the interest of the public is important notwithstanding that it is frequently overlooked. It is not sufficient for employers and employees to agree as to what should be done. One couldimagine employers in the coal-mining industry, for instance, acceding to the demand of the miners for improved pay and conditions of work, and saying that the extra cost of, say, 8s. a ton would be met by increasing the selling price of coal by 10s. a ton. That may be the result of conciliation between' two parties; but if the process of conciliation be left there-and that is what the Government proposes in this bill-the public interest, suffers. In such circumstances all that happens is that two groups meet and agree to pass the burden on to the public. We must have an authority which is able to say that an agreement entered into by employers and employees shall not be sanctioned because it is not fair to the public. As I have said there must be conciliation, but if the system is to work satisfactorily, the interests of the general public must also be safeguarded. Let us examine the tribunal which the Government proposes to set up. It is the Stevedoring Industry Commission. It is outside the Arbitration Court; yet it is expected, in some respects, to function like the Arbitration Court. Well, it will not function like the court. The existing commission has not functioned like a court, and, quite obviously, it would not be able to do so. The commission sits in rather an informal atmosphere. On the one hand, are the representatives of the employers, and on the other the representatives of the employees, whilst there is also a representative of the Government and a chairman, who has a final say in all decisions. Judge Foster, who examined this problem, recommended that should the tribunal be continued it should be presided over by a judge of the Arbitration Court. He did not say a conciliation commissioner. It is significant that the bill itself mentions both, a judge and a conciliation commissioner as the person who could preside over this body. That provision becomes still more significant following the remarks of the Attorney General when he introduced the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill last evening; because if the arguments he advanced in favour of increasing the number of conciliation commissioners, under that measure have any validity in. relation to the arbitration fieldas a whole, they apply with equal force to a tribunal such as this. From what the Attorney-General said the conclusion was sticking out a mile that although this bill mentions a judge, if the Government believes conciliation commissioners are adequaite to find a solution of the general, problemy, then a conciliation commissioner will be> appointed to do the. job in thisinstance. We can picture a conciliation, commissioner sitting in conference, with the representatives of both sides.. The commission. ,can work smoothly where there is scope for the parties to get together; but when the parties become deadlocked as, inevitably, they must when grave issues arise,, then the final decision is thrown back upon the man in the chair. What is the ordinary experience under such conditions? In such a situation who is likely to exercise the greater authority - the man who has been sitting around the table with the parties in an informal atmosphere, perhaps, lunching, smoking, or even, occasionally, having a few drinkc with them-o r the man who has been able to sit above the storm remote from the issues? When the latter, after hearing the arguments presented for both sides givesa decision, naturally it will appeal to the parties as fair, honest and without bias. Of course, the latter is preferable when a deadlock arises between the parties and some one must give an independent decision on matters in dispute. That view is borne out by the experience of the existing tribunal. It was set up to bring peace to the industry, to give better conditions to the waterside workers, and to produce greater efficiency in war-time in the handling of our shipping. What has been the result? So far as peace in industry is concerned, the record on the waterfront has been blacker since the commission was appointed than ever before. Certainly, the commission has gained better conditions for the men in terms of wages; indeed,, today those conditions are out of line with rates of pay given to men who have gone through six years' apprenticeship in skilled trades. As> the result, the commission has created a focus of friction which has already led to the metal trades dispute in Victoria, or, at least, contributed to that dispute. The men involved, in the metal, trades dispute see that waterside workers,, possessing nothing like their own skill, are. receiving very much higher rates of pay for fewer hours of: work. The workers, in other industries are envious of the waterside workers, and ask themselves, why they cannot be treated on an equal footing. Although the commission has given better conditions to the waterside workers it has done so in a way which has thrown industrial conditions out of balance, weighing them heavily in favour of this particular industry. With respect to the loss of efficiency in the industry since appointment of the existing commission, the facts given by other honourable members in this debate show only too clearly, :is - does Judge Poster's own recommendation, that the efficiency in loading and unloading, and in effecting turn-rounds of vessels has declined very seriously during recent years. Not only has the present commission proved a failure, but any commission set up in the form proposed under the bill must also prove a failure. The first chairman of the existing commission was Judge Piper, then Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court. Because of failure to implement the authority of the court as the result of pressure which could not be resisted under the conditions under which the commission operated, he resigned. Mr Justice de Baun, who was chairman of the Maritime Industries Commission, a corresponding body, found after a time that the authority of that commission was not upheld by either the Government or the workers; and for that reason he resigned. A similar experience is reported from New Zealand where a corresponding body, a stevedoring commission, has prescribed conditions on the waterfront. Por many months, that body was presided over by Judge Angley, but, recently, he resigned. He stated his reasons for doing so, and they are similar to those which made it impossible for the men who presided over the Australian bodies to which I have referred to carry on. Within the last few hours it has been brought to our notice that the conciliation commissioner for the port of Sydney, Mr D. V. Morrison, has, in the words of the Prime Minister yesterday, been dissatisfied with the attitude adopted by the men in respect of his decisions. Mr Morrison also has talked about resigning. Whether that is so or not, we do not know; but we do know from what the Prime Minister said that Mr Morrison is very dissatisfied with the response of the men to his decisions, and that as the result a crisis has been caused involving the tying up Mr Holt. of 70 vessels in Sydney at present. The honourable member for Batman and other honourable members, probably know Mr. Morrison personally. They are aware of the high regard in which he has been held by the great body of unionists. the Speaking from my experience when, as Minister for Labour, I had much to do with him, I know that he is a man who makes a strong and fair approach to matters submitted to him; and I have never heard one union representative say that he would not give the workers a fair deal. Yet he has found that he cannot make the present system work. This brings me. to the conclusion that the tribunal proposed under the bill must, inevitably, prove unsatisfactory. The principles and purposes of the measure are obnoxious, and, therefore, should be rejected by the Parliament. If the Government seeks to find a permanent solution of industrial troubles, I hope to propose several sound solutions when the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is debated. In the meantime, the Government must at least support the arbitration system and back up the authority of the Arbitration Court. It must recognize that the effect of the pressure brought to bear upon it to establish these other bodies is to weaken, and, finally, smash the arbitration . system. Having realized that fact it must recognize that in a democratic community, in the final analysis, there is no real alternative to government. If a government is not prepared to govern and accept the responsibilities of government, and if it is not prepared to back with the authority of government those tribunals which it creates to carry out its purposes, chaos and discord must be the inevitable result. That is the issue which the Governmentmust face; and, because, under this measure, it is not prepared to do so, I shall not support the bill.",27
98,Unknown,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Sitting suspended from 12.1)5 to 2.15 p.m.,32
99,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barker) [2.15] - The bill before us represents one of a long series of futile attempts on the part of this Government to import some order, discipline and decency into the affairs of various industries in Australia. Hitherto we have been more or less accustomed to attempts to stabilize, to bring about industrial peace in and to stimulate production in the coal-mining industry. This bill is confined entirely to waterfront employment. The most interesting speech during this debate was made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). I must admit that I was a little surprised by his description of the waterside workers of New South Wales in particular. I believe it was to that section of the industry to which he specially referred. I gathered from the honourable member's remarks that the waterside workers of New South Wales are so sensitive that criticism is something to which they simply will not submit and that as a consequence they have to show their dissatisfaction with the community's failure to recognize their efforts by going out on strike every now and then. They have been painted in colours which, to my mind, are out of keeping with the realities of the situation. We must examine modern trade unions in order to see something of the methods by which their affairs are carried on. It is not over stating the position to declare that modern trade unions, and the Waterside Workers Federation, in particular, are virtually at war with the rest of the community, and that they are carrying on a consistent effort to destroy the standards of livin g and of civilization which we enjoy in Australia today. This destructive effort was more intensified during the war than at any time in our history. If facts and figures were accumulated they would prove beyond doubt that at no other period in Australian history was there greater or more serious trouble on the waterfront than during the war years. Time after time Australian troops, who could have been better employed, were taken away from their training and other duties and sent to the waterfront to do the work which the "" wharfies "" refused to do. That happened at a time when all sorts of appeals were made in this House and elsewhere for an unprecedented war effort. In those days a lot of nonsense was talked but only those completely blind to the situation believed it. The position today is either that the Government must govern Australia or surrender the powers of government to certain trade union leaders. Every one of us knows the political objectives of these gentlemen; we know the gentle methods they employ in the handling of the unions over which they have so much control. Their objective now is that which is stated in Labour's policy, namely, the complete socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange, though some of them would have it stated in slightly different language which perhaps would be better understood in Moscow than in Sydney. Hitherto we have enjoyed-and I use the word "" enjoy "" deliberately- a system of arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. To-day we find that the arbitration system is going into the discard. There may be some faults in the system but there are other causes of this trend which I believe have a very much greater influence on the present-day situation than any inherent or casual faults in the arbitration system. There may have been occasions when the unions were justified in complaining of the slow rate at which the Arbitration Court disposed of the cases before it and of their inability to get speedy decisions when disputes arose; but I do not believe that there has ever been a time when organized Labour was entitled to declare that the arbitration system was wrong in principle or in practice.",32
100,Mr BEENNAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,We contested an election on that point.,33
101,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I know that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is a firm advocate of the arbitration system; he was associated with its establishment. I would be more than interested to hear his views, especially if he essayed to support the principles laid down in this bill. The present system of arbitration applies to the whole of the community, but the Government has separated two industries from the rest and has singled them out for special consideration. First, there was special legislation in regard to the coal-mining industry. It did not achieve anything. Then there were several other pieces of special legislation, sometimes by act of Parliament and sometimes by regulations, all said to be designed to cure the ills that beset the industry; but not in any instance can the Attorney-General (ilftiiii that aiiy enactment for which the Labour Government has been responsible has done one jot towards producing industrial peace or stimulating production on the coal-fields of New South ""Wales. On every occasion the Government has "" kow-towed '* to these people. Every time it bows its knee or its neck- I am not sure which is the most appropriate anatomical term-the gentlemen who control the coal miners federation have adopted a more arrogant attitude. The same is true of those who control the stevedoring industry. Therefore, we cannot expect that the bill now before us will result in bringing about five minutes peace on the waterfront in New South Wales. There are many outer ports in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, and probably in the other States, where trouble in the stevedoring industry is almost unknown. There are reasons for that. The outlook of the men employed in those outer ports is entirely different from that of waterside workers in our principal ports. And they are much more participants in a casual type of employment than are those employed in the big seaports. Labour on the waterfront of any big seaport is in essence permanent employment. I admit that there are occasions when men are laid off for a little while, but it can generally be said that their employment is of a permanent character. The Attorney-General has gone to great trouble to invent what in my opinion is :i completely new noun, the word '"" clecasualization "".",33
102,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I did not invent it tested against its use.,34
103,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL," thought it had the hallmark of the right honourable gentleman upon it. Some others may say it has another mark upon it. The alternative, appears to be to produce a. state of affairs whereby the casual nature of labour on the waterfront will go overboard and the wharf labouring industry will be put upon 'a permanent basis. Let us briefly look at the rights of labour in general. shall pronounce a doctrine now which perhaps will not 'find ready acceptance honourable members on the other side of the chamber. Modern trade Unions take up a dog in the manger attitude; their members say, "" If I will not work, then you shall not"". If the much vaunted policy of full employment means anything it means that a man who is willing to work according to the law of the land - tba t is, the awards of the Arbitration Court-shoul d be guaranteed by the Government the right to work. But today we find an entirely different state of affairs. A man may be most anxious to work on the wharfs, but some meeting, about which he may have had little notice and which is attended by a small selection of members of the union, chooses to declare a certain job black or a certain ship black, and, therefore, whatever may be .his desire to earn a daily wage and carry on the industry of the country, whether he like it or not, according to the standards taken in modern trade Unions, he is not allowed to work. One of the first tasks presenting itself to a government formed from the Opposition will be to grasp that nettle firmly with both hands and to say to the working men of Australia that they shall be guaranteed the protection of the law and they shall have the Commonwealth Parliament behind them when they are prepared to do according to the law the work that they set out to do. I have heard my honourable friends on the Government side-talk about the voluntary system in another sphere of activity. Every man on the waterfront is a volunteer. I trust that we shall never get down to the level in Australia where a man shall be detailed in time of peace to engage in certain employment. As the ; I prohonorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) said last night, if we go I much farther with the principle introduced into this bill by the Labour Government, men shall soon be obliged by law to engage in certain vocations. It is not a far stretch to say that we shall soon be at the stage of the Indian caste system, under which men will be precluded from following any vocation except that of their fathers. I hope the Government will call a halt and look carefully into I the future and see the difficulties ahead of it. If a man volunteers to become a by wharf labourer and does not like the job, the decent and honest thing for him to do is to get off the wharf 'and leave it 'to some one else. But that is not the attitude of the wharf labourers. They say, "" We will not get off the wharf; we will not work ourselves or allow any other men to work; we will not allow other men to do the job that we do not want to do "". It is no use arguing. Every honourable member opposite knows that the majority of strikes on the waterfront and in the coal-mines have not been justified. In very few instances has there been a justifiable reason for a strike. In too many cases there is just an excuse. The real policy of the men who direct industrial unrest is to produce a state in which chaos and communism, instead of law and order; shall be the rule. I know that "" law and order "" will not be altogether acceptable to honourable gentlemen opposite, although some of them have, been there sufficiently long to have almost become used to hearing the term. But today there can be no such thing as security if. men are not to have the right to obey the law in regard to labour conditions. I intend to refer now to .a thing, that was imported into the debate by interjection and ought to be discussed thoroughly. It is pilfering: That is. not the right term to. use. The only truthful teams are "" stealing "" or "" thieving "". A fortnight ago I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping for a statement of the losses from pilfering at the different ports in the last few years-. I repeat that "" pilfering"" is not the term to use. SIR EARLE PAGE - "" Pillaging "" is"" the term.",34
104,Mr AECHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I said "" stealing "" or "" thieving "". Those words' better describe what is happening. It is useless trying to cover evils by use of words' intended to reduce the shock to .sensitive ears. We must face realities and acknowledge' what isgoing on on the wharfs.",35
105,Mr BEAZLEY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Can the honourable member tell us a time when it has not occurred ?,35
106,Mr AECHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Does the honourable gentleman justify it because' it is old? Does he justify the"" oldest"" profession in the. world because if is old""? Unless he' is prepared to: do that} he' ought tb. keep"" quiet: Let' us have a look at the' tonnages' handled on the wharfs' today. 1 will not quote figures, for' they were quoted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), but I will make comparisons. Though I have not the actual details,. I do know from some contacts that I had with the matter that during the war it was common talk in the Australian Army - that in New South Wales and Victoria, in both of' which States I was serving,, untrained soldiers Were sent to the wharfs to do the work that the "" wharfies "" would not do, unloaded and loaded from two tofive times as much cargo as was unloaded or loaded by the trained "" wharfies "".",35
107,Mr BOWDEN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Hear , hear !",35
108,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I think, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) had some personal knowledge of that. I was sent to see fourteen ships in Melbourne when the sensitive souls in the stevedoring industry would not work because of a shower of rain. I have worked since I Was twelve years of age, and I should be happy if any honourable gentleman opposite could keep upwith me.",35
109,Mr LAZZARINI,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member has a great opinion of himself. ,35
110,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I share it with the honourable member. A man wanting to get on wantsthe opportunity to make money. Therefore, I cannot accept the great outcry about overtime. If a man is completely exhausted at the end of six or seven hours of work on the waterfront . there is nothing to prevent him from : knocking off; but. if there are other men who want to. earn extra money, the law and conduct of the union, should be such that they will, be allowed to earn it. 1 concede that the incentive is not great"" because the wharf labourers' political leader, the right honourable member for' Macquarie (Mr Chifley), in his capacity"" as' Treasurer, will no doubt ensure' thai they shall contribute additional taxesin due course. But' this matter of overtime is: important. I .think if is"" a longtime since so much cargo was held upon the wharfs of Australia as today. There was never a time in"" my lifetime""; and I doubt if there' Was' ever a"" time in'"" the lifetime' of any honourable ge'ntle'man opposite, when the' cargoes"" thatAustralia has to export were so badly ueeded in the markets overseas. Those cargoes are not wanted so much for commerce as on purely humane grounds, but this is the time when the great union leaders in the stevedoring industry decide that, humanitarianism or not, the greatest hold up shall take place. Their ponduct is shameful, and it cannot be defended hy any honourable gentleman opposite, and the fact that it cannot be defended is proved by the Government's act in introducing this bill under which it hopes to dispense with some of the difficulties that face it. Consider two things-the time wasted in turning ships round and the reduced tonnage handled per gang per hour on the wharfs. There can be only one result of those two things. The man exporting from: Australia will be penalized and the man using goods imported to Australia for production or consumption will also be penalized. Prices must rise as the result of the behaviour of the waterside workers. In this House I endeavour to represent the interests of every section of the community, and I cannot remain oblivious to the welfare of the big exporting industries and the vast consuming public, the members of which are the victims of this industrial war which is being carried on by the waterside workers against the rest of society. Obviously, if the principles embodied in this measure were applied to all industries, production would decrease and the standard of living would fall. Government supporters may talk as much as they like about the division of labour, but they cannot alter the fact that an essential factor in a high standard of living is a high output per man per hour in industry. Without high production we cannot have a high standard of living. Many features of the bill can best be debated in the committee stages, when I shall move to amend clause 5 and clause 10 by adding a new sub-clause in each instance in the following terms:A. known or reputed Communist shall be ineligible for appointment under this section; proof whereof to the contrary shall lie upon him. These clauses provide for the appointment of the commission and of the staff which it will employ. I have deliberately framed the amendment so as to put the Mr Archie Cameron. Australian Labour party and the Chifley Government right "" on the spot"". There has been a lot of talk about the Labour party's hostility towards communism. I do not accept the truth of those statements. Honourable members opposite were merely shadow-sparring when they made them. If the Government is sincere in its professions, it will accept the amendments, and if it does so, I shall adopt a very different attitude towards the bill at the third reading stage.",35
111,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,If we accept the amendment we will be non-democrats like honourable members opposite.,36
112,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Com munists are not democrats, and I do not believe that the honourable member for Hunter is a democrat.",36
113,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member does not believe in men having the right to work.,36
114,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I am glad that the honourable member raised the point. I have just been arguing in favour of that right. The substance of my speech is that any man who is prepared to work according to the law of the country, which is expressed in the awards of the Arbitration Court, should not be prevented from doing so by any tin-pot union dictator. Can the honourable member - understand that? If the Government would knock the chains of union control from many trade unionists, they would be the most willing workers in Australia. They are prevented from working today, not because they do not want to work, but merely to suit the wishes of their union masters. We should not overlook clause 13 of the bill, which deals with amenities. This word "" amenities"" has recently become a feature of debates in this House. Previously, the most commonly used term in this chamber was "" the new order The position has changed, and now "" amenities"" is dragged in whenever possible. Obviously the Attorney General does not understand very much about amenities, because clause 13 requires the provision of canteens, cafeteria, dining-rooms, rest-rooms, and adequate sanitary and washing facilities for waterside workers. According to the honourable member for Hunter, the clause should be amended so as to include hairdressers, manicurists, chiropodists, Turkish baths, beauty parlours, Geisha houses, and invalid chairs. That would remove from clause 13 any taint of superstition, about misfortune. It would provide for everything that a reasonable waterside worker could wish to have, in this life at any rate. If the amendment which I have foreshadowed is accepted by the Government, the bill will be considerably improved and may be workable. At least it will be understandable. As it stands at present, it will take the stevedoring industry holus bolus out of the influence of the Arbitration Court and set it apart as the coal-mining industry has already been set apart. Other industries in Australia have equally strong claims to separate treatment. Consider the railway workers, postal workers and the seamen. What about their claims? Why should not they be removed from the influence of the Arbitration Court? If the Attorney-General continues along the course which he seems to have mapped out for the coal industry and the stevedoring industry, the Arbitration Court will have to go by the board and we shall have to resort to collective bargaining, or the making of decisions by tribunals of five, two of whom, will represent the employers, two of whom will represent the employees, and one of whom will perhaps be a spineless person nominated by the Government and instructed to carry out government policy. The Government says that it is dissatisfied with the general output of industry in Australia, but I have grave doubts as to whether it is facing up to the realities of the situation. It should take a firm stand, call in the heads of certain unions, and say to them, ""Look here, comrades or chaps"", or whatever term the Government uses in talking to these men, ""these strikes have gone far enough. From now on there must be full production, and men who will not produce will be dealt with severely "". The Attorney-General should have full power to punish men who will not work, and he should exercise it without mercy ",36
115,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Martin) [2.43] - Before commenting on the merits of the bill, I have something to say regarding the observations of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) and some of his colleagues. According to them, the most fearsome figure in the community is the Communist. The honourable member for Barker said nothing new when he told us what he would do with the Communists. We know his capacity for taking fascist action against people with whom he disagrees. His attitude is no different from that of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale), who last night was so upset about conditions in the stevedoring industry that he almost frightened everybody in the House with his dreadful tales about the Communist party. It was difficult to tell whether he thought he was addressing a jury or lecturing a group of sixth grade school children. I inform members of the Opposition that they will not defeat Communists by ""red-baiting"". Imposing a. ban on the Communist party will not eradicate industrial unrest. The only way in which to beat the Communists is to ensure that the Australian workers realise that members of the Communist party are the arch enemies of industrial progress and the Labour movement. They represent people who oppose an improvement of their conditions. Only by a more thorough understanding by the men and women employed in industry and by impressing upon them the necessity to attend the meetings of their unions for the purpose of ensuring that Communist agitators shall not be elected to executive positions shall we remove them, without creating further industrial unrest, from the offices that they occupy. The imposition of a ban on the Communist party, as the honourable member for Barker recommended, would have small beneficial results. I hold no brief for members of the Communist party, and I name them for what they are-the arch enemies of the Labour movement, who are doing everything possible to defeat its purposes. It is futile for the Opposition to attempt to link members of the Labour party with the Communist ""arty, because there is no connection between them. The honourable member for Barker stated that the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation has Communist officials. In the House today is Mr J. B. Mullins, general secretary of the Sydney branch of the organization. He is a member of the Legislative Council of New South ""Wales, and a member - of the official Labour party. He has never had any affiliation with the Communist party. It is idle for honourable members opposite to make these wild accusations which they cannot substantiate.",37

He stated that the bill now under consideration was virtually drafted by Mr Healy, whom he described as a Communist member of the Waterside Worker's Federation. The honourable member read certain clauses for the purpose of proving his statement that the Government had taken its instructions from Mr Healy. I shall state the facts. Mr Healy took the clauses to which the honourable member referred, from the National Security Regulations under which the Stevedoring Industry Commission was established. He adopted those provisions because he agreed with them.",38

125,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member for Parramatta went to great lengths in an endeavour to show the people of Australia that the Labour party had presented to the Parliament a bill which had been drafted by the Communists. That observation is completely inaccurate. The honourable member for Parramatta declared also that clause 22 of Mr. Healy's bill was identical with clause 3 of the bill under consideration.,39

138,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I repeat that last night the honourable member for Parramatta stated in this House that clause 3 of this bill was identical with clause 22 of the bill submitted by Mr Healy to the Government for consideration before presentation to the Parliament.,39
139,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I did not say that.,39
140,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The fact is that clause 3 of this bill and clause 22 of Mr. Healy's' bill are identical because,39

142,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I ask that the honourable member for Martin be requested to withdraw,39
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,There is no point of order. Obviously the honourable member for Parramatta is not familiar with the forms of the House. He cannot make alleged misrepresentation the subject of a point of order.,39
144,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Clause 3 of this bill, clause 22 of Mr Healy's bill, and regulation 55 of the National Security (Shipping Co-ordination) Regulations, under which the Stevedoring Industry Commission was established, are identical, This proves conclusively that the honourable member for Parramatta was misleading the House yesterday when he endeavoured to frighten honourable members with tales of the Communist party, and expressed an obviously' incorrect opinion to bolster up his weak argument. The honourable member stated that clause 5 of the bill was identical with a clause in the measure prevented by Mr Healy to the Government for consideration. But that clause is also identical with regulation 58 of the National Security (Shipping Co-ordination) Regulations. One could go right through the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta, and deal with other observations that he made concerning Mr Healy's bill in the same manner. The similarity in phrasing between Mr Healy's bill and this measure is due to the fact that Mr. Healy based his draft legislation upon the National Security (Shipping Co-ordination) Regulations which are embodied in this bill. I shall not waste the time of the House by continuing to show how utterly inaccurate were the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta. He may have brought some legal knowledge to this House, but obviously, he has little knowledge of the stevedoring industry. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) said that the purpose of the introduction of this bill is to achieve industrial peace, and continuity and efficiency of work in the stevedoring industry. It is based on recommendations made by Judge Foster. Honourable members opposite usually have great respect for learned judges. Constantly they criticize this Government for having failed to adopt the recommendations of various members of the judiciary. Well, in this case, the recommendations of the judge who inquired into this matter have been accepted almost in their entirety, and have been incorporated in this measure. Judge Foster made an extensive inquiry into the stevedoring industry in 1945 and in making his recommendations, he also had in mind the war-timeactivities of the Stevedoring Industry Commission which was appointed by the late Mr John Curtin during his term of office as Prime Minister, and the vital importance of the stevedoring industry to our national economy. Honourable members opposite have based their opposition to this measure on several grounds; but what is their main argument? If they read Judge Foster's report they will see that he has devoted several pages to a clear exposition of the manner in which he considered the commission should be constituted. The functions of the commission have been explained by other speakers on this side of the chamber and I shall not endeavour to elaborate their remarks. However, it is interesting to note that in support of his recommendations, Judge Foster stated that a number of special features associated with the stevedoring industry required some special consideration. The commission was set up to bring about more harmony in the industry, to improve the working conditions of those engaged on the waterfront, and to facilitate a quicker turnround of ships. First, Judge Foster pointed out that this industry was vital to Australia's economic interests both at home and abroad, and that we depended upon it to a substantial degree. Secondly, it was closely allied with our defence problems. Thirdly, it was almost entirely casual in its operation and affected 20,000 workers in Australia. Employment, he said, was subject to great fluctuations. Also, the industry was sensitive to industrial disturbances in other industries, and there was a special urgency about many of the problems that arose in it. Judge Foster also pointed out that port facilities-harbour s and wharfs - were at present under the jurisdiction of the States, and that there was a conflict between the States and the Commonwealth in connection with the making of awards, because of thelack of constitutional power on the part of the Commonwealth in regard to arbitration. There had been clashes with State interests on a number of occasions. Certain other reasons were given, showing quite clearly that in the opinion of the judge there was a great need for urgent consideration of the problems of waterside workers. I shall summarize the judge's observations on this matter by quoting from his report.",40
145,Mr RANKIN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,To what judge is the honourable member referring?,41
146,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Judg e Foster. If the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr . Rankin) devoted a little time to reading he would know the judge's name, but he has time only to abuse Government supporters.",41
147,Mr RANKIN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I know something about his name. He changed it by deed poll.,41
148,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"As usual the honourable member is holding up the business of the House by making interjections, knowing little of the subject under discussion. Judge Foster statedThese special considerations may be regarded as justifying (if any justification be necessary) a special treatment of this industry and its singling out for the exercise of that legislative power that is absent in regard to most industries. It has always been clear that the main work of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is legislative in character (see Alexander's case 25 C.L.E.. page 434) and that legislative power was exercised not by the elected Parliament but by officers (presidents and judges) appointed hy the executive and almost beyond reach of the legislature. In respect of this industry, however, a very large section of it is capable of being dealt with, if it is so proposed, by the people's representatives in the Commonwealth Parliament. That comment would not have been made by Judge Foster had he not considered to be desirable that his recommendations should be adopted. This industry has suffered more than most industries have suffered. In 1928, Judge Beeby, when making an award covering members of the Waterside Workers Federation, saidThe true line of progress of wharf workers is in the opposite direction to that of moment. With those of all other casual workers their difficulties are entitled closer consideration by the community has so far been accorded. As this Court has frequently pointed out, the need for community effort towards better organization of labour, year by year, becomes more urgent. The status of the citizen with no semblance security in social life, hawking his labour for sale by the hour, is one of the greatest gers of the present economic system. It is to sit back and criticize the actions of who gain their livelihood under such conditions. Their actions, to ordinary individuals not concerned with economic problems, may appear to be arrogant, selfish and unreasoned, when in reality they are the natural result of the indifference and neglect of society. It will be seen that twenty years ago a judge of the Arbitration Court considered that a special tribunal should be set up to deal with matters associated with this industry. In the light of the recommendations of Judge Foster, the reasons for introducing this bill are obvious to any person who considers the matter fair l y and has regard for the best interests of both employers and employees. As during this debate it has been said by honourable members opposite that the Stevedoring Industry Commission has failed, I direct attention to the following comment made by Judge Foster on page 15 of his report:My investigation does convince me that the commission achieved a substantial measure of discipline; that it won and had a measure of co-operation to this end from the workers' organization, greater than had been achieved in this industry before; that it achieved its main war-time purpose; that its actions and policies were dictated by the paramount considerations of war, and that the alleged disciplinary failure was conditioned by those special war considerations. That was a most telling comment on the activities of the commission. Long before war broke out in 1939 this was a turbulent industry; for many years there had been strikes and upheavals. As far back as the time when the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr Hughes) worked on the wharfs, there was trouble it in the industry. The right honourable gentleman will recall those turbulent days when there was no Stevedoring Industry Commission to settle disputes. At that time, whenever there was a fight between employers and employees it was a case of the survival of the fittest. Those who could not continue the struggle any longer the were forced to give in . The Stevedoring Industry Commission has reduced unrest to much on the waterfront to a minimum. than The Leader of the Opposition said that vessels now spent 67 per cent, casual of their time in ports, compared with 33 per cent, in pre-war days, and of his statement has been repeated by other danOpposition members. Honourable memeasy bers will be interested to know that the men tonnage of the cargo handled in the main Australian ports during recent years has exceeded the tonnage handled in the years immediately preceding the war. Moreover, as that additional amount of cargo was carried in fewer vessels, that means that each vessel carried a bigger cargo than in pre-war years, and so a longer time in port discharging that cargo is justified. The figures in relation to the port of Sydney are illuminating, and I shall give them for the benefit of honourable members. They cover the period from July, 1938, to April, 1946. Between July, 1938, and June, 1939,7,384 vessels carrying 7,694,699 tons of cargo were handled. Eor the ten months from July, 1945, to April, 1946, the vessels handled numbered 3,063, and they carried 7,332,499 tons of cargo. Honourable members will note the comparison between the twelve months from July, 1938, to June, 1939, and the period from July, 1945, to April, 1946. Although fewer vessels were handled in the latter period the nage handled was almost the same. For the whole period from July, 1938, to April, 1946, the total number of vessels handled was 39,304, with a total cargo of 62,054,948 tons.",41
149,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,What is the authority those figures; have they been obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician?,42
150,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The figures from July, 1945, to April, 1946, cover a period of only ten months, yet the total tonnage handled was only 362,200 tons less than for the twelve months ended June, 1939. For the period July, 1944, to June, 1945, the number of vessels handled was 3,805 with a total cargo tonnage of 9,057,184 tons. The table shows clearly that approximately half the number of vesThomas Gordon saidsels carried a greater total cargo tonnage.",42
151,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Where did the honourable member get those figures?,42

155,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Obviously, honourable senting members opposite have been thrown into a state of consternation by these figures. responsibility Similar figures are available for the Port of Melbourne. In 1938, that port harmonious handled 3,530 vessels which carried cargo totalling 6,449,209 tons. In 1944, when fewer than half the number of vessels entered that port they carried cargo weighing 5,773,057 tons. When honourable members compare those figures they will realise that there is good reason for the 1,682 vessels handled in the Port of Melbourne in 1944, taking longer to discharge their cargo. I ask that the statement setting out the vessels handled in the Port of Melbourne from 1938 to 1944 be incorporated in Hansard. [Leave not granted.] I derive some satisfaction from the fact that honourable members opposite are so upset by the figures that I have cited that they are afraid to have the table incorporated in Hctnsard.",42
156,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,This is the only time in my memory that an honourable member has refused to acknowledge the source from which he obtained figures which he total ton- has cited in this House.,42
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Order ! The honourable member for Martin is entitled to be heard in silence.,42
158,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Honourable members opposite will be interested to hear what a man who is probably one of for their supporters has said about the Stevedoring Industry Commission. I refer to Sir Thomas Gordon, who was, until recently, Director of Shipping and representative in Australia of the British Ministry of Transport. He gives the lie direct to the Opposition's statement that industrial stoppages interfered unduly with shipping during the period that the commision was operating. In a letter addressed to Mr Healy, the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Sir You may have seen from press reports that as from 1st February my assignment as personal representative of the British Ministry of Transport ceased, but I take this opporof officially informing you of same as I would like to place on record the friendly relationship which existed during the years of the war between your organization and the British Ministry of War Transport (later memchanged to Ministry of Transport). We know that on many occasions there were of opinion as between you, repreyour members, and myself as representing the Ministry and charged with the of keeping British tonnage moving, but I feel that overall the relationship between our organizations was on a generally plane, and I think results show that despite difficulties, essential cargoes were moved where required and when required, ami that at least as regards these essential cargoes required by the Allied Forces in the Australian area and otlier areas, industrial disputes with your members was not a factor that materially interfered with their delivery on time.",42
159,Mr RANKIN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I rise to order. In view of the ruling of Mr Speaker that we are not allowed to introduce propaganda statements from the press, is the honourable member for Martin in order in reading this propaganda statement ?",43
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,There is no point of order involved.,43
161,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The communication continuesI take pleasure in recording the above because I appreciate many of the difficulties you personally must come up against, representing as you do such a large body of men spread right throughout Australia and with perhaps varying viewpoints as to the essentiality of some of the commitments they were asked to undertake, and I repeat that the best evidence of the working between your organization and the British Ministry of Transport is the quantity of cargo that was moved to its destination as required by the Allied Commanders in the various theatres of action. That is a striking tribute to the Stevedoring Industry Commission, and is a telling argument in favour of its continuation. I come now to the matter of time lost through stoppages and hold-ups, and I take my figures from the current maritime services report. An examination of the records available for the last six months of 1946 shows that the present number of man-hours lost because of disputes and strikes in all ports of the Commonwealth was approximately 850,000, the worse month being October, with 416,324 man-hours lost, and the lowest being for August, when only 16,312 manhours were lost. The approximate number of man-hours worked in all ports of the Commonwealth during that period was 15,000,000 so that, in the period of six months, approximately 5 per cent, only of the available working time was lost. Honourable members opposite have complained of the hold-ups on the Australian waterfront, but the figures which I have cited on this and other matters, taken from the current Maritime Services Report, compare favourably with the records for Great B r it a in and New Zealand. Although there have been stoppages which I do not condone, they are no different from those which are taking place all over the world, including Great Britain , and the honourable member for Parramatta exhibited a colossal lack of knowledge of what has been happening in that country. He did not even know that, during the war, there were industrial stoppages in B r it a in for certain reasons, although the enemy were much closer to B r it a in than they ever were to Australia. I do not j u s t if y strikes in any country, but it is wrong to mislead the people of Australia and of the world generally into the belief that this is the only country in which there are strikes. The fact is that, for causes arising out of the war, industrial conditions are disturbed everywhere, and it is probable that they will not become settled again for a considerable time. The Government has an unanswerable case in support of this bill. It has been endorsed by the judge who investigated the industry, by the employees, and by all those with a reasonable knowledge of what takes place on the waterfront. It is on record that, as far back as the period between 1924 and 1928, more than £1,000,000 was lost because of delays in the turn-round of ships as the result of industrial disturbances. That was in what an honourable member opposite called the "" good old days,"" when all a man had .to worry about was getting a job. We know, of course, that conditions were such as to make it i m possible for men to give of their best. We must look at this problem fair l y . It is not a matter of the employers against employees. The bill represents an honest attempt by the Government to bring harmony to the stevedoring industry, to promote efficiency and to ensure that the workers enjoy better conditions. It is an attempt to bring about such a state of affairs as will enable Australia to progress industrially, and this is possible only if cargoes are expeditiously handled, and ships assured of a quick turn-round. I trust that the employers and employees will play their part, and accept the decisions of the tribunal, whether in their - favour or against them. Even if this attempt fails, it will not be the fault of the Government, but will be due to the lack of co-operation of others, and because of the activities of honourable members opposite who are endeavouring, for political reasons, to prevent the mission from functioning.",43
162,Mr HOWSE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Calare) [3.20] - It may appear at first sight that there is little connection between the primary producer and the disputes, stoppages and hold-ups on the waterfront, but actually the connection is close and real. Primary producers, who live hundreds of miles away from the seaboard, need stability. They are at the mercy of the'elements. They cannot predict a good season or a bad one - excep t that, for the last ten years, it would have at any time been fairly safe to predict a bad season. As an offset to this they need, more than anything else, security and stability in the world's kets, but no market can be secure unless there is continuity of supply, which, in turn, is dependent upon trouble-free transtrial port. That is why the primary producers, even those who live great distances from our sea ports, are vitally interested in the way the business of those ports is conducted. Let us examine what the continual stoppages on the waterfront mean to our primary producers. I believe that the people in the country are extremely patriotic. By this I do not mean that they are merely jealous of their own interests as against those of the city. They h.ive a patriotic attachment to the British Commonwealth of Nations and to Great Britain. Thousands of them who have never been to Britain have responded to the appeal for food for Britain, and have given all they can. They resent keenly the fact that Great Britain is not getting the food it needs because transport is held up by industrial disputes. The primary producers are also affected because overseas markets, which should be ours, are being lost to us through transbill, port hold-ups, and it will be extremely difficult for us to regain those markets from our competitors. Eor instance, we know that the exasperated Dutch Gographs vernment was forced to cancel a terms £6,000,000 contract for the purchase of goods in Australia, represented largely by primary products, because we could not that maintain continuity of supply to the the Netherlands East Indies. We have lost the goodwill of the Dutch Government as well as a very valuable market. Moreover, when this com- bill becomes law, the cost of working cargo at Australian ports will be increased, and this will be reflected in higher freight charges to exporters, the bulk of whom are primary producers. The real cause of all the trouble is that industrial orders have not been observed. Mr Healy and his friends have taken charge of the situation, and the Government, instead of governing, has sat back and allowed things to drift. We remember that the Stevedoring Industry Commission ordered waterside workers to handle double-dumped bales of - wool. I am not going into the merits of the dispute, but, rightly or wrongly- I believe mar- rightly-the commission gave a certain ruling, but that ruling was simply disregarded. What hope is there of indusorder unless the law is enforced? We claim that our arbitration system is the best in the world. I do not think that any one disputes that. It has its faults, but we have felt justified in holding it up as an example to the world, and now this authority, of which we have been so proud, is being pushed aside. Indeed, for some time past, its decisions have been contemptuously disregarded, The real solution of the problem lies in supporting and enforcing the decisions of the Arbitration Court, not in trying to undermine it, and destroy it piecemeal.",44
163,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I desire to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Martin (Mr Daly), in the speech which he recently concluded, stated in bold terms that I had said last night that clause 3 of this bill was identical with clause 22 of Mr Healy's bill, which I was then discussing and comparing with this bill. I did not say that. What I actually said was thisLet us consider clause 22 of Mr Healy's which provides that the commission shall have power to do so and so, and then are set out in detail the powers which Mr Healy thinks the commission should possess. These, which appear in Mr Healy's bill in paraa, 6, c, d and e, appear in identical in clause 3 of the present bill. Indeed, the gentleman who drafted the bill now before us was apparently so mesmerized by Mr Healy he simply lifted the provisions from Mr. Healy's bill verbatim, and included them in present measure without altering a word. The point I make is that I did not say that the two bills are identical, but that paragraphs a, b, c, d and e of sub-clause 2 of clause 3 of the bill are to be found in identical terms in Mr Healy's draft.",44
164,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Warringah) [3.31] It is now three weeks since this bill was introduced, and the debate having proceeded in the meantime little is left to be said by honourable members who wish to speak at this stage. However, I should like to make some observations. First, no one can overstress the importance of this industry to the welfare of Australia. It has been made quite clear by authorities which have investigated it, such as the Rural Reconstruction Commission, that transportation is the very life-blood of the economy of this country; and, since our marine transport is almost wholly over long distances by sea, I do not need to emphasize the fact that any measure which is designed to deal with that problem should receive, as it has, the intense and careful investigation and scrutiny of honourable members. My second observation is that there is nothing new at all in the bill. The only thing given to us for the first time on this occasion is a real opportunity to discuss the continuation, because that is all it is, of war-time administration in respect of the stevedoring industry. It will be remembered that the regulations which established the Stevedoring Industry Commission during the war were introduced under the National Security Regulations, and that we were not give any opportunity to debate those regulations in this chamber. So, this is the first opportunity given to us to consider their operation and efficacy. I should like to say over and over again that no government can legislate for prosperity, and no government can bring peace to the waterfront by legislation alone. A number of things are needed first, there must be a change of heart on the part of those who direct the destinies of the unionists who work in the stevedoring industry. There is need for better leadership from this Government in dealing with the vital problems which confront the nation today. The Government is sadly lacking in such leadership. One would have thought that during the time the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has been the leader of this Government he would have made clear to the people, because the urgency is apparent, the problems with which we are confronted, and would have given leadership to the people in his handling of such matters; but he does nothing except make occasional statements on the basis that one cannot do anything to any section of the community that defies the law. I repeat that what is urgently needed, from the Prime Minister down to the most junior Minister, is leadership. That leadership cannot be exerted merely by the Prime Minister; it must be a concerted policy adopted by the Government. Upon industrial matters we know that usually the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General makes some pious statement as to what is needed, and then other Ministers, whom I shall not bother to name, do their utmost publicly and privately to excite disaffection among certain unionists. The most important of all factors is that government be restored to the people of this country. It must be obvious to those who have seen the industrial turmoil today that a direct challenge is being levelled by extra parliamentary bodies such as unions to the constituted government of the day. It must be clear not only to those who sit on this side of the House, but also to honourable members opposite, who are more intimately associated with the industrial movement, that there must be restored to the Parliament the right to govern the country. It is idle to pretend that this Parliament governs today. I was somewhat touched when, in the concluding portion of his second-reading speech, on this bill, the Attorney-General said that it was left to this Parliament to clothe the commission to be established under this bill with the high functions it possessed. With what authority is the Parliament clothed? This Parliament is nothing more than a talking shop. It must be apparent to the people that this Parliament does not govern in the slightest degree. I want to see government restored to the people, through their representatives, not the granting of legislative authority to some commission to do this or that. Parliament does not govern and in respect of all industrial matters it may be equally said that neither does the Executive govern. The challenge has now been made. The big industrial unions are prepared to ""take o n "" the Government at any time, well knowing that, ultimately, through the force of numbers, the Government will adopt its usual policy and surrender. We are experiencing a condition of serious drift not only in industrial matters but also in the morale of the people associated with industrial labour. This challenge by outside authorities must be resisted by the Government. It will be seen that as far as the Government's desire to assert its authority is concerned, there is no blood or bone in - this bill. One of the major problems confronting Australia today is the vast monopolist power of the industrial unions. There was a time when it was customary for the Labour party to challenge monopolies as if they constituted one of the most serious evils that beset the community. Is anyone prepared to deny that the industrial unions, such as the Waterside Workers Federation, have developed all the powers and characteristics of monopolies, but suffer none of the inconveniences to which other monoplies in other days were subjected? They are not subject to taxation; they are not disciplined; they are beyond the law. It is at this 6tage that the Government must take up the challenge. I am not seeking to suggest that it is simple to do these things, or that they could be done very quickly; but I do suggest that as long as the Government allows this state of affairs to drift for just as long will the ultimate solution of this problem be postponed. In discussing this bill one has to sider what is the purpose 'and what are the functions of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, and in what way it is to be given authority to exercise its powers. It may be said at the outset that discipline is essential to industrial peace and that discipline cannot be maintained without proper sanctions. When we examine the sanctions in this bill and have regard to the history of the wartime commission which the new body is to replace and perpetuate can we believe that the purpose of the bill will be achieved? Does any one believe that during the last three or four years Mr Spender. the Stevedoring Industry Commission had real sanctions to enforce its orders and decisions? We all know that when the commission exercised its power by making an order or a decision its directions have been defied by the union and on more than one occasion the Government has overridden the commission. Is that the way to get industrial peace? If there be no discipline there can be no order. Is it any wonder there has been such chaos and disorder in this industry? I do not suggest that there are not in this industry many ills that need to be cured. I do not for a moment confine my criticism to the waterside workers; they have already been severely and in my opinion justly criticized; I am concerned more with a matter of principle. In bringing down this measure is not 'the Government acting somewhat like the Irishman who gave his creditor a promissory note, and said, "" Thank God that is paid ""?",45
165,Mr SCULLIN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member should read Dickens again. The character to which he refers was not an Irishman.,46
166,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Does the Government believe that it can "" pass the buck "" in this way ? That it can shelve responsibility by introducing a bill such as this ? During the war years and since, time and time again we have witnessed the spectacle of the Government granting authority to a commission to carry out certain functions only to find that in time of crisis it has failed to uphold the deci- . sions of the commission which it has appointed. The difficulty that confronts the Government resolves itself - into one of disciplining its own supcon- porters. When unions are able to play such a vital part in the destinies of members of the Parliament is it any wonder that there is a reluctance on the part of the Government to discipline them? The importance of this bill has not been sufficiently emphasized. It is equivalent to a measure for the nationalization of the stevedoring industry. It is true that the bill is expressed in terms of control, but if one has regard to the purpose of the commission and its functions as set out in clause 11 one will see that it is an attempt, to borrow a phrase used by Judge Foster, to bring about the "" quasi nationalization of the industry as a permanent feature of our economy"". Clause 11 (1) (b) provides among other things that the commission shall regulate and control performance of stevedoring operations relation to interstate and overseas trade and shipping. I believe that I have rectly summarzed it, but if I have not Attorney-General can correct me. They are general words, but, in content, they are exceedingly wide. Clause 13 gives the commission, amongst other things, power to do all such things as it thinks fit for the purpose of exercising its funcclause tions under clause 11. No wider charter could be given to any authority. In words, there is to be given to this called commission- I call it ""so-called"" for reasons that I will advance later-th most plenary authority to control every aspect of stevedoring. If that is not nationalization by the backdoor, I should like to know what it is. I come now to the manner in which the commission is to be constituted. The Attorney-General told us that has in drafting the bill the Government placed the utmost reliance on the vernment report of Judge Foster. I should like to know how the Government can make that claim when one of Judge Foster's prime recommendations was that the chairman of the commission should be a judge of Arbitration Court. That recommendaaspects tion has not been carried out. In clause 5 are words of such significance they would not appear in the legislation unless it were intended to make them effective. The clause provides, inter thatThe Chairman shall be a Judge of the or a Conciliation Commissioner appointed under the Commonwealth Conciliation Arbitration Act 1904-1946. At this point I am not debating whether the chairman should be a judge or a conflouted ciliation commissioner- I am prepared to debate that at any time-bu t I am directfrom ing attention to the fact that the Attorneyauthority. General has told us that the Government gave grave and weighty consideration Judge Foster's report and that the honourable member for Martin (Mr Daly) has claimed that, in all essential particulars, the report has been given expression to this bill. That provision enables the vernment to claim that it is carrying out the recommendation when it has no intention of doing anything of the sort. Judge Foster went into the matter of the the chairmanship of the commission at great in length. I do not intend to repeat all that he said about the matter, but his corfourth recommendation was that the the chairman of the commission should be a judge of the Arbitration Court, and, in making that recommendation, he rejected to the proposal of no less a person than the Labour party's friend, Mr Healy, that the chairman should be a layman. Yet 5 provides the machinery by which a layman may be appointed chairman. I other ask the Attorney-General why, in the soface of the direct recommendation of Judge Foster that a judge of the Arbitrae tion Court should be appointed chairman, the Government has inserted the provision that a layman may be appointed. Is it because it intends to ignore the judge's carefully reasoned recommendation? I think so. I can understand reasons, even if I do not agree with them, for appointing a lay chairman, but that nothing to do with the issue, because the Attorney-General said that the Gointended to keep the stevedoring industry tied, in effect, to the Arbitration Court, and gave, as a sign of the Government's good faith, the fact that provision was made for the appointment of the an Arbitration Court judge. Both those require further examination by honourable members and demand a reply that from the Attorney-General. Sanctions are essential if the authority alia, of the commission is to be upheld. We are witnessing an upheaval on the Sydney waterfront. If newspaper reports are Court correct-and they have not been denied and - the chairman of the present commission, Mr Morrison, is about "" fed up "" with the way in which his authority is by the waterside workers and the fact that he is not getting any assistance the Government in exercising that",46
167,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,He has invited the Goto vernment to abandon the bill.,47
168,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Yes . If this bill is to receive the approval of the Houseif ""approval of the House"" is a phrase in that can be applied to any legislation Gofostered by this Government-it is the duty of the Attorney-General to say frankly whether any recommendation has been made in respect of the present dispute and this bill. We are entitled to know, because if those who have sought to exercise the powers of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, as it now exists, have come to the conclusion that it cannot function efficiently, of what purpose is it to spend two or three weeks debating this measure and to expect the pious hope of the Government in respect of it to be realized. The sanctions provided are what? The Attorney General said, ""We do not believe you can accomplish anything at all by any severe penalties"". the sanction is ' to be the sanction of registration. Again Judge Foster's report is not heing complied with, because in paragraph 10 d of his report, as a part of the disciplinary measures, His Honour recommends that the commission be empowered "" to register and refuse to register, or to pend such waterside workers and foremen as it deems necessary and proper, and to classify those workers, and to arrange transfer of workers when conditions require it "" . He leaves it to the Government to decide how it shall be done, and recommends the provision ofPower to secure compliance with its orders by employers, employees, stevedores, foremen and their organizations. I ask the Attorney-General, who at the .moment is showing no interest in this debate for reasons 'best known to himself, why the bill contains no provision for carrying out the specific recommendations of Foster in respect of discipline, apart from the matter of licences. It may be said that the provision in respect of licences means discipline, but how futile such a claim would be were it advanced is shown by the present - dispute on the waterfront. The wharf labourers have stopped work. Licences have been cancelled wholesale. But, as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow, no matter how much the workers defy the Stevedoring Industry Commission, the licences will be restored ultimately. In clause 16, the bill provides that the commission shall not alter the standard hours of waterside workers otherwise than in conformity with the awards of the Arbitration Court in Mr Spender. respect of standard hours. That means little, because standard hours are never likely to be altered to any degree. The clause also provides that the commission shall not alter the basic wage applicable to waterside workers or the principles on which it is computed otherwise than in conformity with the awards of the Arbitration Court in respect of the basic wage. That also has little meaning, because the waterside workers are paid more than the basic wage. I think I am correct in saying, in the words of the Attorney General, that, with those two exceptions, the Stevedoring Industry 'Commission will exercise complete jurisdiction in So the stevedoring industry. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the second reading of which was moved yesterday by the Attorney General, contains provisions for the policing of awards in various ways, including the deregistration of unions sus- and the punishment of ""employers, measures that may be taken by the Arbitration Court to discipline any industry, but this bill contains no similar provisions, and I want to know why means by which the stevedoring industry may be disciplined are omitted from this measure. The only disciplinary power provided is that of deregistration, and the workers can snap their fingers at that, as they have done in the past'. Mr DUTHIE. - What - of clauses 26 and 27?",47
169,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Apparently the Hnorable member has not been listening Judge closely. I have been discussing the provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the second reading of which was moved yesterday and which the honourable member should examine. That measure provides for the enforcement of awards arid the disciplining of workers who engage in industrial insurrections. Such provisions have been deliberately omitted from the bill. I want to know why this industry, with its record of turbulence and defiance of authority, has been singled out by the Government for such special treatment. Does anybody believe for a. moment, having regard to the history of the industry in the last three years, and even in the last three weeks. that the provision with regard to deregistration will have any effect at all upon the wharf labourers? The Government should give a lead in this matter and support the commission with its full authority. It has shown no sign of doing so, and I fear that it will not do so in future. The bill falls into two categories. The first relates to executive, or administrative, functions and the second consists of arbitral provisions. Subject to the observations which I have made regarding the need for discipline, the administrative provisions mark an experiment which, in principle, may, if exercised reasonably, be well worth trying. I consider that, in the field of conciliation and arbitration, there is a need for the expert knowledge which can only be acquired by a tribunal which deals only with a specific industry. If sufficient disciplinary measures were applied, the experiment might be justified in order to ascertain the degree to which a specially constituted body, acting within the framework of the arbitration system and giving special attention to the problems of a particular industry, could improve industrial relations. The Government should give the experiment a chance of success by exerting its disciplinary power and supporting to the full the authority which it appoints. But unless it does as I suggest, the bill will be merely so much legislative rigmarole and will be of no practical use. The arbitral provisions of the bill must be tied to the Arbitration Court in respect of general principles; otherwise, the most serious consequences will flow from the measure as the result of the pressure which will be applied by the waterside workers. It has been made clear to us that they expect to receive many major concessions within the next twelve months. I have already drawn attention to the loop-hole in the bill which exists in clause 5. I now refer honourable members to clause 9, which gives to the commission the power to delegate authority. provision requires careful consideration. The commission is vested with plenary power under clauses 11, 12 and 13- a power which I have described as one of quasi-nationalisation. Clause 9 gives to the commission, either generally or in relation to any port, the power to delegate to an officer by writing under its seal any of the powers or functions conferred upon it by this measure. That is an extreme power of delegation. The chairman of the commission, as the Attorney-General has said, will be charged with one of the most important duties imposed by the bill - On vital issues, his word will be law. On such issues, there will probably be an equal division of opinion between the other four voting members of the commission. Therefore, the vote of the chairman will be decisive. The bill lays down no qualifications regarding the exercise of power by conciliation commissioners, and, in this respect, the Parliament is being called upon to hand over one of the most important functions of government to an outside body. I suppose it is too late for us to arrest that process, which has been encouraged by this Government. We are being gradually bereft of our authority, which is exactly what the Communists wish to achieve. The hill represents no departure from the practice of the past four years. It cannot accomplish anything that is hoped of it unless the commission is vested with power to discipline workers in the stevedoring industry. It will be useless unlessthe Government supports the commissionand gives leadership to the people andi unless the authority of government is restored to this Parliament. I am not opposed to some of the general principles of the bill, provided that .the industry is closely linked with the arbitration system and the powers in the bill are reasonably exercised. However, I believe that it will be severed from that system. The experiment may well be worthwhile if the Government will embody in the measure provisions analogous to those existing in the arbitration law, which give power to de-register unions, to call for secret ballots, and to operate the other machinery which was designed, first, to give union This members control over their unions, and, secondly, to enforce orders of the courts and awards made by the commission. It is futile to appoint any body to deal with such a vital economic function as transportation unless that body is clothed with ample power to enforce its orders. I see no indications of such power in this bill. I do not wish to see heavy penalties imposed upon individuals merely because they obey the orders of their union leaders to strike. I have always said that one of the best ways of dealing with industrial intimidation and defiance of the Government is to bring to bear the full process of the law against the leaders, after giving due warning to them. The law must be observed, if it is to survive. At no time has the Government made any attempt to enforce industrial law in Australia. Subject to those observations, the bill - can be considered in committee with a view to determining the degree to which the arbitral provisions can be tied to the Arbitration Court. Before the debate - concludes, the Attorney-General should - explain to the House why certain of the irecommendations by Judge Foster have siot been incorporated in the bill. 3)r. EVATT (Barton-Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs) [4.6] - in reply-The outstanding feature of this long debate is the fact that 90 per cent, of the criticisms which members of the Opposition levelled at the bill totally ignored the basis upon which the measure is put forward. The Government did not attempt to convince the Parliament that peace and contentment prevail in this industry. We frankly admitted that the industry had been most difficult to control, and that the difficulties had not ceased during World War II . I also explained to the House that we were in great difficulty about its future control from the standpoint of industrial regulation and general regulation. The Government appointed a distinguished judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for the purpose of recommending to the Parliament what should be done in connection with this industry. Some members of the Opposition have paid so much lip service to the Arbitration Court, and its judges, that I might be excused for thinking that they would show more deference and respect to the recommendations of Judge Foster. We have followed almost slavishly his recommendations, because he heard the evidence of he shipowners, stevedoring companies, officials of the Waterside Workers Federation and Commonwealth officers who had experience of this important industry during the critical years of the war. Having heard that evidence, His Honour put his recommendations before the Parliament in the form of a written report. In my second-reading speech I did not read the whole of the document to the House, but I made copies of it available to honourable members. Whilst I do not propose to read the whole of the document now, I desire, for purposes of illustration, to quote one passage from it. On page 14, Judge Foster statedIt has been urged that it would be a tragedy to abandon this experiment at the outset and to sacrifice the experience it has gained since 1942. It was in 1942 that the National Security Regulations were promulgated establishing the commission. The report continuedMuch has been learned from its many failures no less than from it successes. His Honour was dealing with the contention that it would be a tragedy to abandon the experiment and sacrifice that experience had gained. The report proceededMy concurrence in this view is strongly fortified by the support it has from the Oversea Shipping Representatives Association. I could read page after page of the report in support of the bill. I. reserve, for the moment, the - point which the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) made and on which His Honour did not express a final opinion, namely, the general power of regulating stevedoring operations. Another point to which I shall return is the matter of who shall be the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. Apart from those two matters, the bill follows the recommendations of Judge Foster's report. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) referred to a bill which had been prepared by the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr. Healy. I inform the honourable gentleman that no such draft legislation has ever come to me, to my department, or to the Parliamentary Draftsman. ' I verified that this afternoon. Mr BEAT.E - I have a copy of the bill prepared by Mr Healy before me.",48
170,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The so-called Healy bill never reached the Attorney-General's Department, and did not play any part in connection with the drafting of the measure now before the House. National Security Regulations, which established the Stevedoring Industry Commission, were promulgated in 1942. If Mr Healy submitted a draf t bill, so also did the shipowners.",51
171,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Of course they did !,51
172,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"They laid their draft bill before Judge Foster, and the two documents appear as annexes to Hi9 Honour's report. He considered them when draftin g his report, and recommended what should be done. We are following, not Mr Healy's draft, but the, recommendations of Judge Foster. That is the proper thing for us to do. When we requested His Honour to conduct this inquiry, many of us felt a doubt as to whether this industry should be separated from Australian industries under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has expressed a similar view. Some ef us, including myself, rather shared that view; but the Government decided to have an inquiry into the matter and obtain judicial recommendations. That has been done. Yet, for a number of days in this House, honourable members opposite have repeatedly attacked the workers in this industry, and have not made any reference to any faults on the part of the employers. I shall not now attack the employers. Tables have been incor-i porated in Hansard dealing with the alleged reduction of tonnages handled on the wharfs. That aspect is dealt with in His Honour's report. Some honourable members quoted a portion of his remarks but not his final conclusion. On page 19 of the report, His Honour saidIt is especially noteworthy, however, that according to the - jvid'ince, a falling of output has occurred and was continuing before. It occurred prior to the 1928 waterside workers strike in Australia. It was cured by the depression which followed. It occurred before this war and continued up to and through the period of the commissi in. It would stem now if the figures arc of any value, to have been arrested, and some improvement imliratid. Whether the figures show it or not, some witnesses and others believe that the through-put is increasing and may be expected to improve. That is what Judge Foster found on the facts. I shall not argue about the significance of the figures. The officers who advised me during the preparation of The the bill, including Mr Sutcliffe. of the Department of Supply and Shipping, have figures which make it clear that it is quite wrong to measure the tonnage handled by the waterside workers by the average number of days that a ship trading to Australia may be at sea during a month. The figures show clearly that ships are now loaded to capacity, and, therefore, it is impossible to expect that they will be at sea for the same proportionate period as in the days before the war when there was a surplus of ships, and each vessel carried comparatively little cargo. I come now to several other criticisms of the bill. Honourable members opposite asked: Why separate this industry from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court? That is an issue which Judge Foster had to decide. Page after page of his report honourable is devoted to reasons for it . He pointed out that this was a special industry, and needed not merely industrial regulation of hours and conditions, but also a progressive - plan so that the workers could, over a period of five or ten years, gradually improve their status as cooperators in what is essentially a public service. That was the spirit in which His Honour and the Government approached the problem. His Honour finds in favour of a separate tribunal. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) who, many year3 ago, was president of the Waterside Workers Federation, and who has a vast experience of the industry, declared himself in favour of a tribunal consisting of a judge and the representatives of the employers and employees. The bill provides for the appointment of a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court or a conciliation commissioner. The right honourable member rejected the idea that there should be a complete duplication in this industry of the pattern set by the Arbitration Court itself. I am not criticizing the Arbitration Court judges who pioneered the work in connection with this industry. One of these was Mr . Justice Higgins, who, I believe, made the first award for this industry. Later, Judge Beehy dealt with it. They were all puzzled by the problems of the waterside industry. I believe that they felt, as I feel, that there was a gap between certain sections of the community and those people who did this vital work of handling cargo for transportation. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), in his rather plaintive speech, spoke of the manner in which certain people referred to "" wharfies "" and "" coalies "" as though those workers were separated from the rest of the community. That attitude is too prevalent today. The spirit of it was evident in the speech of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) today. I am sure that when the honourable member reads what he said he will be ashamed of some of his utterances. His references to the provision of suggested amenities may be termed a jeu d'espril, but I am afraid his criticism went deeper than that. The honourable member for Warringah said that there would have to be a change of heart before this bill could do what is desired, but he finished on a demand for more sanctions. Yet the sanction provided for in this measure, is perhaps the most severe of all-de-rcgis tration, which means, of course, that a worker would not he able to follow his normal occupation. That matter is not in the hands of the Government.",51
173,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The present commission has the same power.,52
174,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,That is so and it was exercised frequently during the war.,52
175,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,And the penalties withdrawn.,52
176,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Ver y seldom. However, I do not propose to indulge in an altercation with the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison). I repeat that during the war the system of suspension or de-registration of waterside workers was effective.",52
177,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The men went strike and the commission surrendered.,52
178,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The trouble is that some honourable members opposite, in considering this measure, have endeavoured to apply what is happening in a particular dispute in one port of Australia to the whole industry. That action has been repudiated by the central organization of the Waterside Workers Federation. However, the main point of the Governments's case is this: We know we are dealing with an industry which is difficult to control. Wrongs have been done, and the recollection of unhappy, far-off events has poisoned relationships between employers and employees. The blame does not lie on one side alone. Not many years ago a new waterfront organization was formed, not by the employees themselves, but by the employers.",52
179,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Does the Attorney General disapprove of the then Government's action in calling for volunteers?,52
180,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I am not approving or disapproving of any of these things. I am saying that the organization of a union by employers is never justified, and has been condemned by every arbitration authority. However, I do not wish to delve into history. Judge Foster approached that portion of his problem by stating that from the industrial point of view, the solution was one union, but he added that he did not mean that the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union should be absorbed into the main organization on anything but reasonable terms. In effect, he meant that there should be no victimization, and the spirit of that recommendation has been embodied in this measure. Not a single member of a registered union will be deprived of his registration. That brings me to the point made by the honourable member for Warringah in regard to the control of the stevedoring operations. The honourable member pointed out, quite correctly, that the commission will have power, not only to settle industrial disputes between unions and employers, and to deal with industrial matters generally as if it were a wages board, but also to direct and control stevedoring operations-the operaon tions of loading and unloading vessels. It may, for instance, insist that safety appliances be provided, or that certain equipment be improved. The honourable member for Warringah objects to that, on the ground that it is nationalization. I say that it is not. It is safety control. The - Commonwealth Parliament has control over interstate trade and all its operations, and looking at the industry as a whole the Government believes that it should not stop at the point where it is necessary to give this regulation-making power to the body that is charged with dealing not merely with industrial matters, but also with other matters. I do not think there will be many others, but the Government, having listened to criticisms voiced by the employers and the employees, believes that this should be part of the bill. I concede quite frankly that Judge Poster does not positively recommend that. He leaves it for future development, but I have come to the conclusion that the Government's view is correct. We want that power as a reserve power in the bill. That brings me to what is perhaps the final point for the consideration of the House: It is said that this measure is a departure from our arbitration machinery. But the bill provides that, so far as standard hours and the basic wage are concerned, the commission must follow the Arbitration Court. The basic wage is an integral part of the waterside workers' award. Similarly if standard hours of work are altered overtime provisions must be affected. Under this bill, the commission will be bound by the three judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in relation to standard hours and the basic wage. That, of course, does not cover everything. Por instance, throughout industry, there are margins above the basic wage. But at least two of the most vital matters are covered. What was the position of industries of this kind in the pre-war days? A judge would deal with an industry as a whole. Under this bill the chairman of the commission is to be a judge or a conciliation commissioner. Under this bill a conciliation commissioner will cccupy a different position from that held by a conciliation commissioner under the present law. His status will be only a little inferior to that of a judge, and his salary will be greater than that paid to a conciliation commissioner today. In future, a conciliation commissioner will have an independence which will make his activities a feature of the arbitration tem. The Government has provided that the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission shall be either a judge or a conciliation commissioner.",52
181,Mr MCBRIDE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Why ?,53
182,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The reason is that when the bill was drafted it was thought that it would not be possible to secure the services of a judge of the court, and that situation may, in fact, arise. The Government thought that, as it proposed to amend the law in respect of conciliation commissioners, it would be almost as satisfactory to have a conciliation commissioner as chairman instead of a judge.",53
183,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The Government's other bill shows disapproval of a judge for these functions.,53
184,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"No . Some of the criticism to which the bill has been subjected might have been silenced had I said earlier that, although no formal decision had been made by the Government, I had consulted with the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and the Minister for Supply and Shipping (.Senator Ashley) and that the Government intends to appoint a judge as chairman of the commission, if possible.",53
185,Mr FRANCIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Would the right honourable gentleman accept an amendment that the chairman must be a judge?,53
186,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,No ; because it may not be physically possible to get a judge to accept the position.,53
187,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,It would be possible to appoint a judge.,53
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Inter jections must cease. The Attorney General is entitled to be heard in silence.,53
189,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I am not objecting to interjections; but it is extraordinary that, after several hours have been occupied by honourable members opposite in emphasizing the necessity of having a judge as chairman of the commission, now, when I am indicating the Government's intention to appoint a judge, if possible, they want to tie the Government down, and restrict the choice to a judge. The bill will remain in its present form; but I repeat that, if possible, a judge will be appointed. The various documents from which quosys- tations have been read, and the figures which have been cited during this debate, were previously furnished to the Government by the shipowners and the stevedoring companies when they met Ministers al deputations. I publicly acknowledge the assistance which both employers and employees have rendered by making suggestions for improving the bill. I think that it is fair to say that most of the criticism to which the bill has been subjected would not be supported by employers in this industry if they knew that the chairman would have the status and standing of a judge of the Arbitration Court. All that I have told the House today I have previously said to these people. The Government does not submit the bill as a cure-all for the ills of this industry, as the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) has suggested. The Government admits frankly that this is an experiment in a most important province of our economic and industrial life which may not be wholly successful, and may even fail. Should the experiment not be a success, this Parliament or some succeeding parliament will have, to review the legislation. The Government, however, hopes that this experiment will be a success, and that the enactment of this legislation will open up a new prospect in this industry, and a recognition that workers on the waterfront are entitled to the standards claimed by others because they, too, are rendering a valuable service to the public as members of a great public utility. Stevedoring is, indeed, a special utility; there is little comDaly, F. M . petition among employers, because the industry is organized on the lines of the shipping companies. There is a close liaison, if not an actual integration, between the stevedoring companies and the shipping companies. The shipping companies which control vessels trading between Australia and other countries believe that the experiment which was begun in 1942 should be continued. That also is the view of the Government. Reference has been made to the obligations that will be cast on those who will benefit from the continuation of this experiment. I speak not of law or of sanctions, but of ordinary fair play and decency. On that point, I agree with the honourable member for Martin (Mr. Daly) that an obligation does rest upon Dr Evait. them, and that that obligation should be recognized more fully than in the past. It is unreasonable to expect this experiment to be completely successful without the wholehearted support of the workers in this industry. There must be co-operation by them in the same way as there must be co-operation on the part of the coal-miners if there is to be peace and harmony in the coal-mining industry where a similar experiment is being undertaken. It is impossible to lay down a rule, and say that every industry must conform to a pattern set by the court. I ask the House to pass the second reading, thereby giving to both employers and employees a chance to work together for the betterment of all associated in any way with the stevedoring industry.

196,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wentworth) [4.50]. - On behalf of the Leader of the Opposialready tion (Mr Menzies), I move the followno ing amendment which has been circulated in his name:That paragraph (a) of sub-clause (2.) left out. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) stated that this was an experiment. It is experiment that has been going on since 1942; and protects a number officers, and a tradition which, I suggest, is not as favourable as the Attorestablish ney-General would lead us to believe, because the existing commission has not been anything like 100 per cent, efficient in the carrying out of its duties. Indeed, the whole record of the present commission has been one of placation simply and complete retreat. It has been instruexisting mental in failin g to uphold the law NOES. under the powers vested in it . Yet, under the bill we are asked to give to the present officers of the commission the right to retain their positions. This experimental body has not proved successf u l at all. I should like to know why the Attorney-General considers that these officers should have established for them a vested interest as members of the staff of the commission. It is quite possibleindeed, it is very probable-that with the return to Australia of a number of servicemen, the commission could draw from PAIRS. their numbers men who possess greater capacity, determination and administrative ability and who would be able to administer the powers conferred under this measure in a way which would establish peace and harmony on the waterfront. The Government should not say, in effect, to officers of the present commission, "" Yours is a vested right. You are in positions, and you cannot be challenged. Nobody has right to take away from you the position you now hold."" The staff of the present commission has been drawn in Are conwe now to admit that they have established a vested right in their positions by Covirtue of the fact that they were in Australia while other men were serving in the this fighting forces on the other side of the office world? Are the latter, who are hopewere f u l of obtaining positions under the re-establishment and employment legislation, to find that key positions on the staff of the commission have been filled? They will have opportunity to apply for those positions. If this is to be a new industry, and the Attorney-General is trying to shear be it of the tradition of frustration and maladministration associated with the existing commission, he should make a an clean sweep and appoint a new staff of men who will be able to give effect to of the powers to be conferred upon them under this legislation. He should not a vested right for any person in a position on the staff of the commission.",56
197,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton-Attorney-Gene ral and Minister for External Affairs ) [4.54] - The effect of this provision is to continue in office, officers of the commission. It does not alter the power of the commission to appoint new officers. It would not be a good thing for a commission which was established as a war-time experiment to throw open every office in the duties of which the present occupants have gained considerable experience. Judge Foster recommended the continuation of the experiment and therefore the Government cannot accept the amendment. ""We believe that it should be left to the commission, if it so desires, to improve its staff in light of its experience in the control industry.",56
198,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"New England) [4.56]. - I support the amendment which is intended to delete the provision that all officers and employees of the Stevedoring Industry Commission constituted under Part V. of the National Security (Shipping 'Co-ordination) Regulations holding office or employed immediately prior to the commencement of the operation of this measure shall continue to hold office or he employed as if they were appointed under it. The body of men at present employed by the commission represents a not inconsiderable number and it is to be expected that that number will be considerably increased. The Attorney General (Dr Evatt) could not have exercised a more happy choice in the selection of the word than he did when he said that the commission was an "" experiment"" which Judge Foster suggested should be continued. It is an experiment, but unfortunately an experiment of a very desperate nature. Although the Attorney-General has been experimenting with the StevedoTing Industry Commission for the last few years the only result of his experiment is that because of the inefficiency of the commission and its staff 73 ships are now tied up in the port of Sydney and the people of Great Britain are prevented from getting urgently needed food. Who are these employees and whence did they come? are those who, during the period of the greatest, conflict in which this nation has ever been engaged, held down safe jobs in this country. M.r. SPENDTJK - They did not fight.",57
199,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Perhaps they could not fight because their physical and mental inefficiency was such that they could not be enlisted in the armed forces. Whatever may have been the reason they are to be given an advantage over those who served their country in the fighting forces from 1939 until peace was declared in 1945. Why should our ex-servicemen be denied an opportunity to apply for a lucrative appointment in the Stevedoring Industry Commission? Common decency demands that they should at least have the an equal right to apply for appointments of the to a commission which the Attorney General describes as an experiment. The war-time body was not in existence for a long period and accordingly there is no question of infringing the rights of long and tried employees. The Attorney General has admitted, and Judge Foster in his report has pointed out, that labour of the best type was not available, to the commission during the waT years because it was being used for other purposes. The commission, therefore, has had to employ a proportion of men unsuited to the posts which they occupy today. The right honourable gentleman knows that the commission has an inefficient staff, but he is allergic to pressure groups, particularly that led by Mr. Healy, the Communist secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation and so he proposes to retain in this experiment, which is designed to cure all the ills on the waterfront, the inefficient men now employed by the organization and to exclude ex-servicemen from appointment. Amendment negatived.",57
200,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton-Attorney-Gene ral and Minister for External Affairs) [5.0] - I move That at the end of the clause, the following new sub-clause be added:"" (3.) The Transport Workers Act 1928 and the Transport Workers Act 1929 are repealed."" These acts were referred to during the debate. Part 3 of the Transport Workers Act 1928-29 which deals with a system They of licensing and gives power to cancel licences and to prohibit men working without licences, was unaccompanied by any provisions for the control of the waterside industry. Such a provision of the law is inconsistent with the bill now before us. Under Part II . of the Transport Workers Act 1928-29 power is given to the Governor General to make regulations, but no rules were prescribed for observance by those concerned. The Government believes that as these existing acts are inconsistent with the bill now before us they should he repealed. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 4 (1.) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears"" employer "" means(d) a person who engages persons for employment in capacity of dragger, mechanical truck driver or mobilo crane driver engaged on haulage from ship to shed or shed to ship.

201,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton-Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.4] - I move- > That, in sub-clause (1.), the definition "" stevedoring operations "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following definition:"" ' stevedoring operations ' means[a) the loading or unloading of the cargo into or from ships; (6) the loading or unloading, into or from ships, of ships' stores, eoal or fuel oil (whether for bunkers or not ) , passengers' luggage or mails; (c) the handling or storage of cargo or other goods at or adjacent to a wharf; (d) the driving or operation of mechanical appliances used in connection with the loading or unloading of ships or with the handling or storage of cargo or other goods at or adjacent to the wharf; and (c) haulage or trucking from ship to shed or shed to ship, and includes the work specified in paragraphs (e), (/ ) , (g) and (ft) of the definition of ' waterside draggers, worker' when performed by a member of the Federation or a person registered as a waterside worker under Part V . of the National Security (Shipping Co-ordination) Regulations immediately prior to the commencement of this Act ; "". waterside Mr ABBOTT - What is meant by "" a d j a c e n t to the w h a r f "" ?",58
202,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,On e cannot define it more precisely. Goods are handled that are not a c t u all y on the w h a r f s . It means coal or fuel o i l ; or with in such a short distance of the w h a r f that it is r e all y a p a r t of the w h a r f .,58

204,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,It would if in trucks from w h i c h it could be conveniently carr i e d to the w h a r f and thence to the s h i p .,58
205,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The B o t a n y store is six miles a w a y from the w h a r f .,58
206,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Of course, it m i g h t be so far a w a y that the c o u r t would hold that it was not adjacent.",58
207,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,It makes a big difference to the members of the Storemen and Packers Union.,59
208,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"They are excluded, as are the members of the Sydney Coal Lumpers Union. Defining "" waterside worker "" and "" stevedoring operations "" presents difficulties, principally because - some work that waterside workers often do is sometimes undertaken by men who are not members of the Waterside Workers Federation or the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union of Australia. It is not desired by means of this measure to prevent persons other than waterside workers from performing tasks customarily done by them, and, in many instances, work that comes within the definition of "" stevedoring operations "" is done by members of unions in - conformity with the approved rules of such unions. So, a new clause 13 (A ) to be moved later provides thatNothing in this act shall authorize the commission to determine or regulate the - salaries, wages, rates ot pay, other terms or conditions of service or employment of persons who are not waterside workers. The intention is to give to the commission authority over the industrial conditions - of waterside workers, and it is necessary, therefore, to define closely who are waterside workers. The alterations follow discussionswith representatives of employers and employees subsequent to the presentation of the bill to the House.",59
209,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Warringah) [5.7] I refer the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to paragraph e of the proposed definition of "" stevedoring operations "". It states that stevedoring operations include the work specified in paragraphs e, /, g and h of the definition of "" waterside worker "". Turning to the definition of "" waterside worker "", one finds that the work referred to in the definition of "" stevedoring operations"" is the work of the removal or replacing of beams or hatches, the handling of dunnage or ballast, the preparing or cleaning of holds, or the preparation of gear for use in connection with the loading or unloading of ships, and the definition of "" waterside worker "" goes on to say that it does not include a certain category of persons. Is it intended that the definition of "" stevedoring operations "" shall apply to waterside workers, whether they do or do not come within the proviso "" but does not include "" ?",59
210,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton-Attorney-Genera l and Minister for External Affairs) [5.9] - I think so. It puzzled me at first, as can easily be understood by the committee. The stevedores, shipowners and the unions have been engaged in trying to arrive at a definition that expresses the clear intention of this part of the bill. I do not mean for a moment that there is not opposition to certain operations being defined as stevedoring operations. The provision that stevedoring operations shall include the work specified-the removal or replacing of beams or hatches, the handling of dunnage or ballast, the preparing of holds, or the preparation of gear for use in connection with the loading or unloading of ships-whe n performed by members of the Waterside Workers Federation or the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union of Australia may seem contradictory; but, for instance, the preparing or cleaning of holds may be work done entirely, in certain circumstances by members of the ships' crew and it is to be regarded as a stevedoring operation only if it is done by a waterside worker.",59
211,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The definition is governed by whom the work is done.,59
212,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Exactly . It was impossible to make the definition clear without indicating that it is not a stevedoring operation if it is done by people who are not waterside workers. For instance, the preparation of gear may sometimes be done by members of the ship's crew.",59
213,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barker) [5.11] - It is remarkable that a bill, obviously the result of considerable study and negotiation by the Government and its collaborators, to give to the Stevedoring Industry Commission vital powers over stevedoring operations was introduced when it now becomes necessary for the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to attempt to define those operations. In order to understand the Attorney-General's amendment, one has to refer to another definition in the same clause, because the definition of "" stevedoring operations "" refers one to the definition of "" waterside worker"". When the bill was introduced the Government was apparently satisfied that seven lines of print could define "" stevedoring operations "" . It now decides that the definition needs about seventeen lines. Even so, the Attorney General made it clear that the definition is still difficult.",59
214,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Yes .,60
215,Mr AECHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The right honourable gentleman admits that, and, no doubt, he will admit it again when we come to the next amendment.",60
216,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Certainly .,60
217,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Because it takes thirteen lines to define "" waterside worker "" in the bill, as it stands, and about 32 lines, as it is proposed to be amended, it appears to me that the more words there are the greater the chance there is of disagreement. The two things around which the success of this bill will revolve are the definitions of "" stevedoring operations "" and "" waterside worker "" . Yet, on his own showing, the Attorney-General i:- dissatisfied with the first draft and has moved for its amendment in a much more elaborate way, at the same time signifying to the committee that there are some difficulties about that, too. If the Gomember vernment itself does not know exactly what it wants in this bill how in of common sense can the Attorney-Genadvisers, who know eral ask the committee to be happy about these proposed definitions. I am not. Amendment agreed to.",60
218,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton-Attorney-General and Minister for External A f f a [5.14] - I move That, in sub-clause (1.), the definition "" waterside worker"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following definition:"" ' waterside worker' means a person accepts, or offers to accept, employment for work in the loading or unloading cargo into or from ships, and includes a member of the Federation or a registered as a waterside worker Part V. of the National Security (Shipshort ping Co-ordination) Regulations diately prior to the commencement of this Act who accepts, or offers to employment for work in(n) the loading or unloading, into or from ships, of ships' stores, r-oal or fuel oil (whether for [ 5 . 1 5 ] bunkers or not), passengers' baggage or mails; (6) the handling or storage of cargoor other goods at or adjacent to a wharf; (c) the driving or operation of mechanical appliances used in connection with the loading or unloading of ships or with the handling or storage of cargo or other goods at or adjacent toa wharf; (d) haulage or trucking from ship toshed or shed to ship; (e) the removal or replacing of beamsor hatches; (/) the handling of dunnage or ballast; (g) the preparing or cleaning or holds; or (A.) the preparation of gear for usein connection with the loadingor unloading of ships, but does not include(i) persons working in or alongsidea ship in connection with the direction or checking of the work of waterside workers; (/) members of the crew of a shipon the ship's articles; (fc) members of the crew of a lighter; or (i) members of the Sydney Coal Lumpers Union while loading or unloading coal in the port of Sydney; "". Referring to the remarks of the honourable for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), I thought that the orithe name ginal definition was good, and my a great deal about precise definition, thought so, too; but the shipowners and the unions worked out, practically by consent, the definition now proposed. Again I do not mean that there is agreement that steve^ doring operations should be brought i r s) within the regulation-making power of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, of but, if they are, the definition of "" stevedoring operations "", which has just been agreed to, and the definition of ""waterwho side worker "", which the committee is now invited to agree to, are accurate descripof tions, and provide the necessary safeperson guards. A broader answer to the honorunder able member is that sometimes the definition causes difficulty, immewhereas the longer definition by enumeraaccept, tion is safer in the interests of all concerned.",60
219,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL," I observe that both the original definition of ""waterside w o r k e r "" and the definition in the proposed amendment - conflict with sub-clause 2 of clause 24. I would be quite satisfied with the definition of "" waterside worker "" either in the original or in the altered form. The - definition in the amendment states"" Waterside worker"" means a person who accepts, or offers to accept, employment for work in the loading or unloading of cargo into - or from ships. . . . However, clause 24, sub-clause 2, statesExcept at such ports as the commission - determines, a waterside worker shall not be registered under this Act unless he is a ber of the Federation. . . . In the light of the definition of "" waterside worker"", that sub-clause is sheer nonsense. The two things are in utter conflict. I do not know how the courts would interpret the bill, because the' definition provides that any person who accepts or offers to accept employment isentitled to be engaged, whereas, according to sub-clause 2 of clause 24, a person cannot be employed unless he is a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. How does the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) explain that situation?",60
220,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.17] - Sub-claus e 2 of clause 24 contains a very important provision. It takes a group of men known as the waterside workers, and says that the members of that group cannot be registered unless they are members of the Waterside Workers Federation. The "" waterside workers "" referred to in the bill are defined by reference to their job. They are men whose job is to accept, or offer to accept, employment for work in a certain industry which is defined in the amendment now before the committee. Tn order to bring waterside workers within the purview of the act, they are generally defined so as to exclude, for instance, storemen and packers, who work in close proximity to them but are not covered by this bill. Having defined the class, the bill imposes a prohibition on registration in clause 24, sub-clause 2. There is no conflict between the two provisions. The definition of ""waterside worker "" has been carefully prepared so as to apply to those men who come within the intention and the scope of Judge Foster's report. This definition is expressed in the amendment now before the committee.",61
221,Mr AECHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barker) [5.19] - The Minister (Dr Evatt) has missed the point of my argument. All that is necessary is to say that a waterside worker means a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. If the right honourable gentleman leaves the amendment as it is drafted, any person who is not a member of the federation mem- but who accepts or offers to accept employment will be entitled to receive employment. That is stated in the proposed new definition.",61
222,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,That makes him a waterside worker.,61
223,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Yes . He need not be a member of the federation.,61
224,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,He will have to be a member in order to be registered under the act.,61
225,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Why not state that a "" waterside worker"" means a member of the Waterside Workers Federation? Why go to the trouble of including a long definition of "" waterside worker"", when the Government's intention could be expressed in one line ?",61
226,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton-Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.20] - My view is supported by the officers who drafted the bill. First, we must define the trade or calling with which the bill deals, namely, that of the waterside worker. Then we must define those who belong to the trade asA person who accepts, or offers to accept, employment for work in the loading or unloading of cargo . . . That is according to the amendment now before the committee. If a person comes within the meaning of the definition stated in the amendment, he is a waterside worker within the meaning of the bill. Does the honourable member follow that?'",61
227,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"No , I do not.",61
228,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"As an illustration, if the honourable member goes to the Sydney waterfront and offers to accept employment for work in the loading and unloading of cargo, he will be a waterside worker within the meaning of this bill. But if he should apply for registration, clause 24 might be brought into operation because he could not be registered unless he were a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. There must be a definition of the calling or trade.",61
229,Mr AECHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I agree with that.,62
230,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"That is done in the amendment now before the committee. But, having done that, it is still necessary for certain purposes, such as registration, to require that a man shall be a member of the Waterside Workers Federation or, at the time of the passing of this law, a registered member of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. There is no conflict between the two provisions. Amendment agreed to.",62
231,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton - Attorneypretation General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.23] - by leave- I move That paragraph (d) of sub-clause left out. This is amendment No. 2 in the list of printed amendments, consideration of which was deferred as it was consequential on the acceptance of the amendments that have already been agreed to by the committee. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Dr. EVATT) proposed - That, in sub-clause (2.), paragraphs [a) and (6) be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following paragraphs:"" [a) a person who puts another person to work shall be deemed to engage that other person for employment; later. and (6) a person who is put to work shall be deemed to accept employment"".",62
232,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barker) [5.24] - This amendment provides that a person who is put to work shall be deemed to accept employment. The pointthat I wish to stress to the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) is that, according to the new definition of "" waterside workers"" to which the committee has agreed, the only persons who can accept employment are those who are approved by the Waterside Workers Federation. In other words, the Commonwealth Government is handing over to an outside body the sole right to decide who shall be employed on the waterfront.",62
233,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Provide d he is a member of the federation.,62
234,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Bein g s member of a union is not a passport to heaven or anywhere else.,62
235,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Does not the honourable member believe in unionism?,62
236,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I do not - believe in present day unionism, because I see very little difference between it and tyranny. The first responsibility of a democratic government is to ensure that the law shall be impartially administered, and that all persons shall have an equal opportunity under it. The bill provides that the only persons who shall obtain employment - on the waterfront shall be those who become members of the Waterside Workers Federation. If my interof this provision be wrong, I should like the Attorney-General to say so. If I am right, I should like him to(1.) be justify this provision.",62
237,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.26] - The purpose of thisamendment is to cover permanent employees. Every time a permanent, employee is put to work, that is deemed to be an engagement. He cannot be put to work at any particular time unless he is registered.",62
238,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,That explanation does not answer my question.,62
239,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,No ; the point raised by the honourable member will be considered Amendment agreed to.,62
240,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Parramatta) [5.27] The definition of "" officer"" is "" an. officer holding office under this Act "" . I should like from the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) an assurance that the definition does not include any members of theStevedoring Industry Commission. I seek that assurance, because clause 5 provides that the chairman shall be appointed, by the Governor General, and shall hold office subject to good behaviour for five years. The other members of the commission will also be appointed by theGovernor-General and will hold officeduring His Excellency's pleasure. Subclause 2 of clause 3 provides that all officers and employees of the Stevedoring Industry Commission shall "" continue to hold office or be employed as if they were appointed under this Act."" Attorney-General will see that the word "" officer"" is used there. I seek an assurance that the definition of "" officer "" in clause 4 does not include a person who is a member of the commission. If it does, sub-clause 2 of clause 3 will apply.",62
241,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.28] - It is quite clear that an officer holding office under this legislation is not governed by the general provisions relating to officers. If he be a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, he has a judge's tenure of office. If he be a conciliation commissioner, he must be a person answering to that descripton under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Four members of the commission will be appointed respectively by the employers and the employees, and will not be officers within the meaning of this legislation. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) believes that their security would disappear if that were not so. I think that a definite assurance can be given to the honourable member. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 5(1.) There shall bo a Stevedoring Industry Commission, which shall consist of a Chairman, an officer of the Commonwealth and fonr other members, of whom one shall represent overseas shipowners, one shall represent Australian shipowners, and two shall represent the Federation. (2.) The Commission shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. (3.) The Chairman(a) shall be appointed by the Governor General; (li) shall be a Judge of the Court or a Conciliation Commissioner pointed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1040; and (c) shall hold office, subject to good behaviour, for five years but shall be eligible for re-appointment. (4.V The other members of the Commission(a) shall be appointed by the Governor General; (6) shall hold office during his pleasure; and (c) except in the case of the member who is an officer of the Commonwealth, shall be paid fees and allowances at such rates as the Minister determines. The Mr HARRISON (Wentworth) [5.29]. - On behalf of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) I move That, in sub-clause (1.), the words "", an officer of the Commonwealth "", be left out. I cannot understand why the Government desires to place an officer of the Commonwealth upon the Stevedoring Industry Commission. What is the purpose? Already we have had examples of ministerial interference in the decisions of the commission. Government intervention in the pay-day dispute resulted in Chief Judge Piper resigning as chairman of the tribunal. That incident occurred after the Government had directed the commission to reregister certain waterside workers whom it had deregistered. When replying to the second-reading debate the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) declared that the commission used its powers fearlessly. I challenge that statement, pointing out to him that the commission had often reversed its decisions. On a number of occasions, the Government has directed the tribunal to reconsider its. determinations, and it consented abjectly to do so. When Chief Judge Piper was chairman, he proved to be a man of mettle, who resigned rather than accept this dictation. A similar incident occurred when Mr. Justice de Baun resigned as chairman of the Maritime Services Commission. Men who are really worthwhile will not brook governmental interference with their administration. Why does the Attorney-General desire to appoint an officer of the Commonwealth to the Stevedoring Industry Commission? Will he be employed as a ap- "" snooper "" on behalf of the Government ? Will it be his function to inform the Government what happens within the commission ? Will he be a "" stand-over "" man, and when the commission proposes to take certain action, will he say, "" Before we reach a decision, I should like you to know the views of the Commonwealth Government on this subject, and. what you must do "". I have no doubt that he would be more discreet than to use the words, ""what you must do"", but he could intimate very clearly what the Government's policy was on a certain matter. If the Attorney-General desires the commission to function successfully, he should accept the amendment. The chairman, who may be a judge of the Arbitration Court, will be strictly impartial. Representatives of the employers and employees will be appointed, and the commission will be given certain powers to bring about peace on the waterfront. ""Why does the Government propose to appoint a Commonwealth officer? Will it be his function to watch the interests of the labour party? This ""stooge"" might have the responsibility of influencing decisions of the tribunal by pointing out that the Government would favour a certain decision. Peace will not be restored on the waterfront unless the commission is free from governmental interference. I urge the Attorney-General to accept the amendment.",63
242,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton--Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.35] - The bill provides that the commission shall be presided over by a judge or a conciliation commissioner. I have indicated that the intention of the Government is that a judge should be chairman. Other members of the commission will include two representatives of the employers, and two representatives of the employees. These five individuals are the only ones who will be able to make decisions - Should a dispute occur between the representatives of the employers and employees, the chairman will determine the matter.",64
243,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Then why have an officer representing the Commonwealth on the commission at all?,64
244,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I do not think that any member of the committee will support the statement by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) that the Commonwealth's representative on the commission will be a "" stooge "" of the Government. After all, there are public in terests to be considered, apart from the interests of employers and employees. The Government believes that the presence on the commission of a Commonwealth officer who can bring to its notice matters of public concern cannot do anything but good. He will not have a vote, and surely nobody will suggest that he will endeavour to influence decisions of the commission. Mr Francis.'-What - will he be there for if . it is not to influence the chairman?",64
245,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The honourable member's view is quite wrong. A Commonwealth officer has sat on the commission ever since it was inaugurated in 1942, and his services have been found to be of considerable value. In all probability, the officer will be one of the highest officials in the Department of Supply and Shipping, and we believe that his presence will be of great assistance to the commission. The Government cannot accept the amendment.",64
246,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Parramatta) [5.37] - I cannot support the clause in its present form despite the explanation given by the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt). I remind the committee that much store has been placed by the Government upon the recommendations of Judge Foster. The Attorney-General has said that the Government has accepted all but two of Judge Foster's recommendations. I find, however, upon examining His Honour's recommendations, that he did not include a recommendation supporting the appointment to the commission of an officer of the Commonwealth. He recommended that the commission should consist of a chairman and two representatives of the employees and two of the employers. There is no mention of an officer of the Commonwealth. The Stevedoring Industry Commission established under the National Security Regulations has been operating since 1942, and, as the Attorney General has said, during that time an officer of the Commonwealth has attended its deliberations. When Judge Foster was considering his recommendations, he could not have been unaware of the fact that an officer of the Commonwealth had been sitting on the commission, but he did not include a provision for such an officer in his recommendations. I do not wish to place this discussion on anything but the highest plane, but I say to the Attorney-General that it is not desirable that a body, the functions of wbicb are mainly judicial, should have, as one of its members, an outside person representing the Commonwealth Government. If this was an arbitration bill, and the proposed commission was to exercise the functions exercised hy Arbitration - Court, no provision would be made for the presence of an officer of the Commonwealth. Therefore, whether we call him a "" stooge"", a spy, or an observer-let us assume that he is there with the best possible motives-it is obvious that his presence must handicap deliberations. Obviously his function will be to convey the Commonwealth Government's point of view. That this will be the purpose of his presence cannot be doubted. As the commission will be fulfilling judicial as well as administrative functions, it should not be subject to influence by the Commonwealth or anybody else. The Commonwealth coiild get information from the commission in the same way as it gets information from courts including the Arbitration Court, or any other public body. No matter how good may be the intentions of the Government in providing for this appointment- I do not impute improper motives to the Attorney General in this regard-the proposal is fraught with the greatest possible danger. The Commonwealth officer will be tempted, perhaps irresistibly on occasions, to say to the commission, "" This is what we want you to do "", and if the commission is not prepared to accept the advice given to it, then perhaps the officer will be further tempted to go back to the Government and say so and so, with the result that there may be a change in the - personnel of the commission. All this is dangerous. The situation is unprecedented. The war-time commission was set up solely because of expediency. I repeat that Judge Foster did not see any necessity to recommend the appointment of a Commonwealth officer to the commission. There is no justification for continuing the present practice. Incidentally, I should like to know from the Attorney-General what duties this officer has performed up to date, and what justification there is for his retention on the permanent body. ""What has he carried from the commission's meetings to the Government, and what has he carried from the Government to the commission? Is it information? If so, surely it could be conveyed by other channels. Is it suggestions? If so, there should not be any such suggestions. Is it influence or pressure? I do not know, and I do not suggest that influence or pressure has been brought to bear, but the presence of that officer is dangerous and there is no warrant for it.",64
247,Mr AECHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barker) [5.43] - Like the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) I have very strong objections to the retention of these words in the clause. I am not unmindful of the fact that the Commonwealth is contemplating re-embarking upon the ownership of ships for commercial purposes. I believe, in fact, that it already has some vessels operating, and I should like to know from the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) whether the Government has in mind being represented on the commission as a ship-owning authority. Is that the intention? I understand that it is the policy of the Government to have Commonwealth ships running in competition with private lines.",65
248,Mr WARD,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Hear , hear!",65
249,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) says "" Hear, hear "". He has been rather silent lately. He seems just to have found his way out of Bretton Woods. Someone must have given him a torch. The functions that an officer of the Commonwealth may fulfil on a commission of this kind are varied and numerous. It has been said, perhaps without any justification, that he would represent to the commission the views of the Government in regard to the settlement of certain disputes. If the Government holds certain definite views in regard to the settlement of any industrial dispute that comes within this commission's jurisdiction, the Government should be properly and publicly represented on the commission. It seems to me that this provision is one under which the Government seeks to exercise influence over the course of events, without recording the imprint of its thumb. In other words, the Government wants power without any responsibility for what its officer does. Sub-clause 4 clause S, which must be read in conI nexion with this clause, readsAll questions arising at any meeting of the Commission shall be decided by a majority of votes, but the member who is an officer of the Commonwealth shall not be entitled to vote. Obviously, that officer is to be a voice only. He is to be there to lay down what the Government thinks on matters of vital concern-that is, if it has any mind at all on such matters - is justified.",65
250,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,It may be his duty to watch expenditure.,66
251,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"That would be an unpardonable sin, and he would soon be sent back to his department.",66
252,Mr MCDONALD,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,He would be in a similar position to that of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain).,66
253,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"That is an exact parallel. He would have no say whatever on anything connected with shipping. If the Government wants to be represented on the commission, it ought to be represented by a man who will be responsible by the casting of his vote for the view that the Government wishes him' to convey. He should be prepared to support the Government's case with his vote. I take it that the commission will have 'authority at any time to call any person before it in order to inform its mind on any subject. If the commission desires to know what the Government thinks on some subject, it should be entitled to say to the Attorney General, for instance, "" We are in trouble about such and such a matter. Would you be good enough to arrange for some one from the Department of Supply and Shipping to come along and explain your views to us ?"" At times matters associated with the interpretation of the law will arise. Are we to expect that an officer of the Attorney-General's Department will be sent along to say what the Attorney-General thinks is the law in regard to those matters? Even that is not precluded by this clause. The Attornev-General told us that he wanted to make the definitions wide enough. I am trying to make them narrow enough. of I am afraid that this one is too wide. regard this as bad procedure, and the committee should not agree to it.",66
254,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Fawkner) [5.4S] - I support the protest against an officer of the Commonwealth being included on this commission in a permanent capacity. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) has not convinced the committee that the retention of an officer of the Commonwealth-presumabl y a highly paid officer It may be that this provision is a carry-over of a war-time arrangement, and that the Government has not fully taken into account the different conditions which exist today. During the war period, when the Government desired that the commission should be informed on matters of national security, it was justified in having its direct representative on the commission, but whatever justification existed in wartime for such a procedure, it does not exist now. There is considerable concern on the part of the public that departments which were set up in wartime are not reducing their staffs as every one expected, thereby easing the burden on the taxpayers, but are, on the contrary, larger than during the war. The committee should examine closely any proposal to continue in a permanent capacity persons appointed to positions for the period of the war, especially when there appeared to be no need for such appointments prior to the outbreak of war. The Attorney-General says that interests other than those of employers and employees have to be considered. That that is also the view of the Opposition was made clear during the second reading debate. If the commissioner, or the judge, to be appointed does his work properly he will watch the interests of the public. It may be that in regard to otlier matters he may desire to know the policy of the Government, but, in that event, I suggest that, instead of appointing a full-time officer to the commission a representative of the department concerned could be sent along at any time his services - were desired. In that way the information sought would be made available without the expense of appointing an officer permanently to the commission. Because I believe that this committee should protest against the incurring unjustified expenditure, I am opposed to the clause as it stands.",66
255,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wentworth) [5.52]. - I am not satisfied with the exTherefore, planation of this clause given by the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt). When I raised this question I Attorney-General expected the right honourable gentletion man to tell the committee what the officer representing the Commonwealth had done, and is empowered to do. I ' pected him to say either that the officer was there to represent the Government and to report back to the Government the workings of the commission, or that he had assisted the commission in its ministrative duties. The right honourable gentleman merely told us that this man had done good work. He did not mission even say the kind of work that he had done. He did not say, for instance, that the officer had kept an eye on expenditure on behalf of the Treasury; had assisted in the interpretation of legal phraseology; had conveyed the directions of the vernment to the commission; or had ported back to the Government on the actions of that body. The committee entitled to know what the officer of Commonwealth did in the past, and what he will be expected to do in the future. Emphasis has been laid on the fact he will have no voting rights. That be, but he will have even greater power than that of exercising a vote. His power will be that of a man with the backing the government of the day. Although may not vote, there is nothing in this bill to prevent him from taking an active part in the deliberations of the mission.",67
256,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,He could recommend the removal of the chairman.,67
257,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"That is so. He would be in a position to place before other members of the commission, with all the force possible, the Government's of them resigned. policy in regard to this or that matter which may come up for consideration. There is nothing whatever to prevent this officer from saying to the commission, "" If you propose to adopt a certain line conduct, I think it would, be better to defer the matter while I refer it back to the Government "". This power is greater of than the power to cast a vote. This officer will be given an overriding power to say to the commission, "" This is the view of the Government, and this is what the Government expects you to do honourable members on this side of the chamber will not be content with the vague generalities which the offered as an explanaof the duties of this officer. The Minister should tell the committee exactly what the duties of this officer exare, and whether it is not possible to give to the commission the right to consult with various officers with regard to on departmental activities. That would be preferable to having one officer only who adwill be a permanent member of the commission, and whose job, obviously, will be either to give a direction to the comas to what the policy of the Government is, or to say to the commission, "" Before you take the step you propose to take, I should report back to my masters in order that they may indicate what they believe you should do "". I readily recall Goinstances of Government interference in rethat way. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) reversed, or altered, the decision is of the Stevedoring Industry Commission the with regard to attendance money. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) castigated the comthat mission quite recently because it may sought to uphold the law. The Government has also interfered with the commission in respect of its decisions of dealing with such things as annual leave he and the double-dumping of wool.",67
258,Mr CHIFLEY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Does the honourable commember mean that the Government has interfered with judges when they have been dealing with particular eases?,67
259,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The Government interfered to such' a degree in a matter which was being handled by Chief Judge the Piper and Mr Nicholls, the deputy chairman of the commission, that both Mr Chifley. - That is not correct.",67
260,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Le t us look at the facts. Immediately following the issuec r an instruction by the Government to of the commission for the immediate reinstatement of fourteen deregistered men involved in the pay-day strike, Chief JudgePiper and Mr Nicholls resigned; and it is clear that the Government's interference caused them to resign. No judge worth his salt would tolerate an instruction from the Government that he must inverse a decision which he had given in a particular matter.",67
261,Mr CHIFLEY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I should make it clear that neither the Government, nor any Minister, instructs judges; and if we did the judges would not accept our instructions.",68
262,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Originally , the pay-day dispute affected fourteen men who were deregistered by the Waterside Employment Committee. Those men appealed to the Stevedoring Industry Commission, which disallowed their appeals on the 31st October last. On the 2nd November last the Government intervened and directed the commission to restore to the working-list the names of those fourteen men. Those are the facts. Yet the Prime Minister now says that the Government does not give directions to the iudge. Possibly, that direction was given to the commission after Chief Judge Piper intimated that he intended to resign. However, the fact remains that the Government interfered in that matter as it interfered in other matters. For instance, when the commission decided that the men should handle double-dumped wool, Mr. Forde, who was then acting Prime Minister, declared that he would withhold permits for the export of any more doubledumped wool. That is how the Government frustrated the decision of the commission in that instance.",68
263,Mr WARD,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,And the work went on.,68
264,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Yes ; but Mr. Healy, the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, saw fit to refuse obey the commission's order to appear before it until after that regulation Government. lapsed.",68
265,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Chie f Judge Piper stated publicly that he resigned on the ground of ill health; and he stated specifically his resignation had nothing to do with the matter mentioned by the honourable member.,68

268,Unknown,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,68
269,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"When I suggested that the chairman and deputy chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission had resigned because of government interference, the Prime Minister said that Chief Judge Piper had resigned because of ill health. I accept that assurance, but I now ask the Attorney-General whether he can give the same assurance in regard to Mr Nicholls, the deputy chairman?",68
270,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I do not know the facts.,68
271,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"It is well known that Mr Nicholls resigned because of Government interference. No officer in his position could continue in the face of Government interference. That is why the Opposition objects to the proposal in this clause. There should he no place on the commission for a government officer who can be of no value to it. Is it suggested that he is to act in a purely advisory capacity? There is no need to appoint a permanent officer for that purpose. The services of Commonwealth officers could be co-opted from time to time when their advice was required. However, the Government proposesto place on the commission a man who will be charged, I have no doubt, with the performance of certain duties on behalf of the Government. The Attorney General said that the last officer who filled such a position on the commission did a good job of work. I now invite the Attorney-General to say what that work was. We on this side of the House have a very strong suspicion that a Commonwealth officer is to be appointed in order to influence the commission regarding government policy; to warn it if it attempts to take action contrary to to government policy; in other words, to act as a stand-over man on behalf of the This would place the commission in an intolerable position. It is that to be asked to work with a man who will be in a position say, "" Steady boys, the policy of the Government is so and so. If you act contrary to that policy the Government may give certain directions, is provided in the bill "" . Then the commission will find itself in the position it occupied in regard to the "" payday "" dispute, when it had to reverse its decision, and say that certain men whom it had deregistered were to be reregistered. That was what caused the resignation of Mr Nicholls. The Stevedoring Industry Commission is ostensibly to be given powers almost equal to those of the Arbitration Court; but, the Government says, in effect, "" Whereas it was not competent for us to put a Commonwealth officer on the Arbitration Court Bench, here we have something of our own creation, and we propose to stultify it by placing on it an officer who will have no vote, and no actual value except to influence the commission on matters concerning government policy"". If the Attorney-General desires the appointment of a commission that will be of value to the community he must not hamstring it at the outset by placing on it a "" stand-over "" man for the Government. Therefore, I ask the Government to accept the amendment so that the commission may exercise its functions unhampered.",68
272,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [8.6] - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) is very careless in the use of expressions. To suggest that Mr Sutcliffe, of the Department of Supply and Shipping, has acted as a "" stand-over "" man on the commission, or a "" stooge "" for the Government, is ridiculous. It must be well-known to many honourable members that this man, who is a distinguished officer in the service of the Commonwealth, has done very useful work during the period of his association with the commission. Let me read a note on this subject that I have received from the Minister for Supply and Shipping (.Senator Ashley)The proposal is to omit the provision officer of the Commonwealth to be a member of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The bill provides that the officer of the Commonwealth who is a member of the commission shall not be entitled to vote. The purpose of his appointment is to provide a liaison between the Government and the commission. The commission will doubtless inaugurate negotiations with State authorities, and these in many instances will be most appropriately dealt with on a governmental level. The services of the government member wil l be most useful in this connection. It is felt that the appointment of a senior government officer to assist in planning and supervising the commission's administrative activities will be of benefit to the commission. The government member will also be an informed channel of communication between the Minister and the commission, and his presence should - be of material assistance to the commission.",69

274,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"No , he is not to be a commissar. The honourable member is mistaken.",69
275,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Apparentl y he is to over-ride the authority of the commission.,69
276,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I remind honourable members that the commission will have many administrative functions to perform, and it is desirable, therefore, that it should have the assistance and advice of a representative of the Commonwealth Government. The commission will not be merely a body charged with the duty of fixing terms and conditions of employment. It will exercise power regarding the regulation of stevedoring operations, and this will not be just something between employers and employees. It will involve matters of general importance. What harm can possibly come out of a situation in which a responsible Commonwealth officer will have a seat on the commission without voting? I cannot see any force in the objection to this officer being present without a vote, having regard to the functions of the commission, and to the fact that the Government must keep itself closely informed regarding what is being done in this important industry. In certain circumstances such an officer, or the Minister himself, may desire to initiate a meeting of the commission. Those circumstances may arise when perhaps the employers do not wish to initiate a meeting or the employees themselves do not for an wish to have a particular matter dealt with.",69
277,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Shoul d not the calling of a meeting be the prerogative of the chairman?,69
278,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Importan t matters may arise in the industry, which in the opinion of the Government make it desirable to hold a meeting of the commission. Apart from the employers and the employees the public is interested in the decisions of the commission and the Government representative will in effect be the representative of the public. There is no principle in this to which objection can be raised. The provision for the appointment of an officer of the Commonwealth as a member of the commission which is contained in the existing regulation should we believe be retained.",69
279,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"New England) [8.11]. - I support the amendment. If anything were needed to strengthen my view on this matter it was the speech of the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to which we have just listened. In his second reading speech the right honourable gentletry man told us that grave and careful consideration had been given by the Government to the report submitted to it by Judge Poster, of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, who had conducted a long inquiry, with many public sittings, at which evidence and opinion were taken from both employers and employees. The right honourable gentleman added that the measure which is now before us followed the broad .recommendations contained in Judge Poster's report. Dealing with the constitution of this body Judge Foster recommended that it consist of a chairman and four members representative of employers' and employees' interests in the industry, that the chairHe man be a judge of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and that the representation on the commission be two members nominated by the ""Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, one member nominated by the Commonwealth Steamship Owners Federation and one member nominated by overseas ship owners. The clause dealing with the constitution of the commission is one of the most important clauses in the bill as commission is to be the body which is to usher in the golden age on the waterfront in Australia. Notwithstanding that the Attorney-General told us that grave and careful consideration was given to - Judge Foster's recommendations, one of the most important recommendations made by the learned judge has been rejected. The right honourable gentleman then read a statement from some document prepared for the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley), - explaining the reason for the failure to adopt these recommendations in to to. Of - course, one would expect that any document prepared for the Minister would be in accordance with government policy. When a representative of the Government was appointed to the war-time commission there was some excuse for his inclusion, as that body was expending funds provided by the Government. The new commission, however, will not draw its funds from the Government; it will collect them through additional freight rates on export and interstate cargoes which will have to be borne by the primary producers of Australia. Counpeople and the members of the party to which I belong know only too well that the producers of Australia will suffer in two ways as the result of this bill; they will be "" h it "" by increased overseas freights, and they will be "" h it "" by rising interstate freights on machinery and other commodities necessary for the working of their properties. The Attorney-General has advanced most extraordinary reasons for continuing to have a Commonwealth representative as a member of the commission. He said that Mr Sutcliffe, the government nominee, is an excellent man who had rendered great service to the war-time commission throughout the whole of the war period. must be an excellent officer because, as far as I know, there has been no criticism of his work either by the owners, the waterside workers or by honourable members on the Government side.",70
280,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,O r by members of the Opposition.,70
281,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"That is so. I remind the Attorney-General, however, that Mr. Sutcliffe is a mere mortal, who will not this live forever. Heaven alone knows who may be appointed in the future. For all we know some future appointee may be the nominee of Mr Healy, the Communist secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation. Still reading from the brief prepared for the Minister for Supply and Shipping, the Attorney General said that the government representative is to act as a liaison officer between the commission and the Government. When I interjected that he would be a sort of commissar of the Government, the right honourable gentleman said, "" Oh no; not a commissar; a sort of liaison officer "". A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. On the admission of the right honourable gentleman the Government representative is to be a kind of liaison officer, a "" stooge"", a sort of peeping Tom, a snooper whose duty it will be to report to the Government exactly what goes on at the meetings of the commission, and whose very presence at such meetings will prevent free and open discussion of the problems with which it has to deal. The Government probably will even consult the chairman, who should be the official channel of communication to the Government, as to decisions made by the comsecond-reading mission. The government nominee will go behind the back of the commission tell the Attorney-General any story he likes, irrespective of what the commission decides. It bodes ill for the successfid working of this commission if it is be made impotent from the very compowers, mencement of its operations by the occasions, inclusion in its membership of a government spy. The right honourable gentleman also said that the government representative will be the informal channel communication between the commission and the Government. Neither the memment bers of the commission nor the chairman will know what this informal mouthyears, piece reports to the Government. He too, that the commission will have a lo,t work to do on a government level. If that be so, surely it should be handled Ministers of the respective governments concerned. Is important work on such high level to be undertaken by the watchthem. dog, the reporter, the snooper, the peeper for the Government? If so, it must be intended that he shall be clothed with powers greater than those possessed by commission itself. The case made by Attorney-General in support of the conIndustry tinuance in office of this gentleman entirely wrong and accordingly I trust that the. amendment will be carried.",70
282,Mr MCBRIDE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wakefield) [8.19] hope that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) will accept the amendment. Honpower orable members on this side of the chamber are extremely keen to make this commission a workable authority. To appoint a liaison officer to such a mission is quite a new idea. Tho 122] Constitution limits the Commonwealth Government's industrial powers. From 1904, when the Arbitration Court was set up under an act of the Commonwealth Parliament, until the Stevedoring Industry Commission was appointed as a wartime body, there was never a suggestion that there should be a liaison officer between the court and the Government. The suggested purpose of the liaison officer between the Stevedoring Industry Commission not and the Government may appear perfectly innocent to the Attorney General and those who sit behind him, but it was demonstrated throughout the debate that the great need of the day is that not only employers and and employees but also the general public shall have confidence in the arbitration system. On two occasions since assuming office, the Labour party has sought to from the people expanded industrial and, I think fortunately, on both the people have said, "" No ! "" I see in the appointment of a liaison officer between the commission and the of Government an effort by the Government to get around that refusal. The statethat it is a completely innocent proposal will deceive no one. In the war extraordinary circumstances prevailed, and, under its defence powers, the said, Commonwealth had wide industrial of powers; but, in spite of the claim that in that period the liaison officer between the by commission and the Government performed useful functions, the Attorneya General has given a poor account of The cold fact remains that the Government, from time to time, would not accept the decisions of its own authority, and, using its war-time powers, over the rode them. That happened to the decithe sions of not only the Stevedoring Commission but also the Mariis time Industry Commission and other war-time authorities. Now that peace reigns, the Government is not in possesI sion of powers of the same magnitude, and, in order to overcome its loss of and the refusal of the people to give it extra powers, it has decided to appoint this liaison officer. I believe that the Stevedoring Industry Commiscomsion will operate under a tremendous handicap if the appointment of the liaison officer is insisted upon. I think there is no doubt in the minds of the people that the liaison officer will be on the commission, not to express publicly the government views, because if the Government wanted public expression of its views, it could submit evidence on any matter considered by the commission, 'but to convey to it reports of the commission's activities. The Government wants to act not frankly but behind closed doors. The appointment of a liaison officer would tend to destroy the confidence in the commission of not only the employers and employees but also the people. Whatever merits there may be in the reasons for the proposed appointment that were given by the Attorney General, the dangers outweigh them. I hope that the Attorney-General will appreciate that every honourable member wants to improve the industrial position, not only on the waterfront but throughout industry generally, and that the amendment has been moved with that end in view. So I trust that he will agree to drop the proposal. Whether or not Mr Sutcliffe was on the commission during the war, there is no certainty that he will be appointed to the new commission, or that, if he should be appointed, he will remain on it, because he could be removed from it at any time. I have no doubt that, should the commission, if appointed, not give the kind of decisions wanted by the Government, he will be "" axed "". It is no reflection to say that he will be appointed, if he is appointed, to carry out the wishes of the Government, for, as a public servant, it will be his job to do so. We are not criticizing the individual. Our criticism is directed at the Government's loading the commission with an extra man who will be its mouthpiece. That is an indication that the Government is beginning to set up a "" gestapo "", a secret service, that it may be kept informed of what the various Commonwealth authorities are doing. I am glad that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the second reading of which was moved yesterday by the Attorney-General, does not provide for a liaison officer between the Arbitration Court and the Government, but it is not beyond the Government's capacity to amend that bill to proMr MCBride. vide for one because, although this bill was introduced only recently, after a great deal of consideration, as we know from the Attorney-General, we have had placed before us by the Government three pages of amendments, and a government capable of such comprehensive reconsideration of this bill may be expected to be equally diligent in re-considering the other. I ask the Attorney-General, in the interests of industrial peace, to put the Stevedoring Industry Commission beyond reproach and to have the employers, the employees and the people generally realise that the Government has accepted the people's will and is operating under the Constitution as it is and not as the Labour party would have it.",71
283,Mr HUTCHINSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Deakin) [8.28]. - The Opposition has not moved the amendment merely as a talking point, but because it believes that if the Stevedoring Industry Commission is to operate successfully it should be unhampered. It is extraordinary that as we discuss this matter we are unaware whether a commission is or is not to be re-appointed. We know that, although it was appointed in the first place to ensure a speedy turnround of vessels, the reverse has applied. Only yesterday the chairman, Mr Morrison, was reported to have said that, in his view, it had failed in that it could not discipline the waterside workers. A strike of unparalleled proportions was raging on the Sydney waterfront and he recommended that the commission should be abolished. We do not know whether, if this bill is passed, it will ever be proclaimed.",72
284,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,We do not know whether the Attorney-General is presiding at a birth or a funeral.,72
285,Mr HUTCHINSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Quite so. We could discuss the bill with more assurance if we knew the Government's intentions, in order and were certain that after the passage of the bill a permanent Stevedoring Industry Commission would arise from the ashes of the war-time body. If a new commission should be established, the people of Australia will look upon it much more favourably if the employers and the employees are represented equitably under the chairmanship of a judge of the Arbitration Court without any representative of the Commonwealth Government being a member of it. The commission will control the affairs of an industry employing a body of men who can do more to affect the public welfare than perhaps any other group of unionists in Australia. Their actions affect exports of primary products, and they can materially affect imports of goods necessary for the development of our secondary industries and the prosperity of the community. The interests of the nation will best be served if the commission is not influenced directly by the representative of any political party. The commission will be presided over by an Arbitration Court judge.",72
286,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,We hope.,73
287,Mr HUTCHINSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I accept the assurance given by the Minister that he intends to appoint an Arbitration Court judge as chairman of the commission. The chairman will not be subject to the conditions which normally apply to Arbitration Court judges. His appointment will be made by the Minister of the day, and he will be eligible for reappointment after a term of a few years. Notice that the term of appointment is limited. It will not be for an indefinite period, as is the case with appointments to the Arbitration Court. The commission will not be able to alter disruption on the waterfront. standard hours of work in the stevedoring industry, but it will have power to do anything that it wishes in connection with wages, and it will also have important managerial and administrative powers. It will be able to take managerial control entirely out of the hands of a shipowner. Its rule will be supreme on the waterfront. Intruded into the memberment's ship of this commission will be a reprethe sentative of the Commonwealth. What is the reason for this provision? We the Dutch in Indonesia. have been told by the Attorney-General that the appointment will be made because, from time to time, there may arise problems which will need intermission governmental action. This officer will institute negotiations leading to such action. That is not a valid reason for the appointment. The Arbitration Court judge who will be appointed as chairbeen man of the commission could approach the government and ask for appropriate action to be taken whenever such a problem arose. Therefore, the only argument advanced by the Government in favour of this appointment is invalid. In the past, the Government has shown a strange lack of resistance to trade union influence, and, unfortunately, to Communist influence. As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) has proved, there is a remarkable similarity between this bill and the bill drafted by Jim Healy, the Communist boss of the waterside workers. On frequent occasions in recent years the Government has danced to the tune of the union bosses. I believe that the Commonwealth representative will be appointed so that the views of the waterside workers and their Communist bosses, or of the trade unions in general, can be brought to bear in the deliberations of the commission. There is ample evidence to support my belief that the Government is willing to yield to the influence of the waterside workers. During the dark days of the war, when ships were pulling into Brisbane and Sydney to load urgently needed war material, the waterside workers engaged in strikes. Despite the fact that strategic plans had been made and dates had been fixed for offensives in New Guinea, these men continued with their policy of The Government, took no action against them, and we do not know whether its representative on the commission advised it to take action or not. Instead of penalizing the strikers, the Government called out soldiers on "" six bob "" a day to load the ships. Another instance of the Governweakness in its dealings with waterside workers was its feeble acceptance of the union policy towards In this instance, too, it failed to discipline the waterside workers. What role did the Government's representative on the complay on that occasion? We have not been told. We can only judge the Government by its record, and its record on the waterfront is deplorable. There have been numerous hold-ups, costs have forced up, and the turn-round of ships has been delayed with consequent interference to the trade and commerce of the country. Because of these facts, the public will view with grave suspicion the Government's decision to appoint to the commission a man who will have a voice in its discussions but will have no responsibility for its actions. For its own benefit, if not for the good of tralia as a whole, the Government should remove the cause of this suspicion by abandoning the proposal. Such an appointment is not necessary. The judge who will preside over the commission could approach the Government on any matters which required inter-governmental action. The Government could consider his advice and take action immediately. It would certainly meet with little obstruction from the State governments, five of which are controlled by the Labour party. We consider the amendment to be of vital importance. Let us have a commission in which we can have faith. On its past record, the Government cannot command the trust of any reasonably intelligent person who has taken an interest in affairs on the waterfront. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.",73
288,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Parramatta) [8.39] The committee is considering clause 5 of the bill, which provides that, in addition to the chairman, two representatives of the employees and two representatives of the employers, an officer of the Commonwealth shall be appointed to the commission. The Opposition has submitted an amendment proposing to delete that part of the clause which provides for the appointment of an officer of the Commonwealth. A very important principle is involved here. At the outset, we asked the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) this very pertinent question: Why was the recommendation of the royal commissioner, Judge Foster, not followed in this connection 1 Judge Foster recommended that the commission should consist of a chairman and four other members. He did not say anything about the appointment of an officer of the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General has a most acute mind, and very great clarity of expression, but T have never heard him at worse advantage than when he sought to explain this matter. Indeed, he was driven to express, not his own views, but the views of the Minister for Supply and Shipping (.Senator Ashley) regarding the retention on the commission of the Commonwealth officer. What does the Minister for Supply and Shipping know about it? I could have understood, Aus- and I could have been very much impressed by a closely reasoned argument by the Attorney-General, who is a man of very 'great experience; but I suggest that the case exposed its own weaknesses when the right honourable gentleman had to import the views of the Minister for Supply and Shipping in order to justify the retention of this official. Judge Foster made no bones about it. As the royal commissioner, he heard the evidence of the representatives of all parties. After having sat for some months, he brought in a most voluminous report, and he was satisfied that it was a bad thing to have a Commonwealth officer on the commission. Despite His Honour's finding, we .are now asked to perpetuate something which was done during World War II . Mr Justice Dixon and Judge Foster specifically stated that what was done during World War II . in connection with the Stevedoring Industry Commission was purely temporary, and was to cease at the termination of hostilities. That statement appears on page 12 of Judge Foster's report. Notwithstanding that opinion, we are asked to agree to the retention on the commission of the Commonwealth officer. I should like to know what functions this officer will perform that cannot be exercised by the secretary or the chairman of the commission. I am completely unconvinced by the reason advanced by the Minister for Supply and Shipping for the retention of the Commonwealth officer. The suggestion is, among other things, that this would be on a "" Cabinet level"". I do not understand that. The suggestion is that negotiations would take place from time to time with State governments, officials, or industrial tribunals. In my experience of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales, the State judges have not had any difficulty on any occasion in negotiating with Ministers of the Crown, departmental heads, and Commonwealth officers. They do not need a government nominee on the commission. On none of the industrial tribunals in New South Wales is there such a nominee. I should like to know why the Attorney-General proposes to perpetuate this temporary measure, and depart from established practice. That brings me to the crux of the matter. This is a new and dangerous thing. It is dangerous because there will sit, side by side with judges or officers who are supposed to be impartial, political advisors on behalf of the Government. I am not putting this on the footing of impropriety, or illegal or improper pressure, because I do not know; but it is strange that this new political practice is to be adopted, and that an allegedly impartial tribunal should have this silent member. Why is he to be appointed ? No reason whatever.has been advanced for his being on the commission, and the community and the commission should not be exposed to the undoubted political risks which lie in having this government member there to advise and, I suggest, in some cases with some governments, to influence the commission.",74
289,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Fawkner) [8.45] - As this is one of the key clauses of this important bill, it should be thoroughly discussed. This clause sets up the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The original commission was a war-time authority, and the Government's experiment of re-appointing it will cost the Australian taxpayer £600,000 per annum. True it is that the £600,000 will be provided in the first instance by charging a certain sum on the wages paid to men employed on the waterfront; but obviously the costs will be passed on, and will eventually be borne by the taxpayer. Therefore, we should scrutinize very closely the value that we shall receive for this commission, and examine the necessity for it. .Before the outbreak of World War II Australia did not - have a Stevedoring Industry Commission, and the industrial functions of this body were undertaken by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. What shall we obtain for the expenditure of £600,000 a year? Can it be claimed that we shall get peace on the waterfront? All honourable members would agree that such a price for continuity in the unloading and loading of ships in Australian ports would not be too high. At present, 70 ships are held up in the Port of Sydney.",75
290,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Mr Clark) Order! Is the honourable member discussing the clause or the amendment?,75
291,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I am discussing the clause generally.,75
292,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member must discuss the amendment which is before the committee.,75
293,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I am entitled to address my remarks to the clause.,75
294,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member's remarks will be in order as long as he knows that he is speaking to the clause.,75
295,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Yes , I am addressing my remarks to the clause, as I am entitled to do. Before the adjournment, I spoke to the amendment. I am now examining the need for the establishment of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. I ask: Can we obtain any guarantee that the commission will bring about industrial peace on the waterfront? The record of industrial unrest on the wharfs has been considerably worse since the appointment of the commission than it was prior to the outbreak of war in 1939. I do not know of anything in the record of the commission which suggests that it will do something which the Commonwealth Arbitration Court could not do very much better and at considerably less expense. As to its workability and practicability, what do we find ? The former chairman of the commission, Chief Judge Piper, resigned because he was not able to get the authority for the commission that he needed. Despite the protestations of the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to the contrary, that is obvious to every one. In the comparable tribunal which was functioning on the waterfront of New . , Zealand a few weeks ago, the judge, who was presiding, also resigned. The former chairman of the Maritime In dustry Commission, Mr Justice de Baun resigned because he found that he was not able to get any authority of government behind the decisions which the commission gave. It is common knowledge that within the last 48 hours, the conciliation commissioner, who now presides over the Stevedoring Industry Commission, has indicated that he is not able to get obedience from waterside workers to the decisions of the commission. Therefore, what recommendation have we for the constitution of this expensive government instrumentality ? There is also the matter of efficiency. Will the commission achieve peace-in industry, and some measure of efficiency? All the discussion on this bill has revealed . very clearly that ships are not being unloaded and loaded so expeditiously as they were in Australian port3 before the outbreak of war. Earlier, I referred to another important aspect. We have criticized the Government's proposal to appoint this commission. We have shown that it will undermine our arbitration system. It represents the policy of the Communist party, which is determined to smash the arbitration system. If the Government, despite our efforts, is determined to establish the commission, we are faced with a practical situation, and must make the tribunal as workable as we can. Consequently, I come to the provision that the chairman of the commission shall be a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, or a conciliation commissioner. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) has already foreshadowed an amendment which would eliminate the possibility of a conciliation commissioner being appointed as chairman of the commission. There are very good reasons for that. As the name implies, a conciliation commissioner's job is to bring the parties together and endeavour to reach an agreement. But that is not the prime function of arbitration. It is one thing to get the parties together and to bring about a settlement, but there is also the other consideration, namely, whether the public interest has been well served by that process, or whether the price that is being paid for the agreement will be passed on to the consuming public. So, there is a very sound basis for our arbitration system which in the past has put presiding officers above the storm, so that they may consider the matters placed before them objectively and 'give decisions which not only represent a basis of justice as between the parties, Mr Bolt. but also protect the interests of the public. The Government claims to have accepted the recommendations of Judge Foster, but it has departed altogether from those recommendations in regard to this matter. Judge Foster recommended that the presiding officer should be a judge; but the Government says that he should lie a judge or a conciliation commissioner. The Attorney-General gave a lukewarm assurance that the chairman would be a judge, but he qualified the assurance with the words "" if possible "". Why should it not be possible? What is to prevent this Government appointing, if it so chooses, half a dozen additional Arbitration Court judges ? In accordance with the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill which was presented to the Parliament yesterday, fifteen additional conciliation commissioners are to be appointed. Surely, if it is possible to appoint fifteen new conciliation commissioners, it should he possible to appoint sufficient additional judges to enable one to preside over the Stevedoring Industry Commission. I am not satisfied with the Attorney-General's assurance. The clause should be amended in terms which have been indicated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies). The Opposition approaches this problem with a great deal of concern and scepticism. The waterfront industry is a key industry and the rapid movement of shipping today is of vital importance, not only to Australia and Australian trade, but also to Great Britain. Yesterday or today, according to this evening's press, a motion was submitted in the British House of Commons in which Mr. Churchill made pointed references to Great Britain's need for foodstuffs. Yet, in the Port of Sydney today, 70 ships are held up when they should be rendering valuable assistance in that regard. This hold-up is occurring despite the fact that a Stevedoring Industry Commission is already in existence. If the waterside workers are not prepared to abide by the decisions of that body, what prospect is there of this new authority meeting with any more success? The price that the public has already paid, and the experience of the past, suggest not merely that the commission should be abolished, but also that waterfront problems should he put where they belong, namely, in the hands of the Arbitration Court.",75
296,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Hunter) [8.54] - Once again the Opposition is endeavouring to delay government business. Already this week we have had a motion for the adjournment of the House, and apparently the Opposition's tactics today represent another phase of its attempt to hinder legislation. I have endeavoured to ascertain the real basis of the arguments that have been advanced by the Opposition against the appointment of a Commonwealth officer to the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The implementation of this legislation will involve the expenditure of public money, and surely there is every justification for-the presence on the new body of an officer who will watch proceedings in the interests of the Government and of the public. He will not be able to vote, nor will he be able to influwith which one does not agree? ence decisions, but he will be of considerCommunist able assistance to the commission as a liaison officer. He will be able to draw the attention of the commission to troubles that are likely to arise in the industry, and so nip disputes in the bud. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale) has alleged that the appointment would be political. That is not true. The officer would be an official of a government department, probably the Attorney-General's Department. He would not be a member of Parliament. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) expressed the opinion that the matters to be handled by the Stevedoring Industry Commission properly fell within the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, but everybody knows what a slow-moving machine the Arbitration Court is. There is always a large number of claims awaiting hearing, and the irritation caused by this delay is one of the fundamental reasons for the present industrial turmoil. A conciliation eommissioner need not be an expert in every phase of a particular industry. He need be well-versed in only the section of it involved in a dispute. Disputes involving other sections could be dealt with by other men. I know just how complicated is the industry to which I belong, and I realise that the waterfront industry presents almost as many problems. Honourable members opposite allege that the stevedoring industry is Communist controlled, and that this measure has 'been introduced at the instigation of the Communist party. But let us consider for a moment the strength of the Communist party throughout Australia. It has not yet succeeded in getting one representative into this Parliament. In fact, in only one State has it succeeded in securing the election of its nominee, yet to hear honourable members opposite talk one would think that the Communist party was leading the Labour party and the whole of the industrial organization by the nose. That is definitely incorrect. I am not prepared to go so far as some Opposition members, and refuse . these people the right to work in industry. Those who take that stand claim to be democrats. What form of democracy is it which would stifle all political views The party has every right to express its view, so long as it keeps within the law, and its members should not be denied the right to work side by side with others in order to earn a livelihood. If we deny them that right we ought not to have fought Hitler or Mussolini. Am I to deny a man and his wife and children food because he has a different political outlook from mine? Some honourable members opposite would not hesitate to do that. The CHAIRMAN' - The honourable member must confine his remarks to the bill.",77
297,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) said that the Communist party is determined to smash the Arbitration Court.,77
298,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Does not the honourable member believe that?,77
299,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"No , I do not; but I do know that the party which the honourable member for Fawkner supported tried to do so. The honourable member may recall that in 1929 the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, brought before the Parliament a proposal to take the control of arbitration from the Commonwealth court and hand it back to the States.",77
300,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) advocated the same thing last night.,77
301,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The honourable member for Denison has a perfect right to express that view, although it is one with which I disagree. If we are to have a mince-meat mixture of arbitration, under the control of a number of tribunals in different states there will be continual turmoil throughout the Commonwealth. With such a system in force there could be a different basic wage in every State, and the result might well be that the captains of industry would transfer their manufacturing establishments to the State which had the lowest basic wage and transport the cheaply made goods to the high-wage State, resulting in unemployment in the latter state. It is foolish to blame the Communist party for opposing the arbitration system, when the party which honourable members opposite supported decided to abolish the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Honourable members may recall that Mr Bruce lost his seat, and that the party led by himwas soundly beaten at the election which followed his proposal.",78

303,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I think that the honoron able member for Denison had a motive in what he said. I believe that he holds view that if the control of arbitration were handed back to the States, they would quickly realise the cause of turmoil in the community and would be Britain. prepared to vest in the Commonwealth additional powers over employment industry. It is not the fault of the Labour party that those powers have not already been conferred on the Commonmond wealth. Mr Matthew Charlton, who the preceded me in this chamber as the representative of the electorate Hunter, supported the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, when he tried to get full industrial powers for the Commontion, wealth m 1924.

I claim that I am sticking to clause 5, which deals with the constitution of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, a body which will be entrusted with the duty of ensuring that cargoes shall be sent overseas, and therefore will be responsible for seeing that they are loaded on to ships. I was endeavouring to. point out that one of the duties of the commission will be to make certain that foodstuffs are not left to rot on the wharfs, as is happening at present in Sydney, where 40,000 bags of potatoes are rotting in the holds of ships which are tied up. Those potatoes and other commodities can be shifted only by some authority",78

321,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Order ! clause is fairly wide. It begins "" There shall be a Stevedoring Industry Commission "". The Chajr rules that members may debate whether there shall be such a. commission, but they are not entitled deal with all the ramifications of the setting up of such a body as if this were a second-reading debate. Their remarks must be confined to the setting up of a commission and its constitution.",79
322,Mr ANTHONY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I shall follow your ruling closely, Mr Chairman. The amendment before the Chair provides that the commission shall consist of a chairman, who shall be a judge, two representatives of - the Waterside Workers Federation, a representative of Australian shipowners and a representative of overseas shipowners. I believe that I shall be in order if I draw attention to some of the difficulties which will face the commission and the necessity for constituting an authority in which confidence can be reposed. I come now to the proposal to appoint a government representative to the commission. The Attorney-General ,(Dr Evatt), in the course of his illustrious career in this Parliament, has provided us with some amazing expositions of logic, but never have I heard him put up a worse case than he did to-night. Never before have I known him to have to leave the chamber in order to get a note from another Minister to explain a simple matter. The Attorney-General, who is one of the keenest legal minds in Australia, had to go out for a note from' the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashely) to explain part of the bill. Such a situation is ludicrous. It has been said that the government officer on the commission will be a liaison officer. He is to sit on the commission without a vote, and is, presumably, to be dumb, also. His function is to report to the Minister. Is that not properly the function of the chairman of the commission? If certain matters require a governmental decision is it not the place of the chairman to discuss them with the Minister? It would be just as logical for the Government to place its own representative on the High Court Bench, or to put a thirteenth man on a jury, one with no vote, but charged with the duties The of reporting to somebody outside. The amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) merits the close consideration of the Attorney General. Surely the Government is to to have enough influence of the appointment of the commission without needing to put on it a separate representative of its own. Let us see how the commission is to be appointed. The clause says that the chairman shall be appointed by the Governor General-that is, of course, His Excellency the Honourable W. J. MCKell. The other members of the commission shall be appointed by the Governor General-Hi s Excellency the Honourable W. J. MCKell. And they shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor General-Hi s Excellency the Honourable W. J. MCKell. These members of the commission, except in the case of the member who is an officer of the Commonwealth, shall be paid fees and allowances at such rates as the Minister determines. It is clear, therefore, that under clause 5, the Government is to have full authority in regard to the appointment of members of the commission. It will not go to the Waterside Workers Federation and say,_ "" Elect your representative to the commission. Take a vote on the matter "". No, it says, "" We shall select two members of your organization, two hand-picked men, and appoint them to the commission The Government does not say to the shipowners, "" Will you choose by ballot some one to represent you on this commission? "" It does nothing of the sort. It says, "" We are going to select some person who may or may not be acceptable to you, and he shall be your representative on the commission"". Then, not yet being satisfied that it will have complete control over the commission, because the men so chosen may prove fro ""be of an independent turn of mind, the Government, so as to make assurance doubly sure, says, "" We shall put our own officer on the commission, whose duty will be, not to vote as a member of the commission, but to report to the Minister "". Will this system work ? Apparently, the present chairman of the commission, Mr D. V. Morrison, can foresee the consequences of such an appointment because yesterday, in the course of a press statement, he asked the Government to abandon its proposal to appoint a permanent stevedoring commission. believe that the Government would be well advised to accept that advice.",79
323,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Martin) [9.17] - As was pointed out by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), we have been treated to-night to an exhibition of stoneable walling by members of the Opposition, who have made a deliberate attempt to put political propaganda over the air, careless of the welfare of the nation which this bill is designed to promote. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) criticized the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) for leaving the chamber for a few moments in order to pick up some notes on the bill. Judging by the speech of the honourable member, 1 should say that it is a pity he did not take the trouble to provide himself with some notes, because his whole speech was nothing but stone-walling, and had nothing to do with the clause before the committee. Honourable members opposite have taken exception to the proposal to appoint to the commission a government representative.",80
324,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,They admit that he is a capable man.,80
325,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Yes , and that he has rendered great service to the Commonwealth. There is no consistency in the arguments of the Opposition. Surely it is reasonable that the Commonwealth should have a representative on any authority which is charged with the expenditure of £600,000 a year, or with the expenditure of any amount, for that matter. This practice was always followed by governments which were supported by honourable members opposite. Therefore, their objection to this provision is merely an attempt to find fault with the bill which, in their hearts, they know is likely to usher in a period of industrial peace. Honourable members opposite are palpably inconsistent. First, they said that the Government should not have implemented Judge Foster's recommendation. At the same time, they found fault with Judge Foster's record and made various insinuations against him. In the next breath, they criticized the Government for failing, in this instance, to follow the judge's recommendation. I Dr. EVATT - And Judge Foster did not recommend against this provision.",80
326,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"No . Obviously, honourable members opposite have cast consistency to the winds. Their sole purpose is to find fault. Consequently, their arguments lack substance. No reasonman can support their proposition that the Government should not appoint a representative on an administrative body for which the Government is responsible. But, viewing this provision in the least favourable light, what damage can be done by appointing a Government representative on this body? That representative will not have power to exercise a vote. His duties will be purely those of an observer on behalf of the Government. In the last resort, on any issue which goes to a vote, and in the nature of things many such issues will arise, he will not be able to influence the decision of the commission, because he will not have a vote. All decisions of the commission will be majority decisions, and the government representative will have no say when the vote is taken. Therefore, we can dismiss the arguments of the Opposition on that point. Honourable members opposite are merely stone-walling. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) said that this measure had been inspired by the Communists. In that respect, he repeated groundless statements by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale), who said that the wording of certain paragraphs of the measure was identical with that of provisions in what he termed "" Mr Healy's bill "". The honourable member, apparently, is not aware that the particular provisions to which he referred in that respect are taken verbatim from regulations of the National Security (Stevedoring Industry) Regulations, and that, obviously, Mr Healy took his wording from that source when drafting the bill which he submitted to Judge Poster. Honourable members opposite deliberately misrepresent the facts when they say that any clause of this measure has been inspired by the Communists. The honourable member for Parramatta in speaking against the measure has been "" off the beam"" altogether. At the appropriate time. I shall read to honourable members figures which completely answer the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). Honourable members opposite have no intention of endeavouring to make practical suggestions for improvement of the measure. I am appalled to find that responsible members of Parliament should endeavour to hold up this measure which is designed to establish peace on the waterfront.",80
327,Mr BERNARD CORSER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wide Bay) [9.25],- I strongly oppose the setting of a stevedoring industry commission which is provided for in the clause now before the Chair. I oppose this provision, first, because it meets the desires of Communists, who have deliberately instinot gated unrest on the waterfront with the sole idea of giving the Government a pretext for the proposed alterations of our arbitration system. The objective of the Communists is to weaken, and then destroy, the existing arbitration system. Under this measure, the Government is doubt, helping them to achieve that aim by the stevedoring industry away from Arbitration Court and placing it under the exclusive control of a commission. Under such conditions the Communists will be able to hold up shipping in every port in Australia to the grave detriment of our commerce and consequent loss to our producers. Much has been said with respect to the appointment of a government representative on the commission. I am unable to work up indignation on that point, because, under the measure, the commission will be so constituted that it would not make any difference at all were it to consist of half a dozen government representatives. The commission is to be composed of a chairman who will be appointed by the Government. Of the other four members, two will represent the "" Com ""-directed Waterside Workers Federation, one will represent the Australian shipowners-and we know that the Government now controls 90 per cent, of the ships plying in Australian waters - and the other member will be a representative of the overseas shipowners in whose selection I have not the slightest doubt the Government will have a very large say. Thus the Government will have the "" bag "". I oppose the setting up of this commission for many reasons, the chief of them being that I do not believe that such a body will be capable of establishing peace on the waterfront. I do not believe that honourable members opposite sincerely think that the setting up of this commission will achieve any worthwhile results. It will not enable parties in the industry to become friends. It will not be able to make the men work, and thus enable the country to carry on its industries and commence, particularly with up countries which are now in such dire distress and are clamouring for supplies of foodstuffs. Although the Arbitration Court is quite capable of carrying out the the duties which will be allotted to the proposed commission, the Government doeshesitate to set up this new body at ». cost of £600,000 a year and appoint to it two "" Corns "", a government representative who will also he a "" Com "", and a representative allegedly of the Australian shipowners who also will, in fact, be another government representative. No after the next general elections, a takdefeated Labour candidate will be the appointed to that position. The cost of maintaining the commission will have to be passed on. to whom? It cannot be passed on to the Government, because the Government does not produce commodities. The Government merely talks about what it does for the producers, and the subsidies which it gives to them. It does not give anything at all to the producers. All subsidies come out of the pockets of the taxpayers. This £600,000 will be taken by compulsion by the authorities 6fl the wharfs by a charge of 4£d. for each man-hour worked by stevedores and waterside workers. That charge will be passed on to the primary producers and manufacturers of secondary products, who ship their commodities either interstate or abroad. As the establishment of the commission was desired by the Communists we have no confidence in its ability to bring about peace on the waterfront and a quicker turn-round of ships. I believe in the maintenance of the arbitration system. I go further and say that we should continue in existence only the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Many years ago a former Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, expressed a strong request for one arbitration system. He asked the States to abolish the state system, claiming that they did not abandon it he would ask them to agree to the abolition of the Commonwealth court. I see nothing in this bill which will improve conditions on the waterfront, and accordingly I shall vote against the clause providing for the establishment of the commission.",81
328,Mr HAYLEN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Parkes) [9.32] - It is patent that honourable members opposite are insincere in relation to this discussion because in the first place their ments have been of a spurious nature. In analysing the composition of the commission, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) referred first to the government officer and then to the representatives of the employees. noticed the same tendency on the part of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale), studiously to avoid any reference to the ship-owners' organization. Listening to the remarks of honourable members opposite one is forced to the conclusion that in their view an ideal stevedoring industry commission would be one the personnel of which consisted entirely of ship-owners. The point I wish to make briefly is that the first request for the establishment of this commission came some years ago from the shipping interests themselves. Is it not typical of capitalism in distress to rush to the Government for assistance when industrial trouble threatens, and when the sun of peace shines again to say "" This is no good; let us scrap it "" . The honourable member for New England interjecting,",82
329,Mr HAYLEN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I hear a rumble from the great spy-hunter, the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott). I shall deal with him in due course. There is a humanitarian angle to this bill in that it is designed to ensure that activities on the waterfront shall be carried out in accordance with civilized principles. We must all realise that the Stevedoring Industry Commission has brought dignity to a job that has in the past so sadly lacked it. If the honourable member for New England knows anything of conditions on the waterfront he will admit that, before the institution of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, what were known as "" bull "" if gangs on the waterfront, were expected to meet at certain places, when the foreman would come up and say, "" You, and you, are required for the job; the others may go"", and that the men who were not engaged sprinted to the next gate to present themselves for employment.",82
330,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Sprinted ?,82
331,Mr HAYLEN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The total distance between the gates on the principal wharfs in - Sydney was known as the hungry mile. In those days a wharf labourer arguhad to be a sprinter capable of winning the Stawell Gift or a cross-country runner of no mean achievements if he were to beat his fellows to the next gate. Honourable members opposite have referred to the high price of a casual inI dustry. The point I make is that this bill is designed to place a casual industry on a humanitarian basis. This Government is too courageous and aware of its task to abdicate to the Communists. It says, "" This bill may not be the answer to all industrial trouble on the wateTfront but at least it is an earnest indication that we are getting on with the job "", just as it did when it set up an organization to control the coal industry. When the jeers of honourable members opposite are long forgotten the work of the Commonwealth Coal Board and of the Stevedoring Industry Commission will be remembered. The Opposition is more concerned with profits than with anything else. Throughout the whole of his. speech, the honourable member for New England constantly referred to additional costs. Did he give a moment's thought to the physical costs imposed on the workers on the waterfront for a number of years? Has he read the MCQueen report relating to broken-down workers on the waterfront ? If the honourable member is so interested in costs he should find out how the wealthy shipowners were able to increase freight rates from 200 to 300 per cent, and passenger rates in like proportion. It is the same ""blather"" we have heard from Opposition members time and time again. Their arguments against this proposal are spurious. Do they know that this commission was asked for by the ship-owners themselves? If we lose the opportunity to establish the Stevedoring Industry Commission on a permanent basis now, after having had some years of control by the war-time body, we shall go back to the bad old days on the waterfront which were a blot on our industrial history. We have no desire to see them repeated. If honourable members opposite still think in terms of profits they should continue their opposition to the establishment of the commission; if they think in terms of humanitarianism they will support its establishment.",82
332,Mr WHITE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Balaclava) [9.38] - I would not have spoken on this clause but for the rather pious ejaculations of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen). One would have thought that he had drifted in from another world and had not heard of troubles on the waterfront. The honourable member said that this bill is based on humanitarian principles; if that be so, he should reject it. The honourable member knows quite well that the conditions of which he spoke, the chains of slavery, the workmen tramping around the wharfs seeking employment, are things of the past.",83
333,Mr WARD,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Not of the so-distant past.,83
334,Mr WHITE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) is still living in the past. The honourable member for Parkes must know from official figures that wharf labourers can earn from £14 to £15 a week and that the average weekly hours worked on the waterfront are fewer than 40. In addition wharf labourers are paid attendance money,83
335,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I ask the honourable member to discuss the clause.,83
336,Mr WHITE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The claim that this bill is based on humanitarian principles is all so much eyewash. Its purpose is stated to be to settle troubles that arise on the waterfront.,83
337,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Order ! The clause under discussion relates to the establishment of a Stevedoring Industry Commission. The honourable member old may refer to the commission and its personnel; he is not in order in making another second-reading speech on the bill.,83
338,Mr WHITE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"The clause is a vital one because the question we have to ask ourselves is whether this commission is to be or not to be. Will this legislation lead to settlement of the waterfront troubles? They exist. We know the position in the port of Sydney and other ports around Australia. This bill contains nothing-no r does the whole bill, for that matter-that will enable the Stevedoring Industry Commission to do anything that cannot be done by the Arbitration Court. The Arbitration Court, which was set up more than 40 years ago, has had a good measure of success. I concede that it has not been perfect, and that it has had failures. Its structure can be improved. In fact, the Government has on the stocks a bill to improve it. The Stevedoring Industry Bill, however, will subtract from it. It will disintegrate the arbitration structure of Australia. Demolition of the arbitration system, of course, is the policy of the Communists. I hear the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) interjecting something or other. I do not know what it is; but I do know that there is no stronger opponent of the Communist party on the Government side than the honourable gentleman, and that he is aware that abolition of the Arbitration Court is one of the planks ol the Communist party's platform. In this bill we have the beginning of the process of the demolition of democracy. It drags the stevedoring industry away from the Arbitration Court and it is a step towards wrecking the powers of that court. Will the Stevedoring In dustry Commission ensure a quicker turn round of ships ? Will it enable trade and commerce to develop as they should ? No! The honourable member for Parkes talked about.the wharf labourers sprinting from wharf to wharf, but the honourable gentleman knows that they are led by malevolent men with no interest in Australia beyond that of making it a Communist state. Has he not heard of Healy, one of the authors of this clause? He knows, surely, that Healy and men of his type hold in jeopardy the jobs of the men that they lead. Should their orders be disobeyed these petty dictators can punish the members of the unions that they control, not only by fining them, but also by tearing up their union tickets. We have witnessed that in the metal trades dispute in Victoria, which has resulted in the departure of skilled men from skilled into unskilled jobs never to return. The welfare of unionists and their families are beld in the hands of the union bosses. Honourable gentlemen opposite do not like this, I know, but the purpose of this clause is to wreck the arbitration system. If the stevedoring industry is subtracted from the scope of the Arbitration Court, the influence of that Court will be weakened. Could the Stevedoring In dustry Commission settle the shameful Dutch shipping incident? We heard nothing from the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) about that.",83

The whole effect of it. the bill will be to strengthen in their positions the putty caesars who dominate the Waterside Workers Eederation. I object to the establishment of the in Stevedoring Industry Commission because, as was said by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), it will be useless. I make the one exception that the public servant to be appointed to the commission is an outstanding man, and I welcome his presence as a sort of watchdog to ensure the least possible waste of public funds. That is necessary because two of the members of the commission will be Communists. The commission is to be presided over by a judge of the Arbitration Court or a conciliation commissioner. Either is possible. Who knows but that the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) may one day be a judge? The Government has been a pretty good judge itself in finding posts for defeated Labour politicians.",84

As I am opposed to the undermining of that system, and as this clause is a part of the framework, I am opposed to it, too.",85
355,Mr BEAZLEY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Fremantle) [9.48] The clause sets up the Stevedoring In dustry Commission. The Opposition has taken exception to the continued existence of the commission, because it claims that it has not succeeded in stopping strikes on the waterfront. The commission took over in circumstances of full employment. In the second-reading debate, the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) said that what she did not like to contemplate, but what was undoubtedly the means of obtaining industrial discipline, was the presence of unemployment. That is, of course, perfectly true. The commission has existed when there has been no industrial unemployment. The industrial discipline of normal times was due to the existence of unemployment. It is undoubtedly dishonest to compare 1939, when there were 350,000 unemployed in Australia, with today, when employees have complained again and again that a strike does not block a man's earnings, because he is able to get work elsewhere. The Stevedoring Industry Commission has existed under conditions of full employment, and I hope it will continue to do so. To argue that it has caused strikes on the waterfront is patently dishonest. If we were back in the laisser-faire situation of 1939, when private companies were simply engaging their own labour, the lack of unemployment would operate as it does today as a factor in disturbing industrial discipline. A prominent American industrialist once said that his best weapon for enforcing industrial discipline was the unemployment queue at the gate of his factory. The truth of that remark applies to Australian industries also. The Stevedoring Industry Commission has had to handle waterside problems during the war, and now it is handling them during a period of industrial boom conditions. One line of opposition argument has been directed particularly at the appointment to the commission of a Commonwealth representative, who will not have a vote but who will be present at the meetings of the commission. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) and a few other honourable members opposite have said that this so called appointment of a "" Gestapo agent"" to watch the commission will be a new departure. Other honourable members opposite have contradicted them by pointing out that the Government has been represented on the Stevedoring In dustry Commission ever since it has been in existence.. As they have said, the composition of the commission will continue to be the same as it has been during the last five years. What is the justification for the appointment of a government liaison officer? Honourable members opposite contend that the judge who will be chairman of the commission should act as the mouthpiece of the commission in its dealings with the Government. They have tried to draw an analogy by saying that the Government would not appoint a government supervisor on the High Court Bench or on the Arbitration Court Bench. Anybody who has read this bill intelligently must realise that the functions of the commission will not be merely those of an arbitration court. It will have administrative powers, and administrative problemswill arise from time to time. The judge, whose functions I presume will be mainly judicial, would not be the appropriate authority to report to the Government on those matters. What will be the nature of the problems which will confront the commission? Honourable members opposite have referred to the limitations of Commonwealth powers in relation to industrial matters. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr MCBride) said that the people emphatically rejected the Government's proposal for increased industrial powers. I do not know what constitutes an emphatic rejection. The referendum proposals were supported by a majority of the people, but not by a majority of the States, as the honourable member will find if he will take the trouble to study the results of the 1946 referendum. The Commonwealth has certain definite powers under the Constitution. For instance, the loading and unloading of ships trading internationally and interstate comes under the Commonwealth power over trade and commerce. However, the Commonwealth has no power in relation to the loading and unloading of ships trading within any one State. This could give rise to a situation in which a determination by the Stevedoring Industry Commission would apply on wharfs where international and interstate ships were being loaded and unloaded but not on wharfs where intra-state vessels were being loaded and unloaded. Therefore, close co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the State governments will be necessary. Is it the function of an Arbitration Court judge to act as an agent between the Commonwealth Government and a State government? Obviously it is not. If the Commonwealth wants to secure the co-operation of a State government in relation to any problem on the waterfront, it will be able to send its liaison officer who has present at the meetings of the commission to negotiate with the State's representatives. In that respect, the appointment of a Commonwealth representative to the commission is entirely justified. It is interesting to note the way in which the Opposition has twisted back on what, during the fifteen months I have been a member of this Parliament, has been one of its Mr Beazley. major lines of argument. According to honourable members opposite, every strike that has occurred in Australia in that period has been the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. In each instance, their cry has been that the Commonwealth ' Government ought to intervene immediately to settle the strike. That shows clearly the basis of their thinking, at least for the purposes of party propaganda. They have said by implication that the Commonwealth Government should have absolute power in industrial matters. But now, when a Commonwealth officer is to be appointed to a commission which will govern a dissident industry, an industry vital to the nation, they say that the Government should have nothing to do with it at all. This Government appointee will be voteless; he will merely watch the interests of the Commonwealth in regard to problems which will arise in the stevedoring industry, particularly those which affect the Commonwealth's relations with the States.",85
356,Mr BOWDEN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Will he have any voice at the meetings of the commission ?,86
357,Mr BEAZLEY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Of course he will have a voice unless he is completely dumb. A man with long experience in a government department and with an intimate knowledge of the industry must have some influence on the commission. That will be a very good thing, because the commission will have many administrative functions which will affect the Commonwealth Government. Tbis officer will not have a vote, but he will report to the Government which, after all, will bear most of the criticism from the community, and certainly from the Opposition, in the event of disruption occurring on the waterfront. There is nothing consistent about the arguments of honourable membeen bers opposite. Those arguments are completely out of harmony with their usual line of propaganda, by which they endeavour to sheet home to the Government all responsibility for industrial unrest. The amendment should be rejected. Question putThat the words proposed to be left out (Mr. HARRISON'S amendment) stand part of the clause. The committee divided. (THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMANMR. T. P.

Spender, P. C. Chifley, J. B. Menzies, R. G. Question so resolved in the affirmative. Amendment negatived. Mr HARRISON' (Wentworth) [10.3]. - On behalf of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), I move That, in sub-clause (3.), paragraph (6), the words "" or a Conciliation Commissioner appointed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1346"" be left out. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission shall be a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitratio n Court and shall not, as has been suggested during this discussion, be a conciliation commissioner appointed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. This is one of the most important clauses of the bill. The whole of the arbitral powers of the commission will be abrogated unless the chairman is a judge of the Arbitration Court. When replying to the second-reading debate, the 9 Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) declared that the provisions of the bill almost AYES. slavishly followed the recommendations of Judge Poster regarding the establishment of the commission. In this instance, however, the right honourable gentleman departed radically from the recommendations. On page 24 of the report, His Honour said I have accepted the proposal of the Oversea Shipping Representatives Association that the chairman should be a judge of the Arbitration Court, and rejected Mr Healy's claim that he be a laymen. Mr Healy feared thaf a judge would bring a legalism and legalistic outlook and a cumbersome legal procedure which would militate against the commission's NOES. effectiveness. Mr Shand, and in this he had of course the support of Mr Reynolds and Mr. Sholl, made what to me was an unanswerable case. Those are strong words. Having heard evidence and argument, His Honour came to the conclusion that the contention that a judge of the Arbitration Court should be appointed chairman of the commission was unanswerable. Mr . Healy had claimed before the royal commissioner that the chairman should be a PAIRS. layman. What constitutes a layman? He is a man who has no judicial authority- a man who might - be appointed as a conciliation commissioner, because a conciliation commissioner need not possess any judicial experience or be a legal practitioner. For example, he may be a defeated Labour politican, a Communist fro m the Waterside Workers Federation or a union secretary or organizer. In short, a layman may be anybody whom the Government desires to appoint to this position. The Attorney General has compromised between the finding of the royal commissioner and the views expressed by Mr Healy. He said, in effect, "" I shall not offend Judge Foster by excluding from appointment as chairman of the commission a judge of the Arbitration Court"". Earlier, the right honourable gentleman had stated that a judge would be appointed, if possible. I ask honourable members to mark the qualification. At the same time, the Attorney-General did not desire to offend Mr Healy, so he decided to permit the possibility of the appointment of a conciliation commissioner. Of course, the conciliation commissioner would be a layman, and Mr Healy advocated the appointment of a layman to that position. The honourable member for M a r t in (Mr Daly ) attempted to reply to the statements by members of the Opposition that this is a Communist-inspired bill. I direct attention to the following observation by Judge Foster, in reference to Mr Healy:His wide proposals envisaged the running of a very big business by the Stevedoring Industry Commission throughout Australia as actual employers. Let us examine how far Mr Healy's observations regarding a big business enterprise have affected this Government. I direct attention to paragraph b of subclause 1 of clause 11, which states that - the .functions of the commission shall be. . . to regulate industrial matters in connection with stevedoring operations, and to regulate and control .the performance of stevedoring operations, insofar as those operations relate to trade and commerce with other countries or among the States or are performed in a Territory of the Commonwealth. There we have the complete answer. Healy says, "" Give us a layman as chairman because we visualize this a - huge business enterprise"". Attorney-General has compromised accepting Mr Healy's recommendation part, namely, in regard to the ment of a conciliation commissioner an alternative to a judge. At the same time, however, he has so framed portion of the bill as to give effect to Mr. Healy's suggestion that the should become a big business tion. I refer to that matter to show that this bill is definitely Communist-inspired, and that the provision for the of a conciliation commissioner tive to a judge indicates the acceptance of a principle that has been laid down by Mr Healy. I have no doubt that the Attorney-General had a twinge of conscience when he said to the committee of nothing, and not in relation to this particular clause, "" We shall appoint a Mr Harrison. judge, if possible "" , and having made that concession, I believe that his legal training and his sense of fairness will lead him to see the merit in this amendment. I realise that pressure must have been brought to bear upon him to accept Mr . Healy's recommendation with regard to the appointment of a layman. The right honourable gentleman has shrouded this proposal by providing for the appointment of a "" conciliation commissioner "" ; but that will not hoodwink anybody. We know whom the term "" conciliation commissioner "" may include. I am sure that the Attorney-General, because of his legal training, appreciates the necessity to have a judge as chairman of this commission in order that the matters that come before it may be given adequate legal consideration, and as the right honourable gentleman has taken one step towards meeting the wishes of the Opposition by stating that a judge will be appointed if possible, I suggest that he might be prepared to go the full distance and accept the amendment. If the right honourable gentleman were to do that he would be making a progressive step by enabling the commission to exercise thoroughly the powers conferred upon it by this measure.",86
358,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Mr Affairs) [10.14] - The amendment seeks to impose upon the Government the oblibecoming gation to appoint a judge as chairman of The the Stevedoring Industry Commission. hy After consultation with the Prime Minisin ter (Mr Chifley) and the Minister for appoint- Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley), as I informed the committee earlier today that it was the Government's intention another to appoint a judge to this commission if possible. I qualified my statement because commission I know of no method by which one could organiza- compel a judge of the Arbitration Court to accept a position of this kind should he wish not to do so. However, I have appointment no doubt that a judge, fit, able and will i ng as alterna- to do this great national work, will be found.",88
359,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Would the Attorney General consider additional appointments apropos if necessary?,88
360,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Additional appointments will probably become necessary as the result of the passage of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and it may be that additional appointments will become necessary under this measure, too. I have stated frankly tc the committee what the intention of the Government is. I only qualified my statement lest we could not find a judge of the Arbitration Court willing to do the work, and, although I think this difficulty will be overcome, it is for that reason that the Government is not prepared to remove from the bill provision for the appointment of a conciliation commissioner. That provision has nothing to do with the proposal that Mr Healy put before Judge Foster. He did not argue in favour of a conciliation commissioner at all. He merely said that the chairman should be a layman.",88
361,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"""What is the difference between a layman and a conciliation commissioner?",89
362,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"A great difference. A conciliation commissioner is appointed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and takes the oath prescribed by that act. Under the new bill he will have a status equivalent to that of a judge, and his position will be much closer to that of a judge than ever before. Therefore, I am not prepared to say that a person occupying such a position would in no circumstances be fit. to be chairman of the commission. Having said that in justification of the alternative being provided for in the bill, I repeat that the Government proposes that a judge should be appointed, if possible, and in view of that assurance, I submit that the amendment should not be pressed. Let us suppose, for instance, that a vacancy in the position of chairman were to occur at some future date. It might well be that there would be available for the job a conciliation commissioner who had proved that he possessed outstanding qualifications, and was worthy of the position. Some honourable members opposite have gone out of their way to acclaim the work of Mr Morrison. Mr Morrison is a conciliation commissioner, and as such has done excellent work.",89
363,Mr MCBRIDE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Mr Morrison has said that the commission is so useless that it should be abolished.,89
364,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Neve r mind what he has said. What he has done is more important. He undertook his present position at a most difficult time. Again 1 assure the committee that the Government proposes to carry out the intention that I have stated, and I urge the Opposition to accept that assurance without further debating this amendment. The position of a conciliation commissioner under the new Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill will be one of great authority, and much different from the old position. The salary will be increased substantially, and the status of the job improved. In addition, security of tenure of office will be given.",89
365,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Does the Government intend to appoint qualified legal men to these positions?,89
366,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I do not intend to make that a necessary condition of appointment, and I do not think that honourable members generally believe that legal training should be a requisite qualification.",89
367,Mrs BLAQKBURN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Is there any possibility that the work of the Stevedoring Industry Commission and that of the conciliation commissioners to be appointed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill will overlaD?,89
368,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"No , because under this measure there is a separation of the work of the commission from the work of the Arbitration Court, except in respect of the basic wage and the standard hours.. The reference to a conciliation commissioner is to make sure that if such a per' son were appointed as chairman he would have all the status that is given to him under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Of course he would be in close contact with the work of the Arbitration Court. However, in spite of the proposed enhanced status of conciliation commissioners, the Government proposes that the chairman of the commission shall be a judge, but, for the reasons I have given, I ask the committee not to make the appointment of a judge mandatory. I can understand a judge of the court holding the view that as there will be some administrative work to be performed-wor k not usually performed by a judge of the court-h e will not be an aspirant for appointment. It might not be easy to get a judge to accept the position.",89
369,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The person appointed will have to make awards.,90
370,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Bu the will also haveother to do some administrative work and carry out functions which are not usually perwith formed by judges. That was pointed by Judge Foster in his report. I do think that the committee has anything to fear. I have been frank with honorawards able members, and I believe that the try will be satisfied with the appointment when it is made.",90
371,Mr HOLT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Fawkner) [10.21] - IA should have been more inclined to accept the assurances of the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) and adopt the course sugbe gested by him had I not heard his speech last night, and his reply a few moments ago to an interjection by the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn). Those two matters require further necessarily analysis if the committee is to be satisfied on the point raised. ' The Attorneyin General says that the Government inObviously, tends to appoint a judge as chairman, if possible, and he has explained that used the words "" if possible "" because may be difficult to get a judge to accept the position. That was a remarkable statement coming from the Attorneying General. If this body cannot inspire sufficient confidence for some suitable person to be willing to accept appointaction ment, what confidence in it can we expect from the people of Australia? Every qualification of his statement made the Attorney-General increases our susmissioner picion. Last night he made it clear that the Government had come to the conclumissioners sion that the system under which judges preside and deal with industrial issues was not working satisfactorily, and that consequently a system of conciliation commissioners was to be instituted to deal with the problems which formerly were dealt with by judges. If that be sound reason, and the Government proover poses to cast aside the practice of the past in respect of other industries, should it not apply also to this industry? The stevedoring industry is one which Minister himself admits calls for prompt attention when a dispute throutenfl. I shall not repeat all the reasons I have previously advanced, but I emphasize that awards relating to this industry will necessarily affect other industries. It is impossible to prescribe an hourly rate of pay for stevedoring and not thereby affect industries. On the waterfront there are rates of pay which are out of line the rates paid to men with greater out skill in other industries. Because not awards of the Stevedoring Industry Commission have not been related to of the Arbitration Court, we counhave said that the commission has its dangers. If a judge of the court is appointed as chairman he will be able to link his work with that of the court. few minutes ago the honourable member for Bourke asked whether the work of the conciliation commissioner who may appointed as chairman would overlap the work of other conciliation commissioners appointed under the act. The Minister replied "" No "" , but that reply will not stand examination. Almost the chairman will be stationed in Sydney, but there are about 40 ports other parts of the Commonwealth. the chairman of the commission will not be able to deal with all he the problems which will arise at those it ports, and will require immediate attention. For some years the practice has been, in the event of a dispute arisat, say, Fremantle, to send a conciliation commissioner there to investigate conditions on the spot. Similar is taken should a dispute threaten at Adelaide, Melbourne, Bris.bane or any other port on the Australian by coast. We may have a conciliation compresiding over the work of the commission and other conciliation comgoing about performing duties required of them in various poTts. Such a system will not work nearly so satisfactorily as one under which a conciliation commissioner operating in a port is responsible to a judge. A conciliation commissioner presiding over this a body will not have the same authority other conciliation commissioners as a judge of the court would have. Whatwhy ever our approach to this problem, we come back to the necessity for having as the chairman a man with a legal background and an association with the work of the court. If , in the face of these arguments, the Attorney-General will not accept the amendment, his action will merely give colour to our suspicion that the person who may be appointed chairman in the first place may not hold office for any considerable time. In the past, judges have been appointed who could not stand up indefinitely to the pressure applied to them, and they have resigned from their office, only to be replaced by men who were not judges. That happened in connection with the tribunal appointed to deal with the coal-mining industry. Judge Drake-Brockman was removed, and a layman, Mr Willis, was appointed in his place. The system soon became chaotic. A similar state of affairs arose in connection with the Maritime Industry Commission. To-day, there is not even a conciliation commissioner presiding over that body; it is in charge of a layman in the person of Mr Edwards, who is a representative of the shipowners. Whatever other qualification Mr Edwards may have, what capacity has he to determine awards which shall apply to the maritime industry? If appointments of this kind continue, the industrial laws of the Commonwealth will soon be in a chaotic state. The Minister, who has had experience of these matters, knows that there is no more fruitful cause of industrial friction than having different sets of wages and conditions in industries doing comparable work. Both safety and sound administration demand that we shall have as chairman of this body a man with the training and authority of a judge of the court. For the reasons that have been given the Opposition is not prepared to accept the statements of the Attorney-General. If he accepts the amendment, the chairman will be a judge of the court; if he refuses to do so, the Opposition will press its amendment.",90
372,Mr DALY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Martin) [10.30] - Judg e Foster recommended that the chairman of the commission should be a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation tion and Arbitration. I should have thought that, in view of the assurance given by the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) a few moments ago, a defito nite assurance, more or less, that a judge would be appointed, the OpposiArbitration tion would have been prepared to accept the clause as it stands. The Attorney General is a man of his word, and he gave sound reasons why the bill should not make it mandatory to appoint a judge of the Arbitration Court. He explained that circumstances might arise in which a judge would not be available. That is reasonable, and the assurance that a judge will be appointed when the act is proclaimed, should remove the objections of all reasonable people to the bill. I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) that there are good reasons why a judge should be appointed, and no doubt the Attorney-General was influenced hy those reasons when he gave his assurance. For my part, I am not convinced that a judge need necessarily be any more efficient than some conciliation commissioners. I believe that it ought to be possible to get a conciliation commissioner who could fill the job very capably. I 'am sometimes inclined to think that the presence of a legal man on tribunals of this kind results in delay in the framing of awards. That would appear to be the experience of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. However, in view of the assurance of the Attorney General, there is no need for the Opposition to persist with the amendment. As for the comparison which the honourable member for Fawkner sought to make with the Arbitration Amendment Bill, I point out that the congestion in the Arbitration Court is due largely to the long-winded procedure in that tribunal, and to the fact that cases have been piling up for a long time past. This has made it necessary for the Government to delegate some of the authority of the court to the commission. Despite the fact that there are 40 different port areas in Australia, I believe that the Stevedoring Industry Commission, whether under the chairmanship of a judge or a conciliation commissioner, will be able to deal rapidly with all matters coming before it, because the commission will have to deal with only one industry, whereas the ArbitraCourt has to deal with many.",91
373,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Parramatta) [10.35] I listened with a good deal of interest the undertaking given by the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) that a judge of the Court would, if possible, be appointed chairman of the commission, and I was in some measure reassured. The Attorney-General went on to say that he had no doubt that a judge would be found to fill the position. At the same time, he was not prepared to give an outright undertaking, and I think I begin to understand his difficulty. It is only fair to say that if he had his way a judge of the Arbitration Court would undoubtedly he appointed. His entire experience would indicate this, and I believe that it is his unshakeable conviction that a judge should be appointed. However, he is only one member of the Government, and there are other members of the Government who do not share his opinion. The remarks of the honourable member for Martin (Mr Daly) confirmed this belief, because, while he played up the Attorney-General's undertaking, it was obvious that he was not himself convinced of the wisdom of appointing a judge as chairman. Indeed, it would appear that he was actually of the opinion that it would be better not to have a judge. The Attorney-General ii> a man of wide experience, and, as if he had his way a judge would be appointed. Probably the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) also favours this course, because the Attorney-General said that he had consulted the Prime Minister. It may be, however, that this is not the opinion of a majority of the members of the Government, and in the end the wishes of the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister may not prevail. If the bill is passed in its present form, it may well happen that a judge of an arbitration court will not, after all, be appointed chairman of the commission. Let us consider the advantages of appointing a judge of the Arbitration Court. As has already been pointed out, he will be in a position to maintain a close liaison with the Arbitration Court, so that there will be a degree of co-operation which could not otherwise exist. The whole purpose of the bill is to remove the stevedoring industry from the control of the Arbitration Court. Members of the Opposition have pointed out that this may well involve grave dangers. It will tend to sectionalize industry, and unrest may be caused if this industry is placed in too favourable a position compared with Mr Beale. others. However, if a judge of the Arbitration Court is appointed chairman of the commission, there is a chance that a< common policy may be applied in making determinations for waterfront work, and for other branches of industry still under the control of the court. The next obvious advantage of appointing a judge as chairman-and in this T think the Attorney-General will agree with me-is that a judge is possessed of an authority under the Constitution that no conciliation commissioner can in law possess. We know from many judgmentsof the High Court the weakness inherent in appointing judicialofficers who lack life tenure. The appointment of someoneless than a judge may very well lead usinto a legal maze which everyone wouldwant to avoid. The Attorney-General iswell aware of this, and he must be influenced by this consideration in desiring: that a judge should be appointed. Another point is that a judge would: possess qualifications for the position as I said, chairman of the commission which noother citizen could have. I am not referring now to merely legal training, but to judical training, to the forensic experience which he has gained, and which must make him peculiarly fitted to exercise judicial functions. Some one who' has had experience in the courts, who hasfought now on one side and now on the other in the almost infinite variety of cases which come within the experience of a legal practitioner, must be better qualified to see both sides of a situation than any layman, no matter what his training or experience. Therefore, a judge,, also by reason of his training, is more suited to fill the position than any other citizen could be. The next qualification which he possesses over and above any possessed by a layman is independence of mind, because the whole of his training has taught him to take a stand, ignoring public opinion and pressure from one side or the other which, in an industry like this, will certainly be applied. It would be idle and foolish to shut our eyes to the fact that in an industry such as this, in which there is so much conflict and hot feeling on both sides, endeavours will be made to bring pressure to bear on the chairman. The - chairman is the key man, because ""with two representatives of each side, and the chairman having a casting vote, he will be the really effective member of the - commission. A person with the training and background and the quality of independence of mind of a judge is the ideal - candidate for this position.",91
374,Mrs BLACKBURN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Does not the honourable member believe that a person who accepts the position will be capable of exercising independence of mind?,93
375,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Eve n assuming that person has honesty of intention, will he possess qualities equal to those possessed by one who has had judicial training? I suggest that the whole of our experience in these matters during the last 100 indicates that that is not so. It is merely a question of honest intention. Assuming, for the purpose of the honordepressed able member's argument, that any person who is appointed is honest and intends to do' his best, the fact remains that in matters of this kind, where bitter presthat sure will be brought to bear, it will be sufficient for him to have honest intenrealizes tions. The person appointed to this posivices tion must have the sort of training which will enable him to stand up to pressure. Let us take the position of the conciliait tion commissioners. They may be anyarbitration, body. I assume that they may have honest intentions; but they may not have. In this sphere, we have all sorts of people who may be appointed. It has been closed that defeated Labour candidates and members of the Australian Labour party have been appointed as conciliation commissioners. They may turn out to Arbitration Court. be good people; but in New South Wales, again and again, union secretaries, and ex-union secretaries, have been appointed conciliation commissioners under State legislation. Those people have spent their whole lifetime absorbing one point view. Even given honesty of intention, it is very difficult, indeed, for persons that to become fair and impartial; and would be equally wrong to appoint as chairman of this commision a person who has been identified all his life with shipowners' point of view. Such a perto son, by occupation and by association, cannot help but be influenced. In a posiposterous, tion of such vital importance to the counthe try, and having regard to the need to maintain public confidence in this tribunal, it is necessary to appoint as chairman of it a person who is quite removed from the interests of any one party. I am quite sure that every word I have said meets with the approval of the Attorney General, and that if he had his way he would appoint to this position a man - with a trained judicial mind. I regret that he will not accept the amendment because the sole object of it is to give effect to what the Prime Minister a and the Attorney-General believe in.",93
376,Mr MCBRIDE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wakefield) [10.45] I am certain that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) will agree to every word years uttered by the honourable"" member for not Parramatta (Mr Beale). The more we examine the bill in detail the more we become. The Government realizes the necessity for this commission, and is aware of the importance of the job which will be entrusted to it. It realizes competent people should be placed in not control of the tribunal; but it also the difficulty of securing the serof competent people for positions of this kind. For that difficulty the Government itself is to blame. Although has paid lip service to the principle of it has rarely supported that principle in fact. Consequently, it will experience difficulty in obtaining persons with suitable qualification for appointdisment as chairman of the commission, as, I have no doubt, it will also have difficulty in inducing people with suitable qualifications to accept judgeships in the The Arbitration Court has, since its establishment in 1904, earned for itself outstanding prestige in the public mind. It is only during recent years that the status of the court has diminished. That process is still going of on. The Attorney-General has said that he would appoint a judge to this position, like and, indeed, he gave the committee an it assurance that he will appoint a judge if it is physically possible to do so. Does he suggest that there is not a competent the person in the community who is prepared accept a judgeship in the Arbitration Court? Such a suggestion would be prewere the prestige and status of court as high today as it was in the past. We have ample evidence of the difficulty of the Government in this respect. One after another, the appointees of the Government to various authorities which it has established have resigned. After the Government established the Joint Coal Board months elapsed before it could obtain a person competent and willing to accept the position of chairman of that body. This commission is being set up under a cloud. It will not staTt off with the prestige, or the status, which a body of such importance should enjoy. To-day, industrial organizations are passing resolutions in direct conflict with the accepted practice of the Arbitration Court. There must surely be something wrong in this land if no person with the necessary qualifications is prepared to accept a judgeship of the Arbitration Court. I trust that the Attorney-General will prove his confidence in this commission by accepting the amendment. If he does so it will convey to the people that he believes the commission to be a worthwhile authority and to the legal fraternity it will be an earnest of his belief that it will serve a useful purpose. There will then be no difficulty in securing a competent person willing to accept a judgeship of the Arbitration Court and the chairmanship of the commission. If the right honourable gentleman wishes to launch this commission on a sound basis, to ensure that it shall do its job, and at the same time hold the confidence of those upon whose affairs it is to adjudicate, he Avill accept the amendment. The people generally and those working under the commission will then feel that its originators have confidence in its powers to do the job it will be asked to perform.

377,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barker) [10.57] - I move That the following new sub-clause be added:"" (5.) A known or reputed Communist shall be ineligible for appointment under this section, proof whereof to the contrary shall lie upon him "". This is one of the most important amend(Mr ments that could be made to the bill. Government supporters have indulged in a great deal of talk about the necessity for a fight with the Communists. The Government itself has already taken action in CLARK.) trade union circles to establish an alternative to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. We have witnessed the banning of a Labour league in the Macouarie district; we have read statement 11 after statement by Government spokesmen to the effect that the great trouble in industry today is due to the influence of the Communists and their followers. Therefore, the Communists should be rooted out of all unions and industrial tribunals. As I have grave doubts about the bona fides of the Government in this respect, I introduce this amendment to test its sincerity. If the Government really believes what it has been asking the people to believe, it will have no hesitation in accepting this amendment. If it is not prepared to do so it may, if it so desires, appoint a Communist to the commission.",94
378,Mr JAMES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I shall consider voting for the amendment if the honourable member will alter it in such a way as to preclude the appointment to the commission of a member of the Liberal party.,95
379,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"It would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a member of the Liberal party to secure an appointment through the good offices of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). The Communist menace is no laughing matter, and, if the Government desires to deal with it, it will have no hesitation in accepting the amendment. I leave the matter for the moment, because I want to hear the Attorney-General on it. He should have at his disposal, through the various departments that he administers, complete information as to the activities of these gentlemen in the community. Not long ago, he placed before honourable members authentic information as to what the Communists are doing in other countries. The time has come for the Commonwealth Parliament to face up to these fellows and say that no job shall be made available to any member, or reputed member, of the Communist party and that if any one wants to clear himself of that reputation'the onus shall rest upon him.",95
380,Mr WHITE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Balaclava) [11.1] - I support the amendment to exclude Communists from appointment to the Stevedoring Industry Commission. Here is a great opportunity for the Government to show its sincerity. We know that privately many members of the Labour party are fiercely opposed to communism and to Communist domination of the proof trade unions. Moreover, the men within him. the unions will thank the Government it declares itself. Many honest men in stevedoring industry and other industries who want to work are forbidden to work .by the machinations of men who owe no allegiance to this country. If those men can be segregated, forced from the dominant positions they occupy, many good Australians will have the right to work returned to them. The opportunity is here for the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to advise his followers to support the amendment. When he returned from one of his trips abroad the right honourable gentleman had favourable things to say about Russia. The Russians feared for their defence, he said. But he has seen and learnt a lot since then, and has made statements that the world is in a large measure menaced by the policy of Russia today. We have the fifth column of Russia operating in our midst. Honourable members saw the report of the Canadian spy ring inquiry. What happened in Canada is happening in Australia. Australia is suffering from the activities of the Communists, who, if justice were done, would be prosecuted and gaoled or deported to the country whence they draw their inspiration. Let the Government declare itself when the division comes by saying that it, too, wants to see the Communists eliminated.",95
381,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton - AttorneyGenera! and Minister for External Affairs') [11.4] - The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) applies to the clause under which the Stevedoring Industry Commission is proposed to be set up. The clause provides that the chairman shall be a judge of the Arbitration Court or a conciliation commissioner; but, in all probability, as I have indicated, he will probably be a judge of the court. The commission shall also consist of an officer of the Commonwealth, who will represent the Government and will not have a vote, two representatives of the shipowners and two elected representatives of the union. The amendment proposes the addition of a new sub-clause providing thatA known or reputed Communist shall be ineligible for appointment under this section, whereof to the' contrary shall lie upon if .Who is to determine whether he is a the reputed Communist? Is it to be a case of give a dog a bad name and of saying to the dog, "" You must prove that you have not a bad name "". That is the kind of thing that was introduced by the Hitler regime in the early days of the Nazi terror, when cries against the Jews and the "" redis "" were raised. Such a law is absolutely unworkable. If any attempt be made to deal with the Communist problem it will have to be made in quite a different way from that envisaged by the honourable member for Barker. I can indicate no support from my party for the disqualification of a person simply because of his being reputed to belong to an organization or to have political views, unless he proves that he does not belong, to it and does not have those views. That would introduce a tyrannical system quite out of keeping with industrial arbitration. The whole plan is that the union shall have the right to elect its representatives. If it were said that certain groups were to be disqualified on proved facts, it would be serious, but if the disqualification rested merely on suspicion or reputation, it would be 1 tyranny at its worse, and' it would create industrial chaos in the community.",95
382,Mr ROSEVEAIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,And the onus of proof is to be on the accused.,96
383,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Yes . If the amendment were agreed to and applied literally, the judge of the Arbitration Court whom we asked to take the position of chairman of the commission would' have to prove to some one not stated that he was not a Communist. In fairness to the honourable member for Barker, I do not think he .advances Ids amendment as a serious contribution to the solution of a serious problem. In any case, the proposal is not practicable and is wrong in principle.",96
384,Mr ANTHONY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Richmond) [11.8] It is evident that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) is anxious to meet the spirit of the amendment of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). All he takes real exception to, from his reply, is the use of the words "" reputed Communist"". Perhaps in that respect the right honourable gentleman's objection has a great deal of merit, especially as the onus of proof to the contrary is proposed to be on the reputed Communist, and I am inclined to agree with him. But I think too that the Attorney-General is anxious to include in the bill a provision that will bar known and admitted Communists from appointment to theStevedoring Industry CommissionTherefore, if the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker should be defeated, I shall move a further amendiment, in the terms of the honourable member's amendment, to provide that known and admitted Communists shall be barred. That would conform to the views of the Attorney-General. It is well known that the Communist party has one purpose, namely, to harrass established forms of government. Its members boast that their object is to overthrow the existing order of society and bring about the downfall' of democratic government, whether it be a Labour government or otherwise, and that in order to achieve this they propose to foment strikes and general dislocation of industry. The object of the bill is to bring about harmony on the waterfront. How could that object be achieved if a man appointed to a commission was a Communist pledged to bring about chaos on the waterfront? The speech made by the Attorney-General was in line with the views of the majority of honourable members. For instance, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) expressed similar views in his maiden speech in this chamber, and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) have done so in numerous public statements. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber regard members of the Communist party as a menace to constitutional government in this country. ME. ROSEVEAB - What would happen if a Communist selected for appointment to the commission happened to be an ex-serviceman ?",96
385,Mr ANTHONY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"He should be treated as a Communist, even if he had been awarded the Victoria Cross. Every Communist is pledged to bring about the downfall of the democratic system. Nothing can alter that fact. I consider that the honourable member for Barker has done a service by submitting his amendment to the committee, although I - do not agree with him that reputed 'Communists should be disqualified arbitrarily. If the committee defeats the amendment, I shall move another amendment to give effect to the views which were enunciated by the Attorney-General .and which are supported by many other honourable members.",96
386,Mr BERNARD CORSER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wide Bay ) [11.14] - I wholeheartedly support the .amendment. All of our industrial troubles on the waterfront and elsewhere are due to the activities of the Communists, who are determined to prevent people fro m working whenever possible. In spite of oil their claims to the contrary, they have .achieved nothing of any value for the waterside workers or for the remainder of the community. The only benefit that the waterside workers have obtained as the result of Communist agitation is a provision for special payment for handling odorous cargoes, such as hides or bad potatoes, which is known as ""smell money"". I watched several of these Communists going through a wharf shed on one occasion. They went from one bag to another, sniffing at each in order to see whether they could claim "" smell money "" for the men handling the goods. In this instance, they decided to "" demand half-a-crown"" for handling buffalo hides. I do not know whether they meant half-a-crown an hour, or half-a-crown for each hide; probably the result would have been the same in either case. Under Communist pampering, the waterside workers will probably begin to carry beauty compacts and scent bottles. I hope that the Government will not permit avowed Communists to be appointed to the Stevedoring Industry Commission. Amendment negatived.",97
387,Mr ANTHONY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Richmond) [11.16]. - I desire to move That the following new sub-clause be added:'- (5.) A member of the Communist shall be ineligible for appointment under section."" This amendment is more specific than the amendment which has just been defeated. It does not place on individuals the onus of proof that they are not memI bers of the Communist party.",97
388,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I am of the opinion thqt the amendment is out of order. The honourable member should have submitted it in the form of an amendment to the amendment which the committee has just negatived. I rule that the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr . Anthony) is substantially of the same character as the amendment which has been defeated, and I cannot accept it .",97
389,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I rise to order. I distinctly heard the honourable member for Richmond state that, if my amendment were defeated, he would submit another amendment of which he gave notice at that time. You d id not then call his attention to the fact that you would not accept his amendment in that form. I contend that, in the circumstances, the obligation was upon you to point out immediately that, if the honourable member for Richmond desired to move that amendment, he must submit it while my amendment was under consideration.",97
390,Mr ROSEVEAR,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I rise to order. The onus is not on the Chairman to point out to an honourable member whether a motion that he proposes to submit will be in order or out of order. The onus is on all honourable members to read and understand the Standing Orders.,97
391,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Surely the test of whether this amendment is in order is whether it is similar to the amendment which was negatived. The amendment which was negatived covered a much wider field than that which the honourable member for Richmond has submitted. The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Barker was to the effect that a known Communist, or a reputed Communist, should be ineligible for appointment to the commission and that proof of non-membership of the Communist party should be the responsibility of any person so challenged. Many party honourable members on this side of the this chamber might take exception to the wide provisions of such an amendment.

The Government and its supporters claim that they are fighting the Communist party and that the Labour party stands as a bulwark against communism. It is well known that it is the policy of the Communist party to obtain control of certain organizations in this country, and thereby place the government of the day in a powerless position. Accordingly they set out to ensure that key positions in various organizations shall be filled by Communists. Their tactics have been successful in the Waterside Workers Federation, the Iron workers Union, and other organizations. The amendment, if agreed to, will prevent a Communist becoming the deputy of a member of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) has spoken in terms which leave no doubt that he is opposed to the activities of Communists. Indeed, he has told us that he would welcome assistance in combating their activities. The amendment should, therefore, be acceptable to him.",99

THE CHAIRMAN - Clause 7 is the will - only matter before the Chair. Clause agreed to. Clause 8(2.) The Chairman may, and shall if directed by the Minister, at any time call meeting of the Commission. PAIRS. Mr HARRISON (Wentworth) [12.20 a.m.] - On behalf of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr MENZIES ) I move That, in sub-clause (2.), the words ""and shall if so directed by the Minister"" be left out. Once again we find that the Government proposes to exercise direction over the commission. Already, we have charged Government with directing the present commission. The result of that has been to rob the commission of the powers it already possesses. Interference from by the Government with the commission of the has caused the resignation of valuable officers. Further, the commission has held in contumely, and the waterside the workers have refused to take any notice of the commission's rulings. is, When we pointed out those facts, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and the At torney-General (Dr Evatt) assured us t that the Government had no intention of beinterfering with the commission. Howapever, dealing with the clauses, we first, that the Government proposes to appoint an officer of the Commonwealth to the commission, and that his n - duty will be to report to the Government. Obviously, the Government intends to use that officer for the purpose of implementing its policy, that is, for party political purposes, because through h im it will direct the commission what it must do. Now, in the clause under consideration, in the words for the deletion of which I now move, we find an admission by the Government, an admission naked and unashamed, that it intends to direct commission. If the commission is to be with the same functions as the Arbitration Court, surely the Government will not need to direct the chairman to raise call a meeting of the commission. We This are told that the chairman may be a judge, in which case he will have unHe will be full y to ensure that the commission carries out its functions because he will be versed in arbitration procedure and not fail to call meetings of the commission when it is necessary to do so. It would appear that there is an ulterior motive underlying this provision, because it says, in effect, that whilst the commisso sion is actively employed about its duties a the Minister may direct the chairman to call a meeting of the commission. The next question that arises is for what purpose would the Minister direct the chairman to call a meeting. In this, we have revealed the Government's purpose in appointing a representative on the commission. He will say to the chairman, "" There has been some alteration in government policy and you must call a meeting of the commission"". When the chairman asks the reason for such a meeting, the officer will reply, "" I have been directed by the Government to inform you that it considers that a certain decision made by the commission is contrary to government policy. You have deregistered a number of men, and the Government now directs you to reinstate them. You must call the commission together for that purpose "". I remind the committee that the Government ordered the reinstatement of men who were deregistered as the result of the pay day dispute. In that instance, the Government said, in effect, to the present commission, "" You deregistered fourteen men, and now you have a strike on your hands. Now, we direct you to reinstate those men"" - That is what happened in the past. Under this measure, the Government will have power to call the commission together and to direct it as to what it should do. I have not the slightest doubt that that is the object of this provision, and, that being so, honourable members on this side of the chamber will vigorously oppose it. We are opposed to the setting up of a party political junta which seems to be the Government's objective in. appointing the commission. Such action will not be tolerated by the people for one moment.

407,Mr FRANCIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Moreton) [12.28 a.m.]. - I move That, after sub-clause (1.), the following new sub-clause be inserted:"" (1A. ) In the appointment of all officers and employees under this section, preference shall be given to returned servicemen and servicewomen."" Up to date, the Government has merely indulged in shadow-sparring in professing its support of the principle of preference in employment, to ex-service personnel. In making any worthwhile appointment up to date is has invariably found some excuse for wriggling out of its obligations to grant preference to ex-servicemen. It has made many appointments for which hundreds of ex-service personnel, out of the 750,000 members of the fighting forces, were highly qualified and would have carried out their duties with efficiency and benefit to the community. I ask the Government to demonstrate its bona fides in the matter of preference for ex-servicemen by accepting the amendment. Under the Rehabilitation and Employment Act preference to ex-servicemen is limited to a period of three years. I object to the whole basis upon which the Government has professed to grant preference to ex-servicemen. If the Government is really desirous of honouring its obligations to ex-servicemen it should grasp the opportunity now presented to it by accepting the amendment.",101
408,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [12.31 a.m.] - Unde r the Re-establishment and Employment Act provision is made for preference to ex-servicemen according to a plan accepted by the Parliament. That provision applies to employment with the Stevedoring Industry Commission just as it dees to employment with the governments of the Commonwealth and the States or under awards of the Arbitration Court or industrial tribunals. The Government proposed to adhere to the law of preference as laid - down by the Re-establishment and Employment Act. If the honourable member wishes to amend that law he will - have to endeavour to do so on some other,101
409,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,New England) [12.32 a.m.]-If an ex-serviceman is not a registered member of the Waterside Workers Federation how may he obtain employment under this clause? The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) knows very well that the claim that ex-servicemen are protected under the Rehabilitation and Employment Act is mere sham and hypocrisy. He is well aware that if an ex-serviceman be not registered by the Waterside Workers Federation he cannot secure employment with the commission as the clause now stands.,101
410,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The clause deals only with the appointment of the commission.,102
411,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,I am aware of that.,102
412,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The honourable member's remarks are not relevant to the clause under discussion.,102
413,Mr ABBOTT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,Then I shall take a later opportunity to express my views on the subject.,102
414,Mr ANTHONY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Richmond) [12.33 a.m.] - I am somewhat surprised at the reply given by the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis). The right honourable gentleman knows very well that the specific preference granted to ex-servicemen under the re-establishment legislation is inoperative in all cases where it may be of value. If the Attorney General and the Government are sincere in their protestations about the welfare of ex-servicemen, there can be no possible objection to the insertion in every bill which proposes the establishment of authorities or commissions of a clause providing for preference to ex-servicemen in such appointments as may be made Sub-clause 2 provides that officers and employees appointed to the commission shall not be subject to the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922-1946. Only a fortnight ago the Government introduced a bill the purpose of which was said to be to bring additional public servants under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, yet today it includes in another measure a clause specifically excluding the employees of the. Stevedoring Industry Commission from the provisions of that act. The only, difference between the employees of the Stevedoring Industry Commission and employees of the Repatriation Department and the War Service Homes Commission, with whom the recent legislation had to deal, is that the latter are almost exclusively ex-servicemen. As the subclause stands at present the employees of the commission may apparently be anything but ex-servicemen. The manner in which the proposal of the honourable member for Moreton was brushed aside by the Attorney-General seems to indicate that ex-servicemen are the last people to be given consideration by this Government. No doubt the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) will ask what is the position of Communist ex-servicemen. I am strongly of the opinion that all Communists, whether they be ex-servicemen or not, should be excluded from appointment to the commission. ME. ROSEVEAB - Eve n those decorated with the Victoria Cross?",102
415,Mr ANTHONY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Yes . Tens of thousands of ex-servicemen who are not Communists possess the requisite qualifications for appointment to the commission, and accordingly it is not necessary to consider members of the Communist party when selecting ex-servicemen for appointments such as this. I have no doubt, however, that some honourable members opposite when considering applications for such appointments would think first of members of that party. The reply given by the Attorney-General in relation to the commission and its staff being excluded from the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act is inconsistent with the principles of the bill which was before us only a fortnight ago.

416,Mr WHITE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Balaclava) [12.37 a.m.]. - I support the amendment, and I appeal to the Government to accept it as embodying a principle in which it professes to believe. Honourable members opposite know only too well that the preference provisions of the Rehabilitation and Employment Act are honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Instances of this which have arisen in the past may well be repeated. Too often has the Government ignored the principles in which it professes to believe. There have been instances of that kind in connection with recent appointments of trade commissioners. Of the applicants for the post recently filled by Mr Breen and Mr Frost, the former members for Calare and Franklin, respectively, 219 out of a total cf 319 were ex-servicemen, yet their rights were ignored. Hundreds of young ex-servicemen who have had the reponsibilities of command, and who lost five valuable years of their lives while serving their country, have come back only to find themselves laughed and jeered at by honourable members opposite. I have had many letters about ex-servicemen being taken from the services of the States into the Department of Supply and Shipping who have never been able to secure permanent positions. I support the amendment.",102
417,Mr FRANCIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Moreton) [12.39 a.m.]. - I make n further appeal to the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to accept the amendment. I stress the need for such an amendment because every time there has been a worthwhile appointment ex-servicemen have been excluded because of some technicalities or some hidden features in the Rehabilitation and Employment Act. We had an instance of this in a recent appointment to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. When we objected we were informed that the council was not subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Is it proposed that the employees of the commission shall or shall not the public servants? Will the Attorney-General say whether all appointments under this bill will or will not be subject to the Re-establishment and Employment Act? I do not like the way in which the Government has been making appointments of late. It never lets an opportunity pass to side-step the preference sections in that act. It exercises a skilled hand in drafting legislation in order to avoid granting preference rather than carry out the letter and spirit of the Re-establishment and Employment Act. I want on this occasion to put the issue beyond a shadow of doubt. All honourable members with regard for the welfare of ex-servicemen will support the amendment if it comes to a division, but I hope that the Attorney-General will reconsider his amazing attitude of hostility to the amendment and accept it without dividing the committee.

Question so resolved in the negative.",103
418,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Warringah) [12.48 a.m.] - I move That the following new sub-clause be added:"" (4.) A person who is or becomes a member of .the Communist party shall be disqualified from becoming, or if already appointed, from continuing to bo, an officer or employee of the Commission "". The amendment speaks for itself. My purpose is to see precisely where the Government stands in relation to its contention that it is opposed to the Communists. It is acknowledged that Communists are at the root of the troubles wherein the Government is defied on the waterfront. be I should particularly like to know where the honourable member for Reid (Mr . Lang) stands when it comes to a vote on the proposed new sub-clause because for a long time he has pretended opposition to the Communists. The . . 31 honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Rosevear) has also expressed views 12 against the Communists, but I doubt whether it was more than mere talk, and I shall be very surprised if he ever does more than talk about the Labour party being opposed to them. The Minister for Transport (Mr Ward), who is endeavouring to interject, is a notable exponent of the Communists' tactics of branding as a fascist anybody who opposes communism. Indeed, I am inclined to believe that the honourable member is a secret member of the Communist party. If we held an inquiry into the activities of that party, the result golden, opportunity. might be upsetting to him. T. have reasons for making that statement. This proposed new sub-clause will give Government supporters an opportunity to indicate clearly whether they are opposed to communism or not. They have frequently expressed their opposition to the party. Now they have a chance to give expression to that opposition by disqualifying any member of the Communist party from being appointed as an officer or employee of the commission.",103
419,Mr FRANCIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Moreton) [12.51 a.m.].' - I strongly support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender). The Communist party is the most dangerous disruptive organization in Australia today. Its members openly declare their opposition to any form of constitutional government. I know of numerous instances in which Communists have led unions into industrial trouble. We must increase production if Australia is to prosper, but we cannot do so while Communists are white-anting our key industries. They control the coal-mining industry, for example. The acting president of the miners federation in my home town is a professed Communist. Men like him have caused untold trouble, in the industry. They have also caused unrest amongst waterside workers ami seamen. Australia today is suffering from the effects of scores of strikes and disturbances from Cape York to Wilson's Promontory. There are many industrial disputes in northern Queensland. These have not been actively fomented by Communists, but the workers involved in them have found that to strike is the only way in which they can impress their grievances on the Government. Dairymen have discovered that they cannot secure a fair deal unless they strike or threaten to do so. They have learned this lesson, from Communist-controlled organizations. I shall do everything in my power to resist the disruptive tactics of the Communist party. Australia should now be on the crest of the greatest wave of prosperity in its history; but the Government, owing to its futility and weakness in dealing with militant unions and the Communists, has missed its I support the proposed new clause.",104
420,Mr BEALE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Parramatta) [12.54 a.m.] - This proposed new clause applies the acid test to the Government and its supporters. Nearly all of the honourable members whose bright shining faces I see before me have, from time to time, protested in throbbing tones their opposition to communism. Yet now that they have a clear-cut chance to exclude Communists from appointments to the staff of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, they "" squib "" the issue. The obvious inference is that all their anti-Communist talk is mere humbug and hot air. I believe that some honourable members opposite would support the amendment but for the fact that they are so regimented that they are not game to defy their masters. There is no doubt that others amongst them, in their hearts, are enthusiastically in favour of Communists and their technique. Honourable members opposite say that the Communist party is "" only another political party "" audi that therefore we should not interfere with it. But it is not a political party at all. It is a revolutionary party. Every tenet of its faith favours revolution. If , of course its members can achieve their objects by white-anting our' constitutional institutions they will do so. If they fail to succeed in this way, they will do it by blood-thirsty revolution. That is their avowed policy, which is expressed in every Communist text-book and which is uttered by Communists in the Sydney Domain every Sunday afternoon. The central article of the party's faith is revolutionary, not political. We say that members of this organization who are pledged to destroy our democratic institutions, by bloodshed if necessary, should be prevented from doing so. If it can be proved that they are creeping into important public positions, we should take steps to exclude them from such positions. I do not agree that a reputed Communist should be required to prove his innocence, but men like Healy, Roach and Thornton, who are confessed Communists, should not be permitted to occupy public positions, they should be banned from the commission, and this amendment will do it. We should provide in this bill that any man who is proved to be a Communist should be forced to resign. The matter of proof offers no more difficulty than in any other matter of proof in courts. Unless the protestations of honourable members opposite have been nothing more than hypocritical flapdoodle, they will vote ior the proposed new clause before the committee. If they oppose it, we shall know them for what they are-fello w travellers with the Communist revolutionaries.",104
421,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wentworth) [12.58 a.m.] - I cannot understand why the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) will not accept the proposal before the committee. He has listened attentively to the speeches made by honourable members on this side of the chamber, but he has not explained why he opposes the proposed new clause. He knows that Communists who will seek appointments to the Stevedoring Industry Commission will do so for the purpose of disrupting the industry. Knowing this to be the avowed policy of the Communists the right honourable gentleman should seek to protect the industry, which is susceptible to Communist infiltration. The president of the Waterside Workers Federation is a selfconfessed Communist, and there are many Communist cells within the federation. There is no doubt that the representatives of that organization on the commission will be Communists. Surely the Minister is anxious to ensure that the staff commission shall be free of the taint of communism. Our arguments have been clear and simple, and there is no reason for the Minister to hedge on this matter. If the Labour party sincerely desires to clear its ranks of Communists, it will accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender).",105
422,Mr HUTCHINSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Deakin) [1 a.m.]. - I am not surprised that the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) does not reply to the Opposition's contentions, because he is not able to do so; but I am surprised that my own colleagues have so little knowledge of political principles. It is well known that the Labour party is a socialist party, and that its members believe that no farm, business factory, or home should be owned by an individual. MR. WARD-What rot! Mr HUTCHINSON"" - Member s of the socialist Labour party must believe that, if they are true to their election pledge. THE CHAIRMAN - Order ! The honourable member is digressing. MR. HUTCHINSON - I am not. THE CHAIRMAN - The Chair has ruled otherwise.",105
423,Mr HUTCHINSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,The Communist party and the socialist Labour party have the same objective. Both parties believe in the complete socialist state. THE CHAIRMAN - Order ! I ask the honourable member to relate his remarks to the amendment.,105
424,Mr HUTCHINSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I am referring to communism. The Attorney-General could not reply to the contentions of the Opposition because the objectives of the socialist Labour party and the Communist party are the same. The only point of difference is that the Communist believes that a socialist state can be attained and held permanently only by totalitarian methods. It is on the question of method only that these two political philosophies differ. What argument could the Attorney General advance against the amendment pxeept that no person should be debarred because of his political views from seeking employment and sustenance for himof the self and his family. He cannot use it, - because this bill deprives men of the right to work on the wharfs unless they are members of the Waterside Workers Federation. In truth, the right honourable gentleman is left without a feather to fly with. He cannot deny the contention that the objective of socialist Labour is the same as that of the Communist party. He cannot state that the Communist can be debarred from entering this industry because of his political views, as the bill provides that a man may only be employed on the wharfs if he is a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. For those reasons, the Attorney-General is not able to reply to the contentions of the Opposition. MB. ROSEVEAR - Then why has Opposition asked the Attorney-General to reply?",105
425,Mr HUTCHINSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"I am making tralia it plain that there can be no reply. Honourable members opposite dare not vote for the amendment, but honourable members on this side of the chamber are bound, first, to tell the Australian people exactly what the Labour party stands for ; secondly, to reveal that socialist Labour and the Communist party have y. common objective; and, thirdly, to expose the tyranny involved in the bill.",106
426,Mr DUTHIE,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wilmot ) [1.4 a.m.] The Opposition, which has monopolized this discussion, has not attempted to define "" Communist"". If the Government accepted the amendment, it would be obliged to define "" Communist"", and would experience great difficulty in doing so. Many people who claim that they are supporters of the Labour party, actually are not. Some of them have "" t w is t e d "" Falkinder, C. W. J. to the Liberal party. Many people who describe themselves as Liberals, are actually not Liberals. How are we to bring into the net by legislation all the persons that we desire to catch ? The task would be impossible. Wherever it has been tried, it has failed. For example, it failed dismally in Germany. Repressive measures will drive the Communists underground, where they work most effectively. Let the Communist party remain in the open, where we can. see it working. If we drive it underground, we shall not know what it is doing until it. is ready to rear its ugly head. The Opposition has given the Communist party an excellent advertisement.",106

Clause 1 1(1.) The functions of the Commission shall be(b) to regulate industrial matters in connection with operations, and to and control the performance of stevedoring operations, in so far as those operations relate to trade and commerce . . . (2.) The Commission shall exercise its functions \vi,th ; i view to securing(a) the speedy and efficient performance of stevedoring operations;",106
429,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wentworth) [1.12 a.m.] - I move That, in sub-clausc (1.), paragraph (6), the words, "" and to regulate and control the performance of stevedoring operations."", be left, out. l.f the amendment be agreed to, paragraph b will readto regulate industrial matters in connection with stevedoring operations, in so far as those operations relate to trade and commerce with other countries or among the States or are performed in a Territory of the Commonwealth. This is a cleverly designed paragraph, the effect of which could be completely to nationalize or socialize the stevedoring industry. The words which the amendment would delete from the paragraph appear at first sight to be innocent enough, but they could lead to the Government taking over control of all stevedoring operations in Australia. On piige 25 of Judge Foster's report His Honour referred to certain recommendations made by Mr Healy, the general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation. Already during this debate honourable members on this side have pointed out that the object of the Communists is to bring about a nationalized State. Referring to Mr Healy's suggestions, Judge Foster saidHis wide proposals envisaged the running of a very big business by the Stevedoring Industry Commission throughout Australia as the actual employers. His Honour referred to that matter earlier in his report, because on page 2 he said Mr Healy suggested that a commission be set up: which, in effect, would, as a quasigovernmental institution not only settle industrial relationships involved, but would also manage the whole industry. That is clear. Mr Healy submitted to Judge Foster a proposal for the control of the industry, and later His Honour stevedoring said that Mr Healy visualized the Steveregulate doring Industry Commission as one big business. One wonders whether the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) has fallen into a trap, but perhaps he has not done so because, after all, one object of the Labour party is the socialization of industry. It may be that the Attorney General, with the help of Mr Healy hopes, in this way to give legislative effect to one plank of the Labour party's platform. Paragraph b of sub-clause 1 would give to the Government power to socialize the stevedoring industry. If that is the Government's intention, the Minister should say so.",107
430,Dr EVATT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Barton-Attorney-Genera l and Minister for External Affairs ) [1.18 a.m.] - It is correct, as I pointed out this afternoon when replying to the second-reading debate, that the powers conferred on the commission go beyond the settlement of industrial disputes and the regulation of industrial matters in relation to stevedoring operations, and include the regulation of the performance of stevedoring operations in interstate and overseas trade. It is also correct that Judge Foster did not recommend that as a present functional purpose of the commission, but His Honour also said, in addition to what the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . Harrison) has read, that this power should be a reserve power in the hands of the commission. On page 22 of his report Judge Foster saidFurther, the more remote future may hold developments in this industry with which it would be altogether impossible for the court to deal. The tribunal to be set up should be such as could offer advice about the future development of the industry and also grow up in experience and power with these foreseeable developments. Speaking of the desirability of the chairman devoting his full time to the work, His Honour saidThere is a tremendous task ahead, to lift the status of this industry to the plane where alone we may expect results satisfactory alike to the workers, the employers, and the community. Ho dcfilt. then with the matter of discipline and referred to the profit motive as a means of achieving efficiency and economy in the industry in times of peace, but lhat motive was largely lost during the war. He added- Pence may restore it but in the meantime - employers will not or cannot, conduct dustry with maximum efficiency, then in interests of the industry and the community, the Stevedoring Industry Commission must given some powers to this end. On page 29, the judge again refers community having an interest, both in efficient management by owners and fair and reasonable work by employees. He then goes on to discuss the problem of decasnalization. On page 33 of his reattention port, the judge concludesThe conduct of the industry depends, more than most industries, upon the successful operation with other bodies, and that propower, vision should be made to enable this to dime as far as is constitutionally practicable. ""Whilst the judge has specifically rejected, at least for the present, any suggestion that the commission should be set up a quasi-governmental institution, not to settle the industrial relationships volved, but also to control and manage the whole industry, the references above to his report indicate clearly that he in mind for the commission, functions beyond the settlement of industrial relaThis tionships between employers and emfrom ployees. To enable it to carry out some page 40of these functions, the commission has been specifically empowered, as will be myThese seen by reference to clause 13 of fully the present bill. It will be incumHowever, bent upon the commission to encounhave ter many novel situations in its very efforts to supervise and regulate the inence, dustry, and to serve, by so doing, the public interest. It is not possible, at this acquire, juncture, to anticipate just what difficulties and problems will be encountered, nor to specify in the bill what powers could be given to the commission to equip it to deal satisfactorily with all the developments which may occur. Thereas fore, it is regarded as essential that should he some reserves of power, and this is provided for in paragraph b of subfar-reaching clause 1 of clause 11. I do not claim that the judge specifithey cally recommended that there should a reserve of power, but such a provision Dr Evatt. is in accordance with his general observations. Why should not the commission have some power to control and regulate the performance of stevedoring operations? For instance, if equipment is out of date, why should not the commission if have authority to deal with the situation .this inby regulation? The Commonwealth has the authority over such matters by virtue of be its power over interstate and overseas trade, and it is now proposed to confer that power on the commission. I say that to the such a provision is necessary.",107
431,Mr SPENDER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Warringah) [1.25 a.m.] - During the debate on the motion for the second reading of the bill, I drew to the words to which reference has been made, and I emphasized how wide was their scope. It is not a matter coof conferring upon the commission some but of conferring upon it all power be to regulate and control the performance of stevedoring operations. I have listened to the so-called defence of the Attorney General, and it amazes me that he should as have refrained from reading the most imonly portant part of Judge Foster's report. inThe first question that arises is why, in view of the comments in that paragraph which I shall shortly read, the Governhas ment should seek to confer this very extensive power upon the commission. is what the judge said, and I read the last paragraph of the report on proposals are very far-reaching and investigations so far have not enabled me in appreciate all the implications involved. the immediate and most pressing problems fall for solution within the powers 1 recommended, and the further powers may wisely wait both knowledge and experiand depend upon the future recommendation of the new body which will steadily as time iioes on. the necessary knowledge and experience and capacity. I cannot understand how, in the face of that statement, a responsible Minister can say that the judge recommended a provision conferring a reserve of power such this upon the commission. The judge there recommended nothing of the sort. On the contrary, he said that very wide and proposals were pressed on him by Mr Healy. He did not say that were ultimately undesirable, but be he said that such powers should be exercised only in the light of experience gained over the years. It is significant that the powers were pressed on the judge by Mr Healy. I should like to know who pressed them on the Government. subject-matter. At whose behest were the relevant words included in the bill? I have a suspicion that we have before us a bill moulded under the constant pressure of Mr Healy. I record my amazement that the AtWarringah ? torney-General (Dr Evatt) should rise in his place and quote from the report of the judge in an attempt to support his attitude when that report contains the paragraphs which I have just read.",108
432,Mr HARRISON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL,"Wentworth) [1.2S a.m.] - The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) owes the committee an explanation. I quoted two passages from report of Judge Foster to the effect the Government should have reported favourably upon the recommendations of Mr Healy on this subject of reserve powers for the commission. Now, honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) has read the last paragraph the report, which makes it clear that the Attorney-General has been misleading the committee. Now, apparently, he prepared to sit quiet and make no ment, thus admitting that he wilfully recommended it. misdirected the committee. He owes the committee an explanation, and I demand that he make it.",109

The Commission shall exercise its functions with a view to securing(o) the speedy, safe and efficient performance of stevedoring operations.

The place suggested by the honourable member is a convenient one to insert the word "" safe "", and I am prepared to accept a suitable amendment. Amendment (by Mrs BLACKBURN) agreed toThat, in sub-clause (2.), paragraph (a) , after the word "" speedy "". the word "" safe "" be inserted. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 12 (He a r in g , & c , of in d u s t r i a l disputes) .",110
446,Dr EVATT,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External A f fair s ) [1.43 a . m . ] - I move That, after sub-clause (2.), the following new sub-clause be inserted:"" (3.) For the purpose of hearing the parties to the dispute, and of inquiring into and investigating the dispute, the Commission shall have the same .powers as the Cour.t or a Conciliation Commissioner has under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1946 in relation to industrial disputes."" This will give to the commission the long list of powers possessed by the Arbitration Court in order to hear disputes effectively. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 13 (Powers of Commission).",110
447,Mr SPENDER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Warringah) [1.44 a.m.] - I ask the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to clarify the meaning of this clause. We know that another measure will be introduced to impose a tax on the stevedoring industry for the purposes of this bill. The clause as printed contemplates the imposition of an additional burden, or the granting of power to the commission to impose a burden in excess of the levy to be raised by the taxing measure. Sub-paragraph vi. of paragraph b gives power to the commission to provide, or require the provision of, canteens, cafeteria, dining-rooms, rest-rooms, and adequate sanitary and washing facilities for waterside workers. Am I to understand that in addition to the levy to be imposed upon the industry power is to be given to the commission to require those engaged in stevedoring operations to provide at their own expense any of the amenities to which I have referred ?",111
448,Dr EVATT,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [1.45 a.m.],-A . taxation plan has been devised for two purposes, first to provide the administrative expenses of the commission and secondly to make it possible for the commission to make payments as a charge against the industry as a whole rather than against individual employers. These powers may in a sense be regarded as imposing additional burdens. The commissionmay exercise them within its discretion after hearing the evidence and according to the nature of the award or order - made. To increase wages or to fix hours may impose additional burdens. I remind the honourable gentleman, however, that power to fix hours also implies power to reduce hours. With that reservation the meaning placed upon the clause by the honourable member is correct.",111
449,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Barker) [1.47 a.m.] - The last sub-paragraph of paragraph b empowers the commission to make provision for the payment of guaranteed weekly or daily wages to waterside workers. I am not at all sure as to what is the policy of the Government on this matter. Sub-paragraph i i of paragraph b empowers the commission to make provision for annual and sick leave. Having regard to the industrial trouble on the waterfront today, does the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), intend that a waterside worker may strike and break the law as often as he likes, and, in due course, after the expiration of every twelve months, be entitled to annual leave at the expense of the Crown?",111
450,Dr EVATT,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"As in the case of the Arbitration Court, the conditions under which such annual leave may be granted or withheld will be at the discretion of the commission-.",111
451,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Then some direction should be given to the commission limiting the condition* under which annual leave may be granted. The representative of the Government on the commission will be able to put the Government's viewpoint in regard to these matters without reference to this Parliament. That is a matter about which we have already complained. I am firmly of opinion that if a man fails to carry out the job he has registered himself to perform-and I use the term "" registered"" with a good deal of emphasissevere penalties should be imposed upon him with respect to his rights to annual leave. These penalties should not be left for determination by the commission; they are matters upon which the Parliament should have some definite say. Is it likely that in cases of ordinary breaches of the law the Attorney-General would agree that the penalties to be imposed by the courts should be left to the determination of some outside body which may not include in its membership one member of the judiciary. The right honourable gentleman will say at once that the penalties should be incorporated in the act. Should, not that be also the case in this instance? Sub-paragraph iv of paragraph b empowers the commission to establish and administer employment bureaux for waterside workers. If all waterside workers are to be registered,, as is contemplated by this bill, what need is there for employment bureaux? An employment bureau is an exchange where people who require labour and those who proffer their services meet and come to an agreement. Under this proposed law nobody will be offering for work unless he is a registered member of the Waterside Workers Federation. That is quite clear. Therefore, the necessity for an employment bureau in the generally accepted sense will not arise. The clause further provides that the commission shall have power to make provision for the payment of attendance money to waterside workers. I have heard it described as "" appearance money "". think this is one of the most remarkable things any government has ever agreed to. We have heard a lot about condicrease tions on the waterfront. In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of last Saturday there appears a list of tax-evaders, some whom are described by the Taxation shall Commissioner as fraudulent. One in that category is a waterside worker who underThe stated his income from 1937-38 to 1939-40 and from 1941-42 to 1943-44 by £1,935, on which he was charged an additional penalty of £203. I am amazed that the waterside workers have not proclaimed general strike in order to have that gentleman's penalty returned to him. That poor fellow is to get 16s. a day he turns up for work and there is no provided work for him. If the payment of state appearance money is to apply on the waterfront, it will not be long before the Commonwealth Government will have other industries applying for similar treatment-the building industry, for instance. When a wall is started and clement weather intervenes, the men cannot work; but what is to prevent them from turning up to collect appearance money ? MB . CHIFLEY - A similar provision is contained in many awards.",111
452,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Then , in like by heaven it will not be long before it is in every award. If that provision is to be incorporated in awards for the stevedoring industry, it must be incora.m.] - I moveporated in the awards for other industries. I say to the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) and to the Attorney-General serted:that the conditions that they are putting into pieces of legisl ition like this such a financial responsibility that no government will be able to stand up to it. They are in the position of the lady friends of Louis XIV . of France who could idly say, "" A f t e r us the deluge"". The flood will come after the present Ministry goes out and a government from this side will have to clean up the mess that it is so glibly making now at the expense of other people. Certain things in this bill cannot be justified by any government in any circumstance. The cost of handling on the wharfs has risen enormously as the result of reduced output per man-hour. I More men do leS3 work. It stands to reason that the value of our exports .must decline and the cost of our imports in because of the increased costs of handling on the wharfs. I am surprised that this bill does not provide that of anyone working overtime on the wharfs be guilty of a capital offence, because that is just about what we are getting to. world was never in more need than now of the commodities that we have to export. Ye t there is a deliberate, premeditated and malicious attempt by the waterside workers in the port of Sydney a to keep those commodities from the people who want them. All we get in response to that from the Government is when that extra good conditions are to be for the men responsible for that of affairs. Clau.=e 13 is wicked and unjustifiable. It is time that honourable members of the Opposition, who represent industry, stand for freedom of the individual and believe that something like common sense should be imported into in - legislation, took a firm stand. Clause agreed to. Clause 14(2.) The provisions of section forty-eight and of section forty-nine of the Acts Interpretation Act 1001-1041 shall apply to awards and orders made hy the Commission which are of a legislative and not an executive character, manner as they apply tio regulations.",112
453,Dr EVATT,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Barton-Attorney-Genera l and Minister for External Affairs [1.57 That, in sub-clause (2.), after the word . "" Commission"", the following words be in"" (not being awards or orders made to prevent or settle industrial disputes, or resmlating industrial matters, in connection connote with stevedoring operations) "". The effect of the amendment would be, as in the case of awards and settlements of disputes made by the Arbitration were circulated:Court, to require industrial matters to be kept within the province of the commission. All ' other orders, such as those regulating stevedoring operations, would be subject to disallowance in either ter, upon noticechamber.

Why is .there no longer a non-public servant representative of the public on the National Film Board? 2. Is it a fact that Professor Stout, who was previously on the board and was dropped from it last year during its reconstruction, had urged production of documentary films giving a realist presentation of Australian life, problems and culture? 3. Is it a fact that Professor Stout campaigned against alleged financial starvation of the board, that he attacked the Department of Information's alleged pinpricking on expenses, and that he urged the establishment of a training scheme? 4.

No. Professor Stout, like other board members, knew that if more money had been available more films could have been made.
