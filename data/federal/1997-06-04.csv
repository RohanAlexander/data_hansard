AGED CARE BILL 1997 Cognate bills: AGED CARE (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 AGED CARE (COMPENSATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 May, on motion by Mrs Moylan: That the bill be now read a second time.",16
12,Mr MCGAURAN,PAIRS,"I present the corrigendum to the explanatory memorandum for the Aged Care Bill 1997. This corrigendum is required as a result of a printing error at the AGPS, which saw the last page of the original explanatory memorandum inadvertently left off.",16
13,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"Jagajaga) (10.00 a.m.)The Aged Care Bill 1997 has been described as 'discriminatory and ill prepared' and as 'short-sighted', its passage lamented as 'seriously risking undermining the current standard of aged care in Australia', its impact assessed as certain to 'punish Australia's most vulnerable older people' and its legacy 'a two-tiered system of health care' - a system that will condemn older Australians without money or assets to second-rate levels of care in older and increasingly run-down accommodation. These are not the words of the opposition, nor are they the words of any fringe antigovernment group. They are the words of the Catholic, Uniting and Anglican churches, of Over 50s Focus, Aged Care Australia, the Older Women's Network and the Alzheimers Association of Australia. They are also the words of the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association. These organisations represent the full spectrum of private and not-for-profit aged care providers as well as older Australians and their families. These reactions have been provoked by a bill which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) describes as 'first class' and which the government claims is aimed at cleaning up a 'mess' in aged care-a 'mess' that the government claims is the legacy of Labor in government. There is a view that if you say something often enough it will become true, throw enough mud around and some of it will stick, and in politics attempt to create a sense of crisis and confusion to justify or smokescreen hidden agendas. Of course, what we see here is the government doing exactly that in relation to aged care. What we have heard from the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), and no doubt we will hear from other speakers from the government side on this subject, is one of the most extraordinary litanies of exaggeration, half truths and outright misrepresentation of the facts ever heard in this chamber. What is the truth about Labor's record in government and what did Labor inherit in terms of aged care from the Fraser government? In 1983 Labor inherited an aged care system that had seen numerous attempts at reform by previous governments of both political persuasions. However, the system provided standards of care that varied widely over the nation. Some of it was appalling. I will not go on about all that now because it is a very long time ago. What did Labor do about it? One thing they did not do is sit on their hands. Rather than give you my words, let us have a look at what Australia's welfare said about our aged care system. Australia's welfare is a detailed report about Australia's health and welfare systems that has been undertaken by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, a body that is independent of government and political parties. I recommend to the minister that she read these reports and stop misleading the public and the parliament about what Labor did. The 1993 report describes the major restructuring of aged care services that started in 1985. It makes the point: It was not until the mid-1980s that a substantial overhaul of the aged care system-the Aged Care Reform Strategy-was implemented. Changes since that time have been considerable. Labor's Aged Care Reform Strategy had major social justice objectives-access, equity and participation. It is worth just pausing here for a minute to compare these objectives with the Howard government's central driving tenet of user pays, which means that you get into a nursing home if you have the money, and the money will determine the type of nursing home bed you get as well. The Howard government has proved extremely creative at developing policies that will increase the number of users who can pay through such things as accommodation bonds or up-front fees. But its policies are most threadbare when coping with the situation where a user cannot pay. We have seen the most glaring example of this in the last week with the government's 'derisory' and 'insulting' offer of $5 per bed day for the financially disadvantaged. Again, these are the words of the churches. By way of contrast, Labor's aged care reform strategy sought to properly target services to levels of need. Thus we had development of a system of care, with the level of care offered determined by need as opposed to how much money one has. That to is the Howard government approach of user pays. The type of care was determined independent aged care assessment teams that were made up of doctors, nurses and social workers. These teams worked to a classification instrument which specified the types of care to be offered and made sure that the more highly dependent residents got greater resources. These important changes were put in place by Labor, not by any previous Libafter eral government. Nursing homes offered higher while the development of hostels offered a lower level of care. That was encouraged to stop a trend that had emerged under succeslittle sive Liberal governments of increasing tionalisation in nursing homes of people lower care needs. There was a further diversiAustralia fication of the type of care offered with the introduction in 1985 of home and community care and, later, community aged care packagservices, es, both of which allowed older Australians accommodation, with increasing dependency to continue in their own homes. User rights, including charter of residents rights, were developed from 1989 to 1991. Labor's strategy also introduced standards monitoring in 1987. Australia's welfare comments: The results of a 4 year evaluation of the Standards Monitoring Program in nursing homes ... included international comparisons, and places the Australian program at the forefront of aged care regulatory practices. This point needs to be stressed if only to counter the wave of strident and irresponsible rot being promoted by the Minister for Family Services and the Prime Minister. Australia under Labor had an excellent standard of care and was a world leader in the levels care provided. This is not just my view; it the view of delegates to international conferences such as the Alzheimer's International Conference in Scotland in 1994, just to give one example. Things were not perfect. They did need ongoing reform. But this trend of ongoing reform, of continuous improvement, was the Labor approach. I might just mention for the the purposes of informing the minister that I personally had nothing to do with this process of reform. I am very happy to give the credit others for this excellent program of reform. In fact, I was not working for the federal by government and of course was not in the federal parliament. The minister might stop misleading everybody on that score as well. Let us have a look at the capital funding issues for aged care institutions. Under Labor, capital expenditure on nursing homes and hostels increased from $46 million in 1984-85 to total $1.2 billion over the lO-year period that. These are the facts that all those opposite should comprehend. As Australia's levels of care welfare comments: The system which emerged by the early 1980's was a consequence of incremental change which took account of the inter-relationships between institudifferent sectors of provision. with Commenting in 1995, the report says: has come to recognise the importance of a more holistic approach to service delivery. - the best balance of care amongst domiciliary long term residential care, supported short term respite services, support living for carers and cash assistance. a But what do this government give us? They are giving us in this Aged Care Bill a return to the incremental approach with the addition of user pays and a significant cut of $500 million to government support for aged care. In preparing for today I could not find any evidence of any other government that put the aged care sector under such budgetary pressure. None. This government has done a first as far as that is concerned. In comparing in real terms what Labor spent on aged care, we find real recurrent expenditure increased by 54 per cent in the nine years 1985-86 to aged 1993-94; in HACC, home and community of care, by 134 per cent; in hostels by 283 per is cent; and in nursing homes by 22 per cent. Compare this picture of ordered, systematic, evolutionary reform to the mess this government has managed to make of its attempts at aged care reform over the last 12 months. Along the way the Howard government have caused an enormous amount of worry and concern amongst the majority of older Australians and their families and a great deal of worry to the providers of aged care. In fact, what this government have managed to do is unite in opposition to their proposals all those involved in aged care-the providers, both private and not for profit, the workers and representatives of nursing home residents. This opposition has developed as the full implications of the government's plans have been revealed. Let us have a look at the piecemeal and confused approach that the government has adopted. Even in the last few !jays, just before we were supposed to debate this bill, we have seen an announcement that the implementation of the bill is to be delayed for three months-something that the opposition and the aged care sector have been calling for-but three months is far too short a time to unravel the mess this government has created. Secondly, we have had the final and belated revelation of one of the bill's key measures: the amount of subsidy to be paid to nursing homes for taking those who cannot pay an entry fee, an amount described by the Uniting Church as 'an insult to our elderly and a slap in the face for charitable service providers' and by the Catholic Church as 'a cruel joke'. These comments should be noted by all those opposite. We have the consultative group responsible for funding details still discussing-I am here debating this bill in the House and we still have people having discussions with the departments-the descriptors to be used to assess nursing home residents. Until these are provided, it is impossible for nursing homes to use the new classification instrument or to have any idea about how their finances will look under the government's new system. They have no way of knowing whether or not they will be better or worse off, and here we are debating the bill. We have once again had the cancellation of training workshops at the last moment. This is an extremely important issue because those who work in ljllrsing homes have to be able to understand liow they are to put this new system in place, how they are to assess residents and how they are to know who will be employed in nursing homes. Labor's aged care strategy was accompanied by almost a year of intensive training by teams of trainers. Without proper training of nursing home staff, there will be total chaos when this bill is implemented-and that too is the view of the nursing home sector. We have had the minister blame in media releases the Senate for obstructing the bill. As people can see, we are actually debating this bill in the House of Representatives today. S-, I cannot quite see how it has anything to do with obstruction in the Senate. In an answer to a question in the House last week, the Minister for Family Services made much of the so-called crisis in aged care, claiming that the government had to act and act now. It might be suggested that this minister has a bit of a predilection for detecting the odd crisis in her portfolio, and of course it is a fairly standard tactic for beating up support for measures which the minister has failed to sell through rational explanation and debate. In child care, for example, she has also recently discovered a crisis: increases in childcare fees. Instead of recognising they are the result of her budget cuts last year, she accuses private child-care providers of overcharging parents by millions of dollars. Regardless of whether there is any truth to her accusation, what is her urgent response to this 'cri.sis', as she calls it? The minister is going to wait for the report of a committee that will report in the year 2000. Some crisis! She and the Prime Minister have been up to their misleading ways again this week. The minister claimed yesterday that the Labor Party offered only $3 per nursing home resident to carry out capital upgrades. I hope she will be better briefed before she comes into respond to this second reading debate. For the record it must be stated that, firstly, Labor spent more than a billion dollars in the last 10 years on nursing home and hostel upgrades and new buildings. Secondly, let us just look at the facts in relation to this $3 that is being talked about. In the 1995-96 budget Labor proposed a $7 top-up on top of the $8 per resident capital grant for any new or rebuilt nursing homes-a total of $15. So you can forget the $3 that she i- talking about as far as that is concerned. But let us see where the $3 comes in. For nursing homes that were spending $20,000 or more on capital upgrades, Labor offered a $3 top-up on top of the $8 per patient capital grant-a total of $11. The minister said on radio this morning, 'This was going to be available only if people spent $20,000.' That is exactly right. This was supposed to be an incentive to get people to upgrade their nursing homes. That was the whole point. This government is basically saying to nursing homes, 'You can raise accommodation bonds, then you don't have to spend it on upgrades. There's nothing in the legislation that requires you to do so.' The government cites a crisis caused by the physical decline of aged care facilities, mainly nursing homes. It is true that in the Gregory report there was an identification of the need to spend considerably more money to bring nursing homes up to an acceptable standard. But I repeat: Labor spent over $1 billion on nursing homes and hostels in the 10 years to 1994 and had aIIocated $245 million in its budget forward estimates-money for direct c,apital upgrade of nursing home stock that of course fell victim to the cuts of Treasurer Costello in the Howard government's first budget. So, rather than retaining Labor's allocation for capital upgrading of nursing homes: the Howard government has different plans-plans more in keeping with its view of the world. To meet these capital needs the Howard government proposes a move to a user-pays ·sys'tem. That is its system. That is the system that it wants to put in place. Let us look at what the bill actually proposes'. Firstly, there is an up-front entry fee, an accommodation bond, supposedly to pay for capital upgrades. Secondly, there is a new daily fee for nursing homes and hostels to replace part of the recurrent subsidy previously paid by government. Thirdly, there is the granting of a power to the minister to transfer responsibility for aged care to the states without any reference to the parliament. Fourthly, there is no longer any decent accountability in this bilI for the funds provided as recurrent subsidies or for capital. There is no requirement that the money raised from entry fees will be used to upgrade nursing homes. There is no requirement that subsidies paid for the care of residents will guarantee that nurses will be employed in nursing homes. Fifthly, the payment of the daily subsidy for people without assets, termed 'concessional residents' in this bill, to compensate nursing homes for the fact that these people cannot pay up-front fees is only $5 a day. Sixthly, there is no hostel subsidy for those residents on the lowest classification level. Lastly, there is the amalgamation of nursing homes anp hostels into a single system of aged care institutions. What are Labor's significant problems with this bill? Let us have a look at the entry fee, or accommodation bond. The bill requires all future nursing home residents to pay an entry tee subject to an assets test. There is no upper limit to the size of the entry fee. The only requirement is that a person be left with $22,500 in assets. For many people the annual interest on $22,500, around $4 a day on current interest rates, will be all they have to pay for the many extras required by nursing home residents-things like toiletries, fruit, stamps and phone calls. Whether a person has to pay an entry fee will be determined by an assets test that includes the family home as an asset. Only those who share their home with a spouse or a person who has been a carer for more than five years and who is a full pensioner will not have to sell. Ninety per cent of people who go to a nursing home live alone before they need to go into that home. Most people have only one significant asset: their home. Most people will have no option. They will have to sell their home to get a nursing home bed. The minister has guaranteed that no-one will be forced to sell their home. Everybody on this side of this parliament will be keeping her to that promise. The money coIIected from these bonds must be held in trust by the nursing home and the proprietors get to keep the interest and an annual jraw down of $2,600 for five years-a tot.f $13,000. But of critical importance is the fact that the entry fee has to be paid up-front. That ,"" means people who need a nursing home bed and are living alone will have to find, according to the nursing homes, around $88,000 to get that bed. That is the price nursing homes are now saying will be the norm. Professor Gregory, the author of the Gregory report into 'the structure of nursing home funding, totally rejected entry fees as a means of raising the capital necessary for upgrades. After careful evaluation of entry fees as an option for capital raising, he wrote: The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to sell assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry. In short, he felt: .. , allowing entry contributions seems too harsh a measure. The Prime Minister does not agree. He thinks he knows better. He believes and has said in the parliament that his government's plan to make people sell their homes to get nursing home care is 'the repayment of a debt'. Prime Minister, on behalf of all of those who have written or spoken to me about this issue, I will let you know what they think. The people who have raised families, paid their taxes and battled the Depression and the Second World War feel that the debt obligation runs the other way. The minister has claimed that people need - not necessarily sell their homes; they could rent them out and use the rent to pay the bond in periodic payments. This will not.be an option for the vast majority of people because if you are a pensioner and the only asset you have is your home and you rent it out, you will be receiving income so you will lose your pension and be subjected to a new - daily fee. It is a false option that this minister has put before 'the elderly community. There is also considerable doubt as to whether the system of up-front entry fees will actually raise the money necessary for capital upgrades. The Department of Health and Family Services estimates that entry fees will raise $130 million a year, but not until the year 2000-2001. In each of the three years the amounts raised for capital for nursing homes will be considerably less than would have been provided under Labor. In 1997-98 the department estimates that only $26.1 million will be raised; in 1998-99, $72.3 million; in 1999-2000, $102.3 millii>n-considerably less than the average provided by Labor over the 10 years 1984 to 1994. A catch-22 also seems to exist in the bill. Only certified homes will be able to be charged an entry fee but, to get certification, homes will have to have a minimum standard of buildings and services, so will not be able to get the upgrades they need to get the capital required. This bill introduces a new daily fee. At the moment all residents pay 87.5 per cent of their pension. Now residents will pay 85 per cent of the pension and there will be an extra daily fee of 25c.in the dollar for those who have income above the pension-free area, up to a maximum of $60 a day. Nursing home residents wlio have to pay this new income tested fee will have effective marginal tax rates of almost 100 per cent. This measure will impact on the 35 per cent of residents who are part pensioners or self-funded retirees. All residents will be income tested by the Department of Social S-curity. Nursing home owners will have to collect the fee, effectively becoming tax collectors for this government and the recurrent care subsidies they get from the government will be reduced by whatever they collect in fees . The introduction of this daily fee will see divisions arise in nursing homes. Those who pay the extra fees will demand extra and better care. This is a recipe for two cl-sses of care in our nursing homes. It is further evidence of the government's muddle. The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, which represents a large number of private nursing homes, yesterday advised the government that dela}ls in applying the DSS means testing of new nursing home residents will mean that all new entrants will be invoiced for two months at the maximum rate of $63.30 per day. The association warns the government that this 'will result in a negative political backlash for the government' - an understatement, I would suggest. There are many other issues. Given the time, I will quickly move to the other signifi'. cant concern we have with this bill, which is the limit of the subsidy for concessional residents to just $5. The total inadequacy of this subsidy will inevitably result in a twotiered system of aged care, with good access and care for those who can afford to pay an entry fee and poor access and care for those who cannot. This low level of subsidy is one of the two main factors that will lead to a two-tiered system. The other factor is the upfront entry fee accommodation bonds. The $5 a day is ridiculously low because it has to be compared with what a nursing home will get from a resident who pays $88,000 in an accommodation bond. That is effectively the same as $20 a day-four times what this government is offering for a concessional resident. Nursing homes have made it clear already to the government that they will not be able to provide the same level of or access to care for all residents. For the representatives of older Australians, this figure of $5 a day has critically defined this government's total disregard for older Australians. I am sure the strength of their feelings has brought considerable discomfort to members opposite. A final unpalatable p:1int about this $5 a day subsidy, which the minister does not draw attention to, is that this is not coming from new money, from extra capital money from the government; it is coming from the pool of funds allocated for the care of nursing home residents. So it will actually reduce the money that is available for care. By contrast, Labor's capital funding was targeted, and targeted to those in need. We face a serious number of changes to the aged care system in Australia. Like the churches and other aged care groups, Labor believes that the bill is discriminatory and illforth. prepared and, like the churches, we believe that it must not pass through this parliament. For all these reasons we oppose this bill and will move a series of amendments both in this House and in the Senate to make this bill a fair bill, to make sure that we do not have a two-tiered system and to make sure that access to nursing homes is entirely on the basis of a person's health care needs-not on the basis of how much money they have. REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, 4 June 1997",17
14,Mr TONY SMITH,PAIRS,"Before embarking on what I was going to say, I think I should touch on some of the matters referred to by the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I was interested to see the motion for the suspension of standing orders in so far as it refers to a number of points in the Aged Care Bill 1997, on which basis the member was saying that the matter should be deferred. Fair enough, she referred to the $5 a day point, of which much has been made by the opposition. , Ms Macklin-And the churches.",22
15,Mr TONY SMITH,PAIRS,"Yes, and I will have more to say about that shortly. Her second point is agreed specific prudential arrangements for safeguarding residents' up-front entry fees. That is how strong her argument was for suspension of standing orders, a question of trust funds. That is how high she rates that. That matter can be attended to very simply, as the member knows. We have trust accounts that operate-solicitors' trust funds, prudential arrangements-which are quite simple to arrange, yet that was the major point that was raised by the member for Jagajaga. The third point talks about residential subsidy classification, instrument and arrangements for training staff in use. Is that really the major thrust of the opposition's argument about these measures? Then we get into the fOl.lrth point which talks a lot about matters in relation to establishing an independent body to monitor various things. That is how significant the matters are that are raised by the honourable member to defer these particular measures. Then we go to the fifth point, which is, again, some mumbo jumbo about accountability of the use of funds, and so It really is absolute rhetoric without substance. The only point that raises any substance at all is the first point, on which the government and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) have said they are prepared to continue talking with those relevant groups. It must be remembered that the government is already subsidising-on top of that $5-at $100 a day which the government pays for people to live in residential aged care facilities. It is important then to splice what was said in that motion to suspend standing orders with what the honourable member said along the way. In particular, she spoke a lot about real increased expenditure between 1984 and 1994. She made passing reference to Professor Gregory and it was perhaps just as well that she did. I am going to remind her what Professor Gregory said about what all that spending had not in fact done and had not achieved. In May 1994 Professor Gregory estimated that upgrading nursing homes to an appropriate standard would cost as much as $520 million. He attributed the problem directly to the nursing home funding system which was introduced by the Labor government in 1987. The Gregory report states: The lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock is a result of the funding system, under which nursing homes receive a set amount for each resident, based on resident which is the same regardless of the age and condition of the building. A further evaluation study of 150 nursing homes produced some alarming findings, including that 75 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards, 70 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet the Commonwealth outcomes standards, 13 per cent did not meet fire authority standards and 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds. Most honourable members who have had the misfortune to visit some of those rundown nursing homes and see the appalling conditions in which older people find themselves would realise that all of the overblown rhetoric about the real increase in spending in the 10 years is seen for what it is-just overblown rhetoric. I pose one other matter. It was said by the honourable member that really the figure is $88,000. Let me pose this question: is the opposition saying that Australian taxpayers should put money into the pockets of the beneficiaries of those old people when they pass away? Is that what the opposition is saying? No answer. Ms Macklin-Do you believe in death duties?",22
16,Mr TONY SMITH,PAIRS,"Answer the question. The fact of the matter is, the opposition's proposal is to put money into the pockets of the beneficiaries of these old people. That is what they are really saying, rather than the reasonable position of the Australian taxpayer, that is, a system of user pays. Let me tum now to the bill itself. The reforms that were announced in the 1996-97 budget will take effect from 1 July this year. They will align nursing home and hostel systems. The measures include a single resident classification scale which determines the level of subsidy for each person, relaxation of previous detailed acquittal requirements for nursing homes, income testing of residential care benefits, adoption of refundable resident entry contributions across all residential care and creation of an aged care standards agency. These measures have to be frailty, seen in the context of a very significant ageing population. The aged care program aims to provide care at a benchmark of 100 aged care places per 1,000 persons aged 70plus in my region of Dickson and also in the region of the adjoining electorate of Longman for which the honourable Mr Mal Brough is the member. That particular program is designed to amount to 86 places per 1,000 persons aged 70, which is slightly under the national average of 93 places per 1,000 persons aged 70-plus. Recently on behalf of the minister I opened the Inverpine Retirement Village, which is a 52-place hostel in the area of Murrumba Downs. Forty places have been built and construction is about to start on another 12 places. There will be a 12place special care unit. Inverpine Retirement Village also includes 32 self-contained units funded solely by the RSL War Veterans' Homes Ltd. There are a number other such places in my electorate for older people, such as the Maranatha Retirement Village at Kallangur, the Pine Woods Hostel at Lawnton, Albany Gardens Nursing Home at Albany Creek, Forest Place Retirement Village at Albany Creek, Keperra Sanctuary Retirement Village at Keperra, Madonna Village Nursing Home at Mitchelton, St Joseph's Villa, Mitchelton and Oxford Park Retirement ViIlage is also in the electorate. Ms Macklin-Who paid for those? Not the Liberals!",23
17,Mr TONY SMITH,PAIRS,"As I said, the population of Australia is not only growing, it is ageing. That is something that the honourable member for Jagajaga closes her eyes to. Ms Macklin-I don't close my eyes.",24
18,Mr TONY SMITH,PAIRS,"The eyes were closed for the period between 1984 to 1994, because in actual fact we need a $520 miIlion injection to improve the facilities in those homes. In 1971 there were a million Australians aged 65 and over. Now there are two miIlion. By 2031 there will be five million in this group. In Queensland about seven per cent of the population is aged over 65, and I am weIl aware of this trend in my electorate. It is interesting also to mention these figures: from across OECD countries the ratio of people aged over 65 to those in the work force is 19 to 100. By the year 2030, that ratio in Australia is expected to be 33 to 100. That is an alarming statistic, and it is important for all members to address that statistic. While it is not addressed we are going to have a continuing run-down in the nursing home system in this country. This bill is not about the government imposing a $26,000 entry contribution. The proposition is essentiaIly no different from that of pre-nursing homes. Those in their own homes have provided an investment. Their return is shelter and comfort. They pay their rates, electricity and other outgoings, including maintenance to the dweIling. Once they leave their own home, they require shelter and generally a far more intensive system of care. If you move from one house to another, generally you seIl your house and buy another house. That is all that is happening here under this bill. The government is not imposing a $26,000 entry contribution. Existing nursing home residents are not required to make entry contributions. Entry contributions are negotiated between the proprietor and the resident. As to the comment which rolls beautifully off the tongue of the member for Jagajaga about there being no upper limit in the fee, obviously it is market determined. That is the simple answer. Entry contributions are not compulsory. Full pensioners who have not owned their own homes in the past two years are not required to pay entry contributions. The government receives no portion of funds raised by entry contributions. Not all nursing homes are eligible to charge entry contributions. To be eligible to charge, facilities will be required to reach a prescribed government standard. The maximum amount deducted from residents' entry contributions has been mentioned many times as being $2,600 per year for five years, to a total of $13,000. The balance is held on account of residents and is refunded if they vacate the nursing home or is paid into the resident's estate. As to the size of the entry contribution, the resident must always be left with assets of at least 250 per cent of pension, some $22,000. Residents are not required to pay entry contributions as an up-front fee. There is six months before any contribution is payable. Residents who remain in care for less than six months are exempted from entry contributions. Individual nursing homes will determine their policy on whether to charge such contributions. If a person goes to a nursing home and pays a capital contribution as a lump sum to the provider, that remains on trust until the resident leaves. A similar system in hostels had been operating under the previous government for some years. Obviously, the contributions are protected and will be protected by a proper trust system, a prudential system, if the proprietor becomes insolvent. People on low incomes will be protected. They will not have to pay an entry fee if they cannot afford it. The government has to pay and will pay a higher level of recurrent subsidy to nursing homes to encourage them to accept financiaIly disadvantaged people as residents. Governments will ensure that pensioner couples whose only asset is their home do not have to seIl it when one of those persons enters a nursing home. There is no requirement for anyone to sell their home. The tactics of scaring old people in relation to this matter are really to be deplored. The purpose and direction of the legislation is that the changes will bring about a future regime of quality nursing home care, because of the very nature of the growing population. I say again and again that those statistics are quite alarming when we look at the fact that we are going to have those incredible increases by 2041 when one in three Australians will be over age 65. It is something that cannot be ignored in this debate. That is the whole basis for many of these changes. There will be safe, appropriate and comfortable accommodation. In trying to read between the lines of what the honourable member opposite said in her speech, there seems to be some sort of suggestion that the government wants to somehow frighten people out of going into nursing home care. Is the opposition suggesting that the government wants to lose many, many votes by adopting a measure that is anathema to older people? It really beggars logic to suggest such a thing. The user pays system will bring a better standard of living in institutions that have been run down. I have already referred to the comments of Professor Gregory in his report in 1994. It is important to remember that the situation did not occur in the last 12 months: it has been occurring over a number of years. While that is a regrettable problem we do, as a government, undertake responsibility to fix it. That is what is behind the legislation. The objectives of the legislation are to provide a funding injection to upgrade nursing home capital stock. That is important. It will ensure that those who can afford to do contribute and it will correct subsidy inequities between nursing home and hostel residents to protect the financially disadvantaged. In so far as fees and charges are concerned, full pensioners will not be required to pay one cent over the $26.05 that they currently pay. There is no income test on full-rate pensioners. The first $49 per week of non-pension income is exempt from the nursing home income test. People on part pensions, which amount to 25 per cent of residents, and those on private incomes, which amount to 10 per cent of residents, will be asked to make a modest contribution. The maximum that can be charged is an additional $34 a day but to reach this a person would need a private income of $61,000 per annum. So for a nonpensioner with a $500 per week income the daily increase will be from $26.05 a day to $42.15 per day. There will be a cap of $60 per day on the maximum amount that the nursing home or hostel resident can pay. It can be seen that those measures are reasonable in terms of the current climate of a blow-out in the cost and a blow-out in the aging of the population, which have to be addressed in some way. The way that is being proposed by the member for Jagajaga is to spend more and more money and put money in the pockets of the beneficiaries of people who pass away. But the attitude of the government is to make sure that the user pays and that those who happen to be in this sort of care get the best care available. The legislation provides a framework and a direction for one of the most important policy areas the country has to face; that is, the aging population and the capacity of the Australian economy to deal with this significant issue. In my view, the measures will upgrade accommodation and ensure better living conditions. They will progress the philosophy so neglected in the past of ensuring that those who can afford to pay do pay and that those who cannot afford to will be provided with a decent home in their later years. I commend the bill to the House.",24
19,Mr MCCLELLAND,PAIRS,"The senior members of our community are going to be very relieved after hearing the speech from my friend the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). He criticised the opposition, as indeed the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has done, for manufacturing a scare campaign. The senior members of our community are going to be very relieved to hear there was no need for fear or concern. The some 5,000 members of my electorate who have signed a petition expressing their very grave concerns about this bill are going to be relieved indeed tonight. They will sleep very comfortably because they have been told that the size of the entry fee-or entry bond-into these nursing homes is going to be determined by market forces. That is great news for them. This holy icon, a thing that never creates injustice and that always reflects equity, is going to determine whether or not they have to sell their homes. With respect, that is an outrageous proposition and one which will do nothing whatsoever to relieve the fear and concern that so many senior members of our community have and should not have. The member for Dickson indicated, at the commencement of his speech, that the notice of motion moved earlier by the shadow minister seeking a deferral of the bill, was without foundation. Let us leave aside the shadow minister's comments but let us consider the representations from the Aged Services Association of NSW & ACT Inc. They say, in a letter dated 3 June 1997: ... the Government's intention to debate the legislation in the Lower House in the absence subordinate legislation and without knowing whether the model can be viable can be no informed debate. They quite properly say that for there to be informed debate the minister needs to reveal: ... details on the new prudential arrangements, guidelines on the new classification scale, the of funding the new accreditation process, and how she will honour her commitment to review the effectiveness of the reform process. I will be paying attention to this debate and I will be curious to see how many government members can properly inform the House and the Australian people of those matters. Of course prudential arrangements vitally important. There are obviously going to be significant differences between those which are acceptable to the charitable sector and those which are acceptable to the private sector. For instance, will it mean that the charitable sector-the non-profit sector-is going to have to subsidise the profit sector? The member for Dickson knows the consethe quences and blow-outs caused contributors to a prudential scheme from the experience of the Law Society scheme, where the prudential insurance requirements are really quite exorbitant as a result of the amount of money which has gone astray. Will the charitable sector have to compensate the private sector for that money when, regrettably and inevitably, some of it goes astray? The shadow minister indicated her concerns about the absence of auditing requirements and the complete absence of detail as to the quality of care which will be provided in nursing homes-in particular, whether qualified nurses will be required to be engaged in those homes. Further, the minister has not got given any details at all about what the transitional arrangements are going to be for nursing homes which have currently either received or applied for funding grants under parts VAB and V AC of the National Health Act. A number have already made commitments and a number have already prepared their forward budgets, anticipating that existing capital grants will be paid and that contracts they have made-often with builderswill be able to be fulfilled. Are those connew tracts going to be frustrated because of this of legislation? The minister has not considered that, and those transitional arrangements are means that there of vital concern. The member for Dickson quite openly and an frankly said that this is part of the new regime, part of the government's new policy of the user pays-the user paying according to what cost has been determined by market forces, not what has been determined as a result of the needs of our citizens. That is entirely consistent with the National Commission of Audit report which recommended greater reliance on user charging and recommended not only entry fees but also exit fees. It remains to be seen whether that is somewhere in the are government's armoury for a later date. Mr Lee-Exit fees?",25
20,Mr MCCLELLAND,PAIRS,"Yes. The other point it recommended was the complete devolution to the states of responsibility in respect of nursing homes. As a result of the government's obsession with contracting the role of federal government, one wonders how far by defaul!ing away that may be. lt is dishonest of members on the other side of the House to use the hostel situation as an appropriate example for nursing homes to follow. The situation in respect of hostels is quite different. When someone enters a hostel it is a voluntary arrangement; they can negotiate, shop around and compare the service they are going to receive. As the Gregory report indicated, some 60 per cent of nursing home entries are straight out of hospital, frequently straight after an acute illness such as a stroke or some other form of debilitating disease. As the shadow minister indicated, 90 per cent of those people who are admitted live on their own, and the assumption that those chronically ill who live on their own have the capacity to go and negotiate one of these entry fees or bonds is nonsensical. They are at the most frail, most vulnerable stage of their life. Before they can get the care they require, they are being compelled to sit down to negotiate an entry fee with businesspeople who are, quite frequently, pretty hard-nosed. It will not happen. They are going to be victims of the whole process. To say that they have the opportunity of fairly negotiating the so-called fair market price is fanciful in the extreme. It will not happen, and it is unfair. I paid particular attention to the Dickson's comments-and indeed aCGPsatiens-that the Labor Party was favouring a situation where the money which will be taken out of senior citizens' accounts-and in many cases their homes-will not be passed on to their beneficiaries. In reality, what that statement amounts to is favouring what this in actuality is: a death duty. But it is a death duty that strikes only the chronically ill, the frail aged and the demented. It is not an across-the-board death duty, even if that was to be advanced by the government as an appropriate taxation measure. It is one which discriminates against, hits and strikes the chronically ill and the frail. That is, with respect, a really condemning feature of the government's position in this debate. The government's assumption that they are going to raise money for sufficient capital works is flawed. The best evidence indicates that at least 50-60 per cent of people will not be able to afford the nursing home entry bond. Mr Lee-Market forces!",26
21,Mr MCCLELLAND,PAIRS,"That will be determined by market forces. The experts say it will be close to $88,000 for anything closely resembling quality nursing home care. At least 50-60 per cent of senior citizens will not be able to afford that, and they will be competing for and negotiating for the 27 per cent of beds which the private homes are required to keep for those who are unable to meet the entry bond. This is unquestionably a bill which favours the haves and not the have-nots. The $5 a day payment for the disadvantaged is an affront. It compares to $19 a day which the nursing homes will achieve from the drawdown of the entry bond. In other words, there is a $14 difference. In addition, the wealthy nursing homes receive the benefit of interest from the capital bond which is paid into their account. As the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd said: The Federal Government's announced funding rates for residential aged care seem likely to foster a two tiered system of aged care in Australia. The problem arises because of the Government's completely inadequate supplementary funding for concessional residents who are unable to afford to member for pay an accommodation bond. Similarly, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association said: ... a shortfall of $14 ... on accommodation for financially disadvantaged people . .. is totally inadequate. The difference will see these people in multi-bed rooms in buildings that will reflect the disparity in funding. So we have a situation where the wealthy private institutions are in demand and, according to market forces, can demand the top dollar, which is predicted to be about $88,000, compared to the charitable organisations, which quite frequently take up to 90 per cent of their residents from disadvantaged groups. You are looking at a situation where nursing homes, for 90 per cent of those patients, will receive $5; whereas the wealthy private sector will receive, for some 73 per cent of their patients, $19 a day from the drawdown plus the interest that they are earning from the entry bond. If the government's logic is correct and the methodology behind this bill is to provide capital funding for nursing homes, why has the government not struck a figure of $13,000, which is obtained by multiplying $2,600 per year, being the drawdown, over the five-year period that those drawdowns are required? Why hasn't the government frankly said, 'This is our reasoning. We will require there to be a $13,000 contribution to capital assistance'? It has not because it is providing a windfall gain for private nursing homes which can benefit from the interest that they are earning from these massive amounts of money that are going to be paid into their accounts. One wonders whether this whole mechanism ha$ behind it a categorising intention whereby those who have the funds are able to jump the queue and get into the good nursing homes and those who do not have the funds are simply left in those multi-bed substandard accommodations which, as members of parliament, we have no doubt all entered into. The Executive Director of the Uniting Ministry with the Ageing, Mr Les MCDonald, said that the $5 contribution is really a poison chalice and that it is going to result in the charitable nursing homes being second rate, despite their best intentions. The other issue which is of concern to me, as a result of the member for Dickson's speech, is the government's obsession with picking scapegoats. Senior citizens are being chosen as scapegoats for our health costs, which it is argued are going to fall on younger people. Regrettably, that is· something which, if not already, is going to lead to intergenerational conflict. We are looking at a situation where younger people are not honouring the achievements of senior citizens-what they have achieved through their daily work and what they have achieved in fighting to represent our country in wars. Rather, there is aIJ obsession with looking at senior citizens as a burden. John MCCallum, in a recent article in the Australian, analysed this phenomena. He said: Since the arrival of the Howard Government in Canberra, the ageing of the Australian population is being more generally argued to make unsustainthat able demands on the health and social security systems. I will not go through his arguments, but I suggest to any member that it is worth reading. He shows that, while health care certainly is required by senior citizens, usually it required until the last year, possibly two years, of their lives. Suggesting that people over 65 are a burden is a gross misrepresentation of the actuality. As John MCCallum said: It is high time we got the story straight. If there is an intent to change health and welfare in Australia it should be argued on its own merits and not attributed to a fictional crisis of ageing. That is very much what this bill is about. I mentioned earlier that I have received in my office to date some 4,000 signatures, and I understand I have in excess of another 1,000 signatures, on a petition opposing the government's legislation. It is causing real concern in the community. The government >has not done anything to address those concerns. The lack of detail in the bill does nothing. The advice that whether or not someone is going to be compelled to sell their home is to be sorted out by virtue of market forces does nothing for confidence. From my point of view, it actually generates fear. The government has a really hot political issue on its hands that it is not addressing and which the minister has not appreciated. It is going to do absolutely nothing to increase the quality of aged care. The crux of, and falling back on, the old statement that Labor did nothing is false. Labor spent more than $1 billion over the past decade of its period of office on aged care. What nursing homes will get out of these provisions from the government is considerably less than that. As the shadow minister indicated, in the 1995-96 budget the Labor government introduced a $7 top-up in addition to the existing $8 per resident capital grant for any new or rebuilt nursing home, which was a total of $15. That $15 applied across the board to all nursing homes and compares to $5 for the charitable institutions as against $19 for the private institutions, in addition to the interest and the clear profit the more affluent private institutions will be able to receive as a result of the windfall gained through the use of the interest. The government has fundamentally changed the way in which we have administered aged care. It has in the past been administered on is not the basis of need. It is now going to be administered on the basis that quality care is to fall to those who can afford it. It is regrettable that aged care has become like buying a pair of shoes or, indeed, engaging a lawyer-that is, those who can afford to, get it; those who cannot, do not. (Time expired)",27
22,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (11.08 a.m.)What a riveting speech from the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), and he is a member of the Labor Party! I remember a time when the Labor Party believed that we should help the poor and the wealthy should pay their own way, but the new Labor Party does not believe that any more. The new Labor Party want their system where the wealthy travel at the expense of the poor, where the people who can afford to pay for their own care are subsidised by the taxpayer out' there on $30,OOQ with three children, paying a mortgage and struggling to make ends meet. That is who is paying for nursing home care for the wealthy at the present. This is the system that new Labor endorses. Old Labor would not have endorsed that system, except old Labor actually put this into place, didn't they? They put in a system where the wealthy were subsidised by the poor. At present, under old Labor's system, which is supported by new Labor, we could have a wealthy widow with $2 million and earning $140,000 a year. If she goes into a nursing home, what does she pay? She pays approximately $180 per week. What do the taxpayers subsidise her? It is approximately $480 a week, yet she has $2 million and is earning $140,000 a year. When she dies, who gets the $2 million? It is not the poor old taxpayer who has been paying the accommodation of this wealthy widow. No, her relatives get it. They say, 'Thank you very much' and, as they drive away in their Mercedes, they wave to that poor old taxpayer out there in his 10year-old car and say, 'Hi, we're doing very well, thank you. We just got $2 million. - Thank you very much for the $480 a week you have been contributing to granny's care for the last 10 years because, boy, does that make our life so much better now.' This is the system that old Labor has that new Labor supports. You do not want the wealthy to pay. You want everyone out there on the same level so the wealthy can come in and say, 'Good,' and take advantage. That is what you stand for. That is what the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) stands for. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) said he was suffering relevance deprivation syndrome. It is not only him; it is the whole Labor Party because you guys no longer know what you stand for. After 13 years in government, you have thrown away every principle that you ever held as a party. You are out there in the wilderness right now saying, 'What is it we believe in? Find us a policy.' But you cannot find yourself a policy because you no longer have a philosophy. So what do you do? You attack because the only thing left for you to say is, 'We know what we'll make our policies: whatever the government does, we will say it's wrong and that way we will look relevant.' But, I have to tell you, you do not look relevant. - ou just loo- like a lot of negative, carping no-hopers. Go away, get yourself a philosophy and then come back into this House. When you come back, have a look at this legislation, which has brought some sense into the aged care industry, and argue then because, when you know what you stand for, you might be able to look at this legislation and say, 'Good, it has done some things that old Labor should have done and that new Labor approves of. It has made people who can afford it pay for it.' What did the member for Jagajaga call it? She called it a tax. She said that making people pay who could afford to pay was a tax. Could the people opposite, the member for Barton or the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), who I believe will be following me in this deba.te, explain to me what a tax is? I always thought a tax was something the government put on you as a sort of added impost to help run the country. When you paid for a service you actually received; that was not a tax, that was what you were paying for. When I pay rent, or when anybody else pays rent, that is not a tax; it is rent, for heaven's sake. So do not call it a tax. It is not a tax. It is simply asking people to pay who can afford to pay. The people who cannot afford it will not be paying. Mr Lee-Do you say it's rent? r lrs GALLUS-No, I said, 'When I pay rent'. I did not say, 'It is rent,' I said, 'When I pay rent'. The pensioners out there will not be paying any extra. They will be paying 85 per cent of the pension and they will get care equal to the others. They will be paying 85 per cent of the pension, and those who can pay more will pay. They will have the pension area plus $49 per week free. That is why this is a fairer system. Those who cannot afford to pay do not pay. Those who can afford to pay do pay. Mr MCClelland-And get better care.",29
23,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"They do not get better care; they get the same sort of care. It is the same sort of system that you have in your hostels. Isn't this great? They could do it in the hostels under Labor and that was fine, but now do it in the nursing homes under the government and they say, 'That's terribly wrong because what we did was right and what you did was wrong.' Get yourselves a philosophy. Get yourselves some policies so you can stand on something and be consistent. Come into this House with something you believe in and pick out what is good in legislation. Then people out there might start to listen to you when you pick out the negatives, because then they will not say, 'Oh God, it's just those Labor people again. They criticise everything.' They will say, 'They said that was good and that was good, so maybe when they pick out this little bit they could be right.' At the moment, you are so busy knocking everything that people out there are not listening. Start picking out what is good and maybe the voters will listen to you, and maybe the government will listen to you, because we want good legislation. If you have some constructive ideas, instead of the carping and the negativity, we are going to listen because we want what is best for the Australian consumer and for the people out there. The member for Jagajaga came in here and quoted her own report, saying what a great system Labor had, what a fantastic system Labor had. Let us have a look at what the Gregory report said about Labor's fantastic system. It said that 70 per cent of nursing homes needed upgrading. Good system! It said that 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds. Mr Deputy Speaker, is that the sort of nursing home system you want in your country? What else did the Gregory report find? Small or insufficient bathrooms and toilets, lack of lever taps and shower seats, small rooms, inadequate ramps, lack of wheelchair access, multi-storey homes without lifts-the same multi-storey homes without lifts that the member for Barton referred to and admitted were existing under his government's policy. The report also found there were insufficient fire standards, toilets not large enough for walking .frames or wheelchairs, too few toilets and inadequate heating and coolingcold in winter and hot in summer. This is old Labor's system of nursing homes, the system that new Labor wants to keep. The report also found rooms with no external windows, and inadequate kitchen and laundry facilities. I especially like this one. The member for Newcastle might like to answer this one and tell me if the nursing homes in his area have this: dirty laundry and food delivered through the same chutes. That report gives us a really great picture of nursing homes under the Labor government that the member for Jagajaga was so keen to support-getting out her quotes to praise Labor from fellow travellers and also choosing some quotes to condemn the government. But, of course, this is a game we can all play. I owe these quotes to the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), who would have liked to get them in his own speech but unfortunately could not, so I have the fortunate chance of quoting them for him. The first quote comes from the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals. It states: The introduction of an entry contribution for those that are able to pay such a contribution will overcome the matters long outstanding regarding the need to address the urgent capital upgrading of nursing homes. That is exactly what we have been sayingthat nursing homes under old Labor, nursing homes that new Labor want to perpetuate, were in a terrible state. That is why this government has introduced accommodation bonds, the accommodation bonds that the member for Jagajaga has continually criticised. She almost says that the accommodation bonds this government has brought in are the work of the devil-the same accommodation bonds that the hostels have introduced under Labor. What else does the member for Jagajaga say? She says that Mr Lee-Don't you like her?",30
24,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"It is of no interest whether I like the member for Jagajaga or not, but I wish she would do her job properly. It would be a great asset to this parliament if the member for Jagajaga would do her job properly. That would get better legislation out there to the people. We were talking about the accommodation bonds and how they have been introduced under Labor. We have the member for Jagajaga going around saying, 'Isn't this terrible? People might have to sell their homes.' Well, what is so terrible about that? If I move from where I live now and I go into different accommodation, I sell my home. It is what we do when we move on. So what is so terrible about somebody selling their home to go into a nursing home? Guess what? This is what people had to do under Labor's policy. Under Labor's policy, if you were a pensioner and you moved into a nursing home, do you know what happened ? Your home was assessed as an asset for the purposes of the pension. So what happened then? Your pension dropped, you did not have any money to live on or to pay that 87.5 per cent of the pension for that accommodation. So what did you do? You sold your house. Under Labor, you were forced to sell your house when you went into a nursing home, yet it is Labor that is coming out and saying, 'This is terrible. Under accommodation bonds they may have to sell their own homes.' It is exactly the same thing they had to do under Labor. Nobody will have to sell their home if they have a remaining spouse and they will not be required to pay an accommodation bond unless they have more than $20,000 left over. What is more, all they will take down out of that accommodation bond is $13,000. What about the people who do not have money for an accommodation bond? There are 27 per cent of places around Australia reserved for people who cannot pay accommodation bonds. That is the guarantee of this government. This legislation introduces a system that looks after the poorer people and asks the people who have the money to pay for what they can afford. It is a fair system, it is an equitable system and it is a much better system than that which we have at present. Under the present system, how can anybody deal with a CAM and SAM-that ridiculous system that divided the care, the food and the housekeeping? What a stupid system that was. We have got rid of that system and all the bureaucracy that went with it. That bureaucracy meant that the staff in the nursing homes, instead of looking after the residents, had to sit down and fill out forms saying, 'I clean resident X's teeth today. I scrubbed for two minutes on the right side and I scrubbed for two minutes on the left side.' That was what they were required to do under the bureaucratic system that Labor had in place. I refer again to the papers that the member for Dickson gave me. I will read another quote, seeing that we are into the game of our quote against your quote. The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association states: Reductions in bureaucratic interference and great funding inflexibility in the residential aged care program should provide aged care consumers over time with a greater choice amongst better aged care facilities and service providers. This legislation should be regarded as something quite revolutionary. The minister is to be praised for her courage in looking at the system as it was and saying, 'This system is bad. Let's start again and make it better.' It is a revolutionary thing to do and a very courageous thing to do. That does not mean that, as time goes by, we will not find some flaws in the detail. That happens any time you try to make things better and you bring about a huge change. I know that the hostel owners in my area have some concerns. I hope their concerns will b- addressed and that in the end they Nill be totally happy with this legislation, because that is what we are aiming for. We are aiming to get the best possible legislation for all the people in our community, because the elderly people in our community have served this community all their lives. What they deserve in their declining years is proper appropriate care. They deserve nursing homes where they do not have to lie in beds with four or five other people in the room, some of whom are extremely ill. They deserve to go into homes with facilities other than a cramped corridor with one television. They deserve to go into homes where food and dirty laundry are not delivered in the same chute. That is what this legislation aims for. It is saying to the people of Australia, 'We will take care of you in your old age. If you can afford it, we will ask you to pay, but if you cannot we will not expect you to pay.' At the end of the day, what we will have is a much better system, a much more equitable system that old Labor had that new Labor wants to keep, a much fairer system that old Labor had that new Labor wants to keep and a much simpler system that old Labor had that new Labor wants to keep.",31
25,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,PAIRS,"It is very easy to recognise when the government is on a loser: they get shrill, they get hysterical and they filibuster. Quite frankly, I think of the comment about sound and fury signifying nothing. I want to talk about old Liberal and new Liberal for a little while. Old Liberal left my electorate with the legacy of a pensioner living on dog food so that he could pay the fees for his wife who was in a nursing home. She had been there for eight years, and every year the fees went up, way above the pension. He was spending $45 to $50 out of his pension to keep her in a nursing home. He was eating dog food because that was all he could afford. Mrs Gallus-How many years ago was this?",32
26,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,PAIRS,"That was old Liberal. I will give a second example. I had a meeting in 1983 with a group of families who had family members in a particular nursing home in my electorate. They came to me to tell me their concerns with the nursing home and its problems. I note that the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) asked a lot of questions but does not wait for the answers. There were a lot of problems with this particular nursing home. These people asked what we were doing about that. As honourable members know, the licensing of nursing homes is a state responsibility. I will come back to that in a moment. About a fortnight later, the aunt of one of those people who had come to see me to complain about the quality of care in this nursing home had been taken for a shower and had been put in the shower by a young woman who was on work experience. When she turned on the tap, the hot water tap did not work. So she left the old lady sitting on a chair in the shower with the tap turned on but with no water and went to find some help. Before she came back, the hot water came on. That old woman was scalded and died. There was a coronial inquest into that case, but the fact is that the young woman cannot be held responsible because she was not a trained employee. She was not a nurse. She was a source of cheap labour. That family had been to me a fortnight earlier complaining about the level of care. That was old Liberal. Old Liberal also put in capital funding for nursing homes. A week or two ago in Newcastle, new Liberal-from the federal department-told a group of carers and concerned residents that the federal government was not responsible for licensing and that any concerns about the quality of care would be a state matter, because licensing of nursing homes was a state responsibility. There is something in common with old Liberal and new Liberal. They are both now saying that it is a state responsibility. The system of accreditation brought in by the Labor government in an attempt to lift standards had forced standards to rise and the system of controls on costs brought in by the Labor government, which controlled costs and set maximum costs, are both being dissolved by new Liberal and new National. But there is one big difference. New Liberal and new National have cut the money. This is not about nursing home care. We have heard all that nonsense and pap about systems and how much better it was. This should be part of appropriations, not aged care, because it is about money. Last August the government announced that it was going to save $244 million on capital funding to nursing homes. It also announced that it was going to save $253 million on recurrent funding for nursing homes. In other words, in those two figures alone, there is a billion dollars worth of savings. Somehow we are being told over here that this is about improving the system and somehow the cutting of those funds will make it better for everybody. This government in this legislation is ripping half a billion dollars out of the aged community and their families. That is what it is about. This is budget stuff. To come in here and say that this is somehow making the system better is palpable nonsense. It is worse than that; it is deceitful, misleading and totally hypocritical. This undermines and guts what has been a fairly decent system in world terms. Given the increase in the last 10 or 15 years of the number of people requiring nursing home care and given the massive increase in dementia that we have suffered as a society, our system has coped better than most. We have not had the granny dumping we have seen in America. On a recent visit to Europe, asking the Europeans, particularly the British, about their aged system, they said they were all looking at ours as one of the models that was much better than theirs. There is another cut which is also important-that is, the $70 million to $80 million cut to home and community care. That is very relevant. Home and community care is a system that helps support people living at home, so they actually have choices. Post1982, post the MCLeay report, the Labor government introduced a three-tiered system. It was way overdue, but a system driven by the need for more spending and a system driven by the need for differentiated care. The home and community care negotiations with the states were incredibly complex and it took an awful long time to get all the states to agree to a common system. Even then, there were massive weaknesses in it, partly because of state peculiarities and so on. Since 1984-85 there had been constant difficulties with measuring and monitoring. The parliamentary inquiry that I chaired in the previous parliament, which looked into home and community care, focused on those difficulties and has proposed and recommended a lot of half improvements, which, by the way, are all being ignored with the attempt by the current government to devolve all of it to the states. It is not even back to before the old days-it is back to the prehistoric days. The fact is that with these changes to nursing homes what is going to happen and what is happening right now is that the aged in our community will want to stay at home for longer. They are saying to me now, 'I don't want that to happen.' We may get granny dumping but we will certainly get granny squatting-people staying at home because they do not want to go into a nursing home and lose the family home, the home that in so many cases has all their memories. The loss of that is the loss of their life. We will get granny squatting and we will be looking for more and more in-home services. This government, which is supposed to be improving, is putting more and more pressure on home and community care by discouraging people from going into nursing homes. This is a clever trick, mind you, because the demand for nursing homes will now drop. People will say, 'I don't want to go.' The euthanasia debate has some relevance here. I think all honourable members will know that people are saying, 'I will die first.' You know it, Mr Deputy Speaker, and you all know it, because you are all picking it up, which is why you are so hysterical in this debate. It is why we are getting from those opposite the repeating of nonsense and falsehoods, which is so exaggerated. The demand for nursing homes will drop simply because people will not want to sell their homes and they will feel that the government does not want them there anyway. The sense of devaluation that this legislation is causing is enormous. Do not underestimate it. It is only just starting. At the same time as you are doing that, you are also cutting home and community care funding by close to $18 million as well. So you are putting more pressure on the home support system and then cutting the money. What kind of improvement is this? In the unanimous report in the last parliament we called for more funding for HACC, not less. We called for better integration between the systems, not less. We called for more Commonwealth responsibility, not less. I should also point out that under old Liberal, old National, pre-1983, the provisions for young disabled living in the community were also inadequate. During the period of the previous Labor government we saw a massive shift of young disabled out of institutions and into the community. When I was first elected the number of young people who were required to live in nursing homes because there was nothing else available and the demand for that was much more than it is now. But, more important, the de-institutionalisaquarter tion programs meant the Commonwealth put funds into housing for the young disabled. Those funds have now been transferred to the state as part of the Commonwealth-state disability agreement, but do not underestimate that shift. A substantial amount of money that was previously available for nursing homes which were housing the young disabled has been transferred to the states, as part of the disability agreement, where the states are now providing accommodation. Mind you, that will all shift as well with this new regime of getting rid of all responsibility. We will see the Commonwealth attempt to move all responsibility to the states, including that for the employment of young people with disabilities. When this new system of paying an upfront fee was first announced in the last budget-and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) talked about it being $26,000my comment at that stage was that that is a joke, a charade, and that has been my comment ever since. It costs between $70,000 and $80,000 to build a nursing home bed. The idea that somehow people can pay for a bed or that it would be viable to have a $26,000 up-front fee deposit was always a falsehood, was always deceitful, was always aimed to mislead-as was suggesting that it was not really a major problem, that $26,000 was not all that much. We have now heard the figure of $88,000, but I doubt whether it would be that eitherthe figure I have always said is between $80,000 and $120,000-for a couple of reasons. One is that a substantial number of people die within six months of going into a nursing home because in many cases they have been discharged· from a hospital after suffering a major stroke, for example, or another major medical episode. A substantial number of people die within a very short time, which means the fees are not applicable. So not only is the problem that a number of people have no money; it is also that a lot of people do not live long enough for a nursing home to be able to recover costs. So, if you are going to take away the Commonwealth contribution-that is, the of a billion dollars in capital being ripped out of the system-as this legislation will do, you will need more than $26,000 upfront, and even more than $88,000. As interest rates go down, the up-front fees go up. Just think through the earning capacity of nursing homes. Firstly, residents have to live for five years for a nursing home to get $13,000, which is the maximum that can be drawn down from the deposit. Only the minority live that long. Secondly, the interest on the up-front fees is the only other source of revenue to build new beds-in other words, capital funding. So, as interest rates decline, the up-front fees will in fact increase. So for $100,000 we are talking about $4,000 or $5,000 a year in interest, and that is the only money available. So the capital required to put in a bed will be serviced by the deposits of the up-front fees. Now the government is talking about a compulsory 27 per cent of people not being required to pay up-front fees, but it is offering $5 a day extra. Five dollars times 365 is $1,800 a year. That is the interest on $50,000 at best. Where will the rest come from? That - does not service the cost of putting in a new bed, let alone maintaining it. The fact is this will run down our system. This will degrade our nursing homes. Talk to any nursing home proprietor. Talk to anybody who is actually involved in the system. When the government announced this proposal it gave the impression that access to up-front fees was going to be an extension of the scheme, it was going to be an enhancement, it was going to be an add-on to what was already there. Of course, the nursing home community said, 'This is great. We need more money,' and many of us said that we had no philosophical or ideological objection to those who can support themselves doing so in some form. But that was not what was being done. What is happening with this legislation is that the government are raising half a billion dollars from these people. That is what this is about: raising half a billion dollars to replace the government withdrawal-and that is apart from the cuts to HACC, which also requires user charges. And I am sure that many members opposite are now finding that those are not very pleasant and, in many cases, are absolutely and totally impractical. I suggest they read the report from the parliamentary inquiry into user charges to find out what we proposed and see whether it is being done. I can assure them it is not. This is about saving half a billion dollars. If it does not work-and I am sure it will not because it will not provide the half a billion dollars unless fees are well over $lOO,OOO-then the nursing home stock will actually run down further. The problem we faced when in government was a substantial expansion in the numbers requiring nursing homes. Our massive investment in hostel care, which, quite frankly, was barely available in 1983, our substantial involvement in funding the HACC system, which was not there in 1983, plus our expansion of nursing homes were still not enough to meet the demand. The Gregory report was correct, because the other part of all that was the shift in levels of expectation and, as I mentioned earlier, the de-institutionalisation program. People were being transferred from hospitals and institutions to nursing homes. They were shifted from the state responsibility to the Commonwealth responsibility. That does not show up in the figures because that was never measured, but we all know it took place. So what we have here is a recipe for disaster. And why? Because it is not policy driven. It is driven by the budget. It is driven by finding half a billion dollars in savings in what appears to be a large, fat, lucrative area where money can be cut. That is what it is about. What we have heard since then has been an attempt to justify why that cut would occur in this area and not somewhere else. The aged of Australia and their families are saying, 'Why us?' The idea that somehow it is equivalent to hostel entry fees is absolutely deceptive, misleading and very nasty. People who enter hostels have some choice about their lives. The equivalent of this nursing home up-front fee is not hostels but hospitals. People do not choose to go into hospital. They are admitted on medical grounds, because they are required to. People go into nursing homes because they are required to; there is no choice. This is not a question of choosing one or the other. There is no choice. You are giving them the choice of a nursing home or death. That is the choice you are giving them, and it is becoming very stark. The more you talk about this being an improvement, the more you will reinforce the devaluation of our aged community and the more they will see themselves as a source of money. They will not give it to you. They will die first. That is what they are thinking and that is what they are saying. We did not create this problem. There is the idea that somehow we created this problem. The fact is that in the last budget you announced a half billion dollar cut to residential aged care support. Once you announced that, you caused a problem. The more you deny it and pretend it is about improving the aged care and residential care systems, the bigger the hole you dig and the more y:m devalue our aged community. This is a nasty bit of legislation. It is discriminatory and it is vicious. But it is not about social policy or aged care policy; it is about budget policy. It is about a government that is more concerned with dollars than with people. It will lead to a running down of the aged care system, it will lead to granny squatting and it will lead to a massive lack of confidence in our aged care system. We had a system that was one of the world's best. We are heading for a system that will be one of the world's worse. As those opposite smile, laugh and carry on, the aged of Australia are watching them. They understand. Make no mistake: being old does not make you stupid. These people are not stupid. They know the situation Members opposite should talk to the pensioner organisations and the caring community. They understand this stuff very well. They are very aware of what you are doing. Do not patronise them and do not take them for granted, because they know that this is not about helping them; this is about cutting money out of the budgeL The more you say it is about an aged care policy, the more they realise how hypocritical you are.",32
27,Mr MCDOUGALL,PAIRS,"In addressing the Aged Care Bill, I remind the House that health services and aged care are two of the fastest growing federal costs since the mid-1970s. I do not believe there is a person on either side of this House who does not acknowledge the need for major reform to protect the future of the ageing members of our community. The tragedy is that the system this government inherited had not seen effective change for over a decade. The results are clear to see. Nursing homes are in crisis. When this government took a look at the nursing homes throughout the nation, it met with an unpleasant shock. Eleven per cent of our nursing homes do not meet fire standards, 15 per cent of nursing homes do not meet state health standards and 40 per cent of nursing home patients are in four-bed or more wards. Recently a Health and Family Services senior officer advised me that, under the previous government, the department did not check the physical standards of aged care . facilities. This was never part of the standards set and is a most serious failing of the exist. mg system. There is an imbalance in not just the funding for aged care facilities but also the type of facilities available. The Aged Care Bill is the first step along the path of improving the security and lifestyle of our aged. The Aged Care Bill is a package. It is not a quick fix solution. It creates an environment to generate funds into the nursing home sector. At the same time, it ensures that access to quality care is based on care needs, not on the means to pay. This major reform to aged care abolishes the two-tiered aged care system and replaces it with a focus on the type of care very well -""needed by residents. To ensure all hostel and nursing home residents receive appropriate care, this bill introduced a new funding structure which applies to all residential. aged care facilities. The eight different care categories range from low care to high care levels and, in particular, dementia care. This ensures all residents of hostels and nursing homes will have their care needs assessed and met. At the same time, this bill eliminates the significant overlap of care between hostels and nursing homes. This bill also addresses the all but ignored residents who have dementia. This reform means residents needing dementia care will benefit from an increase in funds by over 30 per cent. This government recognised what the previous government ignored: the need for a minimum capital injection of $125 million a year to the nursing home sector. The previous government's aged care proposal was for $12.9 million-a shortfall of well over $100 million. No-one pretends major reform is going to be fast. But this new strategy is a powerful start. The Aged Care Bill is a reform package which will not only allow the nursing home sector to rebuild and offer quality aged care but also eliminate the confusing difference in fees charged by hostels and nursing homes. Under the new system, all residents will pay a standard daily fee based on 85 per cent of the age pension. The income tested fee will apply only to income above the pension-free area, which still stands at $49 a week above the full pension. Due to the inequity of the hostel versus nursing home system, we have seen a gradual decline in the standards of nursing homes. Hostels charge entry contributions. As a result, they have had that extra capital and have been of reasonably good standard. Nursing homes, on the other hand, lived on a hand-to-mouth existence, and it shows. To address the situation the government has allocated a substantial capital funding program to assist those facilities which need help. Forty million dollars is available over the next four years. It is expected that these funds will be used by nursing homes with a high proportion of concessional residents. A major key to this bill is the funding to be injected into the nursing home sector by accommodation bonds. That entry contributions have been a way of life for hostel residents has been accepted by the community. Therefore, I am amazed that the opposition, led by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin)-fast becoming known as the shadow minister for scare-has spent weeks terrorising our mature age citizens with empty threats that this will mean that they will lose their homes. They will not, and neither will it spouse, close family member or long-term carer be expected to leave the family home if one member goes into an aged care facility. This has been declared publicly by the Minister for - amily Services ad infinitum. There are many other provisions in this bill to protect those who pay accommodation bonds, provisions which are rarely touted in the press by the opposition. For instance, people who can afford to pay a bond will not have to pay a lump sum up-front but have several options, including periodic payments. Those who have no assets or income will have a place in an aged care facility. This reform locks nursing homes into setting aside a national average of 27 per cent of peds for concessional residents. Those who cannot care for themselves will be cared for by this government. This leads me to another one of the opposi tion' s favoured scare tactics-that nursing homes are to receive only $5 a day for concessional residents. What the opposition fails to mention is that this is an additional $66 million injection into the nursing home section. The former government had planned to do the same thing but were only coming up with $3. It is also in addition to the existing daily amount received by all aged care facilities for concessional residents. This reform will for the first time in a decade adequately address the capital funding crisis in nursing homes. I do not believe it is unreasonable for those who have assets to be income tellted when they choose to go into an aged care facility. Nor do I believe that the community disagrees with the principle that it is much fairer for people to draw on their savings to pay for their own care rather than expect the taxpayers to do so. The people of Australia are already burdened with the debt of $10 billion that Labor left this government with. This government has no intention of plundering those taxpayers' incomes any further. People are used to selling one home to move on to the next. So why not do so when they choose to move into a nursing home and adopt the special care that goes with that lifestyle? We all have to acknowledge that, while the over 65-year-olds comprise only 12 per cent of the population, they absorb 33.5 per cent of the health budget-and that was in 1990. In the next generation, this will reach 50 per cent. This is not unique or unexpected. Only the previous Keating government sought to ignore the needs of the slowly crumbling nursing home system, which has now reached this crisis point. The previous government had the same figures to hand but ignored the fact that our baby boomers are only a decade from retirement. Demographers can tell us with deadly accuracy that, by the year 2030, 20 per cent of the population will be over 65. The young will have to work doubly hard to support them. To coin the old cliche, two things are certain in life: death and taxes. I will adjust that to say that two things are certain in life: ageing and taxes. I recall vividly a documentary I saw many years ago on the life of eskimos. In that harsh environment, when the older members of the family could no longer contribute to its survival, they walked out onto the ice, sat down and died. Fortunately, our environment is not quite so taxing and we still enjoy life to the fullest in our senior years. The senior members of our community are also able to continue to contribute to their families and to the community due to the advances we have in health and care. This government recognises the true value of extended families, of grandparents and greatgrandparents and the urgent need to address the ongoing matter of their care. This reform also paves the way for simplicity for providers. In setting the path for a single national rate of subsidy, we will dramatically reduce the red tape and paperwork for the operators of our aged care facilities. In essence, hostels have worked on a single national rate of subsidy and have always had the responsibility for their staffing mix and how they spend their government subsidy. We are doing the same thing in the nursing home sector. They will still be accountable and must adhere to strict standards, but these will certainly be a vast improvement on what we inherited when we took government. In too many cases, residents have had to endure unacceptable living conditions. The opposition will argue that they did put checks and balances into place, but the facts are plain to see. The aged care system we inherited focused on minimum standards of quality control. This will not be the case in the future. Providers who do not meet high standards will be out of the industry. The blame does not lie with the nursing home providers but with the system which did not offer any recognition for providing quality care. Dementia care, for example, was most certainly not properly addressed. This aged care reform addresses the all important issue of special care for those with that special need. Funding for dementia care will increase by over 30 per cent on average, providing much needed support for both dementia specific units and mainstream facilities. But possibly one of the greatest areas of change has been our reforms in recognising the different and varied needs for people turning to aged care facilities. In creating new classification scales for the different levels of aged care requirements, hostels and nursing homes will be funded accordingly. The system we are introducing is simpler and far less complicated than the old system. Professor Bob Gregory's 1994 report to the former government recommended that $125 million a year needed to be spent to bring nursing home infrastructure costs up to an acceptable level. The former government's response was to allocate $10 million a year. These funds had to be spent on staffing, infrastructure costs and all other ongoing expenditure. The aged care system we inherited focused on minimum standards and was a mess of bureaucracy and red tape. Not only was there a minimum standard of quality controlwhich some providers have been straddling with only centimetres to spare-but there was no recognition, as I said, of good quality care. Therefore, there has been no incentive to be the best care provider. That the previous government gave little or no thought to aged care reform is evident in their so-called aged care reform strategy of their last 10 years in government. This revealing document does not even fill one page. In fact, Labor's aged care reform strategy covers just eight short paragraphs with 207 words. They are delivering more words in objectinto this government's major reforms-reforms which ensure aged care facilities will be accountable to both the government and the families for the levels and quality of care and accommodation they provide. This reform will create the environment for the right care for the right reason, and it cannot be written off in less than a page, as Labor managed to do. I support the bill.  with the honourable member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) when he said in speaking to these aged care bills that there are two things that are certain in life-death and taxes. And what we are dealing with today is a tax. In fact, you might say it is a premature death tax. The member for Griffith made great play of Labor's policy at the last election. Madam Deputy Speaker, please offer me indulgence and allow me to read into the Hansard record exactly what the coalition's policy was at the election and see if we can recognise the difference between their policy at that time and this bill. I think you may find one or two differences. Their policy stated: The Coalition's aged care policy will: . enable people to choose to stay in their own homes for as long as possible ... What a laugh. It continued: provide a range of residential and community based aged care services which offers real choice to older Australians and their familiesproviding they sell their home. And: provide genuine support for residential facilities caring for people suffering from various levels of dementia . . . I acknowledge that the government has done something about that. It finished: ensure residential care services meet the standards that are acceptable to the community; adopt a more flexible approach to the provision of residential care, including alternatives to residential care, in rural and remote areas; and recognise the worth of all sectors of the aged care industry charitable commercial sector proprietors and organisations have expertise, and a common interest, in providing the highest possible quality of care for frail older Australians. Where in that policy does it say that frail older Australians-not because they desire nursing home accommodation but because they require it-have to pay an up-front fee for it? Where is the consistency in what the coalition and the government backbenchers said before the election and what they are jumping up now in a sickening way to support? Madam Deputy Speaker, you might not have seen it, but the ACA has issued a press release asking all members of the Houseopposition members and government members-not to let this legislation through. The ACA is the peak body. Do you know what the press release says? It says that, notwithstanding dialogue with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), dialogue with her advisers and dialogue with the department, the ACA is still unclear about the implications of this bill and there is still too much detail that is up in the air. The ACA asks all government members and all opposition members not to pass the bill. I cannot say that I am an expert on the legislation. I think it is probably the worse bit of legislation, the worse budget measure, that the coalition proposes to enact. I have to say that I do have reservations about the legislation, but I am influenced by that press release and I will be opposing this bill. I want to pay tribute to the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay)-not something that I often do in this House. I notice the shadow minister taking note of thisMr Stephen Smith-And the minister.  (Mr Fahey), who is at the table. It is true that when John Howard was the Treasurer the honourable member for Watson chaired a parliamentary committee and delivered a report into this House. I think it has been one of the most important reports that has been tabled by a parliamentary committee. It is certainly something that the honourable member for Watson and other members who served with him on that committee can take a great deal of comfort in. The title of the report was In home or at home? When we won office in 1983, it was this report that laid the Labor Party's foundations for the HACC program. That was the genesis of the HACC program. The idea was that we ought to allow our frail aged in the community to stay in their own homes for the longest possible time. Not only is that common sense for them and a desirable outcome for them but also it makes good economic sense. In our 13 years in office, we had a very structured approach to aged care. We had the HACC program, allowing more of our older Australians to enjoy their own homes, to enjoy their neighbourhoods and have the familiarity of their own surroundings. We had hostel accommodation for the aged. You do not have to have a medical conditions to get into a hostel; it is an issue of choice. When an aged person's frailty was such that they could no longer be supported either in their own home or in a hostel, we had nursing homes. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you fully appreciate the fact that it did not how much money you had, if you were assessed by ACAT-the aged care assistance team-which comprises medical experts, nurses and social workers, as requiring ing home care, you were given a place. It not matter if you had two bob in the bank more. I notice that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) has said that we supported millionaires in nursing home accommodation. That may be true. If the legislation needs to be tightened up so that millionaires do not take advantage of that, let's tighten it up. But let's not punish all aged Australians because of some millionairbenefit es. We introduced an assets test when we in government. The present government bitterly criticised us. One of the things we did was to take millionaires off the sion. But we did say, 'Your home is sacrothat sanct.' We excluded the home from the assets test. But what is this government doing? dealing the family home in. The government says that, if your spouse is at home or if you have got a carer living with you, you do not have to sell the house. That is true, that is in the legislation, but tell how you find a nursing home place if you not sell the house. What do you expect private providers to do if they have the opportunity of getting even more than the $26,000 that you say this premature death will be? I think everyone now concedes that it is going to be in the order of $80,000 $90,000; they undershot the figure by 300 per cent. If a proprietor can get hold that sort of money and keep the interest draw down $2,500 a year as opposed to taking someone who does not own a home someone who wants to keep the family home, are they going to take the $90,000 or nothing? Left to the marketplace--competition, operatWe ing for profit-what do you reckon is going to happen? We all know. Notwithstanding this legislation, frail aged Australians who have struggled a lifetime get a home will be forced to sell their home to get a nursing home place. That is what this legislation means. That is what you are asking matter us to vote for, and we will not. But the government members are going to get up and say how terrific this legislation is, notwithstanding what was said in 1996 by John nursHoward and what the Minister for Family did Services is introducing into this place now. or What a lot of hypocrisy. What a lot of flipflopping. What a lot of inconsistency. How cruel this is to our frail aged Australians. As ACA, the peak organisation, says, there is still a lot of uncertainty. What are the prudential requirements? I know that the Moran corporation is friendly with the Liberal Party, that it employed former Senator Woods frail as a special adviser and that you are the of this inside information about how private operators operate and what they need were and how this can be made more profitable-I understand that-but when one of our elderly that Australians has actually sold their home and penpaid this up-front fee how do we guarantee it will be protected, that it will always be there, even if there has been a degree of fraud It is or malfeasance? What is the method of protection? What is the method of ensuring that it is properly in trust and always there? The honourable minister at the table is a former solicitor. Solicitors have trust funds me and they are regularly inspected. Notwithdo standing that regular inspection, read the Daily Telegraph, read your local paper, and time after time you will find situations where solicitors have improperly used those funds tax and the solicitor's fidelity fund has got to make up the difference. What is going to to happen to the proceeds of an elderly about Australian's home-that $90,000-when a of proprietor skips off maybe not with the and proceeds of just one home but with the proceeds of quite a number? That is a huge or sum of money. You don't have to have too many residents before you get close to a million dollars. What is going to happen then? do not get the answers in this bill. What the people of Australia really want and what elderly Australians want is to make sure that members of parliament are genuinely to concerned about their needs. They do not really like us bickering, but I must say that it is the individual elements of this bill that make me so passionate about it. What are we going to do to help them? Ho.w can we improve the situation? I am not gomg to stand up in this parliament and say, 'Labor had a perfect system. Nothing could be don- to make it better.' Of course there were thmgs that could make it better and they are the elements that we should be discussing. Yes, we do need better nursing homes. Yes, there should be some incentives for proprietors to improve their homes. But I would be gr.ateful if the Minister for Finance would outlme to the House the competitive elements in this bill that actually force proprietors, particularly these private providers, to improve the nursing homes. If you look at the policy speech that John Howard took to the last election, he did not say that he was going to regulate standards. In fact, he promised self-regulation. You c-n drive a horse and buggy through it. There IS nothing in this bill that ensu-es, mandates - r requires nursing home propnetors to put. thiS money-this premature death tax-mto improving the homes. As knowle-g-able as the minister at the table, the Minister for Finance, and his department are, they will tell you that private providers can drive a horse and buggy through this legislation be-ause they will be able to utilise this money Without improving the nursing homes. From time to time governments do need to make significant changes to policy. I - m not sure that this is one of those occasIOns. I think when you make an intergenerational change like this-that is, you are getting just one sector of the community to leap into a new system-you should have a signific.ant transitional period. If this is what you thmk is so necessary, understand that they need to save and marshall their resources so that they can afford it. The point about this legislation is that there is not going to be one extra nursing home bed as a result of it. Not one. The Labor Party, when in government, justified HECS on the basis that we would take the money and provide extra university places. It was very unpopular at the time and it probably caused more angst on our side of politics than an-­ where else. We said, 'It is a new charge. It IS not full cost recovery, only partial cost recovery. But what we are doing with every dollar we collect is to expand the system.' And we did-massively so. However, that is not happening here. What you are doing is clawing back about half .a billion dollars worth of government expenditure. You are putting less into the system than we did. Not only are you asking our aged Australians that they pay-and pay with their homes-for this up-front so-called accommodation bond, variously estimated at $90,000, but you are not guaranteeing in the legislation that nursing homes will im-rove. You are not guaranteeing that there will be extra beds. I know people on the opposition - ide - re going to be constantly frustrated by listemng to government members, as I was when. I listened to the honourable member for Gnffith-I wish I could have been spared that but it is part of my responsibility-becaus- - hey are going to say ad nauseam, as the minister does, 'We may have promised to do a lot of other things and we're sorry we didn't tell you about what we really wanted to do wh-n we went to the last election, but really all thiS is about is hostel accommodation. Labor had this system where you would pay a fee to the hostel for a place. All we are doing is j.ust translating that from hostels to nursmg homes.' Let me repeat the major point: hostel accommodation is about choice. People could stay at home through the HACC progra-, which I mentioned earlier. My own mother IS in that situation. She is contemplating whether she will continue on at home or whether she will go to a nursing home. It has nothing to do with any medical condition or her state of health; it is an element of choice. But people do not choose to go into nursing homes. They have to be properly assessed. There is a compulsion about nursing homes. It is about time government members, when th-y are talking about these vulnerable Austrahans--:our frail aged community who have contnbuted so much to this country to make it what it is today: a place we, the younger generations, can enjoy-said with a bit of honesty what it is that they are doing. The government, unfortunately, was totally dishonest at the last election. John Howard was totally dishonest in his aged care policy. I have already read it to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I am sure you are more familiar with it than I am. There is not a hint in that of these draconian measures or this particular draconian bill. I think our older Australians deserve better than that. From time to time the government members have rather viciously attacked our shadow spokesperson, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). She has had a tough job having to speak up, as she has consistently, on behalf of our older Australians. I would encourage her to continue to do so. You are putting this draconian legislation through, and probably going to ram it through the Senate at the well, but it is going to put the Labor Party in an awful position when we come back into office. Surely there are some compassionate members on the government side who will read the press release of the ACA and who will have second thoughts about the impact of this measure on older Australians. Maybe they will not do it in the debate-I would admire them if they did-but perhaps they will take to the party room their real concerns. My electorate is characterised as a young electorate. Compared to other electorates, like that of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, for example, mine has a very small elderly population. But, like my friend the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), I wrote to my constituents about this measure because, as I said, I think this legislation as it impacts on our frail aged is the most draconian bit of legislation that I have witnessed as a federal member. I invited my constituents to sign a petition. We have already lodged several hundred of those petitions, and it is taking us a great of time to collate them all. But, overwhelmingly, when people have rung up--and quite a number of them have-they have said, 'Thanks for bringing all this to our attention. We didn't understand it.' It is not just the frail aged who are concerned. Their relatives are concerned about what the impact is going to be on their aunt, their grandmother or their mother. They are horrified. And in my electorate lots of them do not have homes to sell. In conclusion, this is a measure which is going to make a system of health care for the wealthy-they will have no trouble accessing it-but is going to deny the poor and those who have saved for a home their life savings, of which a home is the major part.

28,Mr VAILE,PAIRS,"It is a pleasure to support the Aged Care Bill that is before the House today. The government is not prepared to accept the amendments that will be moved by the opposition. We certainly had an interesting exercise this morning with motions being moved by the opposition to delay the debate and change the focus of the debate on this bill. It is interesting to note that some of the opposition speakers-the previous speaker,  ed-have referred to this legislation as a draconian measure. It would be fair to say that people in the community are always a little reticent about change, and what is being proposed is a major change from the way we have been used to doing things in the aged care system and the provision of aged care services in Australia. One of the earlier government speakers mentioned the SAM and CAM systems that have been in place. The former government instigated the Gregory report and did not take much notice of it after they did it. This government has recognised a need to reform the provision of aged care services in a sensible way. The previous speaker alluded to some of the peak bodies and the comments they have made. I might draw the opposition's attention to a media release that was put out earlier this year by ANECA, the Australian Nursing deal Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd. In that, the Chief Executive Officer was quoted as saying: Overall, the new aged care legislation delivers incentives for aged care service providers to strive for continuous improvement in care standards and upgrade accommodation standards. Isn't providing a better standard of care for the aged what this debate is all about? The former government's policy revolved around provision of beds. There was an announcement recently of more nursing home bed capacity being available for the Great Lakes area in my electorate. A number of different institutions put in submissions to get that allocation of beds. The focus has been on beds whereas the focus should be on the needs of the people in the community. At the other end of my electorate, in the Hastings area, people who have been assessed through the ACAT team there as needing nursing home care outnumber the number of beds available, and so we have the situation where there are 52 people in the Hastings district on the waiting list to get access to nursing home care. Unfortunately, in regional Australia that quite often means that, until such time as beds become available in the local area, those people have to travel to the city to receive nursing home care. That puts an enormous strain on the family and on the people who need the nursing home care themselves. Recognising this, the government has bitten the bullet in introducing the reforms contained within this legislation to try to address the problems in Australia and the increasing demand-and that is a very important and sobering statistic-for nursing home accommodation as we look towards taking this country through to the tum of the century. I refer to an article which was in the Financial Review earlier this year headed up 'Nursing home plan is sound'. It went on to say: For all the sound and fury emanating from Canberra over the proposed charges for new entrants to nursing homes, the Government's policy is a sensible response to a difficult problem, one that procrastination will only make worse. Procrastination is what we experienced from the former Labor government. This article went on to say: Australia is greying, with the percentage of populacase. tion aged over 65 projected to grow from 11.2 per cent in 1991 to more than 19 per cent by the year 2030. The article went on to say: . . . it is much fairer that people be required to draw on their savings to pay for their own care rather than that they expect taxpayers to do so. ""losers"" from such an arrangement are, of course, the potential heirs of nursing home residents. But they have no reason either, to demand that taxpayers continue to subsidise nursing home care merely to protect their inheritance. The article went on: But Australians must come to terms with the fact that there is no bottomless well of ""government"" money. The alternative is taxes to the user-pays principle. This country suffered from that high tax regime for the last 13 years of Labor. The government is taking this opportunity to extend to the nursing home sector what Labor started in the hostels sector of aged care services by way of a user-pays system. Labor's record on aged care is not all that exciting when you look at some of the statistics. Under Labor, 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet fire standards, 15 per cent of nursing homes did not meet state health standards, and 40 per cent of nursing home patients were sharing rooms with four or more patients. The ALP created a two-tier aged care system. Hostels, with the changes that the former government introduced, were of a good standard because they charged the entry contributions. The nursing homes became increasingly of a poorer standard because they relied on government funding. Dementia patients were not receiving adequate care and funding. The ALP arrived at the last election with a fairly thin policy in this area. The government's reforms aim to provide residents with comfort, dignity and security in their most frail years, give incentives for providers to rebuild and refurbish nursing homes and ensure that access to quality care is based on need, not on means. One of the furphies that has been perpetratecl around the community in this debate has arisen from the Labor Party's putting about the proposition that people with lesser means will not have access to quality care. That will not be the In addition, the reforms will deliver simplicity for providers, make providers more accountable to residents and families and address the capital funding crisis. That is all based on two elements: firstly, accommodaThe tion bonds; secondly, the focus on concessional residents. Concessional residents are those people in the community who cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond. They will still have access to nursing home care. A targeted percentage of the community will get access. Nursing homes must allocate a national average of 27 per cent of beds to financially disadvantaged or concessional residents. Some of the nursing homes in my electorate will probably have a higher percentage of concessional residents than 27 per cent. The flip side of the government's commitment to pay the concessional residents' supplement of $5 per person per day is that there will be an increase in income for a lot of those establishcare ments that have a higher percentage of concessional residents already in their nursing homes. One of those providers has already contacted me, after reviewing the latest information that we have been sending out to the electorate on the reforms in this area, and indicated that they will have an increase. Remember that Labor offered only $3 per day for capital upgrading only to hostels, not to nursing homes, and so there is that balance. There is an equity issue being addressed with the provision of the concessional residents' supplement to nursing home providers; that is, it is the broader tax paying community who should be assisting in the provision of nursing home care to those people in the community who cannot afford to pay the accommodation bonds. That is what this supplement is all about. If it was not there, or if it was of a lesser amount, as Labor had proposed, then the burden of providing that nursing home accommodation to concessional residents would fall mainly on the accommodation bond paying residents in that establishment alone, not on the broader tax paying community. With the $5 concessional residents' supplement being paid by the government, it is the broader tax paying community that is shouldering the responsibility of ensuring that concessional residents, those people who cannot afford to pay the accommodation bond, have access to, and the opportunity for, nursing home care when they need it. When they need it is when they have been through the assessment process with ACAT. As I have said, at one end of my electorate 52 people are on a waiting list to access nursing home care. A lot of those people, because they are in need, will end up spending a period of time in maybe Newcastle or Sydney, a great distance from their loved ones and carers. That is certainly not a satisfactory situation. The issue of equitable access for concessional residents is one that has been raised by the opposition and one on which the government has gone to great lengths to get the message out to the broader community. This government wants people to have access to according to their needs, not their means. That is stated quite clearly in the policy. The Labor Party has been peddling a lot of half-truths and untruths about the financially disadvantaged not being protected. This bill contains stronger protection for these older people than Labor's scheme did. These protections are demonstrated by four key facts, which need to be spelt out very clearly in this debate. One, aged care assessment teams will continue to approve people for entry to care based on their need, not their means. Two, people who cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond will not be asked to pay it, and this will not affect their access to care. Three, every nursing home and hostel will have to take a set number of concessional residents. The target will be 27 per cent of nursing home and hostel residents on average nationally. That will vary from one area to another. Financially disadvantaged areas, which is quite often regional Australia, may have a higher percentage of that. Numbers will be set in each region according to local need, and penalties will apply to providers who do not meet these targets. Four, the government will pay an extra supplement of $5 a day for these residents. This means providers will have a financial incentive to care for their residents, and the burden of providing those places will fall on the broader tax paying community. The broader tax paying community acknowledge that the provision of care for those in need and those financially disadvantaged in the community is a responsibility of the taxpayer and that, equally, people who have the financial means to contribute to their nursing home care have a responsibility to provide that. That falls on the families of people in need as well. It has been clearly set out that there are going to be protections in the legislation for those who are financially disadvantaged, for those pensioners whose only asset is the home, and the spouse is still living in that home. It is very important that we highlight that fact during this debate. Another interesting element that has arisen, particularly in my community, is the level of the accommodation bonds, and I know that in the ruckus here this morning there was mention of a figure of $88,000. I am not sure where the opposition has picked that figure up from, or whether it is an indicative figure of the replacement cost of a nursing home bed, but obviously there is no set ceiling. One nursing home provider in my area, which is a community based organisation, has indicated that it will not be charging an accommodation bond, which is interesting. The other element of that part of the debate is the fact that, although the accommodation bond is paid to the care provider, it is a bond: it is put in trust and will be refunded, less the $2,600 a year over five years, to the person receiving care. So the maximum that is being paid by the resident is $13,000. A lot of people have not come to terms with that and have not understood that because of the misinformation that has been peddled around in that regard. I have gone to great lengths in my electorate to explain that to people. On the subject of the accommodation bonds, the guarantee that must be received about the expenditure of those bonds on improving accommodation must be fairly explicit, and the bill is explicit on this point that amounts derived from the bonds must be used for the service. This is clear and transparent. Furthermore, the bill forges a clear link between accommodation bonds and improvements to accommodation. This link is called certification. To charge an accommodation bond, a service needs to meet certain building and care standards. To demonstrate this, all services will be inspected using an instrument that assesses the building in terms of safety, security, privacy as well as other key points. For the first time, consumers and providers can be confident that a service charging a bond meets appropriate standards. This represents a clear and open benchmark, something that has not existed. The intent is to raise the past standard progressively over time. This means a provider will need to continue investing in their building to make sure he or she can continue to charge bonds. This is a real improvement over Labor's hostel system. Labor did not stop providers charging accommodation bonds for substandard accommodation. Labor did not specify that bonds must be used for the service. This bill will do that and will do it in a measurable way so that we will ensure those standards are kept to and the benchmarks are adhered to. I draw the House's attention to some of the comments that were made by the previous speaker with regard to the support that has come from the peak bodies. He alluded to the fact that there was no support. I mentioned an article in the Financial Review and I mentioned a media release that came from the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd. In closing, I will quote from a media release that has come from the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals, which is headed 'Structural reforms for aged care mean a better deal for all'. It states: The ... Chief Executive Officer said ... Some strong measures had to be taken to address the urgent capital upgrading needs of nursing homes in order to ensure the future accommodation of Australia's aged. The Government in its legislation has provided more than adequate protection for consumers and through user pay systems surrounding the accommodation bond will ensure funds are available for upgrading for the future. A couple of the peak bodies involved in providing nursing home services in Australia have indicated publicly their support for the reforms. I will finish where I started. Australia, as far as change is concerned, is traditionally a fairly conservative nation. Australians are fairly wary of change. They take their time coming to terms with change, understanding change and getting to understand the benefits that will flow. Over time, the Australian people will come to terms with it. I know this government is proposing a lot of change. We had to after 13 years of a lot of inaction in a number of different areas by Labor both economically and socially. Importantly, this government is focused in this area on providing care based on needs, not means. The financially disadvantaged in our community will certainly have access to the nursing home care that they expect and deserve. We are going to ensure that it will continue into the future on an equitable basis.",42
29,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"I rise today to draw the House's attention to what can only be described as further evidence of the Howard government's abandonment of its responsibilities to the Australian people since the government is abandoning the most vulnerable in our great society-they, of course, being the most sick and the elderly. I rise today to condemn absolutely the government for the introduction of what are no doubt unspecified up-front fees for nursing home patients because this action, coupled with the $577 million in cuts to funding in the 1996 budget, indicates that this government is nothing less than morally bankrupt. The government is embarking on, in my view, nothing less than a wholesale privatisation of the aged care sector. It has no policy direction in this area. It basically has a 'let the market prevail', 'let it rip' type attitude. In doing that, it somehow hopes, perhaps forlornly, that the difficult problems it is not prepared to address will somehow be sorted out by a benevolent private sector. For the elderly residents of Isaacs, of course, I hope that the substance and the guts of this aged care bill, being what they are, cause the bill to fall on its face. I would like briefly to remind the House of the absolutely disastrous situation in which aged care was left the last time the coalition set policy for this sector. In the 26 years of coalition federal government from 1954 to 1983-of course, those three years of cherished Whitlam government interrupted that period of coalition rule-the other side of the House managed to create a system that was nothing less than poorly managed. It was littered with regional inequalities and was badly focused on the provision of nursing beds as opposed to general care issues. Let me briefly offer a summary to the House of the MCLeay report into the aged care sector. The report highlighted the poorly coordinated provision of community based aged care services, which everybody knew about but about which the coalition did nothing. One of the issues identified in the MCLeay report was the absence of a national organisation representing community care groups. While I do not blame the government for this, it is nevertheless a fact and a key issue detailed in the report. The second issue identified in this report was the relative generosity of financial provisions for the construction of nursing homes as compared with community care services. This resulted in an imbalance between community needs and government and private sector provision. The financial disincentive for state governments to involve themselves in the development of community services, which required the state government to match the Commonwealth funding, was a third key factor identified in this MCLeay report, which in some way was indeed much too kind to the coalition for its so-called efforts in policy terms in this key policy area. The report should have said that the coalition has never come up with decent policy in this area. I will refer briefly to the joint review of nursing homes and hostels conducted back in 1986. It was more explicit in its criticism than was the MCLeay report. The joint review identified a number of issues. Among them were the haphazard nature of program development for aged care services, the excessive concentration on institutional care as opposed to community and home based care, and the failure to develop adequate assessment procedures. The fourth issue identified was the lack of coordination between the various levels of government and the fifth and final key issue that this report identified was the inefficiency of the prevailing funding mechanisms. This report highlighted that, in 26 years of federal government, the coalition hardly got anything right. This is not just a slight criticism but a comprehensive repudiation of this government's ability to set policy direction and spend money appropriately. This is nothing less than a joke. I know we have the minister telling us that she is now intending to undertake a major reform process in the area. I can envisage the major industry participants wishing for another term of Labor to sort out the mess that this government is in the process of creating. In the past 29 years, every time there has been a major crisis in aged care services it has required, as in most other policy areas, the introduction of a Labor government to sort the mess out. In extended terms of government, you on that side of the House simply lost the plot in this key policy area. Harking back momentarily to the Whitlam era of 1972 to 1975, at that time Labor had to introduce controls to the expansion of nursing home beds due to what were then massive cost overruns and the over-provision of these services as opposed to hostel and home and community care services. The Whitlam government also had to sort out the many regional inequalities and inequities that those opposite had created prior to the Whitlam government coming to office. In the Hawke-Keating years similarly, the Labor government had to continue its efforts to redress the imbalance between the provision of nursing home beds and hostel places. The Hawke-Keating government had to act to increase the provision of respite beds in hospitals and in nursing homes. It also had to act to increase the provision of home and community care in broadly general terms. It appears that it is always those on this side of the House who historically have had to foot the bill for the incompetence of those opposite--{)r, more correctly, the public has had to foot the bill and those on this side of the House when in government have been the ones who have had to implement the necessary change. We assumed control of an industry which could only be said to be characterised by uncontrolled growth and, simultaneously, uncontrolled cost. It was also characterised by grossly inefficient regulation. Labor increased spending levels during the term of the HawkeKeating government from $1.2 billion in 1985-86 to $2.6 billion in the 1993-94 budget for this key policy area. It would be quite easy for me to go on and on listing Labor's achievements in this field, but I will spare the House because I would like to discuss in some greater detail the bill currently before us. To date, all this government has done in the field of aged care is to rip money out. A list of what I have called K-Mart Costello's cuts includes a cut of $244 million from capital commitments and the removal of $253 million in subsidies from nursing homes for care. This one looks as though it may have some sort of ideological bent in that it will reduce the number of nurses caring for patients. The coalition has also enacted a $72 million saving by introducing user charges for home and community care services. These cuts were reduced in the last budget with the background of the Gregory report, indicating that there was a requirement of capital funding of about $500 million, mainly in the nursing home area. Instead of allocating more funding to the aged care sector, this government in its wisdom decided to remove a further $244 million specifically from capital outlays and introduce a user pays system, as suggested in the National Commission of Audit. This user pays system is obviously poorly directed at meeting the shortfall of 20 per cent in the provision of the home and community care services, as identified in the joint submission by the Australian Health Care Association and others. At the growth rate of some 2.7 per cent per year of persons requiring HACC services, those on this side of the House are looking forward to addressing this shortfall of 40 per cent by the time the Australian public repudiates the initiatives of this mean-spirited coalition. The coalition's alleged justification for introducing this bill includes a couple of key points. The first is the capital shortage identified above and the expectation that a user pays system will furnish the capital funding that is required. The second is that there is some impending prospect of a blowout in the number of persons requiring nursing home beds. That is perhaps difficult to understand when the numbers suggest that the number of people requiring assistance will actually decrease. There will be a decline in those numbers over the forthcoming 10 years. These justifications appear to be nothing less than a beat-up with the specific purpose in mind of simply cutting costs. That path is one that has been well trodden on many occasions before by the federal Treasurer (Mr Costello) and his Victorian counterpart. I want to draw the House's attention to the bill by summarising some of its ill-considered measures. The first of those is an uncapped entry fee for nursing homes with an assets test which includes the family home. As the  out at quite some length, when Labor introduced the assets test, the family home was sacrosanct; the family home was exempt. Over 90 per cent of people entering nursing homes are single. Those entering nursing homes will have to dispose of their house and make other very important decisions whilst they are sick. Furthermore, over 60 per cent of those entering nursing homes arrive from acute hospital care service facilities. You really could not pick a more unfair or worse time to ask people to make such important decisions and to undertake negotiations with the management of these nursing home facilities. Perhaps the minister could have some of her former colleagues provide inhouse advice to sick and infirm people. Another ill-considered measure of this bill is the fact that it provides a formula for the entry fee which potentially will result in all persons having sold their house and being left with $22,500 in assets, with the remainderwhatever that may be-being placed in a trust fund-again, as put quite lucidly by the member for Chifley, at the mercy of solicitors and lawyers who are the trustees of these funds, some of whom on a regular basis are proven to be less than honest in their management of such funds. These funds have no prudential requirements, as the member for Chifley has pointed out. We on this side of the House are expected to trust the same people who appear daily in the newspapers under crime columns having abused the trust that people have placed in them to manage their money honestly. I am sure that the aged, the elderly and the infirm would be even more vulnerable than the majority of Australian society if they placed their money in the hands of unscrupulous solicitors. The third ill-considered measure is the fact that it provides a policy which is supposedly based on the assumption that more capital funds will be available for nursing homes with this up-front fee but with no legislative requirement directing nursing homes to spend money in this particular way. This could potentially be as useless as Mr Howard's savings package because there is no net benefit, as the Secretary to the Treasury quite clearly pointed out yesterday. Another key issue of concern for those on this side of the House is that of a supposedly reformed sector characterised by the growth of a two-tier health care sector-one for the rich and one for the poor. Those places which cannot meet certain standards-that is, those which cater for the poor-will never receive payments for the capital upgrade so they will remain in a poor state. As the shadow minister at the table, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has pointed out in her contributions to the House earlier this year, some wings will get orange fruit drink but those funded by the more wealthy health care recipients will receive orange juice. This is a catch-22 situation. Obviously this will affect many members of society. Indeed, it will have a negative impact on the church and those other not for profit providers who are at the forefront of delivering aged care facilities to those most in need and to the needy.",46
30,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,They do it now; you don't understand.,48
31,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"I want to quote an initial comment from Mr Les MACDonald of the Uniting Church New South Wales Synod. He recently stated: I am concerned that the scene is set for the development of a two-tiered aged care system, where those that can pay will have access to excellent, modem facilities and those that can't will be housed in increasingly older and inadequate aged care accommodation. Perhaps the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who is from the same state as Mr Les MACDonald of the Uniting Church, might keep that quote in mind when he makes a contribution to this debate after me. Another major issue of concern in this bilI is that it has a lack of specified auditing procedures for those involved in providing aged care services. Some of these industry participants are even suggesting a self-audit. One can only think of the potential horrors that programs like A Current Affair and others would be able to televise in that regard. It also facilitates an unspecified ratio of paid to concessional beds which will be needed to be provided by each nursing home. So, obviously people from some suburbs wilI have to search far and wide for a place because of the unknown quota of concessional beds which may have been met in their local area. This heinous and draconian bilI also provides a policy based on the ridiculous premise that nursing homes and hostels provide the same service, a misconception that is still perpetrated by many of those opposite. Hostels are for those persons looking for security and a little assistance in a community environment, while nursing homes arc clearly for the sick. The minister must think they all look like hotel rooms. This bilI is yet another recipe for the coalition to repeat the massive failures it has created so often in the past. It is a government bereft of vision and ideas. It has no direction. Indeed, it is very similar to the voter reaction to Mr Howard which was identified in recent polls by the Bulletin magazine. It will not be long before the coalition parties decide to move on these sentiments and ask 'K-Mart Costello' to fill this massive void. When we return to address these present and future messes-potentially as soon as the next election-we intend to follow the same basic principles outlined dishonestly when the minister introduced the bill to the House. Minister Moylan said on 10 February this year: I circulated a statement entitled 'Steps to Better Care'. This statement detailed the government's commitment to a new era in the provision of residential aged care in this country, based on dignity, comfort and security for all. What we would need to return to, after these vandals have had their go, is the reintroduction of dignity, comfort and security of accommodation to the industry. There are many ways, which the shadow minister has outlined, which show how Labor would do this. Those on this side of the House fully support the work that she has done in this area in challenging a minister who has perpetrated nothing less than a scare campaign and misrepresentation of the true facts. I am sure that the petition opposing this bilI signed by 5,000 members of the electorate of Barton is reflective of the true views of modem Australia.(Time expired)",48
32,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"Mitchell) (1.03 p.m.)There is one thing I cannot understand about the Labor Party's attitude in this debate. If the Aged Care Bill 1997 is so bad, so crook and so oppressive for the elderly and the aged around Australia, why don't they just let it go through both houses and let the government reap the whirlwind? Surely that would be a tactic-providing they make all the claims and the statements they are making now, making sure that they are covered-to allow this process to go through without change or amendment. I invite the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), if she is serious, to consider that process. I do believe that it is not really the opinion of the Australian Labor Party that this thing is so bad after all. Otherwise, why would they be delaying, why would they be attempting to put back this program, using all the techniques of the House and the Senate to delay and set aside legislation that is sorely needed for the care of the aged in Australia? I do believe that their real purpose, their real goal, is not one that they are saying. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are a very direct and straightforward individual, that you would not be ensnared by a process such as this. But I do have to bring to the attention of the House the fact that I consider the comments and the tactics of the Australian Labor Party to be dishonourable. They are not honest in the way in which they are handling this process. The shadow minister at the table and the opposition are using the processes of the House of Representatives and the Senate to have the introduction of sorely needed change delayed. If they were serious in their criticisms, if their concerns were justified and could be demonstrated and if all of the statements of the shadow minister, to every 'i' and to every '1' , proved to be exact, then this is an horrific piece of legislation that no person of conscience or compassion would want to foist on the aged people of Australia. Therefore, they would want the Australian people to see how heartless and thoughtless the current government is by allowing the process to be enacted. But no, that is not what they are doing. They are not allowing this process to be enacted. They are not allowing these processes that they consider heartless and poorly thought through to be implemented. They want to make changes. They want to debate for hours. They want to have the Senate go on for years with committees and all sorts of processes to get, they say, this legislation right. I do not believe that is the true motive of the Australian Labor Party. The true motive of the Australian Labor Party is a backward looking process, and because of the shadow minister's previous professional involvement with the formulation of policy, she just wants to stick with the past. She does not want to make changes. She wants to say, 'What we did 18 months ago was right. What we did five years ago was right. What we did 10 years ago was right.' If the opposition were a constructive organisation in its approach to this process, it would adopt constructive approaches. But its approaches are not constructive; they are destructive and delaying. So I put it to the House that the opposition, instead of wishing to see changes made for the benefit of the elderly, are using the elderly, in this instance, as a political ploy, a political process, to suit the goals and objectives of the Australian Labor Party. The complaints; the statements of how poorly constructed this legislation is; what terrible consequences it is going to have for people who are in aged care facilities or who are contemplating going into aged care facilities: surely these must be exaggerations. Otherwise, there would be a more constructive approach to getting results from the Australian Labor Party or, on the other hand, they would let this legislation through and let the government reap the whirlwind. I want to tum to the details of the legislation because the government has adopted a twofold approach. I think it is imaginative and suits the needs of the elderly. It is a process which provides certainty and funding. The two streams of activity are these: first of all, to bring a consistency and simplicity of administration and provision of care without confusion and without difficulty to aged people, that is, by consolidating the nursing home accommodation with hostel accommodation and letting the assessment of a person's condition or needs be the sole criterion about what sort of accommodation they would receive. The Australian Labor Party, when they came to office, had, they said, too many nursing homes. So what they did was to not fund nursing homes but to fund hostels. That became difficult and expensive so they then allowed hostels to extend the services that they offered and the hostels of today are more like the nursing homes of 10 and 15 years go because they are allowed to do practically anything. The average length of stay in a nursing home today is six months. They are places where people really just spend the last few months of their lives. They are not there in the true sense as nursing homes, but because of the pressure of funding on the Labor Party governments over a period of time, they had to reclassify the activities of both nursing homes and hostels. So nursing homes became places where people were almost at the point of terminal illness-very ill indeed. One would hope that many people come out of those nursing homes well, or at least better, but the fact is that on average they stay there six months before they die. Hostels have become places where the treatment and care that are given are similar to that formerly given in nursing homes. Care for the aged was a budget driven process; the decisions that were made were purely budget driven. That was the way the Labor Party administered care for the aged; that was the result of their activities. Paul Keating was all about budget driven stuff-pulling the levers, getting the figures, having glasses overflow and bringing home the bacon. That was the Keating style of operation. We are changing that. We are saying that you cannot be an artificial division. Let us identify the problems that people have and give them the appropriate treatment at the appropriate level. What could be more sensible and better geared to the needs of individuals than that? That is the first step. The second step-the second stream of activity-is to assist people where possible to deal with their increasing age in their own home. Here I refer to what I think is a far-sighted program: community aged care packages. People are provided with what amounts to hostel care by professionals in their own homes. This is going beyond what is considered domiciliary nursing care-somebody blowing in for an hour or two to help somebody wash or to administer their medicine or to have the community aid person come round and clean their house. It goes beyond that. The assistance provided through the community aged care packages will be personal care, shopping, housework, laundry, lawn mowing, after hours emergency care, meal preparation, monitoring medications, bill paying, minor maintenance, assistance with transport to medical appointments, and respite care. Those are some of the services that CACPs are offering. That is a comprehensive service akin to being in a motel. It is akin to being in a hostel, yet you have the backup of professional services. The largest single provider of CACPs happens to be in my electorate: the Anglican Retirement Villages. They are a fine organisation. It is all very well for members of the Australian Labor Party to say, 'The poor won't get looked after,' and ask, 'What are your prudential arrangements and how do you coordinate the whole thing?' They are obviously completely unaware of how things actually work. The Baptist homes trust-I know my friend at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), would have some familiarity with them, and with the Anglican Retirement Villages-are a most ethical and caring organisation. They are working on the internal cross-subsidy process right now. People who can afford it pay; those who cannot do not pay. That is exactly what the caring institutions of Australia are running now. But it is going to be formalised by the process that the government is using. It can easily be done, and those compassionate and worthwhile organisations are doing it, so why should everybody not do it? That is what the minister is saying. Why should the wealthy not pay for the poor in their retirement-what is strange about that?-and in the provision of capital input, the buildings and backup services that are needed. Until a person reaches that point, the process is there of providing community aged care right in their home in an extended way which more resembles the hostels of old. People are more comfortable staying in their own home. They would prefer, right to the ultimate, to stay in their own home. They would prefer to have the freedom of inviting their families at weekends. They would prefer the independence that being in their own home offers. In many instances in the past under Labor policies services were not provided in the home. People were forced to sell their homes because they could not get the care they needed in their own home. We are saying, 'We will give you care in your own home. We will help you have a dignified aged lifestyle. We will assist you with all the backup services we can offer by professionals.' If they have the assets, people can then sell their house and move in when it is necessary. If not, they will receive exactly the same care as they do now in the Baptist retirement trust or the Anglican Retirement Villages-the same care a wealthy person receives. You cannot tell the differences between people. Nobody knows the differences in people's means unless they themselves disclose it to their neighbours in those villages. Nobody knows because the quality of service is identical no matter what your means, no matter what your background. The shadow minister advances spurious arguments about second-class care. For goodness sake! What scurrilous arguments you bring into this place. You do not do your profession any credit by the way in which you are arguing this matter. You ought to be ashamed of the way in which you are scaring old people with nonsense arguments. A true professional in this circumstance would want to get results, not score political points. You are scoring political points and causing delays and problems. I have given you the solution: be constructive and get results or let the stuff go through and let the government cop the whirlwind. But you will not do either of those things, you would rather play politics. I am arguing now that you stop playing politics and let us get on with the business of providing decent care for aged people. Let us look at what the government is proposing here: proper care, professionally supported, in a person's home for as long as they are able to remain there. And then professional assessment of what care they need before they move into the next stage of their aged care-whether it be hostel accommodation or nursing home accommodation. The type of care will be different and will suit the person's need, but an assessment will be made of the process. We had a stunt in the parliament this morning with the shadow minister trying to run a whole lot of arguments about where all the shortfalls were. I just want to reiterate some of the facts in the way in which this new aged care process is going to operate. Firstly, aged care assessment teams will continue to approve people for care based on their needs, not on their means. That is not and never has been in the government's mind; in fact, it is not in operation in most decently run nursing or retirement facilities at the moment throughout Australia. Certainly the largest ones do not operate on the basis of means but on the basis of needs. That is the tradition. You denigrate the tradition of nursing and hostel care in Australia by your arguments. Secondly, people who cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond will not be asked to pay it and that will not affect their access to care either. Those are the statements; that is the way it works now, and that is the way it is going to work in the future. But the fact of the matter is that those who do have resources are going to help pay for those who do not. That is where the extra money is going to come from which you could not find as a government, and which the Gregory report so clearly enunciated. You went down the gurgler. The whole thing declined. You had a maintenance attitude in this area. Just maintain the system. Do not worry about any improvements or changes. Let it gradually degenerate with the processes of age to the buildings, facilities and services being provided. There has been no imagination or new policies whatsoever. Every nursing home and hostel will have to take a set number of concessional residents. There is protection built in by the legislation. If they want to take more, they can. If they will not take the number required, they will be asked or required to. So there is protection there. If the bottom line is the formula, then the legislation does provide for that. It underscores and sets in concrete, if you like, the already existing practice. The government has made the commitment that if there is an extra cost it will pay it. That is broadly what is necessary. What about the prudential requirements of these organisations holding bond funds and those sorts of things? If people are required to make a payment going in, and when they come out there is a release of that bond, what is the protection going to be for their funds? That is a legitimate and proper question. But it is not the spurious stuff that the shadow minister has come up with that there is no protection. First of all, there will be a requirement on facilities to maintain a certain level of assets in liquid form so the bonds can be repaid to residents as they leave. What is unusual about that? Every insurance company does it. Every bank does it. They have got to be able to pay you when you go in and ask for your money. The operators of nursing homes or retirement villages will be asked to do the same thing; they will be required to do the same thing. An industry fund will be established-that is right across Australia-which, with providers, will pay a portion of the bonds. This fund will act as a lender of last resort should a provider's own liquidity prove to be insufficient. So there is a second protection. And, as a third protection, there will be insurance as well. So you have got a prudential fund established by the provider, then you have got an industry-wide fund which will be a lender of last resort, and behind that insurance again. I do not think the Reserve Bank has got so much protection. I certainly know that building societies in Australia do not. I know that credit unions do not. You are looking at something that is safer than credit unions, safer than banks, and you are going to be critical of that process. Get real! You are just exaggerating and causing concern when there should not be concern. What about the classification of people? Maybe that is a worry-what sort of service will I get? Anybody who is currently in either a nursing home or a hostel will continue with the classification they have now. That will not change. Over a period of 12 months, assessments will be made. Is the care appropriate to your needs? What person or family would not want an elderly individual in a nursing home or a hostel assessed on that basis? Is the care appropriate to your needs? Not to your means but to your needs. Is the care adequate is the real question being asked, and if it is not it will be changed. Is there anything wrong with us saying, 'Let's check to see how people are being cared for'? For goodness sake, they did it with child care throughout Australia. There was an incredible mess created by the previous government on the accreditation process. The thought police were out about what could be put into preschools and what could not be put into preschools. Yet are they objecting to this process? Do they not like it or do they think it is strange? I think this is a weird process that we are into here. I will just call once more on the Australian Labor Party to reassess their stance. If you think this is so objectionable, let it go through and let the government wear the pain. Otherwise, change your attitudes and let us have some constructive activity from you.",49
33,Mr ANDREN,PAIRS,"If there is one piece of recent legislation that has caused concern, debate and apprehension in the community, it is this Aged Care Bill. This bill attempts to bring about the most significant changes to aged care in Australia since the Menzies government introduced the first federal act of parliament relating to aged care in 1954-namely, the Aged Persons Homes Act. That act was not so much about aged care as about provision of adequate housing for service men and women after the Second World War and the Korean War. This bill will, if passed unamended, allow for nursing home and hostel programs to be rolled together into a single funded residential aged model; provision of a single assessment model to replace the two systems that exist currently in nursing home and hostel programs; extension of the existing entry contribution system in hostels to accommodation bonds for all high-dependency residential care; certification and accreditation of facilities, services and providers with the minimum acceptable benchmark being gradually increased as the existing infrastructure improves; standardisation of basic fee levels; extension of the user-pays principles; and increased quality of residential aged care services. In the words of the Churches of Christ homes, 'These times are exciting for aged care.' 'Each of the aims of the bill,' according to the organisation, 'is an admirable, desirable and achievable aim.' So why the concern? While the aims of this bill are admirable, its promotion and explanation to the elderly of Australia have been poorly handled. This is in no way a criticism of the minister, who I have found to be caring and receptive to any views that I have put forward on the peculiar issues pertaining to the legislation that impact on my electorateincluding, as it does, large regional centres with an established nursing home component and very small rural communities with nursing home type accommodation in local hospitals. The problem with dissemination of information began with the draft bill, a copy of which I received the week submissions were due and which was hardly of much use to local aged care assessment teams or service providers. The same unfortunately occurred with the exposure draft of the principles, received after the due date for comments. Is it too much to expect every member to receive copies of such contentious bills and accompanying information at a reasonable time before such submissions are due? Perhaps the peak bodies advising the aged care industry are at fault here by keeping the input and feedback at an executive level. The minister was alert to the concerns about a feeling of being left out by sections of the community, particularly in rural areas, and accepted late submissions from my electorate. For that I am grateful because it led to the retention of the dementia care counselling service funded by this government and administered by the Alzheimers Association. That kind of special attention to particular concerns has been greatly appreciated in the Orange district especially, where a bureaucratic pen stroke was set to eliminate a service that was, and is, a lifeline for carers of dementia loved ones in their own homes. But I am greatly disturbed that in the case of the Yeoval Hospital multipurpose centre, which is a model for aged care for smaller communities, I believe, the department has yet to get back to the board of that organisation, despite assurances to me in early April that they would explain the path Yeoval Hospital should take in both its hostel and nursing home care. The hospital has decided unilaterally-because the reforms will not be implemented until October-to go down the path of certification for its hostel but to seek recurrent funding for its nursing home, having entered into an agreement, and to wait for more details, which are yet to be provided. This is the sort of lack of communication that is upsetting for the carers of the rural aged. So when I support this bill in the comments I make today, I certainly do not support the manner in which it has been explained to some key sections of the community. It is a pity there has been confusion out there in the community because I believe the system the government has come up with is far simpler and fairer than aged care policies in the past. We have heard the minister detail the results of the survey into the aged care sector-the homes that did not meet fire standards or health standards and the number of patients in a four-bed, or more, ward. We have read the figures of experts who believe it will take $125 million a year to bring the nursing home infrastructure up to standard. The coalition is quick to accuse the former government of overseeing minimum standards and having no long-tenn plan, especially for dementia care. But, as I said, had I not raised the threatened loss of dementia counsellors in rural areas-through the concerns of the Orange Aged Care Assessment Team and the carers out there-then this service would have gone and it would have been inadequately mainstreamed through home and community care, which is ill-equipped for such a service. Overall, though, I believe the bill and its principles do provide a new and a fair system of aged care, and that is why I support these refonns. I am aware that many in the community might question why they have to pay an accommodation bond when others do not. Unless we access funds from the assets of those who can afford to pay, then we will not have a nursing home system of any quality. I have been concerned at the failure of the government to apply a cap on accommodation bonds. The minister's office tells me that there is no need, that the hostel system has worked without a bond quite satisfactorily and that there will be little need for hostels or nursing homes to charge more than a reasonable amount, given the prudential arrangements in place. The minister argues that if a capping mechanism was put in place, then bonds could be higher than necessary and any interest obtained from bonds must be used exclusively for aged care. However, it is interesting to note that, under section 57-12 of the bill, there is an additional subsection to the original draft-namely, subsection (1), clause (c)-which allows for the minister to invoke the user rights principIe, which sets an upper limit on bonds. So there is the mechanism to control bonds at the minister's discretion, according to the interpretation of the bill that I have received. That is good and it is essential. There will be a national average of 27 per cent of places for concessional clients-those on pensions. I am told this could mean as low as five per cent concessional places in some areas and as high as 85 per cent in others. I wonder how the department will keep track of that average of 27 per cent. It sounds a bit like the promise to cut small business red tape by 50 per cent. How do we know when we get there? There must always be a way of providing for those in the community who need aged care, but who can afford to contribute only a small amount or nothing at all. I will be watching this aspect closely as these changes take effect. Mr Deputy Speaker, there has been much concern in the community about the perceived need for nursing home clients to sell their homes to afford an accommodation bond. I believe there has been an unnecessary degree of fear generated by this perception, and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, currently, 55 per cent of hostel or nursing home occupants choose to sell their family home to enter such a facility. If there is a spouse, partner or, indeed, a carer living in the home, it does not come under the assets test because it remains the family home. I found the comments recently of one correspondent in the Sydney Morning Herald a little hard to swallow. She claimed that many part-pensioners, particularly those in Sydney or Melbourne, will complain when they discover the forced sale of their homes makes them ineligible for a pension. Mr Deputy Speaker, if someone is so lucky as to capitalise on the property boom in Sydney, especially at the moment, and pays an accommodation bond in a hostel or nursing home and is still up to $700,000 better off in the bank, why in heaven's name should they qualify for the pension anyway? It is not an inheritance tax; it is payment for accommodation and care at an advanced age. From what I have studied in this bill, the explanatory notes, the Bills Digest and elsewhere, I think this legislation is fair and will achieve the goals pointed out by the Churches of Christ Homes to which I alluded earlier in my comments. I am reassured by comments from the minister that full pensioners will pay no more than the basic pensioner contribution, and will pay no further income tested charge. The base fee for part-pensioners of $21.10 plus 25c in every dollar of income over $49 a week appears fair enough. However, aged care providers have contacted me with concerns that concessional residents will have only about $1,500 left to spend annually after statutory fees and charges are met. This $1,500 has to proyide for clothing, toiletries, telephones, stamps, entertainment, newspapers, hairdressing-perhaps cigarettes and alcohol-gifts, pharmaceuticals and, maybe, taxis. It does not seem a lot for those expenses, does it? Perhaps it does need revisiting. Mr Deputy Speaker, this Aged Care Bill and its complementary bills comprise one of the most complex pieces of legislation to enter this parliament in many years. I therefore am not prepared to commit myself totally to it, because it may very well have a series of landmines that I have not picked up. But we need to restructure aged care in this country, given the statistics staring us in the face of the size of the aged sector in 20 to 30 years time. We could go a long way to funding much of that aged care infrastructure if we were to properly reform our tax system. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) said in the House yesterday that the cash economy was of grave concern-or words to that effect. Forgone taxes in this country are a national budgetary disgrace. We cannot afford vital public infrastructure funds for hospitals, nursing homes, highways and railways because we are being ripped off and the poor old PA YE bunny is footing the bill. In the absence of any political will to reform the tax system and obtain the revenue we should be recovering, we must make a start on rebuilding and improving the aged care accommodation in this country, and lifting the standards of care. It will cost a huge amount of dollars. This users pay system is the only way we can go at the moment, so short is the lead time before the aged population crisis hits us. However, there are real concerns out there still, some of which I have outlined. I would like to add a few more-these from a hostel accommodation provider in Blayney. The board of the Lee Hostel tells me the program for implementation is unrealistic, that current funding agreements with the Commonwealth are effectively ended because it is now either a recurrent funding or accommodation bond arrangement. They and the Yeo val multipurpose hospital service I earlier referred to believe the recurrent funding arrangement they have entered into with the government should remain intact and still allow them to access the accommodation bonds option. I notice there are provisions for rural and remote services to ensure people stay in their communities for continuous care from hostel to nursing home. I applaud that. I think there remains a high degree of misunderstanding, though, in some rural areas and I would urge the department to ensure smaller country towns, in particular, are aware of the recurrent funding option and what their options are in terms of charging accommodation bonds. This also requires an early settlement between the states and Commonwealth on the respective status of nursing home type accommodation in smaller country hospitals. Much also has been made of the subsidy of $5 a day per concessional resident, with the opposition suggesting that this alone would be the amount of Commonwealth support for such clients, as far as I can ascertain from comments. I think I heard the minister's adviser right when he assured me this is not correct. I am concerned that Aged Care Australia believes this concessional resident supplement should be at least $12 a day if the objective of improving buildings and infrastructure is to be met. But I am also persuaded by the figures of the previous administration that show the supplement equivalent was but $3. This came about when the former government allocated $10 million a year on its tiered system standard aggregated modu1e-or $3 a day per resident-for capital upgrade. The new arrangements will provide $5 a day, I am told, in addition to the $100 a day current subsidy. It is an additional supplement that will assist the provider's capital requirements. Nursing homes and hostels which take more than their set number of concessional residents will still receive full funding for them. I hope they are right. As well, Aged Care Australia questions the cost of the accreditation agency yet to be established. Whatever the cost will be, I presume it will be established and will perform the necessary task allotted it under the legislation. The bill provides for three types of aged care: residential, community and flexible. I particularly applaud the resources being put into provision of home based care. It seems a sensible restructuring of the industry and the demands for aged care services. I only hope the government and the minister continue to listen to the community in the months leading up to the October start-up, which still seems too early. Can I plead also for the government to look at other aged care options out there in the community such as that provided by the Abbeyfield Society. This organisation falls outside the residential, community and flexible care categories of this bill. However, it provides about 25 homes at this stage around Australia, including one in Orange, that offer a sharing, virtually self-care accommodation for elderly folk, with a major, almost exclusive, voluntary local committee to run them. They are seeking $175,000 a year to maintain their Melbourne based administration. The homes run themselves virtually, free up the scarce rental accommodation that the clients may otherwise occupy, but offer a cooperative community based elderly residential facility for pensioners. It is highly cost-effective accommodation for our elderly people who are not ready for hostel or nursing home care, but who require companionship and community care if needed. I urge the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to consider Abbeyfield in her interpretation of flexible aged care under this bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a radical change in aged care, there is no doubt. Its consequential provisions that amend existing legislation bear testimony to the complexity of the changes. I only hope the government has got it right. I have a gut feeling that it has, but there is much fine tuning and allaying of concerns yet to be done, particularly as we are dealing with one of the two most vulnerable sectors of the community-the frail aged. With those reservations and cautions, I commend these bills to the House. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) 0.39 p.m.)-I rise in support of the government's Aged Care Bill and commend the initiatives outlined in the bill to the residents of the Lindsay electorate. I would like to reiterate the words of the member for Calare (Mr Andren), a true Independent in this place, who has examined the actions of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the bill and cannot find fault with it but retains some reservations. Those reservations mainly come from the scaremongering by Labor. It is important that I reassure the residents, staff and proprietors of the three hostels and four nursing homes in my electorate who will benefit directly from the measures of this bill. They are: the Emmaus Village Hostel; the Edinglassie Hostel; the Lemongrove Gardens Hostel; the Edinglassie Nursing Home; the Governor Phillip Nursing Home; the Henry Fulton Nursing Home; and the Mountainview Nursing Home. All have a proud tradition and reputation for the delivery of quality care to the aged in the Lindsay electorate. The passage of this bill will provide greater incentive and opportunity to them in the future. It is well known that: our population is ageing-it is estimated that by the year 2030, 20 per cent of our population will be over 65; the current aged care system is in crisis and does not have the capacity to meet the needs of our ageing population; and Labor's neglect of the nursing home sector was a shameful act that consigned too many people to a life in substandard accommodation with little choice or dignity. This government's aged care policy initiatives are essential to address the failure of Labor's two-tiered aged care system-a system that has seen individuals in nursing homes forced to accept second-best accommodation in facilities that have been poorly funded and neglected by 13 years of Labor government. We have heard much of Labor's cynical scaremongering campaign over the past months that has totally focused on promoting misinformation and hollow rhetoric, while deliberately scaring older people in our communities and their families--especially in the electorate of Lindsay. The shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has made a number of unsubstantiated comments which have caused the residents of Lindsay considerable concern. She attacks our policies but has no vision of her own to put forward alternatives which will take us into the 21 st century. Labor's policy in relation to aged care is simply promising to deliver more of the same poor quality, substandard nursing home accommodation. Members of the previous Labor government sat on their hands and ignored the recommendation of Professor Gregory's 1995 report that found that '$124 million per annum needs to be spent to bring nursing home infrastructure up to an acceptable level'. Labor abdicated their responsibility to care for the aged into the future in 1995, they ignored aged care policy during the 1996 federal election campaign and now they offer no vision for the future-simply grannie bashing and scaremongering. It must be remembered that the shadow minister, who now professes great concern for the welfare of our older citizens, was a consultant to the previous Labor minister, who failed his responsibility to the aged. The member for Jagajaga was clearly a failure then and her lack of policy alternatives now indicates that nothing has changed. Throughout the development of this reform package, the government has undertaken a thorough assessment of the needs of the aged in our community. Some aspects of the existing hostel system have been retained and extended into the nursing home sector. The extension of the hostel entry contribution system to nursing homes will provide a much needed source of capital to overcome, for the first time in 10 years, the capital crisis that has bedevilled the nursing home sector. This will be achieved by asking those in the community who have the ability to do so to make a greater contribution to the cost of their care than they do at present. There is no need for a cap. To reassure the member for Calare, if some senior residents who can afford it wish to have gold taps, shagpile carpets and hot and cold running jacuzzis, then they are welcome to it and will pay the costs accordingly. But any home that caters to that style of accommodation must still maintain the concessional resident quota. I think competition-a great principle of our party and a great Liberal tradition-can prove that exactly what has happened in the hostel system will occur again in the homes. It is also important at this point to counter Labor's irresponsible scaremongering, suggesting that individuals will be forced to sell their homes to access an aged care facility. Nothing could be further from the truth. This has been reiterated by the minister and nearly every member speaking on this side of the House. Protections have been included for individuals with dependent children, carers and spouses. No-one will be forced to sell the family home. I think it is very important to make that point: no-one will be forced to sell the family home. Once no-one is living in it, then it is hardly a family home. It can be rented; it becomes an asset and gets included in anyone's eligibility for a pension. Pensioners whose income test is less than the pension, plus the free amount of $49, will not be affected by the income test arrangements. Accommodation bonds will not be on all residents and prudential arrangements have been made to protect any bonds that are put up. It is important to reassure people that those bonds we are talking about are not astronomical fees. We are talking about $2,600 a year to a maximum of five years. After that no further draw-downs from the bonds can be made. The introduction of accommodation bonds and income testing will ensure that the government's resources are focused to the advantage of the less fortunate in our communities. They will be complemented by the concessional resident quota and a concessional resident subsidy. Under the new accommodation bond arrangements, the maximum contribution any individual will be required to pay is $13,000 over five years. It must be emphasised that the government will still make a substantial contribution to the costs of aged care of all people. Our ageing population will rightly demand higher quality nursing home accommodation and care than has been available in the past. The bill that we are debating today provides the foundation for the delivery of an aged care service that provides access to care based on needs, not means-a standard that meets or exceeds world's best practice. For the first time, the level of government subsidy for each resident will be based on the degree of frailty of the resident according to their needs and not according to the style of accommodation occupied, their means. The measures in this bill not only provide a plan for the future but deliver immediate benefits to the l30,000 residents in hostels and nursing homes today. The new residents classification scale will allow more choice and flexibility for older people. It also ensures that funding follows an individual's care needs. The government's commitment to ageing is enhanced by the measures in this bill. It will enable people to stay in familiar surroundings near their family and friends as their care needs change. It is an integrated package that will deliver quality care for our older citizens and provide dignity and choice for all. The new Aged Care Bill will complement other programs that support older people in our communities, such as the home and community care and the community aged care packages. In implementing this package, the government has ensured that those in our community with limited means will be assured access to aged care services. The 27 per cent concessional resident quota and the concessional resident subsidy will ensure adequate support to maintain aged care facilities in less affluent areas. This is an important consideration in the Lindsay electorate, which is a traditional lower to middle income family area. During the 1996 election campaign, the government promised increased assistance for people with dementia. This bill delivers on that commitment. For the first time, mental frailty will gain better recognition and weighting in the residential classification scale. This scale provides funding on the basis of needs arising from incapacities. Under Labor, only physical incapacities were subsidised. Under the new funding system contained in this bill, subsidies for mental incapacity will be substantially increased. In some instances, residents in aged care establishments who require intensive supervision because of dementia will receive funding increases in excess of 30 per cent. The government's new aged care reforms will simplify procedures for providers and provide incentives for the investment in world-class aged care facilities. Importantly, red tape and bureaucracy will be slashed. Unwieldy bureaucracy will be replaced by peer driven review processes that are responsi ve to the needs of residents, providers and others in the industry and, most importantly, promote the development of leading edge technology and world's best practice. Members opposite continue to criticise the government's aged care reforms. We make no apologies for moving so quickly to ensure that our elderly people can reside in aged care facilities with dignity, comfort and security. This bill represents the first step of this government's ongoing commitment to ensuring the provision of quality aged care services and facilities to our older citizens. It is esting to note that the member for Calare has reservations, but he has examined the bill and he sees it as an enormous improvement on previous legislation and previous conditions in the industry. We will continue to improve in this industry. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has a grasp on her portfolio that shows vision and funding right through to all of the considerations and concepts that could possibly affect our aged population through to the year 2030. I congratulate the minister on presenting a comprehensive and integrated package that addresses Labor's failures and enhances the ability of the aged care sector to meet the challenges of our aged population. The minister came to the portfolio with limited experience in aged care, having previously been the shadow minister for small business. She has shown her aptitUde, her enthusiasm and her ability to get around complex procedures in industry in a very short space of time. She has listened to industry. She has responded to what has been required in this area that has been neglected for 13 years. Members opposite continue to run significant scare campaigns in this area. They have challenged our government over issues such as the enormous accommodation bonds that they say will be required. Let me assure the residents of Lindsay that this will not be so. There is no limit on what accommodation bonds can be charged. It is purely up to you in terms of the style of accommodation that you seek to access. The industry will provide a vast range of accommodation levels to meet different lifestyles. Our government's commitment to the aged has not wavered at all over the last 14 months. Over the next 14 months leading to the next electionMr Andrew Thomson-Fourteen years. Miss JACKIE KELLY-Over the next 14 years we will be challenging the leading edge technology in this industry. It is a tremendous challenge that we are all rising to meet. We are urging the industry to build better buildings, to start competing, and that is an important aspect in my electorate of Lindsay where we have a limited number of hostels but a inter- high demand. We have a number of young families who wish to have their parents close by. Quite frequently, grandparents have to be settled far away from the electorate of Lindsay, which is a brand new electorate. We have got very new housing estates, such as Glenmore Park, Claremont Meadows and Mount Pleasant, which are booming with a number of new families and first home buyers who have had to move to western Sydney because of the dramatic rise in accommodation costs in the inner city. They have left behind parents who have access to aged care hostels in those areas but not in western Sydney. It is an increasing concern because it also adds to the breakdown between the older generation and the younger generation. When children grow up too far away from their grandparents they tend to have less tolerance for the elderly. The elderly themselves develop a fear of young people. They tend to see three young people in a group and think it is a gang. A great schism occurs in our society. I think it is important to keep relationships through all generations open and flowing. It is important to place aged care homes in electorates such as Lindsay where there is access to the grandchildren and sometimes the great-grandchildren. As the young grow up there is no fear of getting old. There is no fear of the unknown. They have a great amount of respect for their grandparents and extended family. Currently over 40 per cent of residents nursing homes share rooms with three or more people. Eleven per cent of the facilities do not meet fire standards. Fifteen per cent not meet health standards. That does not apply to any of the homes in my electorate, because they are all relatively new. They are all of an excellent standard but there is a shortage of them. With this introduction of accommodation bonds we will see the potential for new homes to open up. Groups like the Moran Group are gearing up to take advantage of what can be done in the industry and to start providing some competition, some choice, some diversity and some varied standards of accommodation to meet the increasingly particular needs of the generation of the baby boomers, who tend to be more demanding in terms of services offered accommodation type. It is important to come back to Professor it! Gregory's report, which in 1995 identified a deficit in the aged care area. Labor's best response was worth only $36.4 million over four years. What is worse, they actually funding for capital. This is at a stage where nursing homes do not have elevators between floors, do not meet fire standards and are positive health risks. In 1992-93, $45 million was available for nursing home capital alone. This bill addressMarch es the need that Professor Bob Gregory stated was required, of $125 million annually. We are making inroads into the capital investment in our aged care homes and nursing care records. In 14 months we have gone a lot further down the track than Labor had gone in 13 years. I commend the bill to the House.",53

Prime Minister, is it not a fact that as a result of your government's savage attack on assistance to industry, your flattening of the economy and your assault on job security, the latest national in accounts now tell us that we have a recession in manufacturing on top of a dramatically reduced rate of increase in manufacturing do exports? How many more jobs have to be lost before the Prime Minister shows some leadership and produces an industry policy?",60

He is engaging in the very thing that the member for Melbourne railed against in a document that has come into my possession. It has a very interesting title; it is called Populism and rationalism. It is a submission by the member for Melbourne to the ALP's Living Standards and Employment Policy Committee, dated May 1997. I and know that nobody would want me to read from this document. Government members-Oh, go on! Read",60

38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,60
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the Leader of the Opposition and I remind the parliament that there was strong growth of 0.9 per cent in the quarter. It reflected a very strong increase in domestic final demand of 21 per cent. In combination with the large detraction from growth, due to a run-down in stocks, this would signal-this is a point that has been picked up by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in a statement made by the chamber today in response to the national accounts-a pick-up in output growth in coming quarters. I remind the House, to the great disappointment and chagrin of the Leader of the Opposition, that net exports made a very strong contribution to growth. The figures confirm that consumer demand is picking up, the housing sector is strengthening and business investment remains very strong. There have been numerous reports in recent days of the potential strength of investment in the resource sector. Growth in 1997-98 is therefore expected to be consistent with the budget estimate, while growth in 1996-97 is likely to be three per cent. An independent forecast by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council supports the government's forecast of steady, low inflation growth. They are predicting growth of 3Y2 per cent in 1997 and four per cent in 1998. I remind the parliament that of the 20 nations studied in the Pacific Economic Outlook, released overnight, only Singapore was tipped to have a better combination of economic growth and low inflation. I repeat that: only Singapore was predicted to have a better combination of economic growth and low inflation. Mr Crean-Well, why is the manufacturing sector in recession?",60
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear the member for Hotham interjecting about industry policy. I think this marvellous little document should be on the prescribed reading list of all. It is remarkable that you write a document advocating a bit of forward looking policy and you get threatened with expulsion from the front-bench. It is a pretty interesting way of making policy and trying to rebuild yourself in the eyes of the electorate. I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would welcome this. I know the member for Hotham does not welcome this. The member for Hotham is very unhappy about it. He knows that the member for Melbourne has designs on his job. I think the member for Melbourne thinks he would make a far better industry spokesman. I remind the member for Hotham and all of those who sit opposite of both one quote from this very forward looking and perspicacious document entitled Populism and rationalism, when the member for Melbourne said: Recycling the policies of the past is about as sensible as tackling road trauma by legislating to require every car to be preceded by a person on foot carrying a red flag. This is the member for Melbourne clearly worried about the cheapjack populism of the member for Hotham, the crown prince of flipfloppery in Australian politics. He goes bravely to the car workers when he is a minister, saying, 'We've got to have a steady reduction in tariffs.' Now that he is in opposition, he is running around to any factory that will let him in making all sorts of extravagant demands, saying, 'We'll do this; we'll do that. We'll hold back the flood tide of imports. We'll adopt strong attitudes in defence of the Australian workers.' I say: do not be surprised if they do not listen to you because, as I said yesterday, you have got loads of form and they know you have got form. They remember your broken opposition promises when you were last in government and it will take years of the purgatory of opposition for you to retain any kind of credibility in this area. National Accounts",61
41,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. It is also about the national accounts. What are the implications of today's national accounts for growth in the coming year? What is the significance of the fact that all areas, apart from stocks, contributed to growth in the March quarter?",61
42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today's national accounts show that the Australian economy grew strongly in the March quarter by 0.9 per cent, a good outcome, and pointed at very favourable prospects in 1997-98. With the exception of stocks, all areas of expenditure contributed to growth. Forward indicators of housing activity confirmed that the housing recovery continues. Domestic final demand and exports grew very rapidly-domestic final demand by 2.1 per cent and exports by 2.5 per cent. If it had not been for the run-down in stocks, the quarter would have shown an increase substantially in excess of one per cent and, even in the event that stocks are unchanged in the June quarter, stocks will add one percentage point to GDP(E) growth for that quarter. the stock to sales ratio, which is very low, indicates that while sales were strong for the quarter there was an unexpected run-down in stocks. As a result, you would expect in the June quarter a rebuilding of stocks, which will contribute to a very strong outcome for the June quarter. If you wanted to get a set of national accounts which would show favourable prospects, these are the kinds of accounts that you would want. These are the kinds of accounts where you see a growth in private final demand and in exports. Coming off a low stocks figure, it will be a very good outcome in June. Indeed, that is totally consistent with the government's forecasts for strengthening growth in 1997-98.",61

To come back to the national accounts: 0.9 per cent growth in the March quarter; all of the indicators in relation to private final demand, strong; the only detraction from growth, stocks; a sales to stock ratio which run down and which will be corrected; a contribution from stocks which will take the current quarter to one per cent and above; strengthening growth; low inflation growth; low interest rate growth. They are the kinds of conditions that you would actually want to see in the Australian economy. I think the only people who will be upset about today's national accounts will be the Labor Party, because the Labor Party take great delight when things go badly. Seeing a good result and favourable conditions will of course be of no interest to the Labor Party today. Mr Speaker, you would be aware that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition threatened some of his frontbenchers over their treachery. Today we find out that he is proposing discussion of a matter of public importance on the economy. We on this side have seen this before. When the leader comes into do the MPI, it indicates that it is about time to try to buoy up the troops. The Australian said that the Leader of the Opposition 'made it clear' to the Labor Party meeting yesterday 'that he did not mind if the message was passed on to those who were unable to attend'. Then the Australian says, 'Those absent from the meeting included MPs Lindsay Tanner, Mark Latham and Kim Carr.' The member for Melbourne is not here and the member for Werriwa is, but I have said it before: they are the face of modernising Labor and they should be listened to by the leadership. They should not be cast aside; they are the face of modernising Labor. They have a few economic ideas and they should be allowed to ask questions, too. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders: Stolen Children",63
65,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Has the minister seen reports of comments made in an international forum that were critical of Australia's response to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry into the removal of Aboriginal and is Torres Strait Islander children from their families? What is the minister's response to these comments?,63
66,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen comments by Mr Mick Dodson made in the United States. I have not seen the fuIl text of what he said, so I can only comment on how I have seen it reported. I have to say that what I have seen reported is very disappointing and I ask why is Mr Dodson overseas focusing on only the negatives of what is happening and not focusing on some of the good things that are happening. It is very important in this debate that there is some balance and some capacity to say that good things are happening as well. In my own area of health, that is, that I have direct responsibility for, there are some very positive things happening. We have framework agreements with six out of eight states and territories to bring Aboriginal people to the negotiating table-to bring ATSIC and the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and Aboriginal health services together and try to move in the one direction. Of itself, it is not going to fix things; but it is an essential building block we are going to make progress and not repeat the mistakes of the past. Another essential building block for the long term is the Aboriginal work force. We are not going to have success without male and female Aboriginal health workers on the ground, without them getting adequate training and without there being greater numbers of them. We are not going to have success without research. Research has to underpin any endeavour in health, and particularly in Aboriginal health. We have a very exciting venture happening in Darwin with the Menzies school of medical research. We have $50 miIlion$14 million direct from the Commonwealth and $35 million matched mainly by Commonwealth and state agencies-to spend to look at just the health needs of Aboriginal people. This is a cooperative research centre of the Department of Science and Technology that is looking at Aboriginal well-being. We have 15 coordinated care trials. The first of them are due to start in four weeks time. Three of those 15 are going to be in Aboriginal communities-the Tiwi Islands, the south west of Western Australia, including Roebourne and Bunberry and one in Wilcannia in western New South Wales. Looking at specific strategies, we have an Aboriginal sexual health strategy after a year of tough and difficult negotiation and consultation with Aboriginal people. We have a mental health action plan that, again, does not promise the world but does promise incremental improvements and has taken Aboriginal people on board to be part of it. We have new services starting up-18 that we have been able to announce in the last six months; 17 we are still trying to negotiate the location of with states and territories and Aboriginal people on the basis of need. In places like Balgo, in Western Australia, up to a thousand people have no access to health services whatsoever. On the broader issues, Aboriginal people are now getting their fair share in mainstream programs as well-diabetes, public health, HIV and AIDS. Not all things of course happen because of if government. Some things are happening in spite of government. In the Pitjantjatjara lands, in the north-west of South Australia, there has been the most extraordinary improvements in health in the last four years by Nganampa health services, run out of Alice Springs, where they have been doing the hard slog on the ground and making improvements as good as anywhere in the world, recognising that the improvements come from basic public health strategy. In three shires in the Kimberleys over the last 10 years--only three shires-SID rates amongst men have dropped by two-thirds. The only thing those three shires have in common is that they are the only three shires in the Kimberleys to have an Aboriginal medical service. Mr Dodson is obviously frustrated. I can understand his frustration. Aboriginal people get frustrated when they see $400 million spent by the Commonwealth and states on a royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody and Aboriginal death rates go up. Aboriginal people are frustrated when there is a national Aboriginal health strategy that spends $500 million and they can find only traces of it in some places. Australians are generous, and that generosity does extend to improving Aboriginal wellheing. But their generosity will be severely tested if only one side of the argument is put. Their generosity will be severely tested if the view is put around and believed that only bad things are happening, because in many places in the country there are some wonderful, exciting things happening. If the view that everything we do is hopeless does become current, then I am sure the Australian public's generosity will be severely tested. Foreign Debt",64
67,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does he remember his debt truck and the prominence that he gave to increasing foreign debt in the last election campaign? If so, how does he explain the fact that on the figures released today Australia's net foreign debt has risen more in the coalition's first year of government than it did in Labor's last 2Yz years of office?",65
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do remember the debt truck. I remember it very well. While you are on the subject of debt, I also remember that when we came to office you left us with a budget deficit of $10.5 billion. I also know, and you will not be allowed to forget, that in the course of our first term of government we will be translating $10.5 billion of deficit $1.6 billion of surplus. Let me say that again. Mr Gareth Evans-A point of order, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister does not seem to understand the difference between public debt and foreign debt. My question was about the latter.",65
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,65
70,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would also remind the House that this coming financial year we will be repaying more than $5 billion of Mr Keating's and Mr Beazley's debts-$5 billion of the national debt of this country. In the last six years that you were in powerMr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. On the question of relevan.ce, the question is very specifically about foreIgn debt-not about public debt and not about the repayment of public debt but about foreign debt, which is economically, Prime Minister, a completely different issue.",65
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We are not going to debate the issue. There is no point of order.,65
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is sensitive. He ought to be. In the last six years that Labor was in power it ran up deficit levels of $75 billion. Mr Gareth Evans-A point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was about the fact that the size of the foreign debt had increased more than it did in the last 2Yz years when we were in office. What he is saying is utterly irrelevant. That is the point of order.",65
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Deputy Leader. I am sure the Prime Minister is going to address the full complexity of the question.,65
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition invited me to talk about debtand, boy, am I going to talk about debt. I am going to remind you that in the last six years that you were in power you ran up a debt of $75 billion and you purchased a miserable 16,000 jobs. Can I remind those who sit opposite that in 1995-96, which was your last full year in office, the debt to GDP ratio of this nation was 19.5 per cent. Do you know what it will be by the year 2000? It will be 10 per cent. In other words, we inherited a debt into to GDP ratio of 19.5 per cent. By the tum of the centuryMr Gareth Evans-The Prime Minister is still confused. He is talking about a public debt to GDP ratio, which is much less in Europe; he is not talking about foreign debt to GDP.",65
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have made your point emphatically clear. I thank you. Resume your seat. Mr Gareth Evans-If I have made it emphatically clear, why don't you make him address the question and not",65
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is addressing the general question of debt. Prime Minister.,65
77,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,65
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I tell you what-if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had been here during the time my predecessor was Prime Minister he would know that the answer I am giving is an absolute perfect case study of total relevance. He asked me a question about debtMr Leo MCLeay-A point of order. Mr Speaker, earlier this session you issued a new set of rules about question time. The opposition has kept to those rules. The Prime Minister is defying you. When will you make him answer the question?",65
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question focused on foreign debt. Mr Gareth Evans-That is right.,66
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister is using a number of notable examples to expand the debate, and I am sure the Prime Minister will address the question of foreign debt almost forthwith.",66
81,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable member would well know, foreign debt has many components. It has private, it can have government, and it can have state. The point that I am making in answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question on foreign debt-and it was tightly targeted on foreign debt-is that the Commonwealth is making a massive contribution through its budget deficit reduction strategy to reducing the overall debt level. So I thank you. May I return, Mr Speaker, to my theme that this was a debt-ridden country, that it was a deficit-ridden country. The Beazley-Keating inheritance was a $10.5 billion deficit. In one term alone we will have turned that around to a surplus of $1.6 billion. We will have cut the debt to GOP ratio of almost 20 per cent to a debt to GOP ratio of 10 per cent by the tum of the century. We inherited an economy that had seen $75 billion",66
82,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,66
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is this a point of order?,66
84,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a point of order on relevance. I know it is pathetic and we ought to let it go, but there was a very specific question. You have put down a set of rules which we are conforming with absolutely, and have over the last three weeks. We have seen precious little conformity on this side, and this side has just produced one of the least conforming answers we have yet managed to hear.",66
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. There is no doubt that the new conventions are taking a little longer to bed down than I had thought hitherto. But you would have recognised that we had a series of divisions earlier today which also centred on new procedures, and they too are taking a little while to settle down. So I ask the House to accept some flexibility in the issue and I invite the Prime Minister to wind up his answer.",66
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think there is a very direct link between foreign debt and national debt and there is a very direct role that the Commonwealth can play in influencing the levels. The point I am quietly making to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that since we have been in government we have been making a massive contribution to improving the situation. We have cut the deficit you left us. We are reducing our public debt charges by a very imaginative program of privatisation-which you tried to stop, although you know quite well that if you had won the election you would not have done a third of Telstra; you would have done the whole lot, just as your colleague Bob Carr in New South Wales is demonstrating. A debt to GOP ratio of almost 20 per cent in 1995 by the tum of the century will have been cut to 10 per cent. That is a monumental achievement. It is a great gift to future generations of Australians. When you remember that we have accomplished that in the face of the terrible legacy of debt you left us, it is a quite remarkable achievement.",66
87,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,66
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Fisher. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr SPEAKER ,66
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have called the honourable member for Fisher. Mr Gareth Evans-I know that, but I have a supplementary question.",66
90,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sit him down, Mr Speaker.",66
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have called the honourable member for Fisher.",67
92,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, have you seen reports in today's newspapers that the Bureau of Meteorology has predicted that the dry El Nino weather pattern will strengthen? What action is the government taking to meet the ongoing welfare needs of farm families in drought affected areas of Australia, including those in south east Queensland?",67
93,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I begin by saying that the government-and I am sure those opposite would share this opinion-is very deeply concerned by the Bureau of Meteorology's confirmation yesterday that large areas of Australia appeared to be heading, again, into drought. The re-emergence of the EI Nino pattern and the continuing negative trend in the southern oscillation index suggest, unfortunately, that the prospect of good rains over winter and spring is increasingly remote. I have to say that the possibility of many farmers not seeing useful rainfall until next autumn is a terrible blow, particularly for those farmers in eastern Australia who are still struggling to recover from what they have been through in recent years-the worse drought on record. I know all of us sincerely hope that it unfolds differently. Nonetheless, of course the government has to be prepared. I point to the fact that, since we came to office last year we have provided some $170 million in additional funding for drought relief. Very importantly, in October last year we extended that drought recovery period from six months to 12 months, in recognition of the ongoing hardship being experienced by farm families. A six-month recovery period was simply insufficient. As a result of that, all eligible farmers in areas where Drought Exceptional Circumstances declarations have been revoked can receive a drought relief payment, which is an income support payment for 12 months. But tragically, even under these circumstances, there are farm families experiencing continuing hardship because of the unbelievable toll taken by drought and the impact of extremely low commodity prices, particularly in the Drought livestock sector. Many families in areas where the 12-month recovery period was due to end next week faced an impossibly bleak immediate future. This included large parts of northern and south-eastern Queensland from where the member comes, north-eastern New South Wales, New England, parts of Tasmania, Victoria and the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia. The government therefore announced earlier today that the drought relief payment would be extended for a further three months in these areas. This will ensure that these hardpressed families continue to be able to put food on the table. The government has granted this extension because it has not yet finalised detailed consultation with stakeholders, including the states and farm leaders, over the integrated rural policy package which is shortly to be announced. It has to be said that this approach can be contrasted very favourably indeed with what farmers saw under the previous administration. The reality is that there is a real contrastMr O'Keefe-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the minister has had absolute cooperation on this issue because we treated it seriously, as he does.",67
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? We are not going to debate the issue. Mr O'Keefe-The point of order is that you laid down the guidelines. There was a specific question from the member.,67
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr O'Keefe-You have had cooperation. It is not about bagging us,67
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat! I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Burke. The honourable member for Burke thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,67
97,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a very important point to be established here. A lot of the damage that was done, a lot of the terrible circumstances that these peoplp. are experiencing, are because of the sorts of parameters that they ran when they were in government and their refusal to put anything in place until it was so deep into the drought, until Queensland in particular was in",67
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: not only is this deceitful but also it is out of order. In the order of relevance, this has absolutely nothing to do with the question he was asked.",68
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I ask the minister to stop digressing and return to the question.,68
100,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply make the point that a lot of that hardship came about because we had farm costs through the roof, we had interest rates over 20 per cent for an indefinite period of time and then we had a Prime Minister who said that drought is a normal part of management responsibility for farmers. They left the place in such a mess that people are still now trying to recover. Mr O'Connor-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: on relevance: I think it is about time you rule that the minister is out of order.",68
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has concluded his answer. Mr O'Connor-He is not addressing his answer specifically to the question.,68
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said, 'The minister has concluded his answer.' Any further intervention on your part will be treated most severely. You defy the chair; you suffer the consequences, believe me. Tariffs: Motor Vehicle Industry",68
103,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer to the fact that the manufacturing sector is now in recession following two successive quarters of negative growth-all your own work, minister. Why won't you start to repair the damage caused by your lack of an industry policy by embracing Labor's car plan, a plan which will create 10,000 new jobs in manufacturing and treble automotive exports?",68
104,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I am surprised that the member for Hotham should believe what he reads in newspapers because, if he did, he would find in that wonderful Glenn Milne article that he is one of the two, with the Deputy Leader of the OppositionMr Crean-On a point of order, Mr Speaker, as to relevance: I asked a specific question about the recession that his policies have caused for manufacturing industry and why he will not do something to increase jobs in manufacturing, like embrace our car plan, where the car industry has committed to 10,000 new jobs.",68
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member will resume his seat. Your point is well taken. Unfortunately, you have not afforded the minister adequate time to even get the first sentence or two away. I am sure the minister will address the question.",68
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Give the Minister a go!,68
107,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-As I was saying, CJ should not jump in quite so quickly. It shows his sensitivity. Mr Crean-Thank you, Black Jack!",68
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham has asked his question. An answer is on its way.,68
109,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-If CJ keeps this up, he will find that all the young egos will be after all the old egos. As a consequence of that, Simon-CJ-you should not really think too much about aspiring to leadership. Mr Crean-On another point of order, Mr Speaker: I thought you had clearly required ministers to address their comments through the chair",68
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I did ask the ministerMr Crean-And not make comments across the table.,68
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I did ask the minister to address the question. I can understand his enthusiasm to join the battle, but I do invite him to resume his comments and address the thrust of the question.",68
112,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"CJ should not be too worried about all these points he is obviously worried about. Upsetting himself like this does not give him the right profile to take on the leadership. Mr O'Connor-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: earlier you reminded me about my responsibilities to you and the Speaker's chair.",68
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is your point of order? Mr O'Connor-I am wondering whether you could remind the minister of his responsibilities not to contravene standing order 80, which requires that he address members by their correct title.",69
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Corio. The minister is aware of the conventions of the House. I ask him to return to the question.,69
115,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In view of the seriousness of the question he asked-despite the colour and the movement he interjected into it all; I mean, that is part of the profile-I just want ask him to draw himself to some of the facts. Areas of manufacturing are growing quite strongly-in equipment, manufacturing machinery and other areas-with 5.7 per cent growth in a quarter and 4.3 per cent growth in a quarter. Employment (do you remember employment? You are the $2 billion man; you spent that on unemployment) in the manufacturing sector in the year to February grew by just short of 22,000 positions.",69
116,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Really?,69
117,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, 22,000 posItIons. Profitability in the six months to March 1997 grew by 19 per cent in the manufacturing sector. As I said, CJ really ought not read too much into the newspapers, because when he does he gets the wrong line altogether. Legal Aid",69
118,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Attorney-General. Is the Acting Attorney-General aware of media reports today regarding the current status of legal aid negotiations with the states and territories, can he advise the House of the current situation?",69
119,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I can tell him in relation to the issue that he raised concerning the negotiations with the states that New South Wales yesterday informed us that it would be establishing a new Legal Aid Commission to undertake legal aid for New South Wales and that the Commonwealth will be able to contract with the commission to provide Commonwealth services. This does mark the latest stage in the Commonwealth's move to new legal aid arrangements from 1 July, and we are pleased that legal aid will continue in New South Wales through a single shopfront. We are heartened that the New South Wales government, in view of the difficulty in getting the states to fully commit to their areas of responsibility, has provided an additional $4 million to the commission for matters arising under state law. The Commonwealth will continue to provide funding for matters of priority under Commonwealth laws. Negotiations with all states and territories towards new arrangements are progressing very well, which I am sure honourable members will be pleased to hear. In principle, we have agreement with South Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and New South Wales can obviously be added to that list. Negotiations are continuing constructively with the two remaining states, and I believe there will be a smooth transmission to the new arrangements from 1 July. Unemployment",69
120,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Isn't it the case that today's economic data, showing growth running at a pathetic 2.4 per cent, is little more than half the level needed to even begin making inroads into unemployment? Doesn't it mean the unemployment outlook is bleak under your government? When will you start to show leadership by creating jobs and getting the unemployment rate down, includand ing the youth unemployment rate that has grown by two per cent in your first 12 months of government?",69
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Both the Treasurer and I have had something to say objectively and, I think, very accurately about the message that comes out of the national accounts. It is clear, if you analyse the national accounts and you make allowances-as the Treasurer quite rightly did in his answer-for the impact of the change in the area of stocks and put that to one side, you can see some very, very positive signs. You can see that net exports made a very - trong contribution. The figures do confirm that consumer demand is picking up, and there is plenty of evidence around-including the most recent approvals figures-showing that the housing sector is beginning to experience quite a firm recovery. There is certainly some very bright news so far as the resource sector is concerned. It is true, as the honourable gentleman knows, that unemployment in this country remains too high. It is also true that high unemployment did not arrive on 2 March 1996. It is true, as the honourable gentleman knows, that high unemployment has been a feature of the Australian economic and political landscape for some time. In fact it reached more than 11 per cent when the honourable gentleman ran the ACTU and Kim Beazley was the employment minister. I do not think anybody who thinks about the unemployment problem should gainsay those undeniable facts. You need higher levels of economic growth in this country-nobody denies that-over a sustained period of time. You also need structural changes to the labour market, which have been begun by this government, the quality and breadth of which are now starting to filter through the business community. Some of the early critics of the Workplace Relations Act, some of those people who said that it did not go far enough, are now beginning to acknowledge the contribution that it will make to freeing the Australian labour market. Only on Monday I had a lengthy meeting with a very representative group of Australian businessmen and women, and the point was made at that gathering that many of the benefits of that act, after a period of five or six months of operation, are now becoming apparent. I might remind the House, remind the Australian people, remind the workers of Australia and remind the employers of Australia that the Australian Labor Party did everything it could to stop that act coming into force. The Australian Labor Party did everything it could to frustrate the coming into force of that legislation-as the Labor Party has done everything it can to frustrate the modifications that have already been made to the unfair dismissal laws and the further modifications that will be made in accordance with the announcement that I made at the time of the small business statement. Unemployment remains a significant economic and political challenge. In the 14 months that I have been Prime Minister, I have never gainsaid that fact. Until the goal that all of us have of a significant reduction in unemployment is reached, it will continue to have that high priority and major preoccupation with my government. In order to reduce unemployment in a sustained way over a long period of time you need higher growth, you need an infinitely more flexibility labour market and you also need taxation reform. One of the things that will help reduce unemployment in this country is the bringing about of taxation reform. That, of course, almost ineluctably brings me again to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked a question when he arrived this morning. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",69
122,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would be taking a point of order if I were you too. Mr MCMullan-Yes, you would because you would wish to point out, as I wish to, that this section of the answer is clearly not relevant. Raising taxes as a reform question on the matter of jobs fails to take into account the fact that countries without a GST, like the United States, have half the rate of unemployment of countries with one.",70
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are not going to debate the issue. I thank you for your point of order. The question centres on jobs creation and the prevailing economic environment with a particular emphasis on youth employment. The Prime Minister's answer is in order.,70
124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have said repeatedly that one of the criteria against which sensible tax reform in Australia has to be judged is whether it creates jobs. If we are interested in the long term and serious about creating jobs in this country we ought to ask ourselves whether or not the present taxation system promotes the creation of jobs. I think it is perfectly relevant to a question about jobs. Of course, I am therefore brought, ineluctably, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who had this to say this morning: How many hookers or drug peddlers are going to sit around filling out their 15 per cent VAT How many blokes with the lawn-mower in the back of the ute are going to be accommodating the tax system? That is a fascinating answer because not only has he used some rather crass examples but he completely demonstrates his utter ignorance of how the tax system works. Of course people who are into tax evasion do not sit around filling out their tax forms, whether they are VAT forms, GST forms, income tax forms or sales tax forms. The point I would simply make is that all of the people engaged in the three professional categories to which you referred in your answer, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, do not sit around filling out forms. I will tell you what they do do: they do go and buy restaurant meals, and they do go and purchase all sorts of other goods and services. In the process of doing so, they will incur a taxation liability. All I can say to the member for Werriwa is that, if you are trying to get an intelligent debate going on taxation reform in your party, give the Deputy Leader of the Opposition a very wide berth indeed. Living Wage Case Decision",71
125,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. The recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the living wage case ensured real wage increases for low-income earners. What is the government's position on the maintenance of the award system as a safety net for low-income earners in my electorate of Kingston? How does it contrast with other points of view?,71
126,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. It is very important to look at the way in which we are going to use our industrial relations system to improve the living standards of people in her electorate of Kingston and generally throughout the country. One of the good things about the recent living wage case decision of the Industrial Relations Commission was that it was a fair deal for low-income people. Because it was economically responsible it also paved the way for the interest rates cuts which were forms? later announced by the Reserve Bank. The point about having awards as merely a safety net is that this provides you with a system that looks after the people who need to be looked after. It also opens up the system for those beyond the safety net to do productivity based deals which give them the chance of earning more. We are not reinventing the wheel here. This used to be the policy so espoused by the opposition when they were in government, which is a policy they are now officially opposed to. You have the gang of four out there opposing the very reforms to the system which they themselves said would be good for low-income earners as well as which would give us a low inflation environment, thereby paving the way for better deals for people throughout the system, including particularly low-income people. You do not get a $292 benefit in terms of lower and reduced interest rates just as a result of circumstance: it is as a result of good policy in both the fiscal area and in the wages area, giving better outcomes. We have seen-when you make these comparisons with other points of view-the ACTU put their living wage claim into the AIRC. Who are they supported by? The ALP. We saw the TWU run a case which was directly opposed to a system that would give benefits to low-income people. Who supported the TWU? None other than the ALP. We have seen the ALP jettison enterprise bargaining, which they once said was good for lowincome people but which now, of course, is not populist. We have seen them abandon non-union certified agreements, which they themselves, in theory at least, once supported and which they now oppose. Essentially, what you have in this debate and with this point of view is the gang of four-the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the two ex-ACTU presidents-running the ACTU line. We know this is starting to generate a few problems within their own ranks. We have seen announced in the press today this sinister conspiracy by others who are mounting some economically literate argument against the gang of four position. There is a bit of unhappiness in the mid-party, cadre levels about economic policy and, in particular, industrial relations. What we now see is a challenge to the centralised wage system which, if you go back to the 1970s and the 1980s, was in fact the position of the ALP. The challenge, of course, is coming from none other than the member for Melbourne, backed up by the member for Werriwa. This is what the member for Melbourne had to say about wages policy. He said the party should: . . . accept that the detenuination of tenus and conditions in the higher-earning sector of the workforce will be much more dominated by the market than previously. The award system can no longer be a comprehensive prescription of tenus and conditions of employment for everyone ... Wages policy should focus primarily on using the award system to increase the real earnings of income workers. So there you have it. You have the economically literate running the proposition that the award should be the safety net, and you have the gang of four-including the two ACTU ex-presidents-running the same old Labor line, which is that you have to have a centralised wage-fixing system, you do not have real and genuine enterprise bargaining, you should have compulsory unionism and you should give as much power to the trade union bosses as they demand of you. In Labour terms, this is a return to a sort purist ideology. This is where they once were. This is the trip down nostalgia lane which the member for Melbourne referred to. But, as Gough Whitlam once said-and perhaps these immortal words were written by the member for Werriwa in his past life-at a time of yet another split in the party: 'Certainly, the impotent are pure.' Tax Pack",71
127,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Treasurer assure the House that the addition of more than 20 pages to the Tax Pack will, as claimed by the Commissioner of Taxation, make it simpler to understand?",72
128,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The additional 20 pages are designed to elucidate provisions of the taxation law and to assist people if they happen to be interested in those particular areas. Of course, it sounds as if it makes it much longer-and in fact it does-but can I point out that, as the member would know, taxpayers do not have to read every page. In fact, most taxpayers whose income consists solely of PA YE and have a bank account or two covered by an interest withholding tax would have very slight requirements, and they would not have to go to those pages. So I am optimistic. The tax commissioner is probably a touch more optimistic, but I am quite optimistic that those pages will actually assist. Natural Heritage Trust",72
129,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will recall the universal acclaim given the announcement of the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust and the critical lowimportance of the integrity and transparency of funding and accountability processes in its allocation-in contrast to those of the discredited former Labor Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories in the Keating government.",72
130,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,72
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Address the question.,72
132,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the minister assure the House that the Natural Heritage Trust will achieve fully the goals that have been established for this, the largest and most exciting of single environmental initiative in Australian history?",72
133,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And will you launch it again?,72
134,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Probably.,72
135,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Probably. I think we should all have a go. I think there are quite a few people who would like to do it. I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, establishment of the trust fulfils a key election commitment and one that, I believe, the Australian community has really been calling out for and looking for and is now delighted to see happen. But there have been some pretty wild and woolly claims around. Some of them seem to emanate from over there, and they seem to suggest that there is not really going to be as much money in it as we have claimed or that somehow in fact there might not be as much money in our package as, dare I say it, they were going to put in. Mr MCLachlan-The fourteenth year.",72
136,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That's right. Let us have a look at the fourteenth year, since you raise it. A couple of examples will suffice. Labor's forward estimates for the 1997-98 year showed $171 million on environmental programs. It was on the way down, but there was $171 million. This year, in that same year, we will spend $255 million, an increase of $84 million-a 50 per cent increase over what they claimed they were going to spend. But it gets better. Labor's forward estimates for the following year, 1998-99, were $147 million. That year, we will spend $267 million, an increase of 80 per cent. So let us knock firmly on the head any suggestion that somehow we are not really going to spend as much as they are. We are spending a lot more, despite the problems that we faced as a government in repairing your black hole and the undoubted pressures that put on our outlays. I will tell you something else. Not only is our environment program a massive increase on your proposals; it is very important to note that it is a fully-funded program. Your entire budget strategy was to spend more money on Australia's Bankcard. You wanted to impose the debt on future generations. Now the next point is that the Commonwealth's Natural Heritage Trust funding will be complemented-this is very important-by resources provided by state governments and community groups and farmers in partnership as part of a concerted effort. So, overall, the level of resources devoted to this task will be enormous. Mr Crean-Page two.",73
137,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. That's right. We haven't finished. Most of the trust funds are available to the wider community as grants through programs such as the national landcare program, the national vegetation and national rivercare initiatives and Murray-Darling 2001. Coming to the other issue raised by the honourable member, I make this point. The process is open, transparent and accountable. Applications from community groups and others will be assessed and prioritised by community-dominated regional and state assessment panels. They will have access to specialist technical advice and projects will be assessed against national, state and regional priorities. There is no political involvement whatsoever. It is a process of integrity. It builds on structures that have been in place for a long time, structures that you largely put in place with bipartisan support from us. It is worth noting that over 5,000 applications are now in. They will be properly and rigorously processed. People at the grassroots levelwhere the action is needed-are clearly getting on with the job. Employment Growth",73
138,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The question concerns the growth in employment of only 92,000 in the first 14 months of this government and the budget forecast for employment growth of 2111 per cent in each of the next two years. Is the Prime Minister aware that, if these budget forecasts for employment growth are delivered, his government will have achieved 443,000 additional jobs at the end of three years compared with 733,000 additional jobs in Labor's last term of office? How does he equate this projected shortfall of 290,000 jobs with his pre-election promise to boost jobs growth?",73
139,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That question might well have been directed to my colleague the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who I thought spent the best part of the first 12 months that we were in government effectively debunking the myth of massive job generation during the years of the Labor Party. Let me take the opportunity, which the member for Gellibrand's question affords me, of saying a few things about the future and saying a few things about measures that have been announced, will come on stream and into effect over coming months, and will, in the assessment of the government, have a beneficial impact upon jobs, particularly in rural and regional Australia. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy drew attention in an earlier answer to a new rural policy statement, which will be made in the second half of this year, which will involve, over a number of years, an investment of some $200 million. That will have a very beneficial impact on job generation in country Australia. There will be a regional forest agreement in Tasmania, to be signed soon, which will give greater certainty for investment in that state and greater certainty for the environment in that state. The minister for primary industries has already referred to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. I wonder, in the context of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, whether the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats realise that, in voting against it, you were voting against the generation of Australian jobs. I wonder whether you realise that, in voting against that measure, you were voting against the creation of potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs in rural and regional Australia. I wonder whether every time you join the divisions against that measure, both here and in the Senate, you realise how hostile your behaviour appeared then and will continue to appear to people who live in rural and regional Australia. Further down the track there will be the $1 billion Federation Fund for projects of national significance. I know it is not really the custom of those who sit opposite to think about the future. I know it is not really the custom of those who sit opposite to focus on some of the positives. As I said in answer to a question from the member for Batman, I do not pretend for a moment that unemployment does not remain a very significant social and economic challenge. The reality is that we have established the fundamentals. We have tackled the budget problem. We have kept inflation low. We have presided over significant falls in interest rates. The benefits of those falls in interest rates are traditionally delayed by something like a year or 18 months. As they begin to flow through, as the other measures that we have put in place begin to flow through, as the job-generating consequences and flowthrough effects of some of the proposals that I have canvassed in this answer begin to flow through, and putting all of those together, I believe that they will make a much brighter and more positive contribution to the jobs outlook in Australia. I know those who sit opposite are gloomy at the prospect that any measure announced might have a beneficial effect on the labour market of Australia. I simply remind you that 11.1 per cent under your leader was the postrecession high of unemployment. Just remember that it was not until Kim Beazley became employment minister that unemployment in Australia went over 11 per cent. That is a shameful record and one about which you will constantly be reminded. Christmas Island",73
140,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Can the minister advise the House as to what the current economic position is in respect of Christmas Island? What recent initiatives has the government taken to improve the economy in this area of my electorate?",74
141,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question. His question related to the Indian Ocean island teqitories, which are made up of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Island. The decision in the budget was to increase the allocation for Christmas and Cocos islands by $3 million, in addition to the amount of about $30 million already paid to those islands to improve health services, education services, local government and other such services. Those members who have some knowledge about Christmas Island will know that it has a phosphate mine on it. We are just in the process of finalising the extension of a lease for the continuation of the mine, which is a centrepiece of the economics of Christmas Island for a further 25 years. In so doing, we have required of the mine a program for dust suppression. Those who have visited Christmas Island will know that that has been a major problem. The mine has entered into agreements to do that. That will underpin, in a most positive way, the future economics of Christmas Island. Also, the considerable difficulties with the Christmas Island resort have now been resolved, and that resort reopened at the weekend. Westpac Bank, for example, have continued with their banking services, to the delight of all on Christmas Island. On Cocos Island, in the last 12 months we have proceeded with a land release program, and those properties have been sold. Also, there has been an upgrading of planning on both islands to foster their economic development. What is important in both of those islands is the continuation of a strategy to improve economic well-being so that the services and opportunities put Islanders in a position where they can enjoy services at a comparable level to the rest of Australians. The Indian Ocean island territories are a remote part of Australia and this government is proud that, in the last 12 months since the election, we have been able to further this strategy. I do thank the member for the Northern Territory, who has, since he assumed the position, taken a keen interest in the welfare of those on Cocos and Christmas islands. His representations have been listened to and we have been able to deliver the goods to those islands. Diesel Fuel Rebate",74
142,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen media reports today which describe the government's decision to cap the diesel fuel rebate as a public policy disaster, penalising the minerals and resources industries with a higher level of government charges, yet another abandoned promise and an unprincipled tax grab? Prime Minister, why do you not strike a blow for jobs, investment and exports and keep your personal word not to cap the diesel fuel rebate?",75
143,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the honourable member for Perth that in some of the correspondence that I had with the chairman of the Mining Council a reference was made to the very thing that the member said I had broken my word on, so I completely reject that suggestion. The fact is that, when you look at the totality of the impact of budget measures on different industry sectors, the resource sector has been treated very well, indeed, by this government. The resource sector has been very generously treated by this government, and quite rightly so. You cannot have it both ways. Last week you were up here asking a question based on the proposition that the resource sector was booming. Now you reckon it is falling apart. Make up your mind. Paradise Road",75
144,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer the minister to a review published by an English critic which claimed that, while watching the film Paradise Road, 'one is mostly struck by the script's mounting improbabilities'. What has been the reaction of Australian veterans, particularly former prisoners of war, to this film? Do they regard it as an accurate portrayal of life in a prisoner of war camp?",75
145,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Adelaide for her question. I draw the House's attention to her long interest in commemorating the sacrifices of service nurses and servicewomen and also her support for the recently unveiled memorial in South Australia to ex-service women. I have seen the film review referred to by the member for Adelaide. There have also been other reviews which have questioned the film's portrayal of the brutality and suffering endured by those who experienced life in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. These reviews have caused veterans, particularly former prisoners of war, a great deal of hurt. For them, the memories are still very vivid and very painful but, for some ill-informed film reviewers, they do not want us to forget or to cleanse those stories. The Bruce Beresford written and directed film Paradise Road is being released throughout Australia this week. It tells the story of a group of Australian and allied nurses, civilians and children imprisoned in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Sumatra during W orId War II. Veterans and former service nurses who have seen the film, in fact some who were prisoners of war in the camp on which the film is based, say it is an accurate record of what happened. That should be good enough for the film critics. It is the opinion of those who were there that is important. We must never underestimate the importance of telling history as it really was. Current and future generations of Australians need to understand history.",75
146,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,76
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Banks! The member for Rankin! There will be a couple of boofheads out of here in a moment. The minister will resume his seat. I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Rankin. Do that again and you will be in deep trouble. The member for Rankin thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,76
148,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Current and future generations need to understand the historyMr Albanese-This is a history lesson!,76
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Grayndler will join him in a moment.,76
150,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They need to know what really happened. It is only through the accurate recording of history that we will ensure that it never happens again. I saw the film last week. It is very powerful. The film is a great credit to the Australian film industry. It is produced, directed and written by Australians and features some of Australia's best acting talent. I commend the film to Australians and I also commend the film to members of this House. Universities",76
151,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Contrary to the assertions of Senator Vanstone, is the true state of Australia's university sector not reflected in the enrolment application figures released last night by DEETYA? Minister, how does the government explain this year's 3.4 per cent drop in university applications including an 11 per cent fall in South Australia, a five per cent drop in New South Wales and Victoria and a large eight per cent fall for mature age students? Do these figures not confirm the view of your own appointee, Roderick West, that your policies have damaged universities in Australia and what the country needs 'is a strong publicly funded university system counter to the user pays trend'?",76
152,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is nice to see the young and the restless finally being given a go. The tactic of going to the media has obviously succeeded for the member for Werriwa, so I suggest that he keep it up and he might get another question soon.",76
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will address the question.,76
154,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the question that the member for Werriwa asked shows, once again, how completely out of.touch with the realities of university reform the Labor Party is. Let us put a few clear facts on the record because the reforms that the government has put in place and that Senator Vanstone has presided over have been designed to widen access to universities.",76
155,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question concerned the very serious issue of what has happened to university enrolments and the minister needs to address this issue.",76
156,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,76
157,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He misled the House last week,76
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. Government members-Withdraw!,76
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right.,76
160,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's reforms to universities are designed to expand access to universities for students, to allow Australians to invest in higher education and to improve resourcing for the university sector. In other words, they reflect the government's determination to break out of the bureaucratic, centralised, discriminatory system that you had in place and give Australians a chance to actually get the higher education that they want. Let us put the facts on the record. Enrolments in universities this year are up 12,000Mr Latham-Applications are down.",77
161,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, let us just look at the actual enrolments, the number of students who have actually got access. It is up 12,000. In fact, the universities have over-enrolled this year by 26,000 on top of that. So that is another 26,000 students who have got access to the universities. And what about university resources this year? Well, the university sector is estimated this year to have some additional $250 million in revenue on last year from their teaching activities. There are more Commonwealth funded places in universities this year than last year. The number of enrolments is up. University revenue is up. The government is achieving its objectives in the universities. I finish by saying that the member for Werriwa shows why the battlers of Australia turned against the Labor Party at the last election. He is absolutely fixated with the 30 per cent of students who go on to university and has had nothing to say since he has been in the portfolio that would be of the slightest benefit to the 60 per cent of students who leave school and do not go on to university or full-time TAPE and who are going into the unemployment queues. It is this government that has had to take the action to provide these students with the literacy and numeracy skills they need to get jobs and to expand their vocational opportunities. If you can't do better than that, you are going to lose your reputation as one of the opposition's very bright sparks.",77
162,Mr LA THAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. How does the minister explain the 3.4 per cent drop in university enrolment applications, a figure released last night by DEETYA?",77
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,77
164,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER Mr Downer-What about the enrolments? Mr Latham-The question is about applications. Mr Downer-Don't you want people to aspire to universities?,77
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Foreign Affairs.,77
166,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do it slowly, David.",77
167,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will try to take him through it very, very slowly. Because of the expansion in vocational education offerings that the government is supporting, there will be some 55,000 more students in TAPE this year than there were last year-students put in their first, second and other preferences. The key thing is that under your policies tens of thousands of students were locked out of universities. They are now in universities. The important thing is enrolments and resources that underpin quality. All you want to do is go around closing schools, spreading disinformation and, I regret to say, talking to the media about your senior colleagues. Roads",77
168,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Can the minister inform the House of progress in the government's program of roads of national significance, vital to regional Australia? Are state governments cooperating with the federal government in the program?",77
169,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. He has taken a deep interest in roads in his electorate, as have a number of members on the government side in their electorates. As the member for Page correctly points out, these roads are vital to regional Australia because they are the artery to the economy of Australia. This government, prior to the last election, had a policy to establish a new category for Commonwealth road funding called 'roads of national importance'. Chief amongst them was the establishment of a fund to upgrade the Pacific Highway. In partnership with both the New South Wales and Queensland governments, this coalition government has fulfilled its election promise of allocating some $3.1 billion towards upgrading the Pacific Highway over the next 10 years to bring it up to a standard it should have been a long time ago. Indeed, this is something that the previous Labor government could have done but failed to do. Like so many other promises they are now making, they say they would have done it had they had a 14th or 15th·year of office. The member for Page is also concerned about other roads of national importance and, in particular, one in his electorate called Summerland Way. This government, in order to fulfil its commitments made prior to the last election, has allocated funds to upgrade the Summerland Way, an important link from the honourable member's electorate to Brisbane and other parts of Queensland. We have allocated funds to upgrade that road over the next four years. Unfortunately, there have been some difficulties in getting the New South Wales government to cooperate in this program-as usual, Labor not putting the resources where they are most needed to upgrade these important roads. However, last Friday officials from my department and officials from the Roads and Traffic Authority in New South Wales met. I now call on the New South Wales government to come good with their promise of some $50 million towards the upgrade of the Summerland Way. I call upon them to fulfil their commitment and come up with the other funds that the Commonwealth is now prepared to make available to see the Summerland Way improve, according to the wishes of not only the honourable member for Page but indeed many people throughout northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, who see the vital importance of upgrading this road for the local economies in that regional part of Australia. Fair Trading",77
170,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Customs. I refer the minister to a case study within the fair trading inquiry report, Finding a balance. A gift shop called Glasshouse had traded successfully and dispute free for 13 years at the Garden City Shopping Centre at Booragoon in Western Australia. Despite offering to pay more rent, they were told to change to a far worse location or face eviction by the centre management. They were evicted in May 1996. Will you help this type of small business by adopting the unanimous recommendations of the fair trading inquiry, particularly given media reports which state that the recommendations have 'overwhelming majority' support within the government backbench?  the his question. He would be aware that tenancy issues are covered by state legislation. If he will recall, when I set up the inquiry in May of last year I said that generally we think there are three important areas that should be looked at: tenancy, franchising and fuel retailing. They are matters that have come up. They have strong representations in that area. The West Australian shops and tenancy legislation has been under review in the past. There have been representations made in regard to that. I think the recommendation with regard to national consistency in tenancy matters is a sensible one and I have generally no concerns at all with putting that sort of matter forward. You might recall that this matter also came up in the Bell report. Indeed, it is one that will be on the agenda for the summit meeting with my state colleagues, I am sure. We are wanting to ensure there is a fair, reasonable and transparent arrangement for tenants, particularly tenants in shopping centres, that is fair to both parties. Much of what the opposition is trotting out now happened during their period of government. If they think these problems happened in the last 12 months, they are sadly mistaken. They 'are issues that they walked away from for a long timeMr Martin- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: my question went to the findings of a parliamentary committee of this House, a joint parliamentary committee that produced unanimous recommendations. The particular recommendations go to the last 14 or 15 months as well as to the last term of government.",78
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cunningham. Minister, in conclusion.  the former minister for small business, the member for Rankin, who is unfortunately no longer here, made a telling point in the House. I would like to read from Hansard that point to the parliament. The member for Rankin, Mr Beddall, said: The Hawke government, to its credit, tried to tackle these issues-without overwhelming success, and I am the first to admit that. They have admitted they are a failure. Why on earth don't they support us in doing what we are trying to do for small business? One-stop Shop DSS Facilities",79
172,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Minister, was the government's decision to fund the establishment of a new one-stop shop DSS office in my electorate of Gilmore merely a one-off project or was it part of a wider commitment to provide services in rural Australia?",79
173,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I can assure the House that, in relation to the developments that have occurred in establishing a new one-stop arrangement, there areMr Albanese-Where is it?",79
174,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In Nowra, in the member's electorate-and numbers of others will be established around Australia. They are designed to ensure that we are able to receive very beneficial arrangements through the delivery of social security services and services through the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and to ensure that people do not have to wander from one place to another, from a CES office to a Social Security office, for the provision of their entitlements. What we see already is a very considerable advantage as a result of the delivery of services in this most effective way. Unfair Dismissals",79
175,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to Prime Minister. On 28 February 1996 your then shadow minister Peter Reith said: If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal. How does the government justify denying a right of appeal to a child-care worker dismissed for an unsubstantiated allegation to which she had no opportunity to respond, as occurred in the case of Schafer vs Coliero?",79
176,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say a couple of things to the member for Canberra. I invite him to understand, as I am sure he does but perhaps will not admit, the difference between unlawful termination and unfair dismissal. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",79
177,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is the point of order? He doesn't like the answer. This will be a ripper. Mr MCMullan-The point of order is that the Prime Minister is referring to the distinction between unfair and unlawful dismissals. On a point of order of relevance, my question did not refer in the slightest to unlawful dismissals, only to unfair dismissal.",79
178,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Canberra. There is no point of order.,79
179,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course there is no point of order. I repeat that I think a lot of those who sit opposite, including the member for Canberra, do not understand the difference between unfair dismissal and unlawful termination. One of the myths, one of the lies, one of the misrepresentations and distortions that the Labor Party has spread is that there is no provision left in the legislation, after our current and projected changes, in relation to unlawful terminations. The member for Canberra-I thank himgives me the opportunity again to remind the House of the value to small business of the reforms we have made in the area of unfair dismissal. Mr Dargavel-What about the worker?",79
180,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The workers I am worried about are the workers who have been denied jobs because of your stupid laws. They are the workers I am worried about. I am worried about the thousands of young men and women around Australia who were denied jobs when you were in government. They were denied jobs because small employers were frightened to take them on. No amount of phoney, grubby scare campaigning by the Labor Party can alter the fact that the laws you brought in discriminated against the young unemployed. The laws you brought in intimidated small business people out of taking on young people. The law that we have proposed, which you intend to knock off in the Senate, would have created hundreds, potentially thousands, more jobs. What is your answer to that? Your answer is to vote against it. What is your answer to our every attempt to create jobs for young people via the Natural Heritage Trust, via better unfair dismissal law and via many other changes? Your answer is to vote against it. The reason you vote against it is that Jennie George told you to do so. The very day that the legislation was brought out, that was made painfully apparent in the doorstops that you and Senator Cook conducted. She came right over the top and said, 'You've got to vote against it.' Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Members and Guests Dining Room: Dried Apricots",79
181,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I direct a question to you, Mr Speaker, in your capacity as supervising the caterers to the Members and Guests Dining Room, in particular, purchasing practices and policies. By way of background, last week the member for Wakefield, the member for Riverina and I hosted some constituents from our electorates who are processors in the dried fruit industry. We the three members in this parliament who represent the great dried fruit industry. We had a meeting about the future of the industry and we offered them the hospitality of the Members and Guests Dining Room. At the end of the meal I ordered a platter of dried fruit. Mr Speaker, you need to be aware of the embarrassment caused to the member for Wakefield, me and the member for Riverina to be told that the apricots were not Australian. Most members of this House would not be aware how to identify a non-Australian apricot. Opposition members-Tell us.",80
182,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! I am sure that the honourable member for Mallee is very quickly attacking his question.,80
183,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, this is the Australian parliament. It offers us a great opportunity to demonstrate the wonderful produce produced here to the visitors who come to this place. I am asking you to inquire as to whether the caterers can have a distinctly Australian purchasing policy. I am asking you to exercise your influence on that matter.",80
184,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I will take the question on notice, refer it to the appropriate House committee and come back to the member, either privately or to the House in total. Parliament House Cleaning Services",80
185,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I direct a question to you which relates to the recurrence of the dispute between Limro Cleaning Services and the cleaners of this parliament. I have a series of questions that are very relevant to all members as well as to those workers. Are you aware that Limro has proposed to change the hours of work for cleaners from four to eight each morning, so they conclude before the offices are in use, to from six until 10, so they will be cleaned while members are at work in their offices? Has Limro lied when they told those workers that they made that change at the request of the Joint House Department, because Joint House has denied that allegation? Do you support this change? Do you realise that many cleaners will not be able to change their hours because of their family responsibilities and are therefore will have to quit? Are you aware that those cleaners who can and do make the change will lose $70 a week because of the loss of penalties? Are you aware that many of these cleaners, mainly women, have approximately seven years service and will be eligible for pro rata long service leave if they were terminated but not if they resign? Is it also the case that any financial benefits from this inconvenience to members and this injustice to staff will go to Limro and not to the parliament or the taxpayer?",80
186,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Canberra for his multifaceted question. I will take most of it on notice. Members would be aware that there are some ongoing disputes between the Limro organisation and their employees. I understand that yesterday Limro advised their cleaning staff in Parliament House of a proposal to take effect in four weeks time of a change to their early shift start time from 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. The union called a stop-work meeting for the morning. At that meeting the cleaners resolved to take indefinite strike action until Limro withdraws the proposal. The Joint House Department is still to discuss the proposal with the Parliament House occupants to determine its workability. Strike action started at 8 a.m. today. However, the cleaning of the building was substantially completed before 8 a.m. Some staff have reported for duty. During the day they, together with Limro supervisors and management, will concentrate on toilet cleaning and the emptying of waste paper bins throughout the building. The dispute has been listed for hearing by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in Canberra for 3 p.m. this day. As I get further information, I will update that information for you and the House as appropriate. Questions on Notice",81
187,Mr LA THAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I direct a question to you relating to standing order 150. There are two questions of mine on the Notice Paper, Nos. 577 and 943, that have been sitting there for more than 60 days. I would ask you, under the standing orders, to write to the relevant ministers.",81

190,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,81
191,Mr LATHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do.",81
192,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed.,81
193,Mr LATHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Today in Question Time the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) claimed that I intend to close a number of schools. This was a fabrication repeated by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) on 2HD radio yesterday morning. This is a complete myth and misrepresentation of what I had to say in my speech on schools policy on 28 April. I quote from that speech: If citizens wish to establish-in the name of choice---exceptionally small and narrow schools in Australia it should not be at an opportunity cost on public budgets. The ALP maintains a minimum enrolment benchmark of 50 students. This is the same policy that the ALP had in government, designed to open new nongovernment schools and ensure in small country towns that government schools had the best chance of staying open.",81
194,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member for Werriwa has pointed out where he has been misrepresented.,81
195,Mr LATHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have been misrepresented and the House has been misled by the minister because he knows that it is a policy that opens schools, not closes them.",81

197,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question to you is in reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing that is conducting an inquiry into the amalgamation of parliamentary departments. I understand that that committee is going to report on 26 June. Given that this date is very close to the end of the present parliamentary sitting, what action do you propose to involve members in this House in reviewing any recommendations contained in this rerort?",81
198,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his question and recognise the great significance he places on this reform. As I understand it, the assertions you make are accurate. If we have a favourable outcome from the Senate committee, then I will update all members as soon as I possibly can with our intentions. I would hope to begin to implement the organisational changes hopefully with effect from I July. It may extend a little beyond that, depending on the nature and the complexity of the changes that we need to address if substantial changes are introduced by the Senate. Parliamentary Departments Mr LEO MCLEA Y-My question follows on from the question of the honourable member for Cunningham. As the Senate is involving all senators in the inquiry of their appropriations and staffing committee, how will you involve members of this House in these far-ranging changes that are being foisted upon you by the government? I see the Leader of the House is sitting over there grinning his head off, but what do you intend to do to allow members to participate in this process in the same way that the Senate has?",82
199,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Watson and also recognise his continuing interest in this challenging outcome. All members have been invited to apprise my office of any contribution that they would like to make to the fundamental documents. The outcome that is being addressed within the Senate at the moment will provide perhaps a catalyst for us to take further action, and it may be appropriate to refer some of that information to members for further comment. But at the moment nothing is being foisted on me or my office. We are quietly confident that the reorganisation will be substantially as we propose. Mr Leo MCLeay-The Transport Office hasn't been foisted upon you?",82
200,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Nothing has been foisted on me other than the referral of the report to the Senate committee, which was always against the best interests of a satisfactory outcome. House of Representatives Transport Office Mr LEO MCLEA Y-A further question, Mr Speaker. Will you advise the House of what arrangements are being made in relation to the Transport Office? Members understand that the Transport Office will be closing at the end of this sitting fortnight and so far we have heard nothing official from you or the government about that. Is that a fact? If it is a fact, what arrangements are being made and when will you advise members?",82
201,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Watson. I understand that there is a possibility that the Department of Administrative Services and a provider of services will reach a satisfactory outcome some time in the near future which will have an impact on the way we make both our transportation bookings and our air travel bookings. Until I have definitive information at hand, I am not in a position to advise you one way or the other. But, as soon as the information comes to hand, all members will be apprised simultaneously. Visitors to Parliament House",82
202,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, you could perhaps take this question on notice. Could you provide all members with a breakdown of visitors to the parliament, the visitors to the chamber and a differentiation between school and non-school visitors on sitting days for the last five years?",82
203,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Does the member for Newcastle have a particular purpose in mind?,82
204,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I am concerned at the lack of attendance in this building which I have noticed when moving around this building when parliament is sitting. I suspect it may be contributing to Canberra's economic downturn. I am sure the figures are available, and I ask that they be made available to all members.",82
205,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"If the information is readily retrievable, then I will make very effort to make sure that the member's question is answered. This building is one of the most popularly visited establishments in the country, and we do keep a range of definitive information. Divisions",82
206,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question relates to the response you gave to this morning's request by the right honourable member for New England that you 'advise when and in what circumstances we take two successive divisions without the application of the new procedures of counting'; namely, your reply that, 'The honourable member for Dobell actually began to debate the issue and that automatically ruled out a successive division. Notwithstanding the fact that the bells were allowed to ring for one minute, it does require a separate count.' Could you confirm that standing order 200 requires that the doors be closed and locked for the counting of a division after the lapse of four minutes, and the ringing of the bells for one minute is provided for in sessional order 203A which relates only to successive divisions? Mr Leo MCLeay-Is she giving you an advisory position?",83
207,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Wait a minute. I have waited long enough. Now you can just wait a minute. Since the time for the ringing of the bells for the different types of divisions is mandated by the sessional and standing orders, could you please advise the House why the bells for the division I have referred to were rung for one minute and not four minutes, if it was not a 'successive' division? In considering your response to this question, would you please inform the House whether pages 4400 to 4404 of the Hansard for 2 June 1997 and pages 8449 to 8456 of the Hansard for 12 December 1996 might indicate that the conduct of any of the divisions detailed there were out of order? What is the validity of a division which has not been conducted in accordance with the requirements of the House's sessional and standing orders? What are the consequences or implications for matters deemed to have been passed by this House if the conduct of any of the relevant divisions did not conform with sessional and standing orders?",83
208,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for her totally unexpected question. Members would realise that the sessional divisions are still in a state of flux. I think that the honourable member for Prospect called the first one within the last 48 hours or so. After the division this morning, we reviewed the circumstances and, while I will not address all of the questions that you have raised-I will take the balance of those on notice-I do have a comment that I would like to make, and I do thank you for your question. The trial arrangement for the abbrevia,,- 1 taking of a successive division is set out i sessional orders 203A and 203B and was used for the first time this week. Sessional order 203A provides that, where successive divisions are taken and there is no intervening debate after the first division, the bells for the ensuing division shall be rung for one minute only. Sessional order 203B makes provision for an abbreviated taking of the count for a successive division in circumstances where members are voting in the same way as they did in the preceding division. An example of such circumstances would be where a government motion is closured followed immediately by a vote on the motion itself with the government members voting the same way. The point at issue relates to the interpretation of the words in sessional order 203A 'where there is no intervening debate'. Taken literally, this means that any debate such as the seconding of a motion or the moving of the closure amounts to intervening debate, and the shortened method of conducting the division does not apply. This is the way in which I applied the sessional orders this morning. I recognise that there may thought to be some inconsistency between my application of the new sessional order in respect of the actual counting and the practice of the chair adopted under the old standing order 200A of frequently, but not always, ordering the bells to be rung for one minute only for a following division. This is a practice which the House has developed over some years. Because of the newness of the counting methods provided for in sessional order 203B, the House has not yet had an opportunity to develop a practice in relation to the new counting arrangements. I assume from the comments that have been made that it is the wish of members that the new abbreviated counting method be used where there is no debate beyond formal words such as 'I second the motion'. In these circumstances, I will be happy to apply the abbreviated arrangements.",83

210,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's mismanagement of the Australian economy in its first year of office firmed by today's national accounts figures. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number a/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",84
211,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Australian our manufacturing industry, on today's figures, is in recession. One of the biggest sectors of employment in this nation is in recession. Indeed, if you look at the underlying figures as opposed to the quarter on quarter figures, you will see that it has been in recession three quarters. It is no wonder the governcent ment's performance in question time was so desultory. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) was standiHg up announcing a growth figure half the level of the year on year figure to March that the PAPERS previous government left--4.9 per cent down to 2.4 per cent. He defends himself not with reference to his own Treasury figures, which of course now stand in tatters, but with reference to another group which tells him that after three years in office he can look forward to the possibility that the government might well be able to achieve a level of growth that was in place for four successive years before they came into office-a level of growth which they have conceded as absolutely essential before they can make any serious dent on those tragic unemployment figures confronting this nation. They had no answers to a series of questions as to what they would do about the parlous state of the Australian manufacturing industry and what they would do about employment policy in general, as they stare at an unemployment figure of one million. They had no answers to those questions. Economy There was just a quiet, limp denunciation of the people who at least had a decent record on these matters when we were in office. The best that the government could do was to mislead people with the figures that they put forward. Let me take just one set of figures. They as conare very proud of their inflation rate. You would think, if you listened to the Treasurer in here day in and day out, that they had invented a low inflation environment in Australia. 'True,' they say to the workers who have missed out on jobs and to industrymanufacturing industry in particular, which is experiencing extraordinary difficultiesexperiencing all of that. But think of wonderful little inflation numbers. Think of those. Think of all that portends from that.' If you listened to them, you would think that they came into office with the sort of galloping inflation that we confronted when we came into office-John Howard's 11 per cent. for When we came into office there was 11 per unemployment, 11 per cent inflation and a $25 billion budget deficit. That was what Labor confronted when it came into office. Indeed, if you compared the participation rate then with the participation rate that we confronted on unemployment, you would see that, at the very worse nadir of the recession that we confronted six years ago, we would have confronted not an unemployment level of 11 per cent, which was our inheritance from then Treasurer John Howard, but an unemployment level of eight per cent. We were doing, as the former Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, that double backflip with pike. We were providing millions of new jobs in this country in extraordinarily difficult circumstances, as we confronted a revolution in labour force participation by women and an immigration rate twice the level of that which this government has had to cope with-that halving of that particular rate four or five years before they in fact took office. Let us go to this business about their one little kernel, that one little part of the nut, that they drag out to defend themselves. They say, 'Okay, there's ruination all around in manufacturing industry, unemployment is rising, but we've got a wonderful inflation figure. It's around about one to two per cent.' What were the figures in the four years? One year concluded with a growth rate of 4.9 per cent and all had a growth rate of four per cent or over. What were the inflation figures? They were two per cent, 2.1 per cent, 2.1 per cent and 3.2 per cent. Was it John Howard's 11 per cent? No, it was not John Howard's 11 per cent. It was virtually the same level of inflation they experience now. All those changes which took place in the labour market were changes that we put in place. We achieved those levels of inflation which you have simply been able to continue with and which have allowed the Reserve Bank to make adjustments to pick up your failure. What has allowed the Reserve Bank to make adjustments to pick up your failure has been the fact that you were left with a low inflation environment by us, thank you very much. That has put the Reserve Bank in a position-and it has more work to do-where it has been able to come in and fill the hole that you have left. Unfortunately, many other factors, apart from inflation rates, impact upon whether there is confidence in the business community and whether bringing down interest rates will create any opportunities for small business or for the manufacturing industry. Above all, there is the question of confidence. Whatever might be the stage that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister think they strut in this place, there is out there in the community a vote of no-confidence in this government. They are voting with their feet in the shops of the nation. They are walking out of consumption--consumption which is absolutely critical if we are going to see a better performance from business in the next year or two's figures. Can't you remember the smirking arrogance removed from the Treasurer's face here today for the first time in a very long time in answers to questions? Can't you remember the smirking, but in this case also smarting, arrogance from the Treasurer when he took on board a question related to our last set of growth figures, when we left the nation with a near five per cent growth level and bowed out of the place after 13 years of constructive office? What he said then was repeated by the shadow Treasurer here today. He got up in this place and leant across with that cat's smile on his face and said: 'I have to tell you--expect more of it.' Perhaps he might have said: 'Expect the sort of figures that you achieved in a quarter for a year under us.' We do expect more of them. We expect a great deal more of them. We expect a bit of industry policy out of them. We expect a bit of common sense in relation to job security out of them. Let me go to the heart of job security in this country. Job security is made up of many elements. One is that people have confidence that the business community is going to keep employing them. There are many factors associated with that. Some of it goes to the sorts of adjustment that have been made in the public sector-30,OOO jobs out of the public sector, 20,OOO-odd jobs out of Telstra. They take a look around the communities of this nation and wonder where the skilled jobs are going to come from. They wonder where jobs, particularly for middle aged men, are going to come from. They take a look at the decisions of the government. They take a look at the government's priorities and the government's priorities say this: 'If you are a public servant we will fire you. If you happen to be in an institution which we want to privatise we will fire you.' That is this government's position on employment. Then they move on and talk about the industrial relations changes that they made. Remember-the industrial relations changes we made produced two million jobs and produced an inflation level of two per cent while we were in office, which you happen to be building on. That is what our industrial relations policies did. And they produced growth in the manufacturing sector. And they produced a 10 per cent per annum increase in manufactured industry exports, down to a two per cent increase in this last year, or this first year of your period in office. That is what our position produced. But what has your industrial relations policy produced ? Your industrial relations policy has produced fear and anguish in the Australian community as to whether or not people will be protected if they have a job. We have a Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and a Prime Minister who got out there and said: 'Everything sings and dances.' They got out there after the government's industrial relations bill and said: 'What a terrific thing this industrial relations bill has been.' 'There won't be a second wave', said Peter Reith. 'There won't even be a ripple.' Remember the famous last words from the Treasurer: 'If this is growth, I have to tell you--expect more of it.' And from Peter Reith: 'There won't even be a ripple of a second wave as far as our industrial relations reforms are concerned.' The Prime Minister says: 'This is great news for small business.' What has happened three or four months later? They think that they are going to improve confidence in the community by declaring, 'Oh dear. What we thought was so good has been a failure. We are going to have to take it a point further.' That is what they have had to say. What they are saying to people out there whom they are trying to encourage to consume is: 'We are going to make it easier to fire you. That is what we are on about here. We are going to make you easier to sack.' What they say to those folk out there is: 'We are going to make you work harder. We are going to make you work till you die.' At the pension end the government will rip the dental benefits off pensioners. They will rip the position out from underneath pensioners in regard to access to their medicine. But they tell them: 'Good news, team. You can work for another five years.' This is to encourage other people to feel that this is a government serious about getting additional people into the work force, when they know darned well that those over-65s compete with what is now the most vulnerable area of the work force in the sense of job security, and that is not kids-though the figures for kids are bad enough. The real problem for job security in this community, which is impacting massively on family income and on community confidence, is, in the main, middle-aged men, in their 40s and 50s. There is nothing for them. These are the people who are employed in the car industry. These are the people who are employed in the shipbuilding industry. These are the people who, along with their female counterparts, are heavily employed in the textile industry. These are the people the Prime Minister will not go to see at Newcastle. What a statement from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister says to Ray Martin-he who must be answered-four weeks ago: 'I am about to go to Newcastle.' Mr Crean-Soon.",84
212,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"'Soon'. That was four weeks ago. But I will tell you where he is going soon. He is going to Lords soon. He is not going to Newcastle soon. Because what would he confront in Newcastle? He would confront the men that I have been talking about. He would confront the men who were told when we left office that the iron and steel situation was fine as far as they were concerned, from BHP to additional electric arc furnaces-in place a steel policy. The moment the hand is taken off the tiller, off they scupper. The moment a government leaves office with an industry policy and a willingness to use the bully pulpit to keep an industry policy in place, off they scupper overseas-to join the Prime Minister. What is left? What is left is insecurity. What is left is a trail of bad faith and that bad faith is a product of this government. But will the government talk about job security? The government will not talk about its budget. I do not blame them for that. Will they talk about job security? No, they will not. What is their solution? They come in and say, 'You can talk about job security. We'll talk about tax reform.' What? You have had two years in office. Where is the tax reform? You now say you have tax reform on the agenda. What tax reform? What is your proposition? We are slowly coming up to this ridiculous, bogus proposition that the GST is going to be a solution to employment problems. I can just see it now, the mantra: if you put in place a GST, what you are going to have is job security, more jobs. That is a statement of faith. It is not a statement of argument. It is not a statement of proof. You go and look at the big V AT countries in Europe. They have twice the rate of unemployment of the United States and, even after your paltry record, 50 per cent higher than the unemployment rates here. That is your solution. We cannot talk about jobs, we cannot talk about job security, we cannot talk about an industry policy-they have no industry policy-we cannot talk about our budget. So what will we talk about? We will talk about tax reform but without an idea, without a single proposition, but a small flirtation back to where we were before. And remember on that GST they promised there would be none of it. Winston Churchill used to say that it takes courage to rat, but it takes VC standard courage to re-rat. We have had that from the government on this question of a GST and we have had it from them on employment, a ratting and re-ratting on the workers of this nation and on the people who want access to the work force of this nation. They stand absolutely condemned by today's figures, and they have not a feather to fly with. (Time expired)",86
213,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"-If that was the resurrection speech, if that was the speech which was designed to boost the stocks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the stocks that we all know are flagging so much as those on the other side recognise that they are going nowhere and have to change their direction and rethink and rewrite their policies, then I would suggest the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) are in good positions still, as they were yesterday. I cannot put it any better than the honourable member for Melbourne when he warned the Labor Party: We must avoid becoming economically irrational, lapsing into mindless popUlism, recycling the policies of the 1950s and defining ourselves by what we don't like. All we heard for 15 minutes from the Leader of the Opposition was a trip down memory lane, some sort of justification of the policies that Labor had, the policies that led them to oblivion on 3 March last year. They have nothing to suggest in the context of what the economy is about today and where it is going. They simply want to revisit the failed policies that they had in place when they were last in government. We heard much from the Leader of the Opposition about doing something for employment. We heard it during question time today . We heard this defence of jobs that they were supposed to have created during this period when the facts show that, in the last six years of Labor, in net terms, 16,000 jobs were created. When they came out of that recession which, of course, they contributed significantly to, they had a 16,000 net improvement in jobs growth. In the first year of the coalition government, 128,000 jobs, this budget provides for some 200,000 jobs, and the ingredients are in place for that to happen. They are in place very much as a result of the national accounts March quarter released today. I look to the future because I do not intend to look through the rear window of the car like Labor. I want to look forward through that front windscreen and I want to show this House and everyone just where this government is taking this nation and its economy. It is a fact that we now have low inflation locked in. It is a fact that we now have low interest rates, very much the ingredient that encourages business investment, encourages people out there to invest in such things as housing, one of the most important economic indicators that we have and one of the most important industries. What low inflation and low interest rates will provide is sustainable economic growth. And we have this argument that we provided twice the growth in the last year. I will not give you the rhetoric on that. I will go straight to a statement released today by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry which says that the fact is that today showed that, on an annual basis with 0.9 per cent growth this quarter, we have now recorded 2.4 per cent. A question from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is: Do the official numbers reflect reality? They go on to say: ... the fact is, the economy this year is, if anything, growing more strongly than it was at the same time last year. Mr Gareth Evans-John, John!",87
214,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You don't want to hear this, do you? You do not like hearing it: . . . the economy is growing more strongly than it was at the same time last year when the official growth rate was measured to be twice as fast ... The economy will grow more strongly in 1996-97 than in 1995-96. Your big year. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) is arguing about the big year for Labor, the last year. They go on to say: Yet the official growth rate during the present financial year, as measured by the National Accounts, is almost certain to be significantly lower than it was during last year. The facts are, they say, that growth is higher this year than last year and they go forward. They argue: In 1995-96, when the economy was measured to have grown by this so-called figure of 4.9%, all of the following occurredand they are interesting factsAustralia recorded the highest level of bankruptcies in its historythat was Labor's last year, the highest level of bankruptcies in our historyemployment growth came to a virtual standstillwe know that in six years they managed to get the net figures up by 16,000. Further: every business survey, with no exception, showed major reductions in both confidence and activity, profitability fell by 16.4%, government revenue was two percentage points lower than forecast. So quite clearly, on the basis of the independent arbitrators on this debate, the last year of Labor was a complete failure and they are very, very happy with what has been shown by today's figures. The only argument that the Leader of the Opposition attempted to use in this debate was the figures in respect of manufacturing. Manufacturing was down 2.7 per cent for the quarter. But let us have a look at some of the real growth that occurred in the last quarter: construction, up 5.4 per cent; agriculture, up 3.6 per cent; accommodation and cafes, up 3.2 per cent; communication services, up 2.4 per cent; wholesale trade, up 2.3 per cent; personnel and other services, up 2.1 per cent; finance and insurance, up 2.1 per cent; education, up 1.8 per cent; retail trade-and we heard a little about that-up 1.7 per cent; transport and storage, up 0.7 per cent; and mining, up 0.4 per cent. There was growth in this year all areas of the economy . We can argue about the future for as long as we like. The simple facts are that the foundations are in place, as every sensible economic analyst out there will acknowledge. Of course, the only nonsensical economic analysts in this particular debate are on the Labor side of the House. When you have low inflation locked in and low interest rates locked in-interest rates that have delivered $292 per month after-tax as a benefit to those who are seeking to purchase a house or to those with the average mortgage at the present time-then I would say to you that that is one of the healthier signs I have seen in all of the time. I have been watching the management of the economy, and that is all of my adult life. What we know from today's figures was very clearly stated by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his media release today. We have very favourable prospects for the forthcoming year. The economy is very much poised for an acceleration in growth. As I have indicated already, the forward indicators in the housing area-not just based upon the mortgage relief that has been provided in a significant way by the economic policies of this government but on the economic indicators for housing activity--confirm that the housing recovery continues to strengthen. We have seen domestic final demand in exports grow very rapidly during the quarter by 2.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively. The one downside in today's figures is that there is an indication clearly that stock growth is likely to resume in coming quarters. It is an unreliable indicator, but there is a clear indication that it will return. Even in the event-as the Treasurer said in question time today-that the stocks were unchanged in the June quarter, stocks would still add about one percentage point to GDP(E) growth in the quarter. We have seen both private and public final demand grow strongly in the last quarter. We have seen equipment investment up some 3.1 per cent. We have seen a sharp rebound in non-residential construction investment-up 11.2 per cent. We have seen a strong private consumption growth-up one per cent. We have seen accelerating growth in dwelling investment-up 5.2 per cent. We have seen, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated in question time, growth in exports. That is most important for rural and regional Australia, and it contributes so significantly to what is occurring in terms of our growth in this economy. So the future does look bright. If you go back to the budget, the budget indicates 3% per cent growth in the economy during the year ahead. They are the exact ingredients we need to ensure that that growth occurs. We will see very clearly by the end of this financial year a growth of over three per cent. The member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) continually likes to take one quarter in isolation, but he dropped off the March quarter for last year, which had a growth of 1.7 per cent. That was a high growth quarter. I suspect that confidence and that investment all came with a rush after 2 March 1996 or as an expectation of what was going to happen on 2 March. If you take this particular growth of 0.9 per cent, we are exactly on track for that sustainable growth with all of the right ingredients in place. That is despite the fact that we have inherited a deficit of $10.5 billion. We have inherited five consecutive deficit budgets from the Labor government. We have inherited an increase in general government debt of $70 billion in that five-year period. We have seen the growth in debt servicing increase from $5.3 billion in 1991 to just under $10 billion by the time the government changed. We have addressed those problems of debt and deficit by turning that $10.5 billion deficit around in the space of three budgets to a surplus of $1.6 billion. We have reduced the reliance on debt to the extent that we have increased national savings with a public sector contribution. At the same time, we have delivered tax reform to the families of this country . We have given all that we promised and then considerably more in the way of relief, including tax relief, and benefits to the small business sector. We have indicated very, very clearly that this is a government that will not spend what it does not have. This is a government that will act responsibly in all matters fiscal. This is a government that is not going to throw a bucket of money at unemployment problems, as the member for Hotham did when he was the minister responsible. This is a government that is responsible to the self-funded retirees and prepared to give those at that age in our community some considerable relief. We have given relief in the context of the threshold in which they have to pay tax. We have given them a tax rebate in terms of their savings. So we have looked after the needy in the community. We have shared the load equally across the board. We have addressed the debts and the deficits of Labor, the inheritance we received and the disastrous state of the economy and the Commonwealth's finances. At the same time, we have put in place those ingredients that will ensure sustainable growth for the years ahead. Let me now go back to some of the other comments that were made by the Leader of the Opposition. He spoke very passionatelyendeavouring as he was to sustain his current leadership, which is under threat-of the fact that there was a need for job security. There was no job security under Labor. Under Labor we saw jobs die. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) knows all about this; we saw them simply go out the door in large numbers, year after year, before, throughout and subsequent to the recession.

We have seen the support for the textile industry. So the backflips go on. You made a mess of it and now you are going back to what contributed so significantly to the mess you made of our economy and of the Commonwealth's finances in an attempt to try and find some sort of support out there which, of course, is not forthcoming and will not be forthcoming.

222,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When are we going to see that growth the Treasurer told us we could expect so much more of? When are we going to see that growth the Treasurer said was going to be boosted under the coalition government? When are we going to see the jobs? When are we going to tum that endlessly receding comer? When are we going to get results from this particular government? We certainly have not had any results to date. What we have with these national accounts figures is, for the first time now, at the end of a 12-month period of this government being in office, the record. It is no longer the prediction, it is no longer the forecast, it is no longer the expectation and it is no longer the possibility-it is the record. And what a record it is. A growth rate over those last 12 months of just 2.4 per cent. The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance say, 'Well, you had to expect it to come back to that because that big quarter you had in March last year dropped out.' That big quarter we had in March last year was the last quarter of the Labor government. What has now dropped into the accounts is the first quarter of your government. What makes up the rest of the 12-monthly accounts are the second and the third and the fourth quarters of your government. What do those four quarters add up to? They add up to 2.4 per cent. How does that compare with what we achieved in our last year in government? We achieved 4.9 per cent. It is less than half the amount. Of course the quarter of growth that we were last associated with has dropped out; that is what happens when the calendar ticks over. Sooner or later you have to bear the responsibility. It is all your own work. Growth of 4.9 per cent was us: 2.4 per cent is all your own work. It is on the record and, my God, have people noticed it. In our last four years in government we achieved four per cent. In your first year in government it was 2.4 per cent. The government that pledged itself to boosting the economy has flattened the Australian economy. It is even worse so far as manufacturing industry is concerned. You have not just flattened it: you have sent it into recession. Two quarters of negative growth for manufacturing, minus 2.2 per cent for the whole year. The Prime Minister, who has conceded that we have to sustain growth at four to five per cent if we are going to make a lasting inroad into unemployment, as he says, has presided over an economy growing at just half that necessary rate. Even if, looking to the future, that latest quarter of 0.9 per cent is sustained, that still only annualises out at 3.6 per cent. That is less than the 3% per cent that is in your current budget projections. It is less again than the four to five per cent your Prime Minister concedes that you need. You are not going to make 3% per cent for this year. You are not going to make the revised budget forecast that you put down just a few weeks ago. To get that you would have to have two per cent growth in the next quarter. You are not going to get two per cent out of stocks or out of anything else. That is beyond reach. You cannot even meet the growth projections that you revised as recently as five or six weeks ago. These figures are not just abstractions to give economists their jollies. What we are talking about with these particular figures is what they mean in terms of real human pain and suffering for ordinary Australians and, in particular, for the 800,000 unemployed Australians. What they mean is pain and suffering for the faces that I see in my electorate, in Dandenong and in south-east Melbourne, and what so many of my colleagues in this place and, indeed, some of yours see. They are not the faces you see in the view from Kirribilli. They are not the faces you see in the view from Malvern or Toorak that the Treasurer enjoys. These are the faces of ordinary Australians who are affected by these policies and by this abominable performance. The failure of the economy to grow at the pace that it could and should have grown over the last year has meant, as we know, 32,000 more people unemployed under the coalition government. It has meant 30,000 more long term unemployed. It has meant a higher rate of youth unemployment. It has meant a rate of employment growth now being projected for the outyear periods that, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) so effectively put it today, will mean that you are producing nearly 300,000 fewer jobs over this period of government than we did in our last. And who is to blame for this lamentable state of affairs? Who is to blame for the fact that the economy is in this condition? The short answer is that it is absolutely nobody but this government. We are not talking about alien forces at work here. This show is not",90
223,The X,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Files; this show is the Australian economy. And it is the Australian government that is unequivocally responsible for running this show. It is unequivocally responsible for what has gone wrong. What has gone wrong in the management of this economy is two big things. First of all, a budgetary strategy that has been hopelessly astray. The budgetary strategy over the period the government has been in office-for two budgets now-has been deliberately, designedly contractionary in scope, because you have had an utterly wrong-headed appreciation of what the economic priorities of this country are. You have moved into a contractionary mode, which has meant half a per cent less growth over last year and this year than would otherwise have been the case. You have moved into a budgetary strategy that has gone about creating jobs by destroying them in the Public Service in regional Australia and everywhere else. You have gone about a budgetary strategy that has deliberately destroyed jobs and prospects in the manufacturing sector, through the removal of subsidies, the decimation of R&D support, the removal of export assistance and the creation of massive uncertainty about the tariff future of a number of key sectors. You are responsible. It is deliberate strategy that has produced this result. Small business has suffered particularly acutely as a result of this strategy. For small business, the growth that is generated by the economy and by the budget that is so central to economic management is far more than government regulations or taxes or access to bank finance. It is small business that has felt the full brunt of the economic slowdown. Last week's Yellow Pages survey reported that more than 80 per cent of small businesses saw the economy as going backwards or at a standstill, as it affected them. That is reflected in bankruptcy statistics. Do not tell us about the ancient past. Reflect on the fact, Minister for Finance, that bankruptcies have increased 21.3 per cent in the government's first year in office. The second thing you have done is not just to embark upon a contractionary budget strategy but to go about it in a way that has generated a massive decline in consumer confidence. Instead of generating confidence, you undermined it with all your talk about black holes and the nonsensical strategy that has gone with it. Every month, researchers at the University of Melbourne test consumer confidence, and in the space of just five months last year-I will not go into the details-your government turned strong consumer confidence into widespread pessimism. That has continued. Last year's retail experience was the worse in a generation. It was the toughest period for sales in a generation. Things picked up a bit in January and February, and there was some hope that we might have been headed for better times, but now we know that all those extra sales were just generated by deep discounting by desperate retailers, many of them in small business. In the last two months retail sales have again declined sharply. This government is incapable of generating the kind of confidence the economy needs. When confronted with this kind of record of failure-to generate growth, to create jobs, to reduce unemployment, to boost retail sales, to reduce bankruptcy, to reduce foreign debt for that matter and to improve our competitiveness-the government's stock response, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, is to call upon the strong private investment that has been occurring and the interest rate cuts that have been made possible by sustained low inflation. But these are not the government's achievements. They are the government's inheritance. They are the product of the strength of the economy they inherited. The investment decisions that are made were essentially made and bedded down before you came into office, and the inflationary environment you inherited is not something that just came to fruition in the last 12 months and has created an environment-as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is trying to saythat made it difficult for business to adjust. The truth of the matter is that in our last five years in office inflation averaged 2Y2 per cent-right bang in the middle of the Reserve Bank's target range. That was our gift to you. That was the economy that you inherited. This is the economy that you are now in the process of making an unholy mess of. Let there be no mistake, no misunderstanding: the economy is potentially still in an unholy mess. The world economy gives some ground for confidence out there, but there are many dimensions of the economy as we see it that show real cause for concern, and the record of performance of this government does nothing other than to generate continuing alarm in many sectors of the economy about whether things will in fact pick up. If the economy does pick up, as we all hope it will, it will not undo the damage that has been done to the economy in this first year of office. If there are better economic prospects next year-and, my God, we all hope there are, because all our constituents depend upon that-that does not change the fact that tens of thousands more Australian workers are unemployed today than was the case this time last year and thousands of small businesses are struggling to survive--even more than was the case last year-because of one reason only. That is this government's appalling, grotesque mishandling of the economy in its first 12 months in office. (Time expired).",91
224,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies) (4.27 p.m.)This morning in Brisbane the former Labor cabinet minister and former Labor Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, made a speech to a business breakfast in which he made some interesting remarks. When members of the former government leave office, then you see some truthfulness in what they have to say which is not necessarily reflected in what might have been said while they were here. During the course of his remarks, the former Senator Richardson said that Paul Keating had wanted to be viewed as a statesman overseas, but had failed, because he did not address domestic problems such as native title issues, links with Asia and Australia's foreign debt. 'The mishandling of these problems left the last two Labor governments looking awful,' he said. It is a measure of the awfulness of the past Labor government that we were left inheriting a $10,500 million Commonwealth debt. It is a measure of that awfulness that the foreign debt of this country is running at some $180 billion. It is a measure of that awfulness that the former Labor government left this country with unemployment running at over 8 per cent-in reality much higher-in the fifth year of recovery, unemployment that reached over 11 per cent under the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he was Minister for Employment. It is also a measure of that awfulness that unemployment, according to the current Leader of the Opposition, was ratcheted up in each recession over which Labor presided. It is a measure of the awfulness of the former Labor government that in this country we have an increasing gap between the rich and the poor, as middle Australia has been squeezed from all directions. It is a measure of the awfulness-which former Senator Richardson referred to about the former governments he was part of-that we had, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has pointed out today, bankruptcies at record levels under the former government. It is a measure of that awfulness that small businesses have been destroyed by the former Labor government because of the record interest rates which were brought to bear by the former administration-record interest rates that reached over 20 per cent and destroyed thousands upon thousands of small businesses in this country. It is also a measure of that awfulness that national savings collapsed to an all-time low under the former Labor government throughout their decade-long reign in this country. It is a record of that awfulness that personal household savings have reached the point of almost non-existence after 13 years of Labor government. It is a record of that awfulnessto which, again, former Senator Richardson referred about his own former governmentthat the approach to unemployment under the former government meant churning people through training programs which only served to artificially lower the number of long-term unemployed on the books in this country and which created few real jobs. In fact, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, it was a net increase in real jobs of 16,000. This, I take it, is the measure of awfulness to which Graham Richardson was referring this morning-the awfulness of the two former Labor governments. It is also a measure of the former governments that they arrogantly told the Australian people that the recession was the recession we had to have and that there would be a soft landing. Of course, Labor never did bring the bacon home as promised. They are now in limbo as a result. What the Howard and Costello government inherited was an economy heading towards destruction. We have started to address some of those measures. We have started to address some of what we have inherited. We have turned the Commonwealth deficit into a surplus within the period of one parliament. We have turned a $10,500 million Commonwealth deficit into a $1,600 million surplus in the period of one parliament. We have encouraged national savings through a program which will give some incentive for people in this country actually to save some of the money they earn; by reducing some of the red tape that exists for small business in this country; by providing a tax reduction for families, particularly those struggling with children at the present time; and, in the larger economic sense, by taking measures that will reduce the debt to GDP ratio and by building an economy ste dy sustainable growth rather than the decade of boom and bust which was practised under Labor. What do the national accounts actually show, which this matter of public importance is said to be about? Today's national accounts show that the economy grew by in the March quarter. This is a good outcome and a pointer to very favourable prospects the forthcoming year. With the exception stocks, all of the areas of expenditure contrithat buted to growth. The composition of activity in the quarter, with very strong growth in final demand and a sharp run-down in non-farm stocks, comtion. bined with other indicators of activity, suggest that the economy is poised for an acceleration in growth. Forward indicators, for example, housing activity confirm that the housing recovery continues to strengthen. Last week's ABS stocks and selected industry sales release indicated that manufacturers expect sales in this country to strengthen and that the outlook for business investment continues to be positive. Real private consumption expenditure rose one per cent in the March quarter, following the growth of 0.7 per cent in the December quarter. This reflected strong growth in consumption of retail goods, which rebounded in the March quarter to grow by 1.6 per cent, and strength in the purchase of motor vehia cles. Dwelling investments rose by 5.2 per cent in the March quarter, with very strong growth in investment in new dwellings more than offsetting a fall in alterations tions investment. Private business investment rose by 5.3 per cent in the March quarter, reflecting increases in both equipment and non-dwelling construction investment, with the latter growing particularly strongly. The sales to stocks ratio run-down is someand thing which will be corrected in the coming quarter, and all the indicators are that that being corrected at the present time. If you look at some of the other breakdowns in terms of these figures, you will be able to other indicators that this economy is growing in a sustained, steady way, not in the way of the boom-bust cycle that we had in 13 years based on under a Labor government. If you look at manufacturing specifically, which the opposition has referred to today, you will see that employment in manufacturing in the year to February increased by 22,000 positions nationally. You will also see that profitability for manufacturing has also 0.9 per cent continued to grow. Rather than listening to the opposition, for which has got to come in here and carp about of what the government is doing-we know that is the job of the opposition, and of course they are going to come in here and do itperhaps we ought to look at what some independent analysis has said about the situaIf you look at the report of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, you will see some indication of what the experts are of saying. They referred to an outstanding economic performance so far as this country is concerned over the past year. They said that 1996 for Australia was a banner year. 'A banner year,' said the experts from the Pacific Economic Cooperative Council, so far as their very assessment of the Australian economy is concerned. The opposition come in here and feign concern about the economy at the present time. If they were really concerned about the the Australian economy, if they were really concerned about creating real jobs in the Australian economy, then they would adopt different approach from what they have adopted to industrial relations reform. They would not be so niggardly in their attitude to the unfair dismissal provisions and the chanand addiges to the new legislation. The most feigned indignation was contained in the comments by the Leader of the Opposition on industry policy, in which he said, 'We expect an industry policy.' The Leader of the Opposition has the hide to come in here today say, 'We expect an industry policy.' May I refer him to the remarks of former Senator is Richardson in Brisbane this morning in which he said, 'Labor never had an industry policy.' So, after 13 years of having been at the see wheel of the economy in this country, having had their hands on the levers, to come in here and say that they expect an industry policy, when for that period of time, for more than a decade, they did not have one themselves, just indicates the degree of hypocrisy so far as the opposition are concerned. The real story about the opposition is the headline in the Australian newspaper today where the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about his position, and so he may well be. (Time expired)",93
225,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The discussion has concluded. NA NA First Reading Bill presented by Dr Kemp, and read a first time. Second Reading",95
226,Dr KEMP,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (4.38 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill would increase the amount previously appropriated for 1997 under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 by $17.938 million in line with normal price adjustments, taking total funding for 1997 to $909.263 million. In 1997, Commonwealth funding alone is expected to provide 43,000 student places over and above those provided in 1996. This will contribute substantially to an estimated total increase of 55,000 training places this year, as I said in question time today. The bill would also amend the legislated amount for 1998 to $890.585 million to give effect to the 1997-98 budget decision to reduce funding for distribution to the states and territories by the Australian National Training Authority by $20 million. The bill would appropriate the same level of funding for 1999. This budget measure provides an incentive to the states and territories to achieve efficientraining cy gains in vocational education and training operations. The reduction represents about 0.7 per cent of total Commonwealth, state and territory funding for the sector. It should be seen against the background of a 37 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding for the sector since 1992. At the Australian National Training Authority ministerial council meeting on 23 May 1997, all state and territory ministers supported a resolution noting that the reform of the vocational education and training sector agreed at the meeting has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of vocational education and training. Indeed, there should be substantial capacity to fund further growth in the sector from effiBILL 1997 ciency gains, including those resulting from the reforms led by the government. These reforms are far reaching and demonstrate the government's commitment to vocational education and training. This year's budget has clearly demonstrated this commitment with an overall increase in the allocation for vocational education and training of $144 million, or almost 12 per cent, compared with the expenditure of $1.2 billion in 1995-96 when the Labor Party was in government. There has been some re-allocation of funds to focus on our highest priority-the reform of the vocational education and training system and the establishment of new apprenticeships. About 70 per cent of young Australians do not go from school into university. Vocational education and training has a major role to play in making sure young Australians obtain the skills needed to get them into jobs and in ensuring that Australian businesses can meet the challenges of the global economy. The government is working with the states and territories to establish a training system which is responsive to the needs of industry and business enterprises, while operating within a national framework that is based on national standards and high quality, portable national qualifications. The centrepiece of the government's reforms to vocational education and training is new apprenticeships. New apprenticeships are being developed to expand the number of opportunities, especially for young people, into new industries to take advantage of economic growth and employment potential. At the ministerial council meeting last month, the states and territories endorsed arrangements to ensure implementatiOli of new apprenticeships. This was a historic agreement to introduce a flexible national system which meets the needs of today's enterprises wherever they may be located in Australia and whether they are large or small. It also maintains a focus on protecting the interests of those undertaking training through simpler but quality assured regulatory arrangements. The ministerial council agreed that there will be new funding arrangements for off-thejob training for new apprenticeships, allowing employers and their trainees to choose the provider to deliver their training. For the time, we will have a demand driven training system, giving employers an unprecedented opportunity to select the training that meets the needs of their business. More than $500 million a year in Commonwealth, state and territory funding will be available for allocation among public and private training providers under this 'user choice' system. This bill provides the Commonwealth's contribution to that funding as well as ongoing support for other aspects of the vocational education and training provision. The bill provides the solid foundation for building a national vocational education and training system which delivers quality outcomes, especially for young people, more efficiently and with less red tape. It provides a solid foundation for expanding opportunities for Australia's young people and improving the bottom line for Australian enterprises. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned. NA  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (4.44 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No.3 (1997). Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1997) which I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to give effect to the information technology agreement, ITA, which was signed by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) on behalf of Australia in Singapore on 13 December 1996. The ITA was one of the major outcomes of the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, WTO, held in Singapore in December 1996. Negotiations on the agreement were completed on 26 March and it comes into force on 1 July this year. The ITA represents a package of sectoral liberalisation which, in combination with the agreement on basic telecommunications, establishes the trading framework for the rapid growth of global information and communications infrastructure. Participants to the agreement will, in most circumstances, first eliminate tariffs on computer technology and telecommunications products by the year 2000. The ITA has been signed by 41 countries, including our major APEC trading partners. These counties represent 92.3 per cent of world trade in these products, a trade worth an estimated $750 billion per year. During the negotiations, Australia made clear its requirements for an acceptable and balanced package of liberalisation being achieved and for the participation by a core of our regional trading partners. Australia stands to gain substantially from the ITA. Australian tariffs on ITA goods are proportionally lower than the tariffs of many other participating countries and the agreement will provide Australian industry with increased export opportunities to help redress the $6.9 billion trade deficit in this sector. It will do this in a number of ways: Exporters of electronic components, office machines and telecommunications equipment to the European Union, Canada, the United States and Asia are likely to benefit from the tariff eliminations of the ITA. Tariff elimination, combined with other factors such as rapidly expanding economies, large populations, expansion of communications infrastructures, and growing disposable income in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan will benefit trade in all ITA products. These countries, all participants in the ITA, represent the largest potential ITA market in the world. ITA will ensure greater certainty of access through commitments to bind tariffs at zero. The agreement will boost employment in this industry sector, which currently employs 30,000 Australian workers. Moreover, the ITA will provide Australian firms and consumers with access to information technology and telecommunications inputs at world competitive prices. The ITA is an excellent example of Australian industry and government working together. Industry was kept closely involved during the negotiations from the outset and has strongly supported and welcomed our participation in the ITA. The telecommunications industry believes that the ITA will add up to $400 million a year in new exports. Other parts of the industry believe that exports of their products could at least double by the end of the decade. Australia could not have secured the market opening achieved under the ITA through direct bilateral negotiations. Working through APEC and the WTO allowed Australia, in coalition with other major economies, to bring our key regional trading partners to the ITA negotiating table. Australia must now implement its commitment to reduce tariffs on ITA products. These alterations are contained in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1997) and will come into effect on 1 July 1997. They fully implement Australia's tariff obligations under this agreement. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned.  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (4.50 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No.4 (1997). Customs Tariff Proposal No.4 (1997) which I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 which result from Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT, decisions. Each of the alterations is technical in nature, affecting only a narrow range of goods. I will briefly outline each of them and later provide more detail on each alteration. Alteration No. 1 reinstates the level of government assistance granted to local manufacturers of surgical drapes. Alterations Nos. 2 and 3 realign the Australian tariff in accordance with our international obligations to the World Customs Organisation, WCO. Alteration No. 4 corrects a recent tariff amendment, narrowing the range of goods entitled to duty free treatment to only those goods so entitled before the amendment. I will now outline the alterations in more detail. Alteration No. 1 of this proposal will apply a more precise description to goods classified in subheading 4823.90.10. This will exclude surgical drapes from that classification and reinstate the intended level of tariff assistance. In the second matter, an automotive parts importer appealed against a classification ruling by the Australian Customs Service, ACS, that certain lamps were classified under heading 9405. The AAT agreed with the appellant that the lamps should be classified in heading 8539. Australia is a contracting partner to the harmonised commodity description and coding system, HS, sponsored by the WCO. The WCO has advised the ACS that the lamps in question are classified in heading 9405. Alteration Nos. 2 and 3 of this proposal insert an additional note in chapter 85 of the tariff, thus realigning Australia's position with that of the HS. The third matter results from a 1991 AAT decision that certain centrally housed ADP power units should be classified to heading 8471 as computer units. The ACS accepted this decision. In 1995 the weo, in its four-year cycle of review of classification matters, recommended that all power units be classified in heading 8504. The ACS instituted this change and provided a new subheading for the goods covered by the AAT decision, thus allowing a continuation of their free rate of duty. The description in that subheading has now been shown to include a broader range of goods than that specified in the original AAT decision. Alteration No. 4 of this proposal inserts a more precise description of the goods specified in the 1991 AAT decision and limits the free rate of duty to those goods. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House.",95

That proposal relates to the sugar tariff which was introduced in this place on 26 March and has not yet been brought on for discussion, even though it takes effect-and I am talking about a major breach of coalition promise prior to the election campaign; a pay cut of $27 million to Australia's sugar industry-within a couple of days of the end of this session. I want to take this opportunity during the discussion of this tariff proposal to consider in the House the fact that the cane crushing season is starting in Mackay today. A very real election commitment was made by the coalition prior to the election that it would not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 per tonne because Australia had already met its obligations under the WorId Trade Organisation. The Australian Uruguay Round obligations for sugar represent a tariff requirement of $70 per tonne by the year 2000, and our current tariff level of $55 a tonne is comfortably within that obligation. Many of our export destinations have sugar tariffs massively higher than ours, which suggest that there is no reason for Australia to go it alone on the sugar tariff. Given all these things, they have still decided to abolish the sugar tariff by 1 July. We have already made it very clear publicly that Labor will be opposing the proposed scrapping of the sugar tariff. We do not believe it is justified. We do not believe it is an appropriate measure to be taking in the Australian economy. We are very concerned about the fact that sugar growers have been conned by the government-absolutely conned. They have had put to them that, in order to have a single desk marketing system, under the GAIT rules they were requiredMotion (by Mr Ruddock) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",98
228,Mr OKEEFE,SUGAR TARIFF,"I move: That, in light of: (1) the fact that the cane crushing season starts in the Mackay region today; (2) the Government's election commitment not to reduce the sugar tariff, it having promised it would not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 per tonne as Australia had already met its obligations under the World Trade Organisation agreement; (3) the fact that Australia's Uruguay Round obligation for sugar is a tariff of $70 per tonne by the year 2000, and Australia's current tariff at $55 per tonne is comfortably within that obligation; (4) the fact that many of our export destinations have sugar tariffs massively higher than us, which suggests that there is no reason for Australia to go it alone on the sugar tariff; (5) despite the above, the Government's decision to abolish the sugar tariff effective from 1 July 1997; and (6) the fact that the abolition of the proposed tariff will mean job losses and a payout of $27m. to Queensland sugar growersso much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent order of the day No. 66 government business, being called on forthwith so that Members will have an opportunity to debate and vote on the proposals contained in Customs Tariff Proposal (No.2) 1997 to remove customs duty from sugar and sugar coated by-products. Mr Ruddock-I move: That the member be not further heard.",98
229,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,Mr Jenkins)The minister has moved that the member for Burke be not further heard. Is a division required? Opposition members-Yes.,98
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,A division is required. Ring the bells. A division having been called and the bells being rung Mr Leo MCLeay-Can we call the division off?,99
231,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,Order! Is the honourable member for Watson seeking leave to call the division off? Mr Leo MCLeay-Yes.,99
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,Is leave granted? Mr Ruddock-Yes.,99
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,Leave is granted. The division is called off.,99
234,Mr OKEEFE,SUGAR TARIFF,"I am glad that the government has agreed to these arrangements now because the final point I wanted to make was that we have had the Queensland sugar industry led to believe that, in order to get a single desk marketing system, they had to agree to the abolition of their tariff. Whenever you talk to any of the leadership of the Queensland sugar industry, they all make it very clear that that is the deal the government put to them. What they were not aware of was the fact that it did not need to be like that. There are no obligations under GATT or any other obligations. Australia has already met its obligations. It was perfectly possible to enable the Queensland and New South Wales sugar industry to have a single desk marketing system and still maintain their and still be ahead of our requirements under the GATT obligations. As I was saying, it is time we had a debate about this bill. It is time that we considered the fact that two days after this parliament rises in June, this measure was going to come into operation and it was going to be sleazed through without the opportunity for this sort of discussion. We are making it very clear that we will be opposing this and we will be opposing it in the other house.",99
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,Order! Is the motion seconded?,99
236,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SUGAR TARIFF,"I second the motion. The tariff proposal by the government is an express breach of an election commitment. The government gave a promise at the last election that it would not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 per tonne. Why? Because we were comfortably within our Uruguay Round obligation of $70 per tonne by the year 2000. In express breach of that election promise and in express breach of that election commitment, the government is now proposing to abolish the sugar tariff by 1 July. You do not need to do that. The Queensland sugar growers can have the single desk operations and they can have the tariff as well. This is in express breach of the government's election commitment. In addition, it was in express breach of individual and personal commitments made by members of this chamber. The only person on the other side who has been honest on this matter is the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter. He said on Sydney radio on 19 March: ... the now Government of Australia, before the election we said on page 32 of our policy document, a LiberallN ational Government will not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55.00 a tonne, as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation ... Our commitment was that we would review it. We reviewed it and we say that the sugar tariff can stay where it is. Where do we find Larry Anthony, the member for Richmond, and Mr Causley, the member for Page? They are absent without leave, gone missing, tariff having given those commitments to their sugar growers in New South Wales. Mr Bevis-Missing in action.",99
237,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SUGAR TARIFF,"Yes, they are missing in action. They are the New South Wales members. The member for Dawson, De-Anne Kelly, the member for Hinkler, Mr Neville, the member for Leichhardt, Mr Entsch, and the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, have all broken express personal commitments to keep the sugar tariff at $55 per tonne. They should come into this House and do what they said to their electorates in the run-up to the last election-keep the sugar tariff where it is. Question resolved in the negative.

AGED CARE BILL 1997 Cognate bills: AGED CARE (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 AGED CARE (COMPENSATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",99
238,Mr HATTON,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"This Howard coalition government is mad and bad and dangerous. The evidence for that has been seen just in the last couple of days in terms of the priorities that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has set for federal government action in two different areas. The Aged Care Bill 1997, which we have before us today and which is at issue in the discussion in this House, is an extremely important bill. The Prime Minister indicated in the House yesterday what his approach to the next three years might be in terms of what the priorities of this government might be. The Prime Minister could, in effect, be likened to George Bush because what he has introduced into Australia now is the notion that the federal government should take on issues, attitudes and programs for which they have no direct responsibility. Absolutely contrary to the National Commission of Audit, absolutely contrary to what the government has done in the past, it is going to take up state government issues-issues that are the responsibility of the states-and campaign on them. This Prime Minister announced that tomorrow he will be launching a national campaign part against violence and crime in Australia. That will be a three-year campaign in which the federal government will take an active strategic role in relation to trying to monitor and test anti-violence programs within the community, setting those up as models and then getting the states to implement them. Before George Bush was thrown out of office, he had to be told by the Democrats that, basically, 'It's the economy, stupid!' He had not got the point when he was campaigning that the economy in the United States was really in difficulty. We could make that same point here, but we could probably go further and say to the Prime Minister, 'It's the society, stupid!' because what this Aged Care Bill does is present a situation where, instead of what had been done over more than a decade to build aged care facilities that reflected the needs of Australian citizens, we have a Prime Minister running around as if he were Crusader Rabbit or Mighty Mouse, launching a campaign against violence in the community in relation to state government responsibilities. But let us look at the federal government responsibilities that this Prime Minister and his minister are walking away from. This Aged Care Bill is, I believe, a dangerous one. It is dangerous for the aged in this community, it is dangerous for the people in hostel care, it is dangerous for the charitable institutions that run not-for-profit hostels and nursing homes within Australia, and it is dangerous because of the steps it takes to undo the aged care strategy which the former Labor government introduced in 1985. Prior to our coming to office in 1983, the Giles report underlined the condition of nursing homes in Australia. What that underlined was a set of nursing homes, particularly those run for profit, that were entirely run down, where the conditions were deplorable and where people were treated in a manner that did not equate to the dignity that they had or should have been given to them. Labor, at that time with the agreement of the coalition when it was in opposition, put forward a new program to be introduced over a period of 10 years. We had a situation prior to 1983 where, if people got sick-not dramatically sick; just sick enough that they could not look after themselves in their own home-and their family was not capable of assisting them, they had no choice but to go into one of those depleted and run-down nursing homes. The strategy that we put in place was a three-tiered strategy. Firstly, we put Commonwealth government funding into the home and community care program, in cooperation with the states, to allow those people who were still healthy and who had minor problems to be assisted in their own homes for as long as possible and to assist those people who were caring for them and to do so by bringing in community nurses and other community resources to allow them to stay at home. Also, we built the hostel program. The hostel program under Labor was increased by 15 per cent in real terms year on year. That hostel program provided for people who could no longer remain at home but were not sick enough to go into a nursing home. Labor determined that it was important that there be a halfway house between the home and a nursing home. Labor determined that it was important to realise that people who could still cater for themselves but needed central meal facilities, nursing assistance on the property and the help and assistance of other residents could more profitably spend their lives in hostel accommodation, but they would not be forced to go into a nursing home inappropriately. The third thing Labor did was to spend capital funds on building new nursing homes. In 1985-86, the first year of that strategy, the ALP federal government spent $1.2 billion on aged care-that is, on nursing homes, hostels and home and community care. By 1993-94, that had grown to $2.6 billion worth of funding. That is not going to happen under this government, because this government has identified two crises within the community. The first of those crises is the physical decline of aged care facilities noted in the Gregory report of 1993-94. The core problem is the fact that many nursing homes have declined in terms of their standards and fire regulations and they need to be rebuilt. The second crisis is the fact that our aged care system will increasingly come under greater impact by the ageing of the population. Using these two notions and putting them as crises, what is the coalition's solution? They knew what the situation was while Labor was in government-a three-tiered system of appropriate care: care in the home, under home and community care; care in hostels, which met the needs of the clients in the hostels; and, for those people who became quite dramatically sick, the much more expensive nursing home beds. The coalition should realise that the cost to the then federal government was less because it had that threetiered system. They should realise that it was not only appropriate but also cost-effective for the then federal government. But they noted the Gregory report, they noted the tun-down nature of nursing homes in Australia and they noted that it would cost about half a billion dollars, in terms of capital funding, to renew those nursing homes. But, because this coalition government do not want to participate in direct service delivery to the Australian people, they do not want to provide capital funding. They have come up with an entirely new way of going about it and have misrepresented it as just simply cloning Labor's position on hostels. What is particularly dangerous to the people who need those appropriate services in the community and to the not-for-profit charitable institutions who run nursing homes and hostels in Australia is that this coalition government has merged two types of aged care-nursing homes and hostels. No longer will any individual who is not appropriately sick enough have a choice about whether to go into a hostel or to go into a nursing home, because people will be forced into nursing homes. They will enter an aged care centre where hostel accommodation and nursing provide accommodation will be as one. In terms of tion. the capital needed in those facilities, it just so happens that this bill determines that the standard of the building of hostel accommobuilt dation has to be exactly equivalent-I think it is level 9-to nursing home accommodarebuilt tion. In my electorate of Blaxland we have a number of hostel places that have been built up over the past decade. Those hostel places have been very important to the people Blaxland. They have provided appropriate sense. care for them. A number of those hostels are run by the Bankstown City Frail Aged Persons' Homes Trust, a not-for-profit organiorder sation. I have with me a letter from the general manager of that trust, Mr Terry Madden. I wish to read out a number of parts of that letter because it details the direct impact of the Aged Care Bill on the nursing homes and hostels in Bankstown and how their welfare and the welfare of the people they serve will be directly affected by this misguided bill. The hostel beds that we presently have in Bankstown are at level 3. They are not nursing home beds, they are not nursing home institutions, they are hostel institutions. frail aged trust faces this simple situation: people who came into those hostel places not pay an entry fee. More than 60 per cent of the people using the hostels and nursing home places in Bankstown are concessional. They are pensioners; they do not have the funds. This not-for-profit organisation allowed them to enter the hostels without paying an entry fee. Under this bill, the hostels and the trust have been told that they have to provide for a rebuilding of those hostels. They have to either renovate and bring level 3 up to level 9 or consolidate on one site. Effectively, it means this trust that has nursing home places on a site on Birdwood Road and hostel places spread throughout the municipality of Bankstown will be forced to upgrade dispersed hostel places. But this bill requires the trust to provide, effectively, nursing home care at those hostel places to not only bring the quality up to that building standard but also the same kind of care in that instituI think they will be effectively driven to rebuild entirely. All of those hostel places with capital funds provided by the former Labor government will have to be at standard 9. It is not only dangerous but also mad and bad. It is not good public policy. We have that infrastructure in Bankstown now. To duplicate it and then to not be able to run the existing infrastructure as a in hostel program does not seem to make much This frail aged persons homes trust has never had to borrow money from a bank into run the trust, to run its nursing homes, to run its hostels. It has been funded by the local people of Bankstown. It has been funded by the registered clubs, such as the Bankstown District Sports Club and the club of the year, the Revesby Workers Club. It has also been funded by RSL clubs within the community. The people in Bankstown know and understand that they have to look after the aged. They know that the frail aged cannot remain at home. So what is the impact of this aged care legislation? The minister, having announced The that these changes would be made in the the budget last year, from day one has not had a did blind clue about what the implications of what her plans would be because the plans were not fleshed out. She did not really understand them. All she could do was to rhetorically say: 'It is just the same as Labor's hostels program.' It is not. This will coalesce nursing homes beds and hostel beds. Mr Madden says this: Those deemed able to pay the accommodation bond will pay around $88,000 entry fee for an average nursing home bed in Sydney. He supplies an article from the Daily Telegraph indicating that 80 per cent of service providers in the charitable sector will fix their nursing home entry fees at around $88,000: Charities will have no choice other than to set the fee because the Commonwealth Government has abolished capital grants at the same time it is introducing accommodation bonds for nursing homes. He further says: The average cost to build a nursing home bed in New South Wales is between $90,000 and $100,000. To build therefore a 50-bed nursing home will cost an organisation around $5 million. That means the organisation needs to have about $250,000 a year put aside to rebuild after 20 years. Changes in technology and the fact that the buildings will be run down means that an organisation will need money to rebuild. If you take inflation into account over that period he points out that you would need closer to $300,000. So from all of the sources of funds from what used to be capital input for the charity to get those nursing home beds built in the first place, Bankstown will be in the situation where for the first time ever it will have to borrow. It will have to borrow $5 million straight up in order to duplicate those hostel beds. Mr Madden looks at the way in which money under this bill can flow into a charitable trust such as Bankstown's. He says: The following shows the effect this mix would have on any charity running a 50-bed nursing home. If a resident is taken into care as a concessional resident and the charity is paid $5 per day then in a year they would receive $1,825. If a resident is taken into care and pays an accommodation bond of $88,000, then the charity can deduct $2,600 per annum for a maximum of five years, (or $13,000) from the bond, plus the interest it gets the bond. Presuming 5 per cent interest per annum on $88,000 ($4,400) and adding to that the $2,600 gives the charity $7,000 per annum if a person pays the full bond. This represents $19.18 a day. The equations are that if you have a 50-bed nursing home with an accommodation bond of $88,000, that generates about $350,000 per annum for the charity. If, however, you have 30 per cent concessional residents, it is about $272,000. If you have 40 per cent, it is down to $246,000. If you have a 60 per cent intake it is $194,750. If you need $300,000 income and you are only getting $220,000 or $194,000, then your deficit will grow year by year over those 20 years. The government in this bill has indicated that all nursing homes should take in concessional patients, but it should be based on socio-economic factors. In Hunters Hill, as an example given by the minister, they should take about 10 per cent of concessional patients. They would have to forgo $25,875 per annum. But in Bankstown if they had to take 30 per cent of concessional residents they would forgo $77,625 a year. So over 20 years, Bankstown's frail aged trust would be out of pocket by more than $1 Y2 million. It would be that much less able to rebuild its nursing home. Mr Madden puts this proposition: he does not think that this bill is equitable or nondiscriminatory because of that absolute effect. He suggests this system to make the situation more equitable between different providers, between the charitable institutions and the forprofit providers who provided so much of the input to the minister in relation to these changes. Mr Madden says this: A far better system would be for all service providers who receive any form of government subsidy to have a flat rate of concessional residents of, say, 20 per cent and that for those residents the government would pay $5 per day. However, for any residents in excess of 20 per cent, regardless of what socio-economic area they came from, the government should pay the same rate per day the organisation would get if a person was a full accommodation bond paying resident, and that is $19.18 a day. This would be equitable, it would not be discriminatory and it would be uniform across all socio-economic areas. An organisation would not be penalised because it is trying to provide care in a poorer area compared to another charity trying off to provide the same accommodation to the same standard in a more wealthy area. I started this debate arguing that in relation to this Aged Care Bill 1997 the coalition government is mad and bad and dangerous. It is dangerous because it has taken a tripartite program that worked exceptionally well for more than a decade and broken it into small pieces. It has coalesced nursing home and hostel beds. It has got out of the game of providing capital funding. It has heaped that on the heads of the individual citizens of Australia because this coalition government does not believe in supporting the people of Australia. (Time expired)",101
239,Mr BILSON,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Dunkley) (5.30 p.m.)'What is this talk about paying to get into a nursing home? I have just visited an old mate in a home and I wouldn't live there if you paid me.' This was the opening of a conversation I had with a Dunkley elector on the subject of the government's aged care accommodation reforms. He had seen the product of Labor's regime and, to quote the terms used by the member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), 'the three-tier regime'. Let me tell you, member for Blaxland, for one of those tiers, nursing homes, the tears were everywhere. They were about people contemplating moving into some of them. The three-tier system has one big problem and we have got one good plan to fix it. This Dunkley elector had applied the ultimate test of asking himself whether he would like to be accommodated in parts of the system, particularly in some of the nursing homes that Labor left in such a parlous state, with soul destroying living conditions that some elderly people were forced to endure while the former Labor government looked the other way and with low standard premises failing the care needs of the frailest of Australians. Labor had no plan to address these problems and the elderly people in substandard aged care accommodation had no prospect of their living conditions improving. My constituent experienced the sharp end of the problems the Labor Party ignored and that the coalition government has a plan to fix. The problems are real and warrant being publicised. The need for change is evident and compelling. The Gregory report in May 1994 estimated the scale of the need to upgrade the building fabric to be a $520 million challenge-and the Labor Party turned their backs on the people affected by that challenge. From a sample of 150 nursing homes, the deficiencies that impeded the proper care of frail residents included: 75 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards, 70 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Commonwealth outcome standards, and, for the benefit of ' Mr Dangerous Mad and Bad', the member for Blaxland, 13 per cent of homes did not meet fire authority standards-and that is dangerous. And 39 per cent of residents were in rooms of four or more beds. The practical care needs of residents were found to be compromised by poor access and mobility difficulties created by narrow doorways and poor building designs, bathrooms that impeded nursing assistance when bathing and insufficient heating and cooling. These were the problems and Labor had no plan to fix them, certainly not the half billion dollars that were required under the model that has just been advocated by the member for Blaxland. The Gregory report concluded: The lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock is a result of the funding system, under which nursing homes r.eceive a. set amount for each resident, based on reSIdent frruity, which is the same regardless of the age and condition of the building. The government's aged care accommodation reforms, which it seeks to enact through the Aged Care Bill 1997, not only introduce the type of incentives Gregory was looking for to maintain the quality of nursing homes, but they put into place positive obligations on the proprietors of substandard facilities to lift their game. The reforms provided through this bill directly deal with my constituent's concerns about the quality of accommodation, as well as securing affordable access on a fair and sustainable basis. The government is changing the aged care arrangements because people's expectations have changed. As my earlier example demonstrates, a higher quality standard of care is demanded from those in the Dunkley community currently enjoying what can be very exciting times as senior members, but they are contemplating a future possibly in aged care accommodation. No longer are shabby, rundown nursing homes acceptable when two in every five residents have to share a room of four or more beds. No longer is it right that we deny old people the same number of accommodation and lifestyle choices that we give to young members of our community. Most importantly, the coalition government wants to give older Australians the dignity, comfort and security in their lives that is so necessary for them to feel valued members of the Australian society. Times have also changed in the aged care sector itself. Half of the existing hostel residents are frail enough to qualify for nursing home care. Yet, under the current system, a hostel resident gets an average annual Commonwealth subsidy of under $10,000, compared with almost $29,000 if the same person were in a nursing home. Aged care is one of the most important issues facing the community of Dunkley by the bay. At the 1991 census, Dunkley had around 18,000 residents aged 60 or over. Senior citizens are an especially large proportion of the population in Mornington where, in 1991, they comprised almost 23 per cent of all the residents. Contrary to popular impressions, there was then a higher proportion of people aged 60-plus in Frankston at 17Y2 per cent, compared to Mount Eliza at 16.4 per cent. In Seaford, 14.1 per cent of the residents are aged 60 or over and it is only in two areas that I represent-Frankston North and Langwarrin-that the aged are not as numerically significant as in these other areas. Ten per cent and five per cent respectively of the general population are 60 or over in these communities. Hostels in Dunkley such as RSL Park, which I have had the pleasure of visiting with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and Milpara Park, where I officially opened an upgrading of their facilities just in the last week, play an important role in Dunkley. So do nursing homes such as the George Vowell Centre in Mt Eliza, which the minister has also inspected in one of her numerous tours around Australia. The key objectives of the Aged Care Bill 1997 are quite straightforward. High quality care for everyone regardless of a person's income or location is first. More choice and flexibility follows. Safe, appropriate and comfortable accommodation for everyone is a key aim. It is also important that providers have the time to care, instead of being occupied trying to cope with red tape and paperwork. Unification of the hostel and nursing home sectors, and the introduction of a fairer, simpler subsidy system are also key goals. The implementation of arrangements that are affordable, but nonetheless seek a fair and reasonable contribution from residents who have the ability to pay, is a further objective. But perhaps most importantly, as I have suggested previously, are consumer protection measures that ensure accommodation bonds and the standard of care are up to scratch. They are very important parts of this package. Consumer protection is a central plank of the coalition's plan. A prudential scheme for accommodation bonds will be established. Contrast this with Labor's inaction. While we listen to the bleatings of the Labor shadow minister for scaring, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), we might well ask why, during Labor's 13 years in office, they failed to produce a single element of consumer protection for the entry contributions paid by people in hostels. Why have things suddenly changed in the 14Y2th year? The coalition is also for the first time actually mandating-making it compulsoryfor aged care accommodation providers to set aside a guaranteed percentage of beds, a national minimum of 27 per cent, for concessional residents, those financially disadvantaged people who do not have the means that some other members of our community have. If the need is assessed as being greater than this figure in Dunkley, this figure will be adjusted. Labor never did this either. Concessional residents will also attract an additional subsidy of $5 per day, whether they are in a hostel oc a nursing home under the new unified aged care system. Again, this is better than Labor's approach, which offered $3 for people in hostels as an extra subsidy. In the parliament last year, I called on the government's new aged care assessment instrument to take account of sensory impairment and multiple disabilities. I have since been very pleased that the Minister for Family Services has granted $320,000 from the aged care support fund to the Association for the Blind, with $200,000 of this going towards a telephone support service allowing the association to promote and extend its services to all people suffering sensory loss. The government has also provided $100,000 to the National Centre for Ageing and Sensory Loss and a further $20,000 as a one-off grant for a study to investigate the future role of the centre. I was hopeful of a more overt expression of the importance and the care implications of sensory loss and multiple disability in this package, but I have been assured that sensory impairment will be taken into account when the single classification instrument is applied. I am very encouraged by that. The single classification instrument is one of the other important changes of the government's reforms. Put simply, this means that residents with similar care needs will be funded equally no matter what type of facility they live in. For the first time, dementia care needs will be properly identified and resourced. Currently, people with dementia are cared for in hostels and attract less ing than in nursing homes, even if their needs are similar. Hand in hand with the introduction of a single residential classification unit is the coalition's move to a new quality assurance system. I endorse the minister's comments that giving the industry greater responsibility for its own quality assurance is the most appropriate way to achieve improvements. This is not a matter of taking an immediate big stick to the industry; rather providers have to shape up or ship out. Working with aged care providers and developing realistic expectations to be implemented through the new Aged Care Standards Agency from January 1998 are good ways to achieve better quality in aged care accommodation. Of course, the government has flagged in its fact sheet that, unless accreditation can be delivered, Commonwealth funding will not be forthcoming into the future. It is a pretty impressive incentive to address some of those problems and the sorts of perceptions I shared earlier from my constituent. As Professor Gregory indicated in his seminal review of the structure of nursing home funding arrangements, nursing home infrastructure has been in decline. To use the word 'crisis' is no exaggeration. To charge an accommodation bond under the government's proposals, services will need to meet the standards of building and care quality embraced by the accreditation system. The government is not imposing a $26,000 entry contribution, as those opposite seek to assert at times. This is nonsense. What is actually happening is that a non-compulsory accommodation bond may be asked of residents who can afford it, to be drawn down by not more than $2,600 a year for five years. For the residents who can afford it, they must be able to retain $22,000 of their own assets for a single person or $45,000 for a couple after they have been charged an accommodation bond they have agreed to. That is five times the amount of the annual pension. The non-compulsory accommodation bond cannot be asked for unless the facility has reached prescribed standards. Residents who fund- are in nursing homes on 1 July will not be asked for this accommodation bond, and short stay, non-permanent residents of up to six months cannot be asked to pay a bond, although a means tested service charge may apply. Current hostel residents remain subject to the arrangements in place before 1 July, with some caps on outgoings. For residents who leave a nursing home or pass away, they or their estates will receive any balance of the accommodation band that is owing to them. People who move from one aged care accommodation facility to another will not have to pay a second bond. A set number of concessional residents to be accommodated within these facilities has been established. I might add that it was this area where I probably had the most objection from a resident in my community. He was a fairly young man-I like to say that because he was around my age-who came into my office and was quite appalled that the government would be seeking accommodation bonds from people who were able to afford them. As we talked around and the semantics were being shared about the basis of his concern, he finally shared with me what he was worried about. He was worried about the impact on his inheritance. That was more important to him than ensuring that his parents had the sort of care and support they needed. It was an appalling example of some of the sentiment that is behind objection to the accommodation bonds. Entry contributions have worked well in hostels since 1988. Financially disadvantaged people have a higher than average chance of getting into a hostel and have so in the past. This gives the lie to Labor's claims that the coalition's changes will make it hard for people with few assets to obtain a bed in a nursing home. As was said by Labor's Gary Johns, a former minister, in his now famous letter to the Australian on 19 September last year: ... why should Kerry Packer be able to enter a nursing home for free? The fact is that the system already applies to hostels, so why not extend it to nursing homes? ... the residential home is not an asset if the partner remains in it, or for instance a disabled child needs it. . . the resident must always be left with an asset of at least 250 per cent of the pension, which is around $22,000. Labor allowed millionaire nursing home residents to pay fixed, flat low fees. If the same person was in a hostel, they usually received less care but would pay more for it. The coalition believes that it is time to unify the different types of aged care facilities and make sure those who can afford it make a reasonable contribution towards their care. The two-thirds of nursing home residents who receive the full age pension will pay no more in minimum daily fees than they pay now. One other important issue is the security of residents' contributions in nursing homes. It would not be unnatural for older Australians who lost their life savings in the Pyramid Bank collapse to be concerned about how those funds were being managed. I welcome the minister's assurances that a mandatory prudential scheme will be introduced to protect residents if an aged care service provider experiences financial difficulty. I am delighted that the industry itself recognises that standards have to improve. The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals stated, in August 1996, that the government's changes will: ... overcome the matters long outstanding regarding the need to address the urgent capital upgrading of nursing homes. The distinction between CAMs and SAMs will end from 1 July. This will help nursing home proprietors to spend more time on providing quality care and less on paperwork. However, to guard against misuse of public money, the validation program will continue until the middle of 1999. Quality care for the aged is a priority of the coalition government. In 1997-98 more than $3.7 billion is being spent: an increase of almost seven per cent-way above the predicted inflation rise over this next year. When the minister visited Dunkley I reminded her of my interest in offering our senior citizens more choices. That is why I am so pleased that, in implementing the aged care structural reform package, the minister has listened and consulted widely. The four if working groups she established comprise consumers, providers, staff and technical experts as well as academics. The date of implementation for aged care changes is fast approaching. On 1 July new doors will be opened for Dunkley's older citizens. I would like to share with you the sorts of reactions I am getting from my local providers as I talk to them about the changes. I know my friend and colleague the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) has been busy consulting with his aged care facility providers also. Mr Frank Hoff, the Chief Executive Officer of George Vowell Home and Day Care Centre in Mount Eliza said: At Brighton, the Association for the Blind already has a hostel ... it has worked quite well ... The trade-off is that, with the entry contributions, we can provide facilities that we couldn't in any other way ... The families at Mt Eliza are concerned as to how the new system will go. We have been keen to provide them with additional information. To continue: In 12 months time, people will understand the benefits of more staff and facilities while the Centre is still catering for the (concessional) residents. Mr Brian Fitzpatrick from Benlynne Private Nursing Home in Nolan Street, Frankston, who is also Vice President of the Victorian Nursing Home & Extended Care Association, said: The industry is absolutely looking forward to the changes ... We are looking forward to the proper accreditation and professionalism that follows. These changes will help the aged care sector to be more focused on outcomes rather than processes. The bill provides the foundation for senior citizens of our community to enjoy enhanced levels of security, dignity and comfort over the years to come. I congratulate the minister for her outstanding work in addressing another Labor problem left to us and I commend the bill to the House.",105
240,Ms ELLIS,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"This bill attempts to introduce dramatic change to the provision of aged care in our community. As is being seen in other social policy areas, this government's philosophical approach is being hidden in what I would call a smokescreen of financial gobbledegook. The reality is this: people generally do not choose to live in a nursing home. The comparison continually put before this House between nursing homes and hostels is quite misleading. A bed in a nursing home is a health requirement. Other alternatives at that point in the individual's life are not available. The minister and members opposite can continue with these silly remarks of scare campaigns-and silly they are-for as long as they like but the community out there see through that lightweight, weak response. If you choose not to believe us, that is fine. But if you continue to choose to ignore the aged care sector, you do so at your peril. It is important that the records show the comments and the concerns coming from this area of important service delivery. I intend to do that. I received a fax today from Aged Care Australia and I would like to quote some sections from this fax: Despite six months of discussions, confirm details of the application of the proposed Resident Classification Scale and therefore cannot determine the recurrent funding which will be available to a facility for the care of residents. The costs of Prudential arrangements are still unknown. The cost of the Accreditation Agency is unknown. The cost of Certification of existing buildings is being carried almost entirely by providers. Further on it reads: ACA also cannot support the Government's proposal that $5 per resident per day should be paid to providers as a so-called incentive to provide access to low income residents. This subsidy is provided to enable providers to carry out needed improvements to the quality of buildings but this amount cannot possibly achieve this objective. Given the other changes which have been made to the funding mechanisms for aged care, this proposition is completely unacceptable. It continues: The concerns listed above are compounded by the fact that the final draft of subordinate legislation critical to implementation has not been sighted. And finally: As of today we have insufficient information about certain critical elements of the proposals and we cannot support the Government's proposal for the Concessional Resident Supplement. I would now like to refer to a service provider very close to my own electorate. In fact, many of my residents have a great deal to do with Mirinjani Retirement Village at Weston. I received an urgent letter from them two or three days ago. It reads, in part, that Mirinjani Retirement Village wish: . . . to express our deep concerns with the Government's announcement on Tuesday of the proposed recurrent supplement to be paid for concessional residents in residential aged care facilities. This daily rate will only be $5 a day and - w:ill place not-for-profit providers in an extremely difficult situation of being able to provide for this vulnerable group of older Australians .... The amount of $5 a day equates to $1,825 a year, which is less than the allowable retention rate from an accommodation bond of $2,600. The concessional subsidy is not comparable with the accommodation bond. - his funding arrangement for aged care organisatIOns has the strong potential to see the development of a two-tiered care system, where one group will have access to modem facilities, and the other group housed in older and inferior accommodation. ACA still cannot It goes on: This needs to at least equate to the accommodation bond retention rate of $2,600 per year. This would need to be $7.20 a dayfor the not-for-profit aged care organisations. That is from Mirinjani Retirement Village in Weston, Canberra, which is a multifaceted service provider for our aged. Another group that has come to my attention in the last week is the Australian Catholic Health Care Association. They have sent us a paper on behalf of the Alzheimers Association Australia, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, Baptist Care Australia, Churches of Christ Network of Aged Care Services, the Salvation Army and Community Services AustraliaUniting Church. The covering note from the Catholic Health Care Association includes this quote: ... the groups' concerns focus on people who are elderly and frail being further disadvantaged by being denied access to high quality services due to their income and asset limitations. The Aged Care Bill offers little guarantee that with the use of accommodation bonds older people on low incomes will have their right of access to quality residential aged care places. Within the paper accompanying that and representing the group whose names I have just read out, under the heading 'Impact on equity', they state: A strong feature of the current system is its horizontal and vertical equity. Nursing home residents have equal access to the system regardless of income or assets. They go on to say: Under the new system, whilst income will not be a barrier other than entry into Ex.empt facilities be called 'ex.tra service places'), assets---or, in other words, the capacity to pay an Accommodation Bond-will. This has the potential to result in a two tiered system. Socio-economically deprived suburbs will have lesser quality buildings, whilst within some facilities the quality of the accommodation will depend on the resident's capacity to pay an Accommodation Bond. I have a couple more quotes, and I want to preface them by saying that it is terribly important that in this House we have the opportunity to put these things on record. This is not scaremongering from the opposition. These are comments from people-a lot of them fairly conservative groups in the world-who really have a view about what this Aged Care Bill is attempting to do to the care of our aged in our community. I now have a paper in front of me dated 3 June from the Aged Services Association of New South Wales and the ACT Inc. I quote: The Aged Services Association of NSW & ACT (ASA) today called on all Federal Members of Parliament, who will be debating the Government's proposed Aged Care Bill tomorrow, to argue for at least $12 a day in funding to support the care of those frail aged Australians who are financially disadvantaged. They go on to say: While ASA has welcomed the Minister's deferral of the introduction of the Government's major reforms to aged care from 1st July to 1st October, the Government's intention to debate the new legislation in the Lower House in the absence of the subordinate legislation and without knowing whether the model can be viable means that there can be no informed debate. We ask all Federal MPs to ask Minister Moylan for details on the new prudential arrangements, the guidelines on the new classification scale, the cost of funding the new accreditation process, and how she will honour her commitment to review the effectiveness of the reform process. The last paper I want to refer to today is from the Churches of Christ Homes and Community Services Inc. This is a fairly detailed paper sent some two to three weeks ago. They say at the beginning, 'We plead with you to read the contents of this letter.' The writer of the letter is the Chief Executive of the organisation, Wayne Belcher. He says: My fear for my residents and staff is that these (to changes will hurt many frail, dependent residents across Australia, their families and carers. These people live and die in your electorate. He says that to the MPs to whom that letter is addressed. A further objection to this bill follows from the untargeted nature of this $5 per day subsidy. Labor's capital funding was targeted. It was directed at those institutions that needed it m.ost and those people in the highest need. Under this bill, if no upgrade is required, or if the proprietor simply chooses, these taxpayer dollars-or proceeds of the sales of the pensioners' homes-need not go into capital upgrades. They can be taken as profit. Under Labor, capital funding for new and replacement not-for-profit hostels-90 per cent of hostels-was provided according to a targeted formula called variable capital funding. The emphasis was on enabling hostels to provide places for financially disadvantaged people. The proportion of financially disadvantaged people to be accommodated actually determined the level of capital grant payable. In 1994, each FDP place attracted a building subsidy of $50,550 and a land subsidy of $7,300. The funding of non-FDP places was linked to the funding of FDP places. Thus, as the number of FDP places increased, so did the number of other places funded. As for the allegation by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier this week that the Labor government stubbornly refused to inject more capital into the aged care sector, I refer him to the department of health annual reports which show that up until 1995 Labor invested $1.2 billion dollars into capital expenditure on aged care. To give but one direct piece of evidence to further illustrate that point, the Reverend Harry Herbert, Chair of Community Services Australia, in giving evidence before the recent Senate committee of inquiry into aged care, said: . . . in the last two years, the Uniting Church in NSW has received for the construction of hostels, $7,736,750-a large sum of money. None of these projects in regard to hostels would have proceeded without those capital grants. Please note, Prime Minister-capital grants. The Reverend Herbert went on to say in his evidence: This legislation-that is, your Aged Care Billends all those capital grants. Labor believes that nursing home care should be available to all Australians on the basis of clinical need and not on the basis of how much money you have. The capital for nursing home upgrades should come from general revenue and be applied on a needs basis. If the government can give $2 billion in tax breaks to the wealthy, give itself a $1.4 billion re-election slush fund in the form of the Natural Heritage Trust and give another $1.7 billion in health insurance tax breaks to wealthy people, it can afford the money which the aged care sector say is all that is needed to overcome their current problems. I close by saying this: for the sake of our older Australians confronted by the need to enter a nursing home at the most vulnerable time of their lives, and that of their families, please rethink this and stop your economic madness. Pass the amendments which will be moved by the shadow minister and which have been foreshadowed. Do it for the sake of my electorate and the people in my electorate who have come to see me-individuals who have sat in my office, individuals with whom I have had conversations with in the supermarket, everywhere-and who are saying to me that the impost it is going to bring to their families is just over the top. I do not think the government really realises to what degree the level of disappointment and dismay is now perpetrating out there amongst particularly our older people and our families in general. We should not be putting our families up for bartering for the sake of money. As I said a moment ago, entry into a nursing home should have nothing to do with that primarily. It should have a lot to do with whether or not you clinically need to go into that nursing home and, if you do, you should be able to .",109
241,Mr COBB,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I welcome the changes that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is introducing with the Aged Care Bill. I think it is long overdue. After having listened to the previous speaker, I can only think that those in opposition are living in a different world. There are many sensible and significant changes being proposed in this bill. One of the main and symbolic ones is that we are going to merge, for the first time, hostels and nursing homes-put them under the one roof, so to speak-over a period of time. I think that will be very beneficial indeed. It has many side benefits. I see cases where a married couple are both in a hostel. One deteriorates in health and has to move to a nursing home. The couple has to be split up because one has to be moved away. That is very tragic. There is no logic to it. That will cease under this bill. We also have the situation in my electorate where many hostels have in them people who should really be classified as needing to be in nursing homes. There are high percentages of them. This artificial barrier, which is long overdue to be changed, will break down. That is a good thing. The instrument that will drive this is the new residential classification scale, which means that people will be funded according to their care needs rather than their means. There will be eight funding categories and people can be upgraded as their health deteriorates over a period of time. That is the logical way to go with patients. One of the most exciting things in the new package is the way the minister is dealing with dementia care. This has been a longneglected area. Those with dementia have been funded in the past according to their overall physical health, which is often good. These people are ambulatory; they can move around. But in a hostel or nursing home situation, they can cause great disruption. Under the assessment of these people, the weighting given to dementia will effectively double. I think it moves from eight percentage points up to about 18 percentage points. I am told this will mean that, in practice, funding for dementia patients will increase by 30 per cent or more. This will mean that some aged person accommodation facilities will be able to specialise wholly or partially in dementia care. If they do so partially, for example, can put on a dementia wing so that these types of people can be contained within that wing and not interfere with other patients in the facility. The accommodation bond, or the old entry fee, has received a great deal of criticism from the opposition as they have run their scare campaign over recent months. That is unfortunate, and to some extent it is hypocritimore cal. Entry fees for hostels have been introduced by the Labor Party for almost a decade in this country. Because we are putting hostels and nursing homes under the same roof, we are just extending this entry fee to nursing homes. There is nothing remarkable about it at all. In fact, entry fees-now to be called accommodation bonds-have worked very well in hostels. They have worked very well for the providers as they have given them some capital to keep hostels upgraded. You have only to compare the standard of most hostels with nursing homes to see the difference that the fees have made. In the 12V2 years that I have been a member of parliament, I have never received one complaint from one constituent about entry fees into hostels. In fact, I was curious to see what was charged. In my main centre of Dubbo, I asked all the providers about that. The entry fees that were charged for hostel accommodation ranged from zero to $200,000. So, if people are well-off, they pay something; if they cannot afford it, they still get accommodation anyhow. It worked very well. It was supported by the Labor Party and it was supported by the coalition. Nobody batted an eyelid about it. Now we are extending it to nursing home type patients and suddenly the sky is apparently going to fall in. It is totally beyond me as to why this would be. I can only put it down to a misleading scare campaign. Apparently there is now charged across Australia an average entry fee into hostels of $26,000. If that is going to be the Australian average to get into an aged care facility in the future, for most people absolutely nothing changes whatsoever. I stress that, in respect of nursing home type patients, under the new arrangements for anybody who is in a nursing they home now the arrangements will not change at all. You will not be charged an entry fee. So those people will be quarantined from any fee. Also, anyone coming into a nursing home type situation will not have to pay anything for the first six months. So, if you move out, or if you pass on, obviously no payment will be made in that area. To that extent, it is lenient than what has existed for people who have entered hostel accommodation over the last decade or so in this country. Also it is a fee that the government does not impose on anyone. It is purely up to the provider as to wpether they charge it or not and there will be some very strict rules put in place as to how it will be administered. An amount of money roughly equivalent to 2Y2 times the pension must be left in the patient's bank account. At the moment, for a single pensioner that is about $22,500 and something close to double that for married couples. Nobody at all is going to be forced to sell their home. So, if you have a spouse still living in your home, that spouse can continue to live in that home. If you have a carer or a close relative who has been looking after you for a period of time, they may stay in that home. But, if it is obvious that you have the means to make a contribution towards your upkeep in aged person's accommodation, you will be expected to pay something. That is only fair and just when there is such a shortfall in the funding that is needed for aged person accommodation facilities. That has been the case, as I say, with hostels for the last decade or so. It has worked very well in the past and it will continue to work very well in the future. Of any accommodation bond that is paid, only $2,600 a year can be drawn down permanently for the use of the owner or provider of the aged person accommodation facility, and then only each year for a five year period. So a maximum withdrawal would be $13,000 over five years. It would actually be over 5V2 years because you are not charged for the first six months. So, after you leave the facility or you pass on, the remaining amount is returned to your estate. It will be protected by strict prudential requirements. It is interesting, and unfortunate, that the average stay in nursing home accommodation is in the order of only three years. So, if you did not pay anything for the first six months, after 2V2 years only $6,500 would have been taken out of any accommodation bond that was paid anyhow and the rest would be returned to your estate. So these are quite modest sums indeed. Of course, the providers of the facility would have the use of the interest on the accommodation bond to upgrade and maintain a higher standard that has existed in the past for you, the patient, to live indeed. in. So it will be your money being spent for your benefit. Again, I think that is the only logical way to go because, as has been stated earlier in the debate, and it is worth stating again, there is a capital funding crisis in nursing home type accommodation now in Australia: 11 per cent of them are not up to speed as far as fire standards go, 15 per cent of them are behind on health standards and 40 per cent of the facilities have four or more people in the same room. Professor Gregory, who did the study initiated by the previous government, said that you would need an injection of capital funding in the order of $125 million a year to bring the upgrading up to the standard it should be before you even think of providing for extra places. Apparently, the previous government's response to this was to provide $10 million a year, which obviously is totally inadequate. There are other changes that we are proposing too. Under the old system, there was far too much red tape and bureaucracy and the acquittal procedures were far too onerous. Providers had to account for virtually every staff minute of every day. Those will be simplified greatly, and I am sure that will be welcomed by the providers of these facilities. We also look at financially disadvantaged people, who are going to be called concessional residents. On average Australia-wide, there are 27 per cent of these people in such facilities. So we will make it a requirement that each facility has to take, on average, 27 per cent of concessional residents. Obviously, this will vary from region to region and the percentage for each region will be set. We will be giving an extra $1,825 a year, I believe, which will go towards the upkeep of these residents over and above what the providers will be getting from the government otherwise. I think the previous government was giving something in the order of $3 for those in hostels, nothing in nursing homes. We will be giving $5 in the first instance, and I hope that will be extended in future years to everybody. So I think that is very good One section in this bill which I am particularly pleased to see is the viability funding. Small services in remote and isolated areas will receive a viability subsidy. This will be paid in addition to the care subsidies. For facilities in isolated areas that have 15 or fewer places, that will work out at $16.25. For those with up to 29 people in their facility, that will be reduced to $10, and so it goes down a scale whether you are in an isolated area, a remote area or a rural area outside the large centres. It varies between $1 and $16.25. It will make those viable. In addition, we are also providing $40 million over four years in capital grants so that rural and remote areas can upgrade, which I think is very good indeed. In the time remaining to me, I want to make some comments particularly pertinent to my electorate about the formula of how areas are allocated places. The present formula as it exists is 100 places allocated for each thousand of population over the age of 70 years. Those 100 places are broken up into 40 nursing home places, 50 hostel places and 10 community aged care packages. Because nursing homes and hostels will be going under the one roof, that figure of 40 and 50 will become 90 and that will give the facilities much more flexibility. They can have all nursing home type patients if they wish; they can have all hostel type patients if they wish; they can have dementia patients if they wish. That will be a great assistance. What I want to raise over and above the issue of the viability funding and the capital funding for rural and remote areas is a particular problem that exists in country areas. If you are an aged person that needs to go into such a facility in the city, in your suburb, and there is not a place available for you, what happens? You go out to the next suburb that can accommodate you-which may be five or 10 or, at the most, 15 or 20 kilometres away-and you look there. If you work through half a dozen suburbs, eventually you will find a facility that can accommodate you. So, sure, you may not find a place exactly where you live, but you are not that far away-only 10 or 15 kilometres-and your relatives can still visit you, and the system works very well indeed. But if you are in the bush, that is not so. If you live in a town like Cobar, for example, in my electorate and there are no places available-as there are not at the moment in Cobar-the next available places happen to be in Brewarrina, which is several hundred kilometres away. To ship people out of a country town hundreds of kilometres away to another town when they are in the twilight of their life, in a frail condition, when their health is failing, is a cruel and distressing thing to do. Even though Cobar has a population of 7,000 people, it happens to have 14 nursing home places and 14 hostel places. Because it has a low number of people-not much in excess of 200-over the age of 70, the number of places they have got makes them about 35 per cent over quota. So in all conscience I, as the local member, cannot ask for more places. Nyngan, which is only a hundred-odd kilometres away, does not have any nursing home places at all. People from Nyngan have to be next on the list for when places become available. It means that they have to be shipped several hundred kilometres away. It is almost a sentence of death. Their relatives are not able to visit them as much as they could if they could get a place nearby. These people pine, they do not do well. It is a great problem. In Broken Hill, it is even worse. The nearest place to go to is Adelaide, 550 kilometres away; Sydney is 1,200 kilometres away. So there is no easy solution. If you come from Tibooburra, which is 330 kilometres from Broken Hill, you have got an even greater problem. What do we do about this? How do we overcome it? In a lot of country towns, if there is a hospital with spare beds, they put these people in that hospital on a temporary basis until a position falls due in one of the aged care facilities. That is not totally satisfactory, but it is better than being shipped out several hundred kilometres away. That is all very well. But in many instances these people are clogging up the hospitals. In Nyngan, for example, where there are no nursing home facilities, 50 per cent of the hospital is full of these people. In Broken Hill, which has III nursing home places-that is slightly over quota for the number of nursing home places-30 per cent of the hospital is full of aged care people. There is nothing wrong with that, in a sense, except that it is messing up the surgical list. It is very difficult to attract surgeons to Broken Hill as it is, let alone to have their surgical lists constantly disrupted because there are not enough beds in the hospital. So there is a problem there. Again, I say, 'How do we overcome itT You could probably have a situation whereby health board areas were allocated a number of bed places which could be moved from town to town according to a town's need. You will usually find that shire councils are willing to make available, at a cost to themno cost to the taxpayer-the capital funding to provide these places. The Commonwealth would only be up for the recurrent funding which, for a nursing home type person, is in the order of $30,000 a year. So instead of moving a person out from Cobar to Brewarrina, they could stay in Cobar. There would be no greater cost to the government, because if the person went to Brewarrina the Commonwealth would still be up for the recurrent funding. But even that is not totally satisfactory. I think we have to have a proper debate in this country, to get more funds for aged person accommodation places. To shift that formula of 90 places per 1,000 people over the age of 70 is going to be incredibly expensive indeed. Just to lift it from 90 to 100, let alone from 90 to 110, with the ageing population we have in this country and the greater expectation for these sorts of beds, hundreds of millions of dollars would be needed. Hundred of millions of dollars are not there in the budget. So we either have to have increased taxes or a special Medicare levy or a rejigging of the priority of spending in this country. It is going to be a major shift, but has to be done and it will have to be faced up to in the next five to 10 years in this country, if not immediately. I would like to flag that debate in this country. We have to have it. For too long we have flick-passed this responsibility that we have. If we are going to call ourselves a civilisation, we have to look after the elderly, who have given us the standard of living that we enjoy. We have to ensure that they can be looked after in a proper manner in the twilight years of their life.",111
242,Mr JENKINS,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"In no other area of policy yet presented by the Howard government have we seen displayed such a flawed proposal based on flawed ideology as we have seen in these proposals for nursing home care. Even though I describe this as a flawed proposal, matters are compounded by the fact that it is being implemented with such flawed methodology. In fairness to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), this morning the House had an opportunity to give her time to take this bill away and to ensure that answers could be given to a number of matters th, remain unclear in the government's proposaJ Some of these matters that were mentioned in the motion that was defeated earlier today were: consideration of the prudential arrangements that would be put in place to safeguard the residents' up-front entry fees; details of the classification instruments; consideration of an independent body to monitor the numbers of concessional residents and exempt beds that would be provided by regions; consideration or explanation of mechanisms for accountability for the use of the funds; and a rethink on the proposed $5 per day capital subsidy for concessional residents. I know that it is against the standing orders to reflect upon a decision of this place, but the opposition tried to give the government an out, an opportunity to consider these matters. Another aspect of this debate that has concerned me is the galling notion from those opposite that the Labor governments under Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating had neglected aged care; that the 'crisis' of nursing home care is an indication of 13 years of neglect under Labor. The past 15 months have it taught me a lesson. When you are in government for 13 years, you have a record. When you have been in government for 13 years, in some areas you can have form. If you have been in government for 13 years, in some areas you can have pride. But in aged residential care there is nothing that Labor should be ashamed of about its achievements in government. Another thing I was careful to do was to reflect upon other contributions that I have made over the years about aged care to ensure that in my contribution to this debate today I did not trip up by contradicting myself. One of the interesting things I found in doing this investigation was that in 1986, when I first spoke on aged care in the House of Representatives, aged care was in a parlous state. There were inequities that revolved about the way in which residential care was provided to aged people and people with disabilities. There had been a series of inquiries that established and benchmarked where we were at at that stage. There was the expenditure committee report under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). One always has to mention the honourable member for Watson, the Chief Opposition Whip. I do not wish to blatantly curry favour, but in this regard the MCLeay report was very much an important aspect of the debate at the time. In the Senate there was the Giles report and there was a review conducted as a result of an initiative by the then Minister for Community Services, Senator Grimes. In the contribution I made in 1986, I referred to the nursing homes and hostels review. I want to mention a couple of things about the state of this sector at that time. I quoted the review stating: Government, deficit-financed and participating profit homes predominate in low socio-economic areas. The report further stated: ... there are considerably more participating-forprofit homes in high status areas. My great fear is that the brave new world of aged care envisaged by the present government will return us to this type of situation; that as the years go on, if their version of aged care is implemented, we will have yet again developed a two-tier system. This piece of legislation perhaps more than any other represents the mean-spiritedness of the government. It has been condemned by a wide range of groups involved in aged care in Australia. For instance, just today Aged Care Australia announced that it cannot support the passage of this legislation. Aged Care Australia, the largest provider group of residential aged care services in Australia, representing 1,300 hostels and nursing homes, states that: The government has provided insufficient information for our members to be confident that the proposals are viable ... This is from an organisation which admits that it might support the thrust of the government's changes. Aged Care Australia goes on state: ACA can only give its support for the Aged Care Bill when we have full knowledge and understanding of the proposals, and when we are confident about the provision of appropriate funding. That goes directly to the heart of my comments about the implementation being a flawed methodology. The ACA statement indicates the widespread dissatisfaction with this piece of legislation, whether it be due to its flaws or because of the injustice it represents. The government still has not framed any arrangements to protect people's entry contributions. The legislation is before us, and there is no framework yet in place. The government has still not worked out what the auditing procedures to formally monitor the quality of care in nursing homes will be. The bill does not mention the ratio of paid beds to concessional beds. There is nothing about the classification instrument used to determine the rate of residential care subsidy. The government is treating the non- parliament with contempt by asking the House to consider this legislation with so many unanswered questions. In the absence of all this information, there is a great deal of concern in the community. Despite this, the government has the cheek to call the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) the shadow minister for scaring because she has been vocal in pointing out the deficiencies in this legislation. However, it is the uncertainty created by the government's own contradictions in the legislation that has concerned and even scared people. The injustices in this legislation are glaringly obvious. The government claims that no-one will be forced to sell their homes, yet the legislation specifically includes the family home as an asset. The government cannot have it both ways. If it wanted to guarantee that no-one would have to sell their homes, it could have excluded them from any assets test. However, the minister and the government members themselves cannot seem to agree on the implications for the family home. Since the entry contribution was announced, a string of government members have stood in this place and guaranteed that no-one will have to sell their homes to get into a nursing home. Then today in this debate the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) asked whether it would really be so bad if the family home had to be sold. I can assure her that, to the majority of constituents in my electorate, it would be. Later in the debate the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) said that no-one would have to sell their homes, but then added that it was not really the family home any more because no-one lived there. The minister and government members who have stated publicly that no-one need sell their homes must be aware that the opposition will hold them to this guarantee. They will be called to explain themselves when the first sales occur. The sale of the family home is not the only injustice in this bill. The government fails to fundamentally understand that hostels are completely different from nursing homes. Hostels are an accommodation option. Nursing homes are about care. This issue is about access to care. If the government is so concerned about the condition of Australia's nursing homes, why did it decide to slash around $577 million from aged care in the 1996 budget? The government's primary concern was to reduce funding for aged care and transfer this to the users of the nursing homes. It should not be deceitful and claim that it does this to upgrade buildings or to provide services. If we look at the proposal that is contained in this policy, we see that there is no upper limit on the size of the entry contribution. There is really no idea how much a place in a nursing home will cost. The government argues that there is a crisis in nursing home capital stock and that this is the justification for the entry fee. Yet the legislation does not even require this. In addition, the interest earned on the entry fee is kept by the nursing home and can also be taken purely as profit. It is these contradictions in this poorly thought out bill that are causing angst in the community. The government should not try to put this one on the opposition. The community concern is justified and has been created entirely by the government. The government has been putting out this furphy that their nursing home policy is simply an extension of the previous Labor government's hostel policy. The government says this as if hostels are interchangeable with nursing homes. One of the essential ingredients of their policy is the amalgamation of nursing homes and hostels into a single care institution. While there are people in the aged care sector who have little objection to such an amalgamation, it is the proposal that the hostel funding system can be simply transferred over to apply to nursing homes that is really at the heart of the opposition's objections. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has alleged that Labor should be supporting the bill because it is 'modelled on one of your measures'. In other words, we should support this because the system of nursing home entry will be the same for nursing homes as we introduced for hostels. As has been explained time and again but has still been ignored by the government, nursing homes and hostels are different in the way people come to enter them and in the type of people who live in them. They were created separately and set up with different funding mechanisms for this reason. As I have said, hostels are about accommodation. The government has that much right. But nursing homes are about care. People take months to decide to move into a hostel and make all the arrangements to do so. But nursing home entry is not about choice; it is about getting care and, in some cases, getting it fast in days or even hours. It is out of necessity. More than of 60 per cent of those entering nursing homes come from an acute hospital after a serious illness such as a stroke. Many are also suffering from some degree of dementia. A less appropriate condition for engaging in negotiations over the size of entry fees and the sale of one's house is hard to imagine. I stress that access to nursing homes is not a choice. It is based on need. At the heart of the opposition's concerns here is the government's proposal that much of the regulation and operation of the aged care sector be left up to market forces. There is absolutely no way that Labor would have adopted the uncapped entry fee and market forces model of the government. Like Professor Gregory, Labor believes that market forces are inappropriate regulators care. The inquiry that is referred to quite often by government speakers and the minister is the Gregory inquiry, which investiwhich gated the capital funding needs of nursing homes. The government fails to mention Professor Gregory's comments about vehicles for raising the funds. One of the vehicles Professor Gregory has said was not appropriAudit, ate was the type of up-front entry contribution that the government will now be putting place. Why champion the factual information about the need for capital improvements against the indication that a model that been suggested for getting some form of additional funding is flawed? To understand why the government has fallen into this minefield of its own making, Audit report. it is necessary to understand the real motivation behind the bill. In the first place, the Howard government's major and overriding interest in aged care is to reduce the amount of money spent on older Australians. The 1996 budget cut more than half a billion dollars-$577 million-from aged care over four years. Here the savings were reducing outlays on capital commitments, Entering $244 million; reducing subsidies paid to vulnerability nursing homes for care,.· $253 million; and psychological introducing user charging for HACC, $72 entry million. Thus, it must be stressed that the home. Howard government's primary consideration is saving money, not necessarily concern for building upgrades or provision of services for older Australians. The philosophic underpinning of the government's policy on aged care can be found in the report of the National Commission of Audit. This report raised concerns about the pressure on government expenditure resulting from the ageing of the population, especially expenditure on health care, nursing home care and the age pension. The commission recommended greater reliance on user charging, introduction of more competition and devolution of services to the states. The report suggested that that last point alone will save 10 per cent. The report also recommended the introduction of entry and exit fees for nursing homes. But the National Commission of Audit of report gives no explanation about the basis to the conclusions that that audit came to on nursing homes. It is a very scant document is very silent about the methodology that was used by the audit to come to the conclusions. Even worse, because of the government's decision not to make a formal that response to the National Commission of there has been no explanation as to why the government has adopted this proposal in contained within the National Commission of Audit report. As I have said in relation to issues other than nursing homes, in the abhas sence of a formal response to the National Commission of Audit report the government is just successively, especially in budgets, implementing some of the suggestions that were placed in the National Commission of The desire to cut government spending on aged care and to follow the edicts of the National Commission of Audit are behind this bill-not the spurious claims of the Minister for Family Services that there is some crisis in aged care that must be addressed. As made by: Professor Gregory puts it: a nursing home is a time of considerable and little choice for most people ... market forces could do little to ameliorate the impact of being forced to consider an contribution at the point of entering a nursing Other aspects of the amalgamation of hostels and nursing homes need to be considered. For instance, what happens when a person living in a stand-alone hostel, which is predominantly what we have in my electorate, is properly assessed as requiring a level of care akin to what we now would understand to be nursing home care, which requires a level of formal nursing intervention in the care of a person? How does the hostel go about supplying that level of care for a particular individual who might be one out? How does a stand-alone hostel make the adequate changes to the capital infrastructure of that hostel to cater for people who live in the hostels but move to that level of care requirement? These types of questions need to be answered by the government before this procedure is implemented. We also need to know the answer to, as the shadow minister put it, the catch-22 situation of aged care centres getting certain classifications. An aged care centre has to be classified in a certain way to be allowed to charge the up-front entry contribution in the form of an accommodation bond but, if it is in need of capital infrastructure improvements to get that classification, it will not get the classification and it cannot charge the accommodation bond.

243,Dr NELSON,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Bradfield) (6.41 p.m.)There are few things that this government is doing that make me more proud to be a member of it than this. I went into public life for a number of reasons. I have an unfinished agenda, you might say, but not far from the top of it was substantial reform in the way that Australia's aged residential care sector is financed. I feel that in many ways our country, despite changes in the last year, is still at five minutes to midnight. To put it into perspective, just under five per cent of us will eventually need some form of residential aged care. In the absence of a cure, about eight per cent of us over the age of 75 will eventually suffer from dementia. At the moment, about 13.3 per cent of us are over the age of 65; by the year 2050, almost a third of us will be older than 65. Referring, as the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) did, to the National Commission of Audit report produced by Professor Bob Gregory-a report I commend to all honourable members-at the moment the aged dependency ratio in Australia is 5.3 to 1. That means that there are 5.3 Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person over the age of 64 or under the age of 15. Over the next 40 years that ratio will go, according to the present population growth, to 2.6 to one. Last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 7.8 million Australians who were working and paying taxes to support 6.2 million Australians who were relying, most through no fault of their own, on some form of social security benefit. In the absence of some change in the way that we raise finances, as I said in the Main Committee only a short time ago, and also in the way in which we structure our essential expenditures in health, education and welfare, those trend lines will cross within a decade. This reform that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the government are introducing and are determined to see to an end is about vision. It is about where Australia is going to be in the year 2030. It is about ensuring that we have a sustainable, affordable residential aged care sector and one in particular in which you, I or any other member of this House would be quite happy to live. This reform is also about changing cultural expectations, and this is where I think many on our side differ from those on the other: we are saying to younger Australians, people perhaps in my generation, that they cannot blow all their money on holidays and nice cars; they actually have to start making some provision and giving some thought to who will be financing their care when they reach an age where perhaps they are going to need it. That, in a broad sense, is what the principle, the philosophy and, I dare say, the need for this kind of legislation are all about. In government, the Australian Labor Party went to the 1996 election with a policy on care for older people. There were 210 words on Australia's future in residential aged care. I am not normally one that engages in ideological invective, but I will quote that policy directly. It says: Labor recognises that there are some issues to be addressed around hostel funding and the classification system in relation to dementia care needs. Labor will pursue structural reform of the hostel sector to improve funding for dementia care in particular and higher care needs generally to be implemented from 1996 to 1997. For those of us who are accustomed to reading political party policies-as I am, both from the outside of the parliament and indeed from inside it-that is code for the fact that the ALP, if it had been returned to office, would have done very much what we are doing now. Whilst many of the honourable and decent members, like the member for Scullin, would disagree with that, I have little doubt that it was on the agenda for most of those who are knowledgeable about what is required in aged care. Before I tum specifically to some of the details of the bill, perhaps I ought to remind the House that, in the budget, the government actually increased the amount of money available for aged care by just under six per cent. Home and community care funding was increased by just over six per cent. But members are quite right to point out that we are introducing a user-pays system on a means tested basis for those who can afford it. That money can be spent only on the care of the people who will be contributing to it. The government is introducing a rigorous planning system which will cover services to people in their own homes, services in residential care for people with low care needs and people with high care needs. I suspect, from reading the 210 words in the Labor Party's policy platform, we are also unifying the residential classification instrument, which means ageing in place and allows for the capacity of providers to either provide a range of services or specialise in particular areas, such as dementia. Concessional residents are people who do not have to pay an accommodation bond, or at least would not be eligible for consideration of paying a bond, and full-time or part-time pensioners who have not owned their home in the past two years and who have assets less than $22,500 a year. For a married resident, only half of the couple's combined assets are to be counted. There are also to be assisted residents, and they are those who can pay only a small bond, for which a higher daily subsidy will be paid by the government. Providers who do not meet the quota for concessional residents will face deductions from their subsidy. In other words, funding will not be provided for places that concessional residents should have occupied. Vulnerable concessional residents will be protected, more so than they are now under the present system. Aged care assessment teams will assess and prioritise prospective residents in a multidisciplinary manner on the basis of need. No-one is going to go into a care institution on the basis of anything other than need, because the ACA Ts, as they are known, will continue to fill the role that they currently do. People who cannot afford a bond will not be asked to pay a bond and those who are eligible have no compulsion placed upon them to do so. Referring to the Labor Party model introduced into the hostel sector in 1988, 40 per cent of eligible people-people who were eligible to pay a bond-have not paid a bond. The resident going in and their family, or their lawyer, or whoever they may choose to negotiate on their behalf, have up to six months to negotiate that bond. That bond may be paid within that six-month period and go into some prudential trust arrangements, which I will cover in a moment. That bond may be paid as a higher weekly, fortnightly or monthly payment or it may be taken as a debt against the estate of that person should they pass on. At the moment, the reality of the situation is that only four per cent of people in nursing homes return home, in most cases to die. A person may negotiate a situation where the family home is maintained, they maintain ownership of it, and the bond, or at least the necessary draw down and interest that would have been paid on that bond, is paid from that person's estate once they have passed on. As I said earlier, it is worth remembering that there will be people eligible to pay a bond who will not in fact pay one at all. The third thing is that there will be a quota of 27 per cent applied to concessional residents. Importantly, in applying that quota, there will also be regional variations. So in some parts of Australia where it is clear that a higher quota may be required the department will negotiate with providers and state government agencies to allow for a higher quota. There will also be a higher daily payment of $5, about which we have heard so much, that will be paid for concessional residents. Understandably, there are those who say, 'If a draw down is $2,600 a year, six months in arrears, that would amount to $7 a day. So why isn't the government paying a concessional subsidy of $7 a day?' The answer to that is, firstly, that they are working on the assumption that everyone will pay an accommodation bond, and they will not. Secondly, the assumption put by the opposition, and some people in the aged care sector who should know better, is that everybody will be paying a maximum draw down of $2,600 a year. In fact, there will be residents who will pay only a very small bond and their drawn down will be considerably less than $2,600 a year. The daily level of capital depreciation, as calculated by the department, is $4.62 a day. I think $5 is quite a reasonable and an adequate level at which to commence concessional payments. We should also keep in mind that the entire bill and its implementation is the subject of constant review and negotiation between providers and those who represent the interests of older Australians and those of us who are getting there. Eligible smaller services in regional Australia will receive a viability subsidy and may be eligible for a viability subsidy on top of the concessional resident subsidy in recognition of the higher costs that they incur and the economies of scale that they do not enjoy. Prudential arrangements are important and they are enshrined in this bill to protect accommodation bonds. There are three components to the prudential arrangements. Firstly, the facilities must maintain a minimum level of assets in a liquid form so that bonds can be repaid as residents leave. Secondly, an industry fund will be established into which providers will pay a proportion of bonds to act as a lender of last resort should a provider's liquidity prove to be insufficient. Thirdly, insurance will provide coverage against particularly large claims and prevent the fund from becoming eroded. Specialist financial, actuarial and legal expertise is now developing the detail, with the government constantly also seeking the views of provider organisations and consumers. I do not think any legitimate provider or consumer organisation in this country could nominate an area of government activity that has been the subject of more rigorous and constant feedback by government than this one. The bill also provides for ministerial discretion for approving alternative prudential arrangements in exceptional cases, which may involve some of the church and charitable organisations. Whilst I have a very high regard for that sector, I think that most of us in modem society are aware that not every organisation is necessarily beyond these kinds of prudential arrangements. The prudential costs will present some cost to providers, but is that not part of the responsibility that is attached to the privilege of being able to charge accommodation bonds? I do not think it is unreasonable that providers pay a small amount and have a financial interest in seeing the prudential arrangements work, and work well. In regard to the resident classification instrument, at the moment about 40 per cent of hostel residents have care needs that should see them in a nursing home. Under the current arrangements neither they nor the provider is reimbursed adequately for their care. The new instrument, which has been trialled with 20,000 residents in 400 facilities, will not only more equitably finance what have been hostel and nursing home services, now leading to their amalgamation, but it will also enable ageing in place to occur. So if someone has been in a nursing home for three or four years and suffers a stroke or some other intellectual or physical disability and is then required to relocate to a nursing home, under these proposals, once they go into the institution, whatever happens to them, they will be able to remain there. Equally, if not more importantly, when a husband and a wife go in after 40, 50 or even 60 years of marriage it means that both of them can stay in the same institution and neither will be required to move. The legislation will also allow long overdue increased funding for dementia. Providers will now attract appropriate funding for those people suffering from dementia and currently cared for in hostels. All existing residents already in an aged care facility when the bill takes effect will remain on their existing classification and only when that expires will they be assessed under the new scale. This will be after 12 months for nursing home residents and after six months for those currently in hostels. There are eight care categories in the new resident classification instrument. All but level 8 will attract a level of funding. Two broad bands will exist, the lower care level category being from categories 5 to 8 inclusive. Twenty-two questions will lead to the allocation of a waiting and subsequent classification of the resident. This is nothing new for those who run and work within nursing homes. ACA TS will not be involved in classification but those aged care assessment teams will be involved in the reassessment of those in lower band categories for whom it is considered reallocation or reclassification may be necessary. Training will be and is being provided to providers. All 3,000 residential aged care facilities across Australia will be offered training in a number of locations around the country. One day sessions will be offered on aspects of the reform, but in particular the new RCI, a home study kit being sent in advance. Importantly in this bill we are also establishing the Aged Care Standards Agency. This has involved providers, consumers and government in its development. Independent assessment of quality of care will be provided and monitored by ACATS. There will be regular publishing of reports on issues of quality and access and waiting times. For the first time in the nursing home sector we are now going to have residents and their families, and perhaps their lawyers, standing at the door of a nursing home being asked to pay an accommodation bond if they are eligible. They will be saying: 'If you think that I am going to pay a $20,000 or $30,000 accommodation bond to come into this institution you have got another think coming.' In other words, the families, whom I have found have had a very real interest in the financial affairs of their ageing relatives, will be saying: 'I do not know if this is the sort of place I want my mother to be in. I don't know whether she should invest $30,000 in this and possibly be subject to a means tested daily fee.' In other words, the consumer is going to have a very real financial interest in the quality of what is being provided, as well as the Aged Care Standards Agency. The way to ensure proper nursing care, by the way, is not through any structural or legislative program, but rather a program that ensures that standards are being met. Action will be taken against those who reduce levels of care. Apart from anything else, they will not be able to charge an accommodation bond. Amounts derived from bonds have to be used, can only be used, on the care of the very person who is paying the bond. It can only be spent on improving and maintaining the capital of the home in which that person is living. The bond can only be charged by a facility which has been accredited, which has met the necessary standards. The standard will be raised progressively over time. That will mean that providers will have to keep investing in their building to make sure that he or she can continue to charge a bond. Labor, in contrast, did not stop hostel providers under their system from charging accommodation bonds for substandard accommodation. These changes are about the future. Governments, I think justifiably, are frequently accused of thinking only in terms of shortterm political cycles. Those on the other side who are engaged in political opportunism at the moment need to hose themselves down a little and have a think about the kind of Australia that we are all-Labor or Liberalgoing to be living in in 2020. If the government of the day does not have the political courage and intestinal fortitude to implement these reforms and do it now, then we are abrogating our responsibilities to the next and subsequent generations. When you look at Bob Gregory's report in 1994 and you consider that we then had to spend $1 billion bringing nursing home capital up to fire, health, outcome and design standards, when you consider that almost 40 per cent of residents in residential aged care institutions at the moment live with at least three other people, when you consider the demands of the generation behind them who have been accustomed to a standard of living that those currently in homes did not enjoythose who lived through the Depression and went to wars and did other things to make this country what it currently is-and when you consider what the next generation's expectations are, you realise that these reforms should have been made in 1988 when the Labor government, to its real credit, introduced reforms into the hostel sector. Also, the point ought be made that, if this government were only about popUlism, do you think we would be doing this? If we were simply about appealing to primitive electoral instincts in people, don't you think that we would succumb to some of the populist nonsense that is being spread by some on the other side? Instead, the government is about making sure that we have a future in which older people get the care that they deserve and expect.",119
244,Mr LEE,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak in support of the amendments which have been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) as the Labor Party has serious reservations and grave concerns about the impact of this particular piece of legislation. First of all, to understand what this legislation is all about, you have to understand when it was announced and what it is really intended to do. It was announced on budget night last year. It is all about cutting back federal spending on aged care by half a billion dollars because the forward estimates produced in last year's budget show that in the first four years the budget will save $577 million as a result of the changes announced in this particular package of legislation and in one other change announced in last year's budget which also reduces federal spending on aged care. So it is driven not by some intention to upgrade the standard or quality of our nursing homes, as every government speaker has claimed in the debate; it is about trying to cut back federal expenditure on providing quality aged care for elderly Australians. I will explain that in some detail later in my speech. The government says that it is about trying to cut back government spending. So why isn't the government quite open and honest about its intentions? I think there would perhaps be greater acceptance in the wider community if the government was open and up-front about admitting what is really driving these reforms. It is not about improving the quality of nursing homes; it is about saving Mr Howard a few dollars so that we can package up some nice election promise come the next election. When you realise that the failed savings rebate-which gives the directors of BHP $450 and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) $450 in this year's budget-would more than pay for the cutbacks that will be implemented by this legislation, and, if redirected into aged care, would obviate the need for all of this, then that makes it quite clear that the government's priorities are quite misdirected. These measures introduce two major changes. The first is the imposition of the up-front entry fee or the up-front accommodation bond, as the government calls it. The imposition of this uncapped, new, up-front entry fee is going to mean that wealthy people who can afford to pay very large up-front fees are going to have access to the best nursing homes beds. It is going to mean that those people who are less well off and are not able to provide that accommodation bond, that upfront entry fee, are going to be relegated to the back of the queue. They will be the elderly Australians who are left with the poorest level of care in the poorest quality nursing homes. The second measure that is implemented with this legislation is the imposition of additional daily fees for nursing home residents. The imposition of this new fee means that residents will be paying an extra 25c in the dollar for every dollar over the pensionfree area. This might sound reasonable to some of the hard-hearted accountants on the government benches. We even had the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) proudly boast that full rate pensioners would not pay this additional impost on their pension. Thank God full rate pensioners do not pay, battling as they do on that very modest sum of money that they receive from the government for the years of working and paying taxes for all of their lives. If an aged pensioner or a service pensioner earns $1 more than $50 a week, then this government says that they are going to impose an additional tax on those people. It will not be imposed on high income earners, it will be imposed on people who are earning $51 a week, which is a very modest sum of money these days when it has to meet the cost of part of their medication, their upkeep and their clothing. Fifty one dollars a week is a pitiful level at which to bring in this new, additional 25c in the dollar rate. That is in addition to some other ways that the government seeks to whack elderly Australians. I have done a bit of work on the imposts that are placed on a pensioner in that position, where a part pensioner earns a little bit of money above the free rate. They not only get hit with income tax; they get hit with the Medicare levy, they get hit with withdrawal of that pensioner rebate and, as a result of change, they are going to be hit with the50c in the dollar reduction in their pension because of the social security means test and this new 25c in the dollar means test as applied to cover the cost of their daily nursing home fees. The all-up cost of this is that the effective marginal tax rate, the effective withdrawal rate-the equivalent of the effective tax rate for these part pensioners-is going to be up in the range of 78c to 91c in the dollar.  not pay 91c in the dollar. I suspect Rupert Murdoch does not even pay 78c in the dollar. So how could we expect part pensioners on very modest sums of money to be paying effective rates of tax of between 78c and 91c in the dollar? That is what the government will deliver as a result of the imposition of this new 25c in the dollar means test on the daily nursing home benefit. It is outrageous that the government is seeking to impose these new imposts on people who are on very modest sums of money. The other point I would like to make is that there is a bit of a split in the government. Usually they stick to one particular line-I will concede that-but there are two groups within the government speakers on this legislation. One group claims that no-one will have to sell their home. The other group is typified by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), and I made some notes from her contribution earlier today. She said, 'What is so terrible about selling your home? If I move, I sell mine. What is so terrible about having to sell your home to move into a nursing horneT That is what the honourable member for Hindmarsh said. I do not know if that is the view shared by other Liberal members who are in the chamber at the moment, but I think that sums up the feelings of a group of government members who are speaking in this debate. It is okay for the honourable member for Hindmarsh to say that. If she sells her home, she can negotiate the purchase of a new home, unit or property. But how do you think people seeking entry to a nursing homethis often people who have been in hospital or have had a stroke; often people whose families are under enormous pressure at this time in their lives-would cope? I think it is quite unfair for the member for Hindmarsh to equate her circumstances with that of the family of a person who is trying to decide whether he or she should reside in a nursing home. In the words from the mouth of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, there is nothing so terrible about someone being required to sell their home. The government says, 'It's optional. It is not compulsory. This is just market forces. It's up to each person considering being admitted to a nursing home to reach agreement with the owner of the nursing home.' The problem the government faces is that it does not understand what the Corporations Law is going to do. We have some very competent officials in the advisers' box tonight, I am sure. They take very copious notes, and I would ask them to pass our concerns about this on to the minister so she can answer this question-a question we have raised in this House before-in her summing up to this second reading debate. Under the Corporations Law, if there is a for-profit nursing home being run by a private entrepreneur--especially one that might be listed on the stock exchange-the directors and the management of that company have to do all they can to maximise the returns to the shareholders. That is their obligation by law. If that for-profit nursing home has one spare bed and it has to choose between a person who can afford to pay $200,000 for the upfront fee, a person who can only afford to pay $88,000 for the up-front fee and a person who is disadvantaged and cannot afford to pay any up-front fee, the Corporations Law says the nursing home has to give the bed to the person who can afford $200,000, otherwise the directors of the company breach their fiduciary duty to their shareholders. Let us just put the $200,000 to one side. Let us say there is a nursing home on the Central Coast that has decided they will charge everyone-whatever their means, however rich they are-$88,000 as their upfront fee. If a person is disadvantaged, the government will say, 'Don't worry. We'll put in a bit of extra money per day.' That was fine until we found out last week that the generous sum of money the government is going to offer is only $3 a day. There is no way that $3 a day can make up to a for-profit nursing home the amount they can earn from having an $88,000 bond in a bank account somewhere earning interest. The question I put to the minister is this: does she deny that the Corporations Law will require a nursing home proprietor in those circumstances to deny the disadvantaged person that bed? We have asked the minister that before, but this time we hope to get an answer. Because of the Corporations Law, the introduction of market forces with nursing home accommodation will mean that a lot of low income Australians, elderly Australians, will be very severely hurt by these changes. Government members delight in referring to Professor Gregory's review of nursing home accommodation. They then go on to claim that Professor Gregory's findings on the capital needs of the nursing home sector justify the imposition of this market forces approach. The problem for the government is that, in chapter 5 of Professor Gregory's report, he particularly went out of his way to discourage the Australian parliament from heading down this approach of market forces. I would like to quote from what Professor Gregory said in chapter 5: The circumstances under which clients seek access to nursing homes are considerably different from hostel clients. Approximately 60% of nursing home admissions are from hospitals. This is one indicator of the fact that nursing home entry is often urgent, motivated overwhelmingly by the need for nursing care. The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to sell assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry. He then goes on to describe it as a measure which seems too harsh. It is completely misleading for members of the Liberal and National parties to claim that in some way Professor Gregory endorses the introduction of up-front fees. He does not. It is certainly wrong for Liberal and National Party members to say that in some way Professor Gregory supports or justifies the imposition of this new 25c in the dollar means test on part-pensioners who earn only $51 a week. Someone of Professor Gregory's background and concerns would never argue that low income Australians should be targeted in that way. When the honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to the concerns that have been expressed by many of those involved in the charitable sector of aged care, she dismissed these people as 'fellow travellers'. We presume she was not referring to them as being fellow travellers of the Communist Party-the old expression of the 1950s. We presume she meant they were fellow travellers of the Labor Party because they had had the temerity to criticise the government's decision and to express concerns about the impact the government's decision was going to have on low income Australians. It is pretty hard to believe that an organisation such as Community Services Australia, the national body for community services in the Uniting Church, is in some way aligned to any side of politics, when it says that the government subsidy of $3 a day is: ... an insult to our elderly and a slap in the face for charitable service providers. It is pretty hard to challenge the view of the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association who said, on 27 May, that this will inevitably result in a two-tiered aged care system. They said: The problem arises because of the Government's con.Jletely inadequate supplementary funding for concessional residents. We have the Australian Catholic Health Care Association who said that they cannot support funding changes because: . . . under the proposed changes the government will provide a capital regeneration subsidy of $5 a day per bed for fir.ancially disadvantaged people while the payment of an accommodation bond will generate an average of $19 per bed per day for non-financially disadvantaged Australians. If the government is picking up the measly subsidy, then it is clear that you are much worse off. Mr lull interjecting",123
245,Mr LEE,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"The minister at the table is· grumbling away there but I am sure he would not describe this group as being in any way associated with - our side of politics. On 11 May the Alzheimers Association of Australia, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association again, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Baptist Community Care, Churches of Christ, Community Services of Australia and the Salvation Army aged care services issued a joint paper expressing their concerns about the impact of the aged care legislation on Australians with low incomes. All of these are being dismissed by government members as fellow travellers when these are organisations and individuals that have put enormous resources and an enormous amount of their own time into trying to look after elderly Australians and trying to make sure that disadvantaged elderly Australians in particular are not left behind as a result of the changes that this government is seeking to implement. My other concerns in many ways have developed after I had a number of discussions with a person who lives within the electorate of Robertson. This gentleman's name is Mr Neville Boyce and he appeared before the Senate committee. Anyone who lives on the Central Coast knows that Neville Boyce is the former Chief Executive of the Central Coast Area Health Service. He very bravely attacked Labor and Liberal ministers for health over many years of distinguished service looking after the area health service. I would like to read a few quotes from Mr Boyce's submission to the Senate committee. On page 1 he says: Having read the Aged Care Bill 1997 I would have believed, if the act had not come from the government, that these pages were written by the nursing home industry as they are so skewed to benefit the provider. He goes on to say: The proposed changes will cause great distress to the elderly and their families. How can the present government, without a mandate, introduce means testing and a capital contribution at the end of one's life span when entry into the public hospital system is almost free to the richest people of the country? Mr Boyce goes on to make the point that on the Central Coast we are very fortunate to have high quality nursing home beds available to people. The danger that Mr Boyce has raised is that, if you allow the market forces approach, disadvantaged elderly residents of the Central Coast will be priced out of the market. Of course, it does not take long to drive from the electorate of Bradfield to the Central Coast and we can imagine that, before long, residents of the northern suburbs of Sydney will be able to pay very large sums of money for access to the beds of the nursing homes on the Central Coast. This a concern which has been raised by Mr Boyce in his submission to the Senate and it is a concern that I think should cause the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) to seriously rethink his strong support for this particular legislation. If that does not cause the member for Robertson to rethink his position I would encourage him to attend another meeting of the Self-funded Retirees Association at the Gosford Central Coast branch who, I know, have grave reservations about the impacts of these changes on elderly Australians on the Central Coast. The crucial point is that the Labor Party's position is that we think nursing home care should be available equally to all Australians on the basis of clinical need rather than on the basis of their financial circumstances. It should really be considered the same as hospital care. If people need to be admitted to a hospital they are admitted. If people need to be admitted to a nursing home they do not do it by choice; they do it because of medical need and because they are assessed by the aged care assessment teams as having certain clinical conditions that require them to have that 24-hour nursing home care. The final point I wish to make is that we expect that, unless something unusual happens in the Senate, this government legislation will pass in the not too distant future. The opposition will do all it can to try to persuade a majority in the Senate not to approve the legislation because we think it is unfair and it is going to hurt elderly Australians. But if, at the end of the day, we are wrong then we give every Liberal and National Party member of this House an assurance that elderly Australians in your electorates will hold you accountable in future days.",126
246,Mr EOIN CAMERON,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. This is a bill which is long overdue but which the former Labor government never had the courage to introduce. We heard this morning the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), the shadow minister for social security, and opposition speakers since criticise this legislation. Many of the things they are critical of do not exist in the legislation. They are simply perpetuating a fear campaign that they have been spreading in the community for quite some time. One thing the shadow minister said is that this legislation creates a two-tiered system. That is a complete load of rot. The funding arrangements contained in the legislation simply reflect the arrangements the former Labor government introduced with hostels. We have merely extended it to nursing homes. Look who has commended this policy: the former Labor minister, Gary Johns. He has not been deceived by the tricks campaign of the member for Jagajaga. The shadow minister has also misrepresented the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), as is her wont, saying that he: ... believes and has said in the Parliament that his Government's plan to make people sell their homes to get nursing home care is the repayment of a debt. The government has never said people would be forced to sell their homes. No-one is being forced to. We are simply asking those who can afford to make a contribution for their entry to residential care accommodation to do so if they can. What is wrong with that? If the member for Jagajaga had her way, people would not pay to enter nursing homes but taxes would need to go up to pay for nursing home upkeep or, as we saw in the Labor years, nursing homes would continue to deteriorate to significantly poor standards. But that would not bother the member for Jagajaga. If we can believe her utterances, she would be happy for the living standards of the aged to fall. What the member for J agajaga also failed to acknowledge was that, under Labor, 50 per cent of people freely chose t- sell their homes before going into an aged care facility. The member for Jagajaga's comments ring hollow when you look at the facts behind what she has to say. She is a fearmonger, as we all know. If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) wants to find the treacherous MP undermining his party and continually sniping, as was reported in the Australian this morning, perhaps he ought to look no further than the member for J agajaga because, on her record, she is the one to snipe and to scare, and she has been doing that during her term as a shadow minister. Mr Lee-I'm starting to think you don't like her. I'm starting to think you don't like her.",127
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,Mr Nehl)Order! Mr Lee-I'm starting to think you don't like her.,127
248,Mr EOIN CAMERON,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"She is a complete and utter disgrace. This bill aims to provide for the policy needs of the next century. Mr Lee- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If I am being called to order, I accept that, but how about other members of the House who are calling the member for Jagajaga a disgrace? I find that offensive and I ask you to have it withdrawn. MI DEPUTY SPEAKER-I didn't near anybody do that. Mr Lee-The member over there did and he will admit it, I am sure.",127
249,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I am not conducting a witch hunt, but I did hear you three times, and that is why I called you to order. All members know that it is out of order to continually interject.",128
250,Mr EOIN CAMERON,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"The opposition simply aims at scoring points for the next election. They are in for a really bad result. They have total disregard for what is responsible long-term policy. This bill has been introduced by the minister for caring, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). Amendments have been moved by the shadow minister for scaring, the member for Jagajaga, who has since her election to this place made it an absolute art form to scare the wits out of the most vulnerable in our society-the elderly people in our community. We have heard much misinformation from the opposition-both within this place and also out in the general community-about the aged care reform being undertaken by the government. It is a shame that the opposition have sought to score cheap political points from the government's genuine and necessary attempt to provide a framework for the future of aged care so that we have the best available sustainable provisions for the elderly today and in the future. It appears the opposition would rather Australia's aged live in deteriorating conditions without the funding that is required so desperately. They do not want to support this bill, but they offer no alternative as to how to provide for our ageing population. Nor do they explain how a Labor government would fund the provision of residential care and other services for the aged. Their opposition indicates they want Australia's aged to suffer in their final years in deteriorating accommodation without the significant funding necessary to maintain nursing homes. I should not need to remind the House that we are living in an ageing society and, as such, our policy focus should be on providing the infrastructure and resources that cater for their needs both today and in the future. If we do not address these policy issues today, the burden will be on future generations to make the tough decisions in the years to come which will meet the demands of the aged and provide the necessary funding so urgently required now. This bill is a responsible bill. It ensures appropriate provision of residential accommodation for the aged which safeguards their quality of life. This bill addresses the key issues, ensuring access to residential aged care is based on need, ensuring entry contributions operate consistently and fairly and introducing effective and fair income testing arrangements to support all these measures. The bill ensures that those who can afford to make a contribution to the accommodation costs do so. Too often I hear people say that, while they desire a service from the government or someone else, they do not believe that they should be required to contribute to the cost of it. This bill requires those who can afford to make a contribution to do so. It is responsible legislation which provides for residents to take up their responsibility. The contribution that will be made by those who can afford to is called an accommodation bond, and the bond will be gi ven to the residential care provider. From that bond, the provider can draw down a maximum-as the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) emphasised here earlier today-of $2,600 per annum for a period not exceeding five years. That is a total maximum of $13,000. The balance will be refunded to the resident or their estate on departure. It is not an exorbitant contribution by any standards, but it is a contribution which will provide for the upkeep of the residents over time, without the burden being placed predominantly on the government. I cannot see why someone who can afford to provide for their own accommodation should not. Those residents who are required to pay an accommodation bond will also be provided with alternative payment methods: as a lump sum or on a periodical basis or as a combination of both. Further, those who pay the accommodation bond will have their bond protected via the provision in the legislation for prudential safeguards. This will allow residents to enter residential accommodation without fear of their contribution being lost the event of the provider experiencing financial difficulty. Notwithstanding that, those who cannot afford to contribute will be protected by this legislation. As the minister has said previously-and repeatedly-financial disadvantage will not affect a person's ability to get the care they require. This legislation provides for income testing to determine one's ability to pay. That is the right course of action to take. Institutional Every residential care facility will be required to provide a minimum number of places for concessional residents-that is, full or part pensioners who have not owned their own home in the past two years and who have assets worth less than 2Y2 times the single aged pension. The target will be 27 per cent of nursing home and hostel residents nationally, but the actual numbers will be calculated in each region, according to their local need. Another important aspect of this legislation is that it provides strategies for ensuring that the rights of aged care recipients and the quality of care are maintained and strengthened. The essence of the bill is to provide aged care recipients with the same rights as all other Australians. The burden will be on the provider to meet a basic standard of care in the interests of the residents. The legislation we are debating is will meet the needs and requirements of our elderly in the near future and beyond while ensuring their accommodation needs and standards of living are more than adequate and are funded appropriately. Older Australians deserve better than they received under 13 negligent years of Labor. This bill provides it. I commend it and the minister for caring-as opposed to the shadow minister for scaring-to the House. Debate interrupted. NA",128
251,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being almost 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Bringing Them Home",129
252,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Scullin) (7.30 p.m.)Tonight I wish to read into the Hansard in record some quotes from the report Bringing them home of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. In doing so, I wish to highlight a point that was made in the inquiry that these practices were known to many people, that 'People did know, but the warnings went unheeded.' On page 44 of the report, in talking about institutional life, there is this quote: life is prejudicial to a healthy development of character and the rearing of children as good and useful men and women. The one fatal and all-sufficient objection to the massing of children together under the necessary conditions of barrack life is, its utter variance from the family system recognised by nature in the constitution of human society as the best suited for the training of the young. That is a quote from the 1874 Public Charities Commission of Inquiry. Another quote I wish to read into the record appears on page 123 of the report: There is not and never should be occasion for the Children to be taken away from their parents and farmed out among white people. That was written by J.e. Genders, editor of Daylight magazine, in 1924. On page 140 of the report, there is a quote from the 1930s: I know many stock breeders who would not dream of crowding their stock in the way that these halftimely. It caste children are huddled. This was a quote from John MCEwen, Minister of the Interior, after visiting the Half-Caste Home in Darwin in 1937. The thing that struck me in particular was that this practice was nationwide and continued for a considerably long time. A case that really struck home to me was the case of Paul, who in evidence said, 'For 18 years the state of Victoria referred to me as state ward No. 54321.' Paul was born in May 1964. My youngest sister was born in September 1963. In the evidence he gave, Paul said: My Mother and I lived together within an inner suburb of Melbourne. At the age of five and a half months, both my Mother and I became ill. My Mother took me to the Royal Children's Hospital, where I was admitted. Upon my recovery, the Social Welfare Department of the Royal Children's Hospital persuaded my Mother to board me into St Gabriel's Babies' Home in Balwyn ... just until Mum regained her health. If only Mum could've known the secret, deceitful agenda of the State welfare system that was about to be put into motion-18 years of forced separation between a loving mother and her son. Early in 1965, I was made a ward of the State. The reason given by the State was that, 'Mother is unable to provide adequate care for her son'. He went on to say: When my Mother came for one of her visits, found an empty cot. With the stroke of a pen, Mother's heart and spirit had been shattered. she was to describe this to me as one of 'darkest days of her life'. Paul then described how he went to a foster family. He said: When I'd say to my foster family, 'why am I a different colour?', they would laugh would tell me to drink plenty of milk, 'and then you will look more like us'. The other sons would call me names such as 'their little Abo', and tease me. At the time, I didn't know what this meant, it did really hurt, and I'd run into the bedroom crying. They would threaten to hurt me if anyone they said these things. Paul, in speaking about his mother, said: She wrote many letters to the State Welfare Authorities, pleading with them back. Birthday and Christmas cards were sent care of the Welfare Department. All these letters were shelved, the State Welfare Department treated Mother like dirt, and with utter contempt, as never existed. The Department rejected and scoffed at all my Mother's cries and pleas for help. Subsequently, Paul was discharged from state wardship in May 1982. Paul described what the officer said upon his discharge. He said: ... his Department's position was only to protect me and, 'that is why you were not told these things before'. He placed in front of me 368 pages file, together with letters, photos and birthday cards. He informed me that my surname would change back to my Mother's maiden name of Angus. Confidential submission No. 133 says: When Paul located his mother at the age of 18 she was working in a hostel for Aboriginal children with 20 children under her care. She died six later at the age of 45. I think that this is a shameful period of our history that should be better known. I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, which was in government in some state jurisdictions, has apologised on our behalf. (Time expired) Drought Relief",129
253,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to commend the government for its announcement today of a three-month extension of drought relief payments for farmers who have been suffering from exceptional drought. For she several years much of eastern and northern my Australia has been in drought. It took a long Later, time to persuade the previous government that the the drought was serious, that there was a crisis in the bush. Eventually, the former government could ignore the problem no longer, and all of Queensland and much of New South Wales was declared to be in the at me, and grip of an exceptional drought. A range of emergency measures were put in place that have helped many farmers to but survive. There was a full range of rural adjustment scheme measures. Also, the access I told to social security benefits was eased. This has indeed been an exceptional drought. It has not just affected the marginal areas but, indeed, those that are normally to give her son more secure. Following fairly general rainfall, the excepmy tional drought status was lifted from much of if she Queensland and New South Wales. All of my own electorate was declared free of exceptional drought except for one shire last year. The new government recognised that it does not rain cash, so they extended the eligibility for some of these measures to give farmers time to recover. An extra $160 million was provided to extend access to social security benefits of my to 10 December and then to 10 June. These benefits do not pay farm bills, but they have enabled many farmers to keep food on the table and have enabled their children to go to school respectably dressed. These benefits would have expired in less than a week. But, with today's announcement by the years government, this vital assistance will continue. The drought, sadly, has not ended, with rainfall drying up in many parts of southern Queensland. In the first quarter of this year, most of south Queensland has recorded rainfalls in the 10 per cent historic low range. The Queensland government is again declaring shires in my electorate drought stricken, including Kilkivan and Murgon shires which have rarely been drought declared in their history. With the end of the wet season now upon us and winter frosts arriving, the prospects are indeed poor. Cattle prices are appalling, grain prices are low and the weather bureau is now forecasting with, sadly, some degree of confidence that EI Nino is returning and the prospects for good winter rainfall are poor. The government announced a new $198.9 million integrated rural package in the budget. This will replace the old rural adjustment scheme, which has been terminated following an unflattering review of its performance. The government intends to announce details of the new measures in this package later in the year, but this interim announcement today will help keep farmers afloat until the new measures are announced. Around 5,800 farm families are expected to benefit. Had this announcement not been made, their lifeline would have ended next week. For these growers, for these farmers, the government has acted with compassion. It has provided interim relief and they will now be looking forward with some more confidence to what this new integrated rural package will contain. I hope that it will provide not only measures to assist farmers with the management of their property but also access to some kind of welfare assistance as a safety net whenever emergencies arise in the future. No farmer wants to live on welfare. They do not expect to be able to access it every day, but there should be a safety net in place to assist them, as there is for other sectors of the community, when disastrous circumstances befall them. They also need counselling services. I call on the government to provide continuing funding to support the rural counsellors who are in place to ensure that they can assist farmers through these difficult times and, when there are those who need to leave the industry, provide them with the sort of advice and help they need so they can have an honourable exit. The government's decision today recognised the serious plight confronting many people in rural industry. It is only an interim measure, but hopefully the measures to be announced in the integrated rural policy package will secure the future of the rural sector and guarantee hope for farmers for the future. Bringing Them Home",130
254,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to commend the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Ronald Wilson, for the report Bringing them home, which was the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. It is a very heart-breaking report, and I commend all of those associated with it. There is one particular case that I have been reading in this report that I would like to have in the Hansard record tonight, and that is the case of Millicent, who was taken from her family in 1945 when she was four years of age. Her parents were half-castes, she was one of seven children and they lived very happily together, but five children were taken away. They were taken to a protection area and, as she called it, to Sister Kate's, as the home was known. They had a very trying life, a very hard existence. The children lined up to have their parents come to visit them. Their parents did not come, and they were told their parents did not come because their family did not care. It then describes how she went through hell as a very, very young child. But, worse than that, it goes on further on page 116 where she said that, no matter what she had when she was young: The worse was yet to come. While I was in first year high school I was sent out to work on a farm as a domestic. I thought it would be great to get away from the home for a while. At first it was. I was made welcome· and treated with kindness. The four shillings I was payed went to the home. I wasn't allowed to keep it, I didn't care. I was never payed for the work I did at Sister Kate's so you don't miss what you didn't get, pocket money etc. The first time. I was sent to the farm for only a few weeks and then back to school. In the next holidays I had to go back. This time it was a terrifying experience, the man of the house used to come into my room at night and force me to have sex. I tried to fight him off but he was too strong. When I returned to the home I was feeling so used and unwanted. I went to the Matron and told her what happened. She washed my mouth out with soap and boxed my ears and told me that awful things would happen to me if I told any of the other kids. I was so scared and wanted to die. When the next school holidays came I begged not to be sent to that farm again. But they would not listen and said I had to. I ran away from the home, I was going to try to find my family. It was impossible, I didn't even know where to go. The only thing was to go back. I got a good belting and had to kneel at the altar everyday after school for two weeks. Then I had to go back to that farm to work. The anguish and humiliation of being sent back was bad enough but the worse was yet to come. This time. I was raped, bashed and slashed with a razor blade on both of my arms and legs because I would not stop struggling and screaming. The farmer and one of his workers raped me several times. I wanted to die, I wanted my mother to take me home where I would be safe and wanted. Because I was bruised and in a state of shock I didn't have to do any work but wasn't allowed to leave the property. When they returned me to the home I once again went to the Matron. I got a belting with a wet ironing cord, my mouth washed out with soap and put in a cottage by myself away from everyone so I couldn't talk to the other girls. They constantly told me that I was bad and a disgrace and if anyone knew it would bring shame to Sister Kate's Home. They showed me no comfort which I desperately needed. I became more and more distant from everyone and tried to block everything out of my mind but couldn't. I ate rat poison to try and kill myself but became very sick and vomited. This meant another belting. After several weeks of being kept away from everyone I was examined by a doctor who told the Matron I was pregnant. Another belting, they blamed me for everything that had happened. I didn't care what happened to me anymore and kept to myself. All I wanted now was to have my baby and get away .. . My daughter was born [in 1962]and, I might add, my twin daughters were born in 1961at King Edward Memorial Hospital. I was so happy, I had a beautiful baby girl of my own who 1 could love and cherish and have with me always. But my dreams were soon crushed: the bastards took her from me and said she would be fostered out until I was old enough to look after her. They said when I left Sister Kate's I could have my baby back. I couldn't believe what was happening. My baby was taken away from me just as I was from my mother. Once again, I approached the Matron asking for the Address of my family and address of the foster family who had my daughter. She said that it was Government Policy not to give information about family and she could not help me. I then asked again about my baby girl and was told she did not know her whereabouts. In desperation I rang the King Edward Memorial Hospital. They said there was no record of me ever giving birth or of my daughter Toni. Then I wrote to the Native Welfare Department only to be told the same thing and that there were no records of the D. family because all records were destroyed ... It shows this woman's desperation both as a child of the hell she went through and as a mother when she tried to redeem her child. She went to South Australia. She went back many times to Western Australia. The final part of this story is as follows: Defeated I finally returned to Adelaide. In my heart I believed that one day everything would be alright and I would be reunited with my family. My baby was dead. (That's what I was told). I didn't even get to hold her, kiss her and had no photographs, but her image would always be with me, and I would always love her. They couldn't take that away from me. Confidential submission 640, South Australia: WA woman removed in 1949 ... A woman bom in 1962 was searching for her birth mother. This was Toni, Millicent's daughter. The two have since been reunited. I would commend this report to everyone not only here in this parliament but throughout Australia. It is worth reading and it is action we must take. More and more we must stand up and be counted. (Time expired) Hong, Mr David C.S.",131
255,Mr HARDGRAVE,ADJOURNMENT,"The death yesterday of Mr David C.S. Hong should be mourned by all Australians. David Hong was a great man. My deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Linda, his family and his colleagues, both here in Australia and back in Taiwan. His role as representative of the Taiwanese government to Canberra was one he relished and his efforts in promoting stronger cultural and economic ties between both nations were producing great dividends for both countries. David was just 59 years old. He was a career diplomat with service including as Consul-General in Cape Town, South Africa. David Hong died in the line of duty for his country. His death yesterday morning in Melbourne, following a stroke, has certainly shocked me and many others in this place. We shared dinner just a few days ago-the annual dinner of the Australia-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group--and warmly bade each other goodbye, secure in the knowledge that we would no doubt see each other again soon. David was one of the first people who welcomed me to Canberra, making a courtesy visit to my Parliament House office a year ago. This gesture summed up David Hong for me. He was a gentleman, a fine diplomat, a great representative for his country, and a strong advocate for both our nations. David and I met each other on countless occasions here in Canberra and also in my electorate of Moreton. It is certainly worth reflecting on the diffiern cult post which David Hong held. Australia, like most Western countries, has a one-China policy: we do not officially recognise Taiwan. David Hong could not be called ambassador for his country. Here he was called the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. He was like a rock in the middle of a raging torrent-the torrent being the maelstrom of mainland China, ever checking our adherence to our one-China policy. David reflected upon this in his speech to the parliamentary friendship group just last week. I, like many others in this place, share his frustrations. David Hong represented a nation of 21 million people, proudly democratic and aggressively free enterprise. He constantly tried to do things to improve the situation of official dealings between our two countries. It must have been frustrating to him last week to read headlines about the PRC ruthlessly working to suffocate Taiwan's links with Australia. No other country should tell this country who our friends should be. Given that Taiwan has the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world and is looking for places to invest, it is very much so in Australia's interests to promote strong ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan as well as with the People's Republic of China. Last April I was privileged to be a guest of the Taiwanese government as a member of a delegation from this parliament's friendship group. Along with colleagues from both sides of politics, including Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I met with key legislators, bureaucrats and, importantly, the captains of industry in Taiwan. There are many major Australian companies with operations in Taiwan-Readymix, Transfield, CSR and many others. China Motors is affiliated with Mitsubishi Motors in Australia and Japan and they now order 2,000 Australian made Diamante luxury cars for the Taiwan market each year. These cars are made in South Australia and are the top of the range of China Motors' fleet. This is another example of Australian jobs being created by the economic ties with Taiwan. In the southindustrial port city of Kaohsiung, there are strong links with Australia, particularly with people from my own electorate. The delegation visited the headquarters of An Feng Steel, coincidently on the day that local newspapers reported that the Howard federal government was giving the go-ahead for a joint venture between An Feng Steel and an Australian company, Kingstream, to construct and operate a steel smelter at Geraldton, Western Australia. This is a multi-billion dollar project which is going to eam a lot of money for Australia. The success of this project will trigger even more investment by other Taiwanese companies. Taiwan's 'look south' foreign investment policy is very much so focused on Australia. This is imponant and good news. It is also part of the work done which was done by David Hong. The Moreton electorate has more people of Taiwanese origin than any other electorate in Australia. So there are many people whom I represent in this place who share the grief that I have for the passing of David Hong. David Hong supported and encouraged the efforts of groups in my electorate to promote friendship and understanding between all Australians, especially over the past difficult year as some have tried to raise racial tensions. Those groups include the Taiwanese Friendship Society of Queensland, the Taiwan Women's League and the ROC-Australia Business Association. I am pleased to be part of a government which supports Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organisation, in tandem with the entry of the PRC in the near future. The goodwill that is between Australia and Taiwan will strengthen in the years ahead. With closer economic and cultural ties comes more understanding and more cross-pollination of people and ideas and capital. Australia needs a friendship with both Chinas. Australia has lost a good friend in sudden and tragic circumstances. I am greatly saddened by the death of David Hong. Taiwan, though, will continue to have many goods friends in this place and throughout Australia, as we as a nation have in Taiwan. Bringing Them Home",132
256,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (7.50 p.m.)I rise tonight to raise the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. The stolen generations inquiry, as it has become known, has brought to light the continuing devastation of the lives of thousands of indigenous people in this country as a result of policies and practices which shamefully continued until very recently in our history. For any of my colleagues in this House who have any lingering doubts about the morality or context of these policies, I recommend that you read the report. The report details many excerpts from evidence given to the inquiry by witnesses who suffered under these policies. Let me give you examples, firstly, from a Western Australian woman removed from her family at the age of 10. In her confidential evidence, No. 821, she told the inquiry: I was at the post office with my Mum and Aunty [and cousin]. They put us in the police ute and they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [about ten miles] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were screaming in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth. Further on, on page 204 of the report, she outlines details of what happened to her after she was taken. She said: I was taken there because I was 'half-caste'. I started thinking, 'Why do I deserve to be treated like this?' But as the years went by, I sort of accepted all that. We were treated differently to white and black people. We weren't allowed to go down to see our Aboriginal people, or go into the houses where the white people were. We just had to live around the outside of the house. They made us feel like we weren't allowed to do anything: no freedom of movement, even to think for yourself. They had to tell you what to do, and how to think. We were locked up in the dormitories, and had to go and ask for anything. We had to go and ask if we could go and see our people. We were more or less like slaves, I think. We didn't think that was wrong. We just thought it was our duty. We did what we were told. Years later, when we were grown up, our own boss-by this time we were married and having our children-we were having families and still couldn't go up and ask the managers if we could get married. They had to tell you who you had to marry. We didn't know what was their plans for us. We just lived and did what we were told. I was almost ashamed to be half-caste sometimes. I had no confidence in myself, or how to make up my mind what to do ... When I was growing up I wanted to be a teacher or a nurse. But you couldn't say that because you had to go to school and go out and work in the house, do domestic duties. That's what they said. We lost much of our culture, our language and traditional knowledge, our kinship and our land. Mr Speaker, this report represents the cultural genocide of a whole generation or generations of people. I certainly recommend it to you. Dealing with these issues does not mean adopting personal guilt about past actions. The view that making a decent response to said this issue somehow confers this guilt on white Australians is a furphy being bandied around by extremists like the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and, unfortunately, more sensible people like the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in an attempt to cloud the issue and somehow try to justify their position of not having the leadership and the guts to make the right decision and properly compensate indigenous people. This cannot be brought down to dollars and cents. This is about the morally right thing to do. The fact that today's comments by Jose Ramos Horta and Mick Dodson have been criticised for bringing criticism on Australia. I think is absolutely ironic. They cannot ignore this report. We as parliamentarians cannot ignore this report. People should not exacerbate the damage which has been done by condemning people for speaking out on these facts. It is unfortunate that Australia's reputation will be damaged unless we do the right thing by offering an appropriate apology, a full apology on behalf of our nation, just as Tony Blair has made an apology for the Irish potato famine. If that is good enough, why is it not good enough for us when we are talking about events which occurred as recently as the 1970s? That is step one. Step 2 is to offer proper compensation for indigenous people. (Time expired) Bringing Them Home J .K. Williams Contracting Pty Ltd Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (7.55 p.m.)-No doubt the report mentioned by the previous member, the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), is of concern to all members of parliament and has been treated with all the compassion and sympathy that this government can offer. I commend the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and cabinet in relation to that report. Its recommendations will certainly be considered in the normal parliamentary process. I rise tonight with a grievance from J.K. Williams Contracting Pty Ltd, which is a small company in my electorate which is having trouble with the Australian Taxation Office. The Taxation Law Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993 introduced the investment allowance to kick-start Australia out of the economic recession. At the time, unemployment was in double digits, economic growth was stagnant and the Australian economy was in dire trouble. Australia was in the worse economic recession for 60 years. The government asked Australian businesses, particularly small businesses, such as J.K. Williams, to help boost Australia's economic prospects. It offered a major incentive-the investment allowance-to provide an appropriate carrot for Australian businesses to invest in capital equipment. J.K. Williams duly heeded the government's call and invested substantial capital sums in equipment-two caterpillar scrapers from Gough and Gilmore. Were it not for the investment allowance, J.K. Williams would not have bought the equipment because J.K. Williams could not otherwise afford it. Therefore, in the terms of the government's policy, J.K. Williams did exactly what the government wanted it to do. J.K. Williams's actions were pro-business, pro-Australian and should be commended. But, alas, J.K. Williams has become a victim of the ATO's obsession with legal form. In acquiring the equipment, J.K. Williams was careful to ensure that it complied with the highly complex investment allowance provisions. As you will appreciate, like all small businesses with limited resources, complying to the letter of the law is extremely difficult. However, J.K. Williams did 100 per cent of the things in accordance with the spirit of the law and sought as best as it could to comply with the strict letter of the law. In fact, only a person highly trained in contract law would even begin to think that there may have been a technical failure to comply with the letter of the law. J.K. Williams entered into a written contract with Gough and Gilmore before 30 June 1990, which was the last date on which contracts could be entered into in order to qualify for the investment allowance. The equipment was delivered before 30 June 1995, which was the last day on which the equipment had to be installed and ready for use in order to qualify for the investment allowance. J.K. Williams met with the National Australia Bank before 30 June 1994, and the NAB agreed to fund the acquisition. However, because of the time delay between the making interrupted. of the contract with Gough and Gilmore and the delivery of the equipment, the NAB and J.K. Williams agreed to finalise the form of the financing-be it a loan, be it a hire purchase agreement, a bank overdraft or a mortgage. It was not considered that it would do this until 10 months time. J.K. Williams, Gough and Gilmore and the National Australia Bank have signed letters Nos. 128, 129. unequivocally stating there was a binding contract for J.K. Williams to acquire equipment prior to the end of June 1994. The NAB at no point owned the equipment. contract was with J.K. Williams and Gough and Gilmore to purchase this equipment. The Australian Taxation Office has found that 10 months later a new contract appeared out of thin air. Somehow NAB entered into brand new hire purchase agreement to provide HIS 9, HIS 11. these scrapers to J.K. Williams. That seems an incredibly pedantic and tight interpretation of the law which is exactly at odds with everything the legislation was introduced to do. J.K. Williams entered into the contract good faith. Where a major tax incentive is introduced such as the investment allowance and where hard working honest small business taxpayers such as J.K. Williams comply with the spirit of the law and seek as best they can to comply with the letter of the law, should as a matter of administrative practice the ATO seek to defeat the government's policy?

Mr Sharp-The amended answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department does not have breakups of vessels by twenty foot equivalent unit for international trade. I have supplied instead the statistics for quantity (tonnes) and value($A). The Department has estimated that an average of 14 tonnes (based on Port of Melbourne figures in WaterlineMarch 1997)is carried per teu. Ship categories are different to that the honourable member. This is necessary because of the aggregations that have already been done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to the data supplied to the Department. This data categories the vessels somewhat differently to that requested. The tables try to match the ves-el categories as closely as possible to those requested. Ro-ro have been included as a separate category, as these vessels carry both container and break-bulk cargo, as well as vehicles.
