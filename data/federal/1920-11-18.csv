4,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"As we are approaching the season in which the beautiful sentiment of peace on earth and good will towards men is the spirit which should actuate us, will the Prune Minister make a supreme effort to avert the industrial disaster that threatens Australia in connection with an award under his Industrial Peace Act 1 The matter is very serious, and the outlook for a merry Christmas is for many'people very black indeed.",19
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No one realizes better than I do what may follow if a modus vivendi is not found. I have endeavoured to secure it by making representations to both parties, but have failed. I do not of His know what more I can do. Yesterday afternoon the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) made an interjection which I did not catch at the time, but the reading of which furnished me with a few moments' entertainment this morning. He said that what has occurred is the result of abolishing the Arbitration OffiCourt. I do not know whether we are to assume that the remark was an effort of humour on his part.",19
6,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,"B y no means. Mr HUiGHES - Well , it is not true that the Arbitration Court has been abolished. The Court is in existence, and much more efficiently equipped for its work now than ever it was before. Further, the honourable member and other members know that the miners have declined point-blank to go to that Court, and have held to that position for the last four years, whether rightly or wrongly it is not for me to say. It wasbecause of their refusal to go to the Arbitration Court that the Industrial Peace Bill was introduced. I have only to add that under the Industrial Peace Act there is less opportunity for the employment oflawyers, of whom my honourable friend isi one, than under the arbitration legislation. Perhaps he has an interjection to make in regard to that.",19

12,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"for Dr asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, tipon notice I. Is it a fact that nearly three years ago the Institute of Science and Industry recommended that the Excise regulations for the methylation of alcohol should be relaxed so as to permit of the utilization of methylating materials which can be produced in Australia at reasonable cost? 2. If so, what action, if any, has been taken by the Excise authorities to relax the regulations ? 3. Is it a fact that the production of alcohol for power purposes in Queensland and other parts of Australia is at present blocked owing to the impossibility of procuring, at reasonable cost, supplies of methyl alcohol, which is now required to be used under the Excise regulations ? 4. Is it a fact that the United States of America Internal Revenue Department does not now require the use of methyl alcohol as a denaturant ? 5. If so, will the Excise authorities relax the regulation, so as to permit of the use of pyridine or other coal tar distillates as one of the methylating materials required to be used in Australia? [269] 6. Has the Government given due consideration to the great necessity for assisting the production of much needed alcohol industrial spirit? 7. If so, what support or assistance has been given ?",20
13,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The answers bo the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. Yes. The methlyating materials recommended by the Institute were certain coal tar oil distillates. 2. The regulations have been relaxed, but not so as to permit the use of coal tar oil distillates in lieu of wood naphtha. 3 - I have been so informed in' regard to Queensland only.. The difficulty is due to a world shortage in supplies of wood naphtha, of which methyl alcohol is one of the chief constituents. 4. Yes, as to certain specified formula? only, but in others the addition of wood naphtha is still required. It is pointed out, however, that prohibition is now in force in the United States of America, with the result that the Excise revenue aspect of the denaturation question is radically different from that in Australia. 5. For many years certain coal tar distillates, viz., pyridine and coal tar naphtha (including benzole) have been authorized when used with a small percentage of wood naphtha. 6. The matter has been constantly under consideration. 7. By relaxation of the methylating requirements, and making special grants to the Institute of Science and Industry. Before, however, a decision can be reached as to the kind and extent of support or assistance which may MALONEY) properly be given by the Government, it is necessary to find a cheaper but satisfactory denaturant to take the place of wood naphtha. This problem is being investigated by the British Government and also by the Commonwealth Government. MERCANTILE MARINE. WAB SEEVIOE MEDAL .",20

I have in my possession a memorial submitted to the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), from which I propose to read, the following: Melbourne, 6th March, 1918. To the Prime Minister of Australia. - Memorial from the Australian Farmers Federal Organization, in which is incorporated the Farmers and Settlers Associations of Australia. From time to time our ears have been tickled by economic principles laid down by you, and none more so than the one enunciated when you were dealing with the recent coal strike, iri November last, and which we now call to your memory:"" I hope that, in the interest of the country, as well as of the industry, a settlement when it is arrived at will be a settlement that must leave the industry in a position to carry on its business which, with that reasonable margin of profit which every industry is entitled to, while giving to the men of all classes' those reasonable conditions which they are entitled . to, will at the same time protect the general interests of the country."" These principles we thoroughly endorse, and ' urge their application to the wheat industry, and on their realization the wheat farmers of Australia will fervently repeat the words: "" Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer."" Formula submitted by the Labour Conket ference of New South Wales. In New ministration, South Wales I submitted the following to the Country Section of the 1918 Conference, which was accepted and afterwards adopted by the Conference sentatives and became the policy of the party in that State. ",22
36,Mr JH CATTS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"The Country Seceffected, tion met and adopted this policy, which was afterwards adopted, at its recommenequal dation, by the general Conference:Australian Labour - party, State of New South Wales. Policy for the handling, financing, and marketing of Australian grain as adopted Annual Conference, New South Wales, June, 1018. I will read those portions which affect the graph 10 price for local consumption8. That the Labour party's 1914 Election Policy, "" Commonwealth Line of Steamers,"" under which the Commonwealth service established, be expanded to cover the whole of Australia's requirements in shipping, providing for the carriage of our products at reasonable rates. 9. That farmers be paid for wheat conwarrant sumed in Australia at a fair price, based upon the cost of production, to be ascertained by the application of the formula set forth in the next succeeding paragraph. 10. The price of wheat for home tion in Australia shall be ascertained investigation in each State, and thereafter upon an average of the result of those investiof the 16th September. 1919. gations based upon the following:(a-)-The average cost of working area sized farm in each State a period of five years prior first fixation of price, and that cost be kept up-to-date from year to year thereafter. (I) The payment of a Union wage to all persons, including the self, and any member of his employed In the production of the wheat crop. (c) The cost of necessary farming implements at ruling Australian prices, together with allowance for depreciation and renewal. (d) The ruling rate of interest on essential capital employed in operating the farm to be allowed in computing the cost of production. (e) An allowance, as profit to the farmer, of an amount equal to the ruling rate of interest, on .the necessary capital employed in operating the farm. 11. The Commonwealth Government shall re'tain in Australia at least one year's supply of wheat towards meeting any unexpected shortage in the annual production. 12. That the farmers be paid the world's marrates for ail export wheat, less cost of adthus preventing the exploitation of Australian farmers by other countries, as Labour was the case in 1916 and 1917. 13. That farmers be paid in full for their wheat delivered at rail to Government repreby a special note issue made legal tender, such notes to be withdrawn and retired as settlements of wheat sales are effected. Provided, however, that in any case where a contract of sale for export wlieat has not been the payment to the farmer shall be upon delivery as beforementioned, an amount to the price fixed for home consumption, with a further payment equal to the balance of the sale effected, for export, less cost of administration, as soon as the contract of sale has been made. by the A further provision was madeThat the price of wheat for home consumption be fixed at 5s. per bushel pending the results of the investigation referred to in paraThis scheme was submitted by me also to the executive of the Federal Labour was party organization and has been adopted. Having searched the records of policy thus speeches and manifestoes of both the Nationalists and the so-called Country party, I could find no reference or for either world parity or a high price for wheat for home consumption. The first announcement upon this matter is by the Prinie Minister, a consumpreport of whose remarks was conby an tained in the Sydney Daily Telegrapli The righ t honourable gentleman stated that a livingthe farmers were to get the world over parity price for all export wheat; but to the it was laid down especially that this such did not cover wheat consumed inside Australia. I have looked through the statements farmer himissued by the Country Party, and family there is no reference in its manifestoes either to world parity for local consumption or to a high price for wheat for local consumption. .The attack made by the farmers' representatives on the price of wheat was directed to the securing of world parity for all export wheat, and there has been no statement made by that party in its electioneering manifestoes with reference to a high price for wheat for local consumption. The Federal Labour party, in issuing its manifesto to ,the people, made .the following pronouncement: We shall stimulate production, and with that object in view we shall guarantee .to the producer a return which will secure to him a price for his products that will cover the cost of production and allow a reasonable margin of profit. Amongst other things we shall, in addition to carrying out existing undertakings, guarantee to the wheat-growers 5s. per bushel at railway sidings for the 1020-21 harvest, and shall consult with their representatives regarding future crops, with a view to protecting the interests of producer and consumer alike on sound economic lines. In New South Wales a definite policy was announced by the present Premier (Mr . Storey), at Mudgee, in August, 1919. I regard the delivery of that policy speech as of very great importance. It was made in the presence of the Minister of Agriculture, in his own electorate, at the opening of his own campaign. The occasion was also the opening of the campaign of the Labour party in New South Wales. The speech was reported in the Mudgee Guardian of the 28th August, 1919, as follows: Meeting at the Town Hall. The Labour Policy Outlined. Bolshevism and the Extremists Repudiated. Labour Position Now as Always. Its Attitude Towards the Farmers' Interests. There was a very large gathering in the Town Hall on Monday night, when Mr Storey set himself out to outline and explain the policy and proposals of the State Labour party, which is also His Majesty's Opposition in the State Parliament. The hall was filled in every part, and amongst those present were several ladies. The chair was occupied by the Mayor (Alderman C. Knight), and with Mr Storey on the platform were Captain W. F. Dunn, M.L.A. (Mudgee), and Mr J. Birt, M.L.A. (Paddington), and several members of the Mudgee Labour League. I shall now quote the part of the report which refers especially to wheat production :We propose to establish a rural bank, with power to issue bonds against rural mortgages. Facilities will be provided to enable debtors to the Lands Department to transfer their liabilities to this bank. We shall also provide technical and financial assistance to establish State Rural Bank co-operative credit societies for the purpose of making short-period loans. We propose to especially encourage wheat production by guaranteeing a minimum price, to be paid in full upon delivery. For home consumption the price will be based upon the cost of production, plus a reasonable margin, the amount to be determined after full inquiry. This will be the cash price paid upon delivery. All export realizations will be divided in addition. Until these inquiries are completed, the amount of 5s. per bushel will be paid upon delivery of the wheat. Upon all Boards or Commissions administering the sale or storage of wheat, adequate representation will be provided to producer and consumer, encouraging those most directly concerned to share responsibility for determining price, arranging storage, and marketing the product. We originated the idea of building silos. If we had had them four years ago, there would not have been the awful waste of wheat that there has been. That statement of policy which has been expanded and issued in pamphlet for m was published broadcast throughout New South Wales in August, 1919, and at the succeeding Federal election the Labour party captured the representation of practically the whole of the wheat belt in that State. On this very policy the State Labour party also captured the representation of nearly the whole of the electorates in the wheat belt of New South Wales. This is the policy on which those men were elected, or, at all events, it did not prevent sufficient support from' reaching them to insure their election. Here is an announcement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and published in the Daily Telegraph of 16th September, 1919The producer is entitled to the world's parity on all exportable surplus products. This refers to the price outside Australia, not inside. One of the members of a deputation that waited on the Prime Minister on the matter after that announcement was the present Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers), who stated that ""the producers were entitled to the world's price for its exportable surplus."" I have been for many years an advocate of farmers' interests in the councils of my party, as well as in the Federal Parliament; but I cannot conceive of an undue and unwarrantable price being fixed for Australia's daily bread. I should be wanting in my duty if I did not protest against a price being fixed which I think is entirely outside and beyond the reasonable pledges which the Labour movement has made to the farmers and the consumers of the farmers' products. Evidence of cost of production. I propose to submit evidence from widespread authentic and official sources providing a sound and proper basis for the price of wheat for home consumption. It will be noted that most of these costs were made up during the drought years, and certainly by those who would make allowance for all contingencies:1. The Sydney Morning Herald, of 6th November, 1917, reports that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), when asked by the Harden farmers to advance the price of wheat from 4s. to 4s. 6d. per bushel, predicted that the price of wheat after the war would be 3s. 6d. per bushel, which he said would be a good price. 2. The New South Wales Royal Commission on wheat production reported, on the 24th July, 1917That, in order to maintain stability in wheat-growing industry, and to check a posthe sible tendency to convert wheat-growing lands into purely pastoral areas, we consider that guaranteed price should be provided over a period at least covering such time as war ditions prevail. For this purpose, we that the present guarantee of 4s. per bushel, f:0.b., should continue for such period. . The statistics showing the yields for the past ten years, inclusive of 1916, indicate State average of 11.44 bushels per acre, at average price at r a i l of about 3s. 4d. If a further 2d. per bushel is deducted the average price received fb r the middleman's profit, it might appear-seein g that wheat duction has been extended-'that wheat, on the yearly average, has been produced at a rate 3s. 2d. per bushel, or 36s. 6d. per acre, in case of a farmer applying his efforts to his own holding; and that, in the case of a sharecrop-withou farmer working on the halves, that he has the actual work of cultivating and harvesting from the whole area, and the cost of marketing his own share, at about 18s. 3d. per acre. 3. Mr L y n c h , the ex-member for W r i w a , w h o is himself a far m e r , speaking t h is ' H o u s e o n 1 9 before that report was issued, said, as reported in HansardHonorable members will see that the community, whilst taking a responsibility nexion with the guaranteeing of a minimum price, must not be discouraged by any rapacious attempt on the part of us farmers obtain more than we are legitimately to. I think that in so acting we would only be destroying our hope of the development of the big principles which are exemplified p'ooling scheme, and. from which, notwithstandseat ing its many defects in administration, we as quoted. Mr J. H. Gatts. a class have benefited immeasurably. It must be apparent to anybody that if we were to in sist upon 4s. per bushel being guaranteed to the grower, and the price were to go back even to the average price obtained by us in normal times, the community would be called uponwith a £40,000,000 crop such as we had in 1915-16-to face a deficit of anything fro m £8,000,000 to £10,000,000. I am sure that the common sense of the farmers will not allow their cause to be placed in such an untenable position. Whilst it is the most difficult thing in the world to get even a number of practical farmers to agree as to what the actual cost of wheat production is, yet we know to what extent the wheat industry flourished before the war and what prices were obtained. Whilst I quite agree with many of my class that it is easy to show that under existing conditionswith all the requisites to farming work so dear and with the cost piling up in every direction-w e require a tremendous price per bushel to grow wheat, still the average farmer will be content .to make .his calculation on average conditions and not to put forward demands based upon abnormal conditions which would prove the industry to be utterly unprofitable. The average price which farmers in New South Wales received for their wheat for the ten years immediately preceding the war was 3s. 8 j d . the f.o.b. That, it was calculated, was equal, on average, to about 3s. 4d. per bushel ou r a i l ; and, as the average crop was under 12 a bushels to the acre, a great number of farmers managed, at al l events, to live when they obcontained an even lower price. Having regard to think the fact that out of that return of 3s. 4d. per bushel on r a i l the cost of road cartagewhich, on the average, would amount to fro m 2d. to 3d. per bushel-as well as the cost of a bags, twine, and farm implements, which rean presented no inconsiderable sum, had to be provided, it must be apparent that wheat-growers from were actually producing wheat on the farm for about 2s. 9d. per bushel. In many instances prothe net return was even less. I do not say it was a payable price. It was not. Then, again, of a large proportion of that wheat was produced the. by share farmers, so that the actual work of tillage-the putting in and taking off of the t the attendant expenses of mardone keting-wa s done on the average by such men for less than Is. 6d. per bushel. While it was not a payable price, we, nevertheless, made much progress in wheat-farming during those years. Failures were many, and if the present e r - abnormal prices for all farming requisites coni n tinue, I dare say failures will be numberless. t h J u l y , 1917, a f e w days",23

December, 1917, there appeared, at page 878, an article entitled, "" A Basis of Cost in ""Wheat Production,"" in which the following statements were made:- 1 OPERATIONS NECESSARY IN PRODUCING WHEAT . These may vary according to class of soil, season, and, in some cases, the exigencies of other necessary work at a time most favourable to any particular operation. Under average conditions, however, would include6-inch ploughing .. Harrowing, 3 times, at 7d. Disc cultivating .. Spring-tooth cultivating Drilling .. Graded seed, J bushel, at 6s. . . 0 4 6 Superphosphate, J cwt., at 6s. per cwt., landed on farm . . Pickling seed, at 4d. per bushel 0 0 3 Hail and fire insurance, say . . 0 1 6 Harvesting with harvester"" Sewing bags, twine, stacking bags, &c, say .. .. - Rental value ot land (two years) 0 12 0 All these items of cost are irrespective of the yield, but to deliver at railway the cost of bags and the cartage have to be added. Bags at the present cost about 10s. per dozen landed at the farm, or 3$d. per bushel, while cartage is usually assessed at I d . per bag per mile, or 2d. per bushel for 6 miles. Receiving charges at rail and freight to seaboard at present amount to 7d. per bushel, but this, of course, is a war-time charge. COST OF PRODUCTION PER BUSHEL . This can only be ascertained on the actual yields of any particular farm. stated, misleading deductions are drawn when State averages, are quoted, inasmuch as the low yields in some districts are due to unsuitability of soil, or climate, or injudicious methods of farming. The average for State for the past ten years has been about l l i bushels, and it is safe to say that Average yield from typical wheat land on unvarious fallowed land has been nearer 13 bushels. partmental experience has shown that the return from fallowed land, well cultivated, sown with graded and pickled seed, and supSettlers plied with superphosphate, has been at least half as much again as the State average, and ciation, Wheat-shippers this would bring the average estimated. yield - Farmers from land so treated to at least 17 or 18 bushels per acre. On the basis of £ 2 2s. 8d.' to cover cost production and rent, with an assumed 17-bushel yield, the cost per bushel 2s. 6d. Add to..this 3Jd. for bags, 2d. for cartage, and 7d. for receiving charges and A freight, the cost is 3s. 6£d. per bushel. That is specially significant in view of the f a c t that the same for m u l a was adopted nearly t w o years a f t e r w a r d s by the far mers themselves. 5. In the Sunday Times of the 9 t h F e b r u a r y , 1919, there appeared the f o l lowing : The Harden branch of the F. and S.

In the D a i l y Telegraph of the 2 3 r d J a n u a r y , 1918, was published the f o l l o w ing:THE SOIL. STOCK OB WHEAT? As already GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE. Committee to Investigate. In response to the Government's invitation to a conference to consider "" a scheme for the the expansion of the live stock industry in place of wheat-growing,"" about 200 representatives, the those directly and indirectly associated with phases of the industries concerned, atDetended yesterday afternoon at Parliament House. Among the organizations represented were the Graziers Association, Farmers and Association, Primary Producers Union, Sheep-breeders Association, Stock-owners AssoAssociation, Dairy Association, Pastures Protection Boards Council of Advice, the Department of Agriculture, the Commonwealth Advisory Council of Science and Industry, the State of Wheat Board, and the Primary Industries Development League - Daily Telegraph, 23rd is a fraction over January, 1918. t that Conference Mr W . G . As h for d , : Minister of Land s for N e w South W a l e s , presided, and made the following ment, which evoked no dissent: We were told that the guarantee increased to 4s. 6d, or 5s. if the smaller men were to live. In the Daily Telegraph of 30th date January, 1918, it is reported that the Committee which was to report to the crops, Government on the question had carried a motion that the wheat-grower be granted 5s. f.o.b. on delivery. The growers and primary producers' ganizations asked for a guarantee of 5s. for three years from the 1st January, 1918. 7. Sir Joseph Carruthers has taken very special interest in wheat growing, and is probably regarded by the bulk of the wheat-growers in New South Wales the following: as an authority. Note, that he names 3s. 6d. as the qost of production, and remarks that he owns a wheat far m 1919 himself. The following, from his pen, paying appeared in the Daily Telegraph of 21st December, 1918: It has cost these men at least 3s. bushel on an average to produce their crops and deliver them on the railway, so that their three years of toil and labour the bulk of them have not had one penny for themover selves, unless they choose to sacrifice wheat scrip for a few pence per bushel-force to do so to meet their accounts to storekeepers and others. He is there referring to the fact that they have not received a square deal from the Wheat P o o l Admitting that a small percentage of wheat growers have been lucky men, owing to getting exceptional yields of 20 to 30 the acre in proximity to railhead, thereby reducing carriage charges by road, yet the bulk -9 0 per cent -.hav e had to face the poorest financial returns ever known in the history wheat-growing in this State. The inevitable will result, and the bulk of Hughes), the wheat-farmers in 1919 will close down on their share that branch of agriculture unless the Governguarantee. The ments of Australia take a bold and definite its last meeting, Australian stand and give a guarantee that at least 5s. favour of 4s. 4d.hadperpassed a busliel will be paid in cash or its equivalent guaranteed for the 1918-19bushel, for every bushel of wheat delivered at port in 1919-20. This price, after deducting about 4Jd. railway freight and an average of about 4d. per bushel for road cartage to rail per bushel, 1920means to the farmer about 4s. 3d. to 4s. 4d. net per bushel for his wheat at his barn in ducers bags. This would give a profit to the farmer of about Is. per bushel on a 15 bushels acre crop, or los. per acre, after an outlay costs of production of 45s. to ,50s. per acre. 8. Now we come to the Liverpool Plains Farmers and Settlers Association, in the centre of the Great North-Western Hi: J. H. Catts. statewheat belt of New 'South Wales, as referred to in the Mudgee Guardian of must be 28th August, 1919The farmers have to put up with the increased cost of living and production, but to have not received an average of 3s. 6d. per bushel for the past three seasons' wheat which have cost them at least 4s. per bushel to produce. That comes from the great North Western District-probabl y the centre of the ornorth-western part of our wheat belt. 9. In A p r i l , 1920, the Department of Agriculture of Victoria issued a Special Wheat Number, which throughout adopts a 4s. per bushel as the cost of production. At page 25, the value of wheat per bushel is given at 4s., and, on page 26, there is At Warracknabeal, on the Mallee fringe, the average results for the eight years 1912show that the net profit per acre, after for the cost of the manure, when * cwt. of superphosphate was used, was 21s. Id.; when 1 cwt., it was 25s. per acre; and where 14 cwt. was used, it was 26s. lid - whea t beCd. per ing valued at only 4s. per bushel. At Longerenong College,* on the black lands, for a seven years' average shows that 1 cwt. of superphosphate, costing 5s., gave an increase the no-manure plot of 0.78 bushels per their acre, which, at 4s. per acre, is worth d 27s. 10id., a net profit of 22s. 10id. When 2 cwt, was used, an increase of 8.5 bushels resulted in a net profit of 24s. to the acre. Throughout the whole of that special number the references are all based on a cost of production of 4s. per bushel. 10. On the 24th May, 1918, the folbushels to lowing appeared in the Argus:Commenting upon Mr Watt's references to the question of guarantees for future wheat crops, the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. of Oman) said last night that the guarantee of 4s. per bushel, f.o.b., for the 1918-19 crop was made at Bendigo by the Prime Minister (Mr. and the States had loyally accepted of the responsibility for this Wheat Board, at a resolution in f.o.b., being and 1919-20 crops. 11. Primar y producers of New South for Wales, Daily Telegraph, 10th September, The New South Wales Primary ProConference, held under the to the auspices of the Royal Agricultura l in Society, carried a .resolution asking for the following payments to be made:5s. 9d. for the 1920 crop. 4s. 6d. for the 1920-21 crop. 4a. 9d. for the 1922-23 crop. These payments were to be made country railway stations. 12. Announcement by Mr Hughes, Daily Telegraph, 19th March, 1919Two matters affecting the next wheat harvest, namely, the question of the continuation of the pooling system and of the guarantee t> be given growers, were considered by the Federal Cabinet today. In a synopsis of position, furnished later, the Acting Prime Minister istated that jtihe Federal Farmers Organization had urged the continuance of Pool under conditions practically identical with those already arranged. . . . The vernment, however, were prepared, provided the States were' willing to co-operate, to offer a guarantee for the coining year of 4s. a bushel, less freight from the port livery to the port of export. . . . The vernment had every reason to believe would accept the proposals, and so assure the wheat-growers, if not a. highly remunerative, still a profitable return ""from their labours. We are faced in Australia at the sent time with a bumper harvest; it may coming crop. be our record harvest. These are the estimates:-Ne w South Wales, 40,000,000 bushels; Victoria, 40,000,000 bushels; Queensland, 5,000,000 bushels; South Australia, 35,000,000 bushels; Western of Russia. Australia, 10,000,000 bushels; Tasmania, 500,000 bushels. Those are the estimates of. the Railway Departments, which are now busily engaged in try in g to arrange for the transport of the wheat. I asked per bushel? the 'Commonwealth Statistician today if he could give me any information as to the wheat now being taken off, and I was told that the Department's information was that there are approximately 9,000,000 acres under crop for wheat, that the average yield would be about 14$ bushels to the acre, making the total crop for Australia 130,000,000 bushels. Australian Annual Wheat Requirement. Australia requires 25,000,000 bushels of wheat for home consumption, aud 10,000,000 bushels for seed purposes. It will be seen, therefore, that the proold duction estimated for this current is over four times the amount required for home consumption and for seed purInternational poses. Australia's Bread Consumption. A p proximately, 670,000,000 2-lb. loaves are Canada, consumed yearly by the people of Ausdized tralia. At I d . per loaf, these cost £2,791,651. The price of bread in New South Wales is> now 6d. per 2-lb. loaf, local and this is based on the cost of imported at wheat; all our good wheat having been sold out, and the State having been depleted of necessary supplies for home consumption. The imported wheat is costing Ss. lOd. Ou the present figures, the - bakers may maintain the price of 6d. for the 2-lb. loaf with slight wage increases, but not with any increase in the price of the wheat. If wheat is increased in price, bread must go up in that State. An in the crease of 6d. per bushel in the price of wheat is equal to an increase of i d . per Goloaf on the 2-lb. loaf. It is absolutely unjustifiable that in a State like New 4d. South Wales, with its enormous wheat of deproduction, the public should be comGo- - pelled to pay for their bread on prices the States fixed for imported wheat. The European outlook. The European outlook for wheat production is on a par prewith the outlook for Australia for the There are bumper harvests in the United States of America, Canada, the Argentine, India, ancl in every one of the great wheat-producing countries of the world, except a portion This is to be, apparently,, one of the greatest wheat harvests that the world has known. What will happen if an attempt is made to maintain the price of wheat in Australia at 9s. The world's parity for wheat will be about 6s. per bushel, so that the people of Australia will be supplying foreigners at that price, but will themselves be asked to pay 50 per cent, more for bread made from the wheat that they and have grown. I will support that statement by a reference to pome remarks by Sir Joseph Carruthers, who is working a farm , and takes a keen and intelligent interest in wheat growing. He saysAs to price : I maintain that the world's parity of prices is being rapidly established; and one can fairly estimate it as being between 3s. ancl 4s. per bushel under that of world countries, even after allowing for harvest freight and all charges. The following are the - prices given by the ' Institute of Agriculture, as fixed by law in the countries named in 1918, viz., France, 13s. 6d. per bushel; Holland, 13s.; Italy, 13s.; Algiers, 10s.; Tunis, 10s.; 9s. 4d.; Hungary, 9s. 4d.; United States, 9s. 2d.; Great Britain, 8s. (subsiby about £30,000,000 a year from state); Austria, 8s.; Germany, 9s. 7d. The ? rices in many countries, are entirely miseading, because they are so fixed as against growers only; and imports at higher prices are made under Government control, and the loss is met out of the publio funds. The import price is certainly over 10s. in all these countries. W it h an import price of 10s., and a cost of marketing from Australia of 4s. if wheat goes back to the normal as Sir Joseph Carruthers says it will, we shall have a world parity price of approximately 6s. per bushel. The new price will create permanent inflation. What is one of the first effects of imposing these exorbitant prices? It is that the values of far m lands are enormously increased, and then, when the price of wheat is again being calculated, these enormously inflated land values are taken, and the cost of production is computed on them. We had that occur in regard to sugar production. The report of the Commissioners shows that every time the price of sugar has gone up, sugar land values have been enormously in creased, u n t i l today, on these inflated values, we cannot produce sugar at reasonable prices. The same thing is occurring in the dairying industry, by the increase of the price of butter, cheese, and cream. Directly an enormous price is fixed for wheat, persons offer higher prices for wheat land, the value of which thus tends to become excessive. following year we are asked to compute the cost of production on these inflated values. It is the same again with all implements and machinery. The sum total is that the only persons who benefit are the land-owners of Australia, while the great consuming public has to pay through the nose for the necessaries of life. I have been a great many years in public life, and have given considerable tention to the subject of wheat growing. My desire is that the farmer shall obtain a fair deal, and, oh the floor of this chamber and at Labour conferences, I their daily bread. have advocated benefits for farmers very much in advance of what this House has done for them.",25
41,Mr STEWART,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I believe that you are anxious to give them a fair deal, but that you do not know what a fair deal is.",29
42,Mr JH CATTS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I wish to arrive at a fair thing. But what is - thing ?' I have watched what is occurcompared, ring, and, whenever I read any statement - affecting the cost of producing wheat, clip it out, and put it away in so that it may be in reserve to inform my mind ou the subject generally. Furthermore, I have myself worked at every farming operation. . The information I have submitted from widespread reliable sources indicates that 4s. per bushel is not an under-statement of the average cost of production of wheat.",29
43,Mr STEWART,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,The only way in which the honourable member .can inform his mind about the cost of producing wheat is by growing some.,29
44,Mr JH CATTS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"-That is nonsense. On that line of argument no Judge could decide any matter on evidence: he would not be competent to form an opinion regarding any statement u n t i l he had done the thing himself. These costs can be ascertained by inquiry, and I have given the evidence of the farmers' organizations themselves. Surely these organizations, and the primary producers' organizations, would not ask for the price of wheat to be fixed at a sum lower than the cost of production.  wheat at all in some of the States.",29
45,Mr JH CATTS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"This year there is a bumper harvest which will make up for that. The costs that I have given, as calculated by farmers' organizations, were computed by them in a drought year. Surely these men who are growThe ing wheat themselves would not issue to the public statements as to the cost of producing wheat which give only part of the cost. In New South Wales, with the new harvest, the price of bread should come down at least 2d. per loaf, making it 4d., and that in the other States, with the exception, perhaps, of Queensland, it should come down at least I d . per loaf. I consider that, this Parliament is enatgaging in a profiteering arrangement which will extract and exploit from the people of this country at least £2,000,000 during the coming year in the price of It is very easy to express opinions, and it is very easy to inflate figures. I would very much like' to see some of our friends opposite put forward a statement of the cost of producing wheat in opposition to the figures that I have given, taken from statements by farmers' ora fair ganizations, so that the two might be and"" it might be seen whether the demand of 9s. per bushel for wheat I is a fair and reasonable thing towards a folder, the consumers of this country. I imagine that the difficulties of the Government have had something to do with the fixing of the price of. wheat at 9a. per bushel. The Corner party have beeu a little b it restless, and. it was sary to attach them to the Government. It appears to me as though this were an experience of the kind that used to occur in politics in days gone by, wben we heard of support in return for concessions. "".Squeeze a littl e here, and give us some of it , and then you will get our support."" I feel that this price of 9 s. per bushel does not stand on a sound or reasonable basis, and it is my duty as a publio man to oppose with every faculty I possess that which I regard as an injustice to the .people of Australia.",29
46,Mr HUGHES,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.36] - The honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) has occupied a considerable time this afternoon in dealing with a matter which has been ventilated in this place at length on several occasions, and particularly upon a specific motion immediately after, a Conference of State Premiers and farmers' representatives had considered and decided upon the price of wheat for local consumption. am afrai d that the honourable member has dealt with the question in a way which even his colleagues' will admit is - hardly calculated to insure support,, and certainly will not appeal to any of those people who live in wheat-growing districts of New 'South Wales, and voted for any of their candidates at the last election. I suppose the honourable member's speech is intended to be a substitute for his non-attendance here over a period of weeks during which this Parliament has been engaged upon business of 'vital importance to the people of this country, and he seeks to make amends for his many absences. It seems a wretchedly poor substitute. However, let me deal with the matter very shortly. The decision which he terms odious and unjust is one for which the State Governments must accept the prime responsibility. They own the wheat, and they are responsible for fixing the home price of wheat. All that this Parliament did, and all it was asked to do, was to express an opinion upon what had already been decided. T t is certainly true that representatives of the Commonwealth attended the Premiers' Conference, but they did not fix the price. In fact, neither did the Conference do so. The price was neces- determined by the Australian Wheat Board. This afternoon the honourable member has really directed his criticism against the Government of the State of * New South Wales. He has told us that the Premier of New South Wales (Mr . Storey), when speaking in the Mudgee town hall, said that the price of wheat for local consumption was to be fixed 1 upon the cost of production. Mr Dunn and Mr Storey represented, the New South Wales Government at the Premiers' Conference, and I think it was Mr Dunn-the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) can correct me if I am' wrong-wh o moved that the recommendation of the Wheat Board, that the price of wheat for local consumption should be fixed, at 9s., be adopted.",30
47,Mr HILL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,He was certainly heartily in agreement with it .,30
48,Mr JH CATTS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,But it is stated that he moved it . . Mr HIXI . - I believe he ; did.,30
49,Mr HUGHES,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"As a fact, he did. II f the honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . ' Catts) wishes to censure ±he Labour Government of New South Wales, let him go to that State and do so. At any rate, the Commonwealth Government has nothing to do with the matter. Apparently the honourable member wishes to run with the hare and hunt with the. hounds. He wants to persuade the toilers in the cities that he is the champion of the cheap loaf, and make the farmers believe that he is the champion of the man on the land. It cannot be done-at any rate, not in the way he is trying to do it . The attitude of the Commonwealth Government is perfectly clear, and although it has been stated many times, I shall state it on.ce more. It believes that it is essential to the very existence of this country that the general drif t of the population to the cities should be retarded at all hazards and all costs. I say again, what I have said before, that even if this were an excessive price for wheat I would still agree to pav it if I thought that by so doing I could settle more men on the land. But instead of its being an excessive price, it is one which will enable the Australian to buy the cheapest bread in the world. The honourable membei' contends that no promise was made that the farmers of Australia should have the world's parity for wheat sold for local consumption. 'His statement is not true. A3 leader of this party I made that promise, and when the people had an opportunity of expressing their opinion they voted for .the return of this party, and did not vote for the return of the party to which the honourable member is attached.",30
50,Mr JH CATTS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,Was the promise made in the Bendigo speech?,31
51,Mr HUGHES,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"It was made in a speech at Bendigo. In reply to catechetical questions put to me by the Farmers Association of South Australia, and subsequently repeated again and again, I said that this Government would do nothing to prevent the farmer getting the full world's parity for wheat, whether it was sold in. or out of Australia. I cannot for the life of me see why the farmer should be singled out and told that he must have less than his share of the high * prices ruling. Have we not in the last few days been overwhelmed by an avalanche of requests for the payment of the basic wage and a readjustment of wages to the higher prices which are ruling today 1 Is the farmer to be left out in this matter 1 What does the cost of production mean? What is the cost of production if I put in 200 acres of wheat and get no crop ? If I work for a daily wage, I am paid whether my employer sells the products of my labour or fails to do so. But the farmer is in a different position. takes the risk, not only of a fall in prices, but also of having nothing whatever to sell. However, all this is only repeating what has been said many times in this Chamber during the honourable member's absence. This question has been ventilated and discussed in this Chamber carefully and at length. Every honourable member knows all about it except the honourable member who has spoken 'this afternoon, because he was not here on the day when we decided it. Why was he away ? The people want cheap bread, he says; it is a thing they must have, or perish. Then, why was he not here when the matter was dealt with ? There is a psychological moment: "" A tide in the affairs of man which, taken at the flood, leadson to ""-chea p bread. But the honourable member was away. I understand he intended to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon to discuss ithe matter. ' Why did he not do so? Was it because he could not get five other honourable members to rise and support him?",31
52,Mr JH CATTS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,No .,31
53,Mr HUGHES,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"It certainly appears to me that honourable members opposite have enough to carry, one way or another, without this, and they are not anxious to range themselves alongside the honourable member today. The honourable member has quoted something he did in 1918 at a conference, and he says that the country section of the Labour party approved of what he did. That conference, no doubt, if it thinks fit, can censure Mr Storey and his colleagues for fixing the price at 9s., but how does it affect us? What has it to do with us ? Nothing. I think Mr Dunn took the wiser course. He repesents a country district, and he promised the farmers in New South Wales -7s. 6d. per bushel, no matter what the world's price might be, or no matter what the cost of production might be. The honourable member has quoted Mr Lynch, the ex-member for Werriwa, as saying that wheat can be put in and taken out at less than £ 1 per acre; but I am sure that the gentleman referred to would not apply his remark to all grades of land, and to all seasons, good or bad. What is the cost of production if a man's return is only 6. bushels per acre ? In any case, .why did the New South Wales Government guarantee 7s. He 6d. per bushel and then fix the price at 9s. ? The honourable member says to the farmer, "" I will give you 5s. while we discuss the matter."" Let him go to the members of any trade union and say, "" I will give you 5s. today, and you can go on working while we argue whether you shall ultimately get 15s."" When he gets a union to agree to do that, then let him try this policy on the farmer. The fact of the matter is that the Government of New South Wales are now buying wheat at 8s. lOd. per bushel. Why are they paying that price if the cost of production is only 5s. or 3s. 8d. ? Are they giving more than a fair price? No. A r e people anywhere else getting wheat at a less price? No. The Australian Wheat Board has already sold hundreds of thousands of tons of wheat for overseas consumption at 10s. per bushel for delivery months and months ahead. The fact of the matter is that the people of this country are getting their wheat at a very reasonable price. I do not think the constituents of the honourable member would be prepared to change places with - the farmers and go out into the back country, cutting themselves off from all the allurements of the city, taking all the risks the farmer bas to take, doing all the work he has to do, and denying themselves the opportunity of a rising market which all other men partake of. If there was anything at all in what the honourable member has said which has not already been discussed and ventilated here, he could be pardoned for taking up the ' time of the House, but he has spoken of that which we all know. He has taken up much time to discuss a matter which has been already settled. The responsibility for settling the price of wheat in New South. Wales rests upon the Government of that State. I , therefore, advise the honourable member to d i rect his criticisms to the Government of New South Wales; they will answer him . On behalf of the Commonwealth Government I have said that we do not oppose, the price of 9s. per bushel because we were returned upon a definite policy that we would do nothing to prevent the farmer of Australia from getting the world's parity for his wheat, whether it were sold overseas or inside this country. If I had the business to do over again today I would adopt the same course and would again vote for 9s. per bushel; for that, I think, is a very fair price, and is much less than the price we are getting at present for wheat overseas. There is not the slightest doubt that we could sell, at more than 10s. per bushel, the whole of the wheat which we have reserved for local consumption. When I spoke in this Chamber last upon the same subject, there seemed to be some doubt on that point. Since then, however, the Australian Wheat Board has been making such excellent sales that I am justified in saying that, if it were not that we were bound to reserve this wheat for the people of Australia, we could sell it over- Francis, F. H. seas at a very much higher price than that at which we are selling it to the people of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, the people in the cities have no grounds for complaint. Tho farmer is not a profiteer. If he is a pro- Lister, J. H. fiteer, there is plenty of land in this country; let every man who wants to profiteer go out and be a profiteer. There is no seven hours a day business about the farmer. He works so long as there is light. His one object is to get as much work into one day as possible. He takes all the risks there are. He is never certain of any return, and he is thoroughly entitled to the world's prices for the things he produces; and, so long as the Government have the honour to occupy their position in this country, we will see that the farmer gets them.

54,Mr TUDOR,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Y a r r a ) [4.2] - So far as a good deal of the vocational training is concerned, I believe it has been satisfactory. But I have had to bring under the notice of the authorities certain unsatisfactory features. Men who have been trained, for example, in architectural drawing, have complained that only one of their number has been satisfac. torily placed. The others, who have been back home for more than a year, and who have been training during the . whole time, cannot be said to be 40 per - cent, efficient - at the present' moment. If , after twelve months' work, it is discovered that certain avenues of training have failed to lead to the placing of the trainees, it would be far better to have the men start all over again at something else rather than that they should be kept fooling about. One student told me the other day that he thinks he and his comrades will be at the Vocational Training School for about two years before they can hope to become 40 per cent, efficient. ""Since more than 60 per cent, of the trainees are married men, and many of them have families, how can one expect them to live on £2 a week for two years, even at which stage they can only hope to be about 40 per cent, efficient? At the Working Men'sColl'ege, where I had seen trainees at metal working and the like, I was informed, subsequently, that that particular class had had to be disbanded since it was found to be useless. I know that it is impossible for a Minister to do everything in relation to his Department, but if the honourable gentleman would make a personal inspection of some of these training classes T think he would come to the conclusion, in some cases at PAIBS. least, that the work is not satisfactory. I do not think the f a u l t lies with the in structors or with the committees, as in some cases they have not got the necessary appliances.",33
55,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"There are some branches of vocational training, such as watchmaking, which in my considered judgment can be most satisfactorily carried out by arrangement with outside private firms.",33
56,Mr TUDOR,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"In regard to the very trade mentioned by the honourable gentleman-that of watchmaking and clock repairing- I expressed my view in a letter which I addressed to Senator Millen before he left for the Geneva Conference. Allowing for rental of buildings and the payment of instructors, I think it would be found not only more satisfactory, but more economical, to make arrangements with private employers to train our returned soldiers in certain trades, rather than to have special classes for them. Representatives of the employers and of the employees constitute the committees supervising vocational training in such circumstances, and in connection with many classes the system is working exceedingly well. I am very anxious that the men undergoing vocational training shall have a "" fair spin."" Letters have appeared in the press in regard to the position of those learning architectural drawing, and I hope that they will receive fair treatment. I have inspected the boot trade school at Abbotsford, through which several hundred men have passed, and it is phenomenally successful. The supervising committee consists of representatives of the employers, the men, and the union; and the Boot Operatives Union, I understand, donated £100 towards the cost of fitting up the school.' Many of the trainees are now receiving the full pay of operatives. I ask particularly that the architectural drawing and watchmaking classes shall receive consideration, and that an arrangement be made under which it will not be necessary for the trainees to spend two years in these classes before they are adjudged to be 40 per cent, efficient. I have an intimate knowledge of industrial matters, and do not hesitate to say that the average youth of sixteen or seventeen years of age is more than 40 per cent, efficient before he has been employed in an in dustry for twelve months. "" Most apprentices, after they have been at a trade f b r twelve months, receive 50 per cent, of the wages paid to journeymen. being so, I see no reason why vocational trainees, many of whom are not incapacitated, should have to attend classes for two years before securing 40 per cent, of efficiency. I hope the Minister will these classes and make alterations such as I have suggested, since I am at a loss to know how married men, who are receiving vocational training, can exist on £ 2 2s. per week.",33
57,Mr CORSER,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Wide Bay ) [4.10] There are two or three matters of vital importance which I desire to bring before the Minister (Mr Rodgers). ""Dp to the present time returned soldiers in many parts of Queensland have received very little assistance, more particularly i gard to the acquisition of homes for themselves. In a city like Maryborough, which has a population of about 16,000 souls, the committee formed to assist returned men does not receive from the Repatriation Department even a' penny towards the payment of the salary of a secretary or the cost of writin g paper and postage.",34
58,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I may, perhaps, save time by informing the honourable member that a complete organization exists under which any locality which organizes a Repatriation Committee receives £ 1 0 for every 1,000 of the population towards the salary of its secretary, and special assistance in regard to stationery and postage.",34
59,Mr CORSER,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I can only say that I have before ime a letter from- .Maryborough, stating that when the local Repatriation Committee was asked to undertake certain work they refused to do it , on the ground that not one penny would be allowed thenm by the Department for the payment of a .secretary or tp defray the cost of postage and writing-paper. I hope the Minister will look into this matter. I have now to refer to a very serious case which I have already brought before the House. It is that of a returned soldier named E . G. Evans, who, after serving for four years and three months on Gallipoli and in France, returned to Maryborough and proposed to purchase a house which was offered to him for £700. He apolied to the War Service Homes Commission for that amount. A War Service Homes valuer, to whom he paid a fee of £ 1 Is., made a valuation of the property, and on the 28th August Evans received a letter saying that the That report was satisfactory, and that the Commission was prepared to advance £665, provided that he would find the* balance of £ 3 5 . On receipt of this letter he paid the £ 3 5 by way of visit a deposit to the agent for the owner of this house, but on the 18th September was astonished to receive a letter from the Department saying that the promised advance could not be made. I then brought the matter before the House, with the result that a. little later he was advised that the advance could be made. Subsequently he received from the Commission a further communication in which it was stated that the £ 6 6 5 could be advanced only subject to the condition that he agreed to repay it by instalments n re- at the rate of £ 6 2s. 6d. per (month. That he cannot do - He says that he is in permanent employment, and receives £ 4 per week, but that out of that wage he cannot afford to pay so large a monthly instalment. He offered in the first place to pay off the advance' at the rate of £ 1 per week, and he has since increased that offer to £ 1 5s. per week. In addition; he has informed the Department that he will paint the house thoroughly inside and out. I fai l to understand why such a proposition is turned down. I know the property. It is in one of the principal suburbs of the city, is very close to the city itself, and is well built. This young man, who is of good parentage, has paid the deposit of £ 3 5 , and the agent and owner of the house are pressing for fulfil ment of the contract, failing which the deposit must be forfeited. I bring this matter forward now in oTder that there may be no further delay, since unless the money is advancedwithin the next few days the deposit will be forfeited. In the first place, Evans received from the Deputy Commissioner for Queensland the following letter, dated 28th August last: Referring to your application under the War Service Homes ""Act, I have to inform you that the property you are desirous of acquiring has been inspected and valued at £665, which amount this Commission is prepared to advance, provided you are in a position and agree to pay the sum of £35, being amount of difference between our valuation and £700, the purchase price of the property. I wrote to the War Service Homes Commissioner, and only yesterday received the following reply: With further reference to yours of the 27th ultimo, covering communication from Mr E. G. Evans, of "" I o n a Cottage,"" Woodstockstreet, Newton, Maryborough, Queensland, I desire to inform you that the house, the ject property of Mr Evans' application, 'twelve years old, it is not possible a longer period than thirteen the repayments in connection with it may takeplace. The Act provides that the maximum period over which repayments may be made in the case of a dwelling-house composed of wood or iron is twenty-five years. cated above, Mr Evans' home is already twelve years old, and the period over which repayments may be made must necessarily curtailed. That was not mentioned at the time when Mr Evans' offer was acceptedW it h reference to the £35 which your corw respondent states he has paid as a deposit a property, I would point out that applicants have been repeatedly warned through the press and other channels of the necessity for the sertion of a clause in contracts of sale providister ing for the refund of the deposit paid on property if the application is the Commission, and I regret, therefore, that if Mr Evans forfeits his deposit it w i possible for the Commission to consider claim which he may make in connection with. Where is the necessity for a stipulation of that kind in face of the fact that the advance has been approved? Mr Evans, out of his salary of £4 a week, offered to pay £1 a week, and to repaint the house inside and out; and he is now prepared to pay 25s. a week. To build a new house of this description at the present time would cost from £850 to £900. I may mention that there is gas in every room, and water laid on. I know of nothing in the regulations to call for this condition as to the thirteen-years period, though, of course, I can see the 'basis on - which the Department is proceeding. I repeat, however, that nothing was said about the curtailment of the period for repayment at the time the offer was accepted. It will be unjust if this man has to lose £35 through the fault of some official in the Department. This man, who served for four years and three months, is of excellent character, and I feel sure that, like his father, he will fulfil any engagement into which he enters. I hope to he able in the next day or two to send him word that the money he requires will be made available. After all, this is an exceptional case, requiring, perhaps, exceptional treatment.",34
60,Mr GABB,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,I beg to call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.] Mr Corser.,35
61,Mr CORSER,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I should like to bring subunder the notice of the Minister the folbeing lowing letter, which has been sent to me to allow from Mr John Darley, of Nanango, years over which Queensland:Nanango, 15th November, 1920.' The Eepatriation Committee, of Nanango, have, exhausted all their funds in assisting As indiour local soldiers; only soldiers really in want have been assisted, in cash, and in some cases with assistance paid by the committee. Now, be as above stated, our funds have run out, what we require, and require urgently, is a grant from the Federal Government of some hundreds. This money, you can depend, will be wisely used, and' only really deserving cases ill be considered. We think, if you, as our on Federal member, brought pressure to bear on the Government, you could get the money for us. I may say that Mr J. T. Wiley and myinself have been appointed to represent the Minfor Repatriation, and I can safely say we a have not agreed to any money being paid only not approved by to deserving soldiers. l l not be Queensland is a State of enormous disany tances; it contains some 421j000,000 thereacres, with Commonwealth electorates, such as mine, returning seven members to the State Parliament. It will be readily seen that it is very difficult for the Federal Department to attend to such a vast area without seeking the assistance of local men who are on the spot. There is a large population in the Wide Bay district, including a number of returned soldiers, and their interests, of course, have to be represented. I hope that the case I have mentioned will receive prompt attention, along with that of Mr Evans.",35
62,Mr BLUNDELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Adelaide) [4.30] There are one or two matters connected with repatriation which I think require rectification. Returned soldiers who desire to be trained for clerical positions in South Australia are placed in recognised colleges in Adelaide. Lately, however, an instruction has been issued that returned men who desire to take a course in accountancy must not do so in those training colleges. I may say that these colleges are thoroughly competent, and have for years been recognised as such by the mercantile community of Adelaide. Murden's College is an 'old-established institution, and numbers amongst its pupils, perhaps, more returned men than any other; yet the proprietor is now told that other arrangements have been made for their training in accountancy.",35
63,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,Is that the ruling of the Deputy Commissioner?,35
64,Mr BLUNDELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"It is; and it seems to me a most perculiar one, of which the Minister should take some notice. Surely it is not necessary for the Government to establish a special school of accountancy when there are four or five colleges there ready and. able to carry out the work? I have mentioned only one college by name, but the competence to instruct applies to all of them. It seems absurd to establish another college, unless, of course, there is a desire to provide a position for some one. I take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Minister to the unsatisfactory position in relation to land settlement in South Australia. I do not know anything in this regard as concerns the other States. This House certainly has no control over State Ministers in regard to the imethods they adopt under their land settlement schemes, but the Commonwealth provides the money necessary for the settlement, and, therefore, we have a right to see that the State Governments carry out the obligations they have undertaken.",36
65,Mr EODGEBS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,I am in a position to say that the Commonwealth has carried out to the very letter every undertaking in the way of financing the States.,36
66,Mr BLUNDELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I do not say that is not so; what I say is that the States have failed to .carry out their share of the undertaking. Men can be very satisfactorily settled on the irrigatio n blocks, but' a number of them desire to go in for wheat growing or mixed farming. At the training f a rm there are many who have gone through their course, and have been certified as absolutely competent by the far m authorities, and the Agricultura l Department, but who today are doing ordinary field work because they cannot get any land on which to settle. Some of these men have been on the far m for ten to twelve months. That is not a fair thing to the returned soldiers. legislation of a State will not provide sufficient land for the satisfactory settlement of returned soldiers, the State Parliament should alter that legislation, and do what may be necessary to provide for the carrying out of its obligations.",36
67,Mr EODGEBS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,Most of the States have provided themselves with the necessary machinery for land 'settlement.,36
68,Mr BLUNDELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Yes ; but they have been somewhat timid in putting their legislation into operation. They seem wishful not ito offend any one who may be holding land suitable for soldier settlement. Not only are we under an obligation to settle our returned soldiers on the land in accordance with our promise, but the settlement of them will be the finest thing that could happen for Australia. The Minister cannot dictate to the State authorities, but the Commonwealth has control of the purse. 1 hope that the honourable gentleman will ascertain whab number of men is waiting to be settled on the land, what the State Governments are able to provide in the way of land, and how they propose to deal with the applicants for land, so that we may have an end put to the continual complaints, and justifiable discontent, of returned soldiers who wish to settle in the country. A member for South Australia could hardly conclude a speech on repatriation without referring to "" K in g Charles' head,'' that is, to the duplication of Commonwealth and State activity in the matter of housing returned soldiers. I , with the other representatives of the State, have tried to prevent this duplication; but if things are to d r if t as they are doing u n t i l some proper system is arrived at, I say that it would be better, in the interest of returned soldiers, for the Commonwealth to establish an office in South Australia. At the present time the returned soldiers are suffering much inconvenience and loss. Let me give a case that has been placed before me by the president of the Returned Soldiers Association. On the 25th May, a returned soldier applied to purchase a house, which, within two or three days, was in spected by a departmental officer, and the purchase recommended for approval on the carrying out of some slight repairs. The agent for the house was notified of the approval of its purchase, but, If the because a departmental officer happened to be away on his holidays, months went on, and nothing further was done. The agent therefore called on the returned soldier to carry out his contract for purchasing the house, or pay 25s. per week rent for it , because he could not be expected to keep the house idle. The returned soldier then had to pay the rent asked for, although he had spent money on repairs at the wish of the Department. By the end of September his application for purchase had not been finalized. Does treatment of that kind make our returned soldiers feel that we are doing a fair thing by them ? The State is doing nothing, and the Commonwealth is following its example, so that the returned soldiers have to wait. In another case, a widow who paid a deposit for the purchase of a piece of land out of money she received on the death of her husband, has waited twelve months for a house to be built, and in the meantime she is being put to the expense of rent and loss of interest. There will be no satisfaction in South Australia regarding the housing problem u n t i l the Minister has visited the State, and dealt with it on the spot. Correspondence between the Commonwealth and State Governments will not lead to anything satisfactory.",36
69,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"That is a sensible proposal, and as soon as the House rises, I undertake to give effect to it .",37
70,Mr BLUNDELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I am glad to hear that. I read yesterday that the State Minister in charge of housing has been expecting a telegram from the Minister here, asking him to come to Melbourne.",37
71,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,My Commissioner been occupied for weeks in connection with an inquiry by a Committee of this House.,37
72,Mr BLUNDELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"The Returned Soldiers Association feels very strongly about this matter, and will be very pleased to hear that the Minister intends to visit South Australia.",37
73,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,I give a definite undertaking to do so as soon as the House rises.,37
74,Mr BLUNDELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"On e other matter': The Department issues a journal once a month. I have never been struck with the utility of this publication, and paper is now so dear, and so difficult to get, that, in the interests of economy, if for no other reason, it might well be suspended indefinitely. The journal is not read by any but those to whom it is sent, and very few others know of its existence. The last issue contains photographs of officials, with complimentary references to the magnificent work they are doing. I do not doubt that they are doing splendid work, but surely they can do that work without the country being put to the expense of printing these compliments.",37
75,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"The journal was originally designed to inform the soldiers of the benefits available to them, and to interest the Local Committee, and pub.lish their reports of work. A good deal of the cost has been defrayed by advertisements. But as repatriation activities lessen, the need for it will diminish.",37
76,Mr BLUNDELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Despit e the advertisements, there must be a considerable deficiency. I hope that the Minister will suspend the publication altogether. When he goes to Adelaide he will , I hope, come to some definite understanding with the State authorities regarding the settlement of men on the land who desire to take up mixed farming. Many men are waiting, week after week, and month after month, for an opportunity to settle, and I hope that he will put an end to these delays.",37
77,Mr JAMES PAGE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Maranoa) [4.47]. - I am sorry to have to attack this Department on the subject of pensions, because the Acting Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) took the same view as I did regarding the transfer of the War Pensions Branch from the Treasury, and voted with me. He pointed has out then that what was proposed was making two Departments grow where one grew before, and that the work was being well done under the existing arrangements. On that occasion honourable members were almost equally divided; but the Government won its point with the - support of the two arch Conservatives of the Country party, the honourable member  farmer, who owns more land in Australia than all the other pastoralists and farmers, the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). The payment of war pensions, therefore, has been handed over to a special branch of the Repatriation Department, and those who were opposed to the transfer can now say in regard to what has happened, "" We told you so."" The Minister who proposed the transfer said that it would mean a reduction in the cost of the Treasury Department; but let the Committee listen to these figures: Last year the vote for the administration of pensions by the Treasury was £57,064, but the expenditure was £73,238. This year the vote is £72,102, a saving of only £1,136 on last year's actual expenditure. Now let us turn froni the Treasury and ascertain what burden has been imposed upon the taxpayers by transferring the control of war pensions from the Treasury to the Repatriation 'Commission. The honourable members for Grampians  the two members of the Country party who opposed the proposal of honourable members of the - Labour party to retain the control of these pensions in the Treasury, will realise that they have succeeded in increasing the burden on the taxpayers by over £33,000. iWe find that, although last year £20/500 was provided under the Repatriation Department for the salaries of officers engaged in the administration of war pensions, the actual expenditure on this account as only £13,500; but this year the provision in this regard is £34,495. Making allowance for the. saving of £1,136 effected in the Treasury Estimates, the net increased burden on the taxpayers brought about by the removal of the war pensions administration from the Treasury is over £33,000. Honourable members who supported the transfer will see that the chickens have now come home to roost. It is monstrous that we should have this duplication of work. I am sorry for the Acting Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers), because he was one of those who pointed out what was likely to happen, and opposed the transfer. Where aTe the members of that great Country party at this moment, when the opportunity presents itself of bringing about some of that economy to effect which it came into existence ? There is not one of them in the chamber. Yet a little while ago never a day passed but their Leader, their Deputy Leader,-their Secretary, their Whip, or some other official of the party was on his feet preaching the necessity for economy.. Here now is their opportunity to reverse the vote given five or six months ago, and save the country a heavy expenditure. I have no desire to make any capital out of the fact that members of the Labour party opposed the transfer, but, as a matter of fact, the honourable members for Swan and Grampians are the only two members of the Country party who gave their support to the Government on that occasion. I wish to point out the inconsistency of these gentlemen, who told the people that they would'see that the Estimates, particularly those of the Defence Department, would be closely scrutinized. We have already had two exhibitions of the scrutiny they have exercised in regard to the Defence vote; and now here, when they have an opportunity of saving the people an expenditure of over £33,000, they do nothing. I have no desire to move for a reduction in these Estimates as an instruction that the administration of war pensions should be placed once more in the hands of the Treasury officials, who carried out the work in a manner which caused no dissatisfaction whatever, because it was done sympathetically; but I hope that Parliament will soon see the error of its ways, and, taking the matter into its own hands, effect a retransfer of this work. I do not know why the Government's proposal was agreed to, except, perhaps, that it was for the purpose of providing permanent jobs for those gentlemen who were to be appointed Repatriation Commissioners. One of the arguments put up on that occasion by the Acting Minister, who was then a private member, was that it would be the means of creating permanent employment for the Commissioners just at a time when we were all hoping that the Repatriation Department would soon fade away. Some of the young vocational trainees who were deprived of a holiday on Melbourne Show Day took French leave and visited the Show. Those under the State control were given the holiday on full pay, but those under the Commonwealth were not, and the gentleman in charge of vocational training, no doubt a good military man, treated the absentees as they would have been treated on active service. He did not make the punishment fit the crime, but inflicted a fine of £ 1 each. These vocational trainees are only paid 7s. a day, which is little enough; those who were not living with their people were thus obliged to put something "" up the spout "" in order to find the money to pay their board that week. I believe that discipline should be enforced, but I also 'think that justice should be tempered with mercy, especially in civil life. If the fine had been to the extent of a day's pay it would have been ample punishment.",37
78,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I have no desire to interfere with the enforcement of discipline, but I am strongly of opinion that the amount of the fine should he reduced. I will take the matter into consideration.",38
79,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,It is a pretty harsh law that would prohibit these trainees from visiting the Show.,39
80,Mr JAMES PAGE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I do not know. The absence of these youths may have prevented a lot of men from working on that day. I think they would have been satisfied if the fine had been a day's pay, because they realized that they had taken the law into their own hands, and ought to be punished to that extent. However, they were threatened with all sorts of penalties. Some of them were told that they would be taken away from their vocational classes. These men are no longer on active service, and ought to be treated in accordance with home life conditions. They have had enough of the hardships and horrors of war; and, perhaps, some of those who have punished them do not themselves know what it is to have suffered active service conditions.",39
81,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Illawarra) [5.6] - Eve n though this Parliament deliberately clothed the Repatriation and War Service Homes Commissions with practically independent powers, an effort should be made to see that they adequately perform their duties. Honourable members have, possibly,, been inundated with particulars of cases arising out of the reluctance of the War Service Homes"" Commission to authorize the purchase of existing houses. There is a distinct departmental prejudice against that kind of thing, and the reason is obvious. If the Commission can put a soldier off for a year or two by dissuading him from buying a house already built, and can then place him in a home built by the Commission, it can be sure of carrying on for very many months and even years longer than necessary. In order to force a soldier to wait for a new home rather than facilitate him in getting into an existing house which has been offered him, the Department raises every obstacle. I know of a case where the Commission refused to authorize the purchase of a certain house just because there were three sheets offibro-cementin the front of the building, which had been placed there for purely decorative purposes. At the same time the State bank authorities are by no means unwilling to advance money upon houses constructed entirely of fibro-cement. Right from the beginning the Commission has tried by continual delays to force returned men to wait for Commission-built houses rather than go into homes already constructed. I know of one returned man who selected a home which had been offered him at a very attractive price. The Department occupied four months in investigating the proposition, by which time the vendor became tired and withdrew his offer. This same proposition was subsequently put before a friendly society, in behalf of a person who had not gone to the war; and, in seven days, the sale was effected. I have notes concerning the case of a soldier who for fourteen months has been trying to secure a decision from the Department respecting the purchase of a home. On the 31st December, 1919, the vendor negotiated for the sale of this property, and his agent reported that the returned soldier concerned had been informed by the War Service Homes Cqmmission that the matter of purchase would be. fixed up in the middle of the month of January following. On the 12th April last the Department wrote that "" the matter was being put through as quickly as possible, and that it was hoped to have the papers sent on to Melbourne within a fortnight."" On the 6th May the Department wrote again that delay had been caused by an old title; however, the difficulty had been overcome, "" and the matter was being pushed through as speedily as possible."" The hope was also expressed that the purchase would be finalizeij very shortly. On the 10th September notification was sent to the patiently waiting returned soldier that necessary particulars were being sent to head-quarters in Melbourne for gazettal, whereupon the Crown was to be instructed to effect a prompt settlement. On the 31st October the plans were sent to the vendor for ni3 approval. But, at this stage,, he refused to sign. He _ indicated that he wanted to get out of his contract. Lastly, on the 8th of this month, when I personally telephoned to the Department, the officials appeared to have a hazy idea that the business was not confirmed, and that the soldier had grown tired and wanted to get out of the whole thing. What would happen to the men responsible for such proceedings in any building society? not be able to hold their jobs for one minute. Unfortunately, this case which I have cited is not unique. There are hundreds of instances in which similar treatment has been meted out to those men to whom we promised a fair deal. The Commission is not doing a fair thing for the soldiers. L et honourable members endeavour to imagine the amount that this method of carrying on public business has cost the country. Month after month there are reports, and inspections, and documents, and letters going back and forth, and files are being piled up. we remember that there are many thousands of applications, we must realise that there is a serious waste of public time and funds which ought to be stopped immediately. The people of Australia are prepared to bear the cost of providing their returned men with homes, but they are not willing to continue to pay the salaries of a host of in competent officials. What is more, the conditions are going from bad to worse. I desire now to refer to a statement the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr the cost. Blundell) regarding the failure of the Commonwealth to attempt to check State expenditure of Commonwealth money i respect of land settlement for soldiers. When the proposal was originally made this House to hand the whole subject over to the States, I opposed it . I could not agree to the principle that the Commondependent wealth should raise the money, and the take. States spend it without Federal supervision.",39
82,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,So m e of the States are doing it quite well. Mr HECT OR LAMOND - While others are doing it quite badly. There is no need for me to dwell upon the scandals concerning soldiers' homes i Wales ; but I am bound to remark that the shameful business has been very costly to the Commonwealth.,40
83,Mr LAVELLE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I call attention state of the Committee. formed.""] Mr HECT OR LAMOND - H a d the complaints of the soldiers during the early stages of their settlement on New South Wales been attended to, these scandals oould not have developed to such an extent. I do not blame the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E . D . Millen) or the Acting Minister (Mr Rodgers).

But it is much too old now to have any weight either inside or outside of Parliament. The work of the Repatriation Department itself today is open to very little criticism, but the work of some of the Commissions that have been set up, and have been made independent of Parliament, shoui'-i .have the very closest attention of Ministers who have to find the money for them. Too close a check cannot be kept on the tendency of these independent Commissions to expand, and before the next Estimates are submitted I hope that very careful scrutiny of the operations of all these independent bodies will be made, with a view-to ascertaining whether Comnot monwealth money is being economically vocational spent by them, and whether it is not sible to effect considerable savings by tailing their operations, and particularly by insisting that they shall do their work ing letter: within a reasonable time, and shall be efficiently conducted.",41

An y man who has appreciate been in politics for five 'minutes will reproperly, cognise that no Government would be exare married. pected to resign because of an adverse I vote of that kind. The division took place on an amendment to insert the words, a "" This part of the Act shall be adminisought tered by the existing Pensions Department."" Had that been treated as a motion of want of confidence would the present Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) have voted for it ? He is as good a supporter of the Government as is the honourable member for Illawarra, but he voted for the amendment. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr . Gibson), the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) also voted against the creation of two pension departments. It will thus be seen that the honourable member for I l l a warra voted for the creation of a second Pensions Department, which, as shown this afternoon, is costing us at least an additional £20,000 per annum. Those who have had anything to do with applications for war pensions will readily adm it that the service is in no wise better than it was when under the control of the Pensions Branch of the Treasury. The Victorian branch of the War Pensions Department with which I am most familiar was just as well administered by the Treasury as it is today. When these Estimates were first brought before us this afternoon I had at hand several letters relating to training which I desired to put posbefore the Committee. I propose now to curplace them on record. On the 8th September last I wrote to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) the followDear Senator - Ex-Private J. Newsome, No. 632, 2nd Battalion, 78 Victoria-street, Carlton, called upon me this afternoon. He is in the class at Wdrth's Park, and he, a number of others, has been advised by the instructor that, on accoimt of their disabilities, they will never be marked 40 per cent, efficient. This means that the men will get out in the trade.' I understand that number of the men are getting £2 2s. per week pension, but no sustenance, and they are anxious to get into the trade and get more These men in the frenchpolishing He class have been advised to take on something else, such as boot making. That means they lost from six to fifteen months. I believe the men in other classes have been advised. Will you kindly look intothe matter and advise me. You will, of course, the anxiety of the men to get going especially as a large number of them f a man has an in j u r y which - makes it unlikely that he will become efficient in particular trade the responsible officers to be able to say at once that be should not enter the class r e l at in g to it . I ask that care shall be taken not to allow men to spend some m o n t h s in a c q u i r in g a knowledge of at r a de in which they can never hope to become efficient. I received n o reply to the letter I have j u s t read, and have heard not h in g more in regard to the matter. On the 13th September I addressed a l e t t e r to the R e p at r i at i o n Commission in regard to the t r a in in g of soldiers in a r c h it e c t u r a l d r a w in g and b u i l d in g cons t r u c t i o n , and on the 13th October I received ' the following letter, w h i c h was signed by "" J . A . B . "" on behalf of the C h a i r m a n of the Commission, Colonel Semmens, w h o at the time was out of Melbourne: Dear Sir,-Wit h further reference to your letter of the 30th September, relative to the training of soldiers in architectural drawing and building construction, I have to advise you that inquiry into the statements made by your correspondent has brought forward the following information:-Fifty-foU r men have been commenced in this form of trainingseventeen of whom went through the course. Of the total seventeen completed, nine have been placed in the been placed in other trades, two have been referred to employment, and one is still unplaced. Of the remainder who did not complete the course, six have been placed in trades, whilst others have ceased from various causes, as follows-take n up land, withdrawn on own account, training terminated, ineligibility, terminated by default. sion recently reviewed various aspects of vocational training activities, and it was found that men receiving tuition in this and a few other callings were wasting time and public money, as we had entered a lane to which there was no outlet. Instructions were then issued that all such cases were to be reviewed and training cease. Incapacitated men unfit for pre-war occupations, &c, vide Regulation 92(1), were to be rcselected for training suitable to their adaptability and incapacity, whilst those certified as medically f it were to be allowed to register for employment and to receive sustenance pending employment being made available. The instructions referred to terminated with the following : - "" If thu trainee can obtain a position on the industrial basis in the trade or calling in which he has received training, the Department will place him therein, and will also undertake to endeavour to obtain such positions, but . will give preference, where possible, to incapacitated trainees."" It was economically and morally, to continue a form of training that under the prevailing conditions was of no avail to the trainee or the Department. The remark "" that the only position available was a cornet player in a band "" may have been made, but such a position would not have been offered to an applicant other than one who was registered for employment and possessed the necessary qualifications. In reply , I addressed to the C h a i r m a n of the Commission the following l e t t e r , e m b o d y in g f u r the r statements by m y correspondent: 19th October, 1920. Dear Sir - I received your letter of 13th instant, Gr.20/24639, relative to the training of soldiers in the architectural drawing and building construction class. Many thanks. I would specially invite'your attention to the first paragraph of your communication, in which it is stated that "" two have been referred to employment and one is still unplaced."" In this connection I would like to refer you to the following trainees:W. A. Pierce - Thirtee n months in class, 45 per cent efficient, unable to follow pre-war occupation of carpenter owing to wounds, registered for light employment where there is no straining or jarring of the right arm. D. M . Wright - Sam e as above. W. O'Donnell - Seve n months in class, pre-war occupation bricklayer, right arm useless, registered for light employment. R. Hanger - Unabl e to follow pre-war occupation, registered for light employment. trade, five have O. Dew - Unabl e to return to pre-war occupation, registered for light employment. N . MCDonald - Unabl e to return to pre-war occupation, registered for light employment. These men have during the past seventeen days been before your medical officers, and The Commis- have been marked as unfit to return to their pre-war occupation. They have not been offered any opportunity for any further training, and have registered for light employment. They were also told that if any positions were available in the calling for which they were trained they would be given an opportunity to f ill thom ' Thank you for nothing. Tf an opport u n it y offers, these m e n will q u i c k l y a v a i l themselves of it . but when the statement is made in an official communicatio n that of the number of m en who have commenced t r a in in g in a r c h it e c t u r a l d r a w in g and b u i l d in g construction o n l y one is s t ill unplaced, a l t h o u g h, as a matter of f a c t , seven m e n h a d been registered o n l y a day or two> before, it w o u ld seem that some one is try in g to f o o l either the m e n or the Minister . The l e t t e r c o n t in u e d considered unsound, I would now like to refer you to the case of J. B. Neale, who enlisted at the age of sixteen years and seven months, and was in camp for nearly a year. He had not worked prior to this. After being discharged he did a little work, and re-enlisted on his eighteenth birthday! On his return from abroad he was granted vocational training. He was then ordered to report to your Medical Oflicer to see if he was fit to return to his pre-war occupation. He was subsequently told to register for employment at his pre-war occupation. He is registeredas a salesman, although his only pre-war experience was a messenger boy for about three months. These men consider that, as you state there is only one man still unplaced, that after he is provided with employment they should be given a chance. If you will have this matter again gone into I shall be obliged. I hope that you will be able to meet the wishes of the men concerned. 1 understand there are two more besides those mentioned in this letter. I have not yet received any reply to that communication, although it was sent exactly a month, ago. Men should not he put in a class where they are likely to come to a dead-end, and the Department by this time should have sufficient experience to enable them to avoid anything of the kind. On the 7th September I wrote to Senator Millen the following letter in regard to the watch and clock making class: Dear Senator - It has been brought under my notice that the watch and clock making class in connection with repatriation is not very satisfactory. I understand that some of the men made application to get into this class over two years ago. It is now five months since an instructor was appointed. They were then at the Working Men's College, but are now at Jolimont. From what I have been told, practically nothing has been done since the class started. I believe at present they have no lathes, and only within the last fortnight cabled for them. In a conversation with Mr. .T. S. Sharman, watchmaker,, 294 Little Collinsstreet, Melbourne, he stated that it would be a good idea to train these men to make clocks here. You may consider this worthy of consideration. I would be pleased to have a chat with you on this subject should you so desire. I do nob wish-indee d I refuse-to mak» party capital out of the training of these men. My only desire is that they shall get a fair deal. The Minister has said this afternoon that in respect of some of the small and highly technical trades, such as watchmaking, he agrees with me that we should arrange for vocational training to be carried out by private emvployers who have up-to-date plants.",41
95,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"The difficulty so far the watch and clock making ciass is concerned is to obtain the very delicate tools used in the trade. ,",43
96,Mr TUDOR,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I adar.it that. have the necessary tools and implements at the Working Men's College, but the whole Committee objected, that room set apart there for the watch and clock making class was too dark-that the light was so bad that the trainees would injure their eyes in working there. The men were then transferred to Jolimont, but they are unable to secure the small lathes necessary for the making of 1 screws and duplicate parts used in connection with the trade. However, I have sufficient f a i th in some of the boys to believe that they will make good in spite of all the difficulties in the way. I make no reflection on the Minister, but suggest that he ought, if possible, to visit some of the classes.",43
97,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I have visited some, but it is difficult while the House is sitting.",43
98,Mr TUDOR,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"That is so, and the work of the Department is extremely onerous. Of all the work, vocational training is, perhaps, the most important. If the men lose months or years of their lives now in this training, they will find it extremely difficult to make up the time, 7th September, 1920. and I trust that the Minister will see that the whole business is placed on a sound footing.",43
99,Mr MARR,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Parkes) [5.36] - When the War Service Homes Bill was before us the Minister, in reply to an interjection, said that the occupier of one of the homes who was transferred from one State to another, or from the city to the country, would have to surrender his home to the Department, receiving in return all the contributions he had paid, plus the value of improvements. 1I have in my mind the case of a man in South Australia who was transferred to New South Wales, only to be informed by the Department there that he is not eligible for a home in that State. When in Sydney on Tuesday last I interviewed the Secretary to the Department, who told me that this man is eligible.",43
100,Mr JAMES PAGE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"He went to fight for Australia, and not for any particular State.",43
101,Mr MARR,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Of course; and the M in ister should, I think, inform the House what view he intends to take in such a as case as .1I have cited. I know that the Department has a big job in ' hand, and I have no personal complaint to make against it ; but every time. I visit Sydney They the work in the Department always appears to me to be very much congested. There is only one attendant at the counthe ter, and, when I was last there, I found two men who had been waiting for three hours to be attended to. That is not r i g h t ; certainly no private firm would mete out that sort of treatment to applicants for houses. Why should an extra attendant not be provided? Then, again, there is great delay in connection with the war widows' homes. Much as we wish to see the soldiers themselves expeditiously provided for, we ought to take care that there is no delay in the case of the widows. Some of these ladios in my electorate have been waiting, not for weeks, but for as long as nine to ten months for the homes to which they are entitled. I hope the Minister will look into the matter and let us know the reason for the delay.",43
102,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,Ballarat) [ 5 . 4 0 ] understand that the living allowance has been deleted from the Act.,44
103,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Not deleted from the Act, but included in increased pensions.",44
104,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"That arrangement has not met all cases. A Mrs Moon lost two sons at the war, and her husband has become invalided since. She applied to have the pension for her six children increased or for some addition to her ; own, and she received the following reply from the Department of RepatriationI have to inform you that your application to this Department for a continuation of living allowance has, after careful considerabeen tion, been declined in view of the fact that your war and invalid pensions now equal 55s. per week. It is suggested that you may apply to the Neglected Children's Department for an allowance on behalf of your younger children. I take it that it is not the wish of this country that the sisters and brothers of the lads who have fallen abroad, should be compelled to apply to the Neglected Children's Department, or any other charitable institution, for sustenance. Had those lads lived they would have been earning sufficient today to make any such 'applications unnecessary. know of no letter more cruel than the one I have just read. To think that such a letter should come from a Federal Department to a mother who has given her best to the country! I shall hand it to the Minister in the hope that he will look into the matter with a view to the adoption of some better methods. There is another phase of the question to which I should like to allude. A boy of seventeen or eighteen enlisted and went to the war. A f t e r his return, he took up vocational training at £ 2 2s. per week. He has a widowed mother, but he is refused sustenance for his mother simply because he was not working for wages prior to his enlistment. I was so surprised to get a reply to that effect from the Department that I thought a mistake had been made, so I sent it on to the Acting Minister for Repatriation (Mr . Rodgers), who, however, informs me that the reply is in accordance with some regulation. How in the name of God can a boy keep himself and his widowed mother on £ 2 2s. per week, in view of the present high rents and the high cost of living generally ? I guarantee that when the call for recruits was made this boy was not asked whether or not he was working for wages, but only - I whether he was physically f it . If the regulation be as I am informed, it ought to be altered without any delay, and this lad given aii opportunity to continue his vocational studies so as to equip himself to fight the world's battles. If he had not gone to the war he would have had a trade today, and able to earn much more than £ 2 2s. per week; but he is penalized, along with his mother, because he volunteered, and spent several years fighting his country's battles. The only reason for this refusal is that he enlisted when too young. Had he hung back u n t i l your he was twenty-one, the war would have over, and we should have been short of many thousands of men had others taken that course. As a Victorian, I have not much reason to complain in relation to the housing scheme, and I believe that the ' Deputy Commissioner in this State is doing his best. My complaint is that after these homes have been purchased, and even after the soldiers are in occupation, it is almost impossible to induce the Department to send cheques to the vendors. I have had cases where no cheque has been paid three months after the approval of I the sale has been given.. In most of the cases the vendors are poor people who cannot afford to wait for the money, and cheques ought to be sent promptly. I have come across two or three hard cases.",44
105,Mr BURCHELL,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,Hav e you inquired what is the reason for the delay?,44
106,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,The business gets in t j some branches of the Departmentthe delay has something to do with the lawyers.,44
107,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I am not j u s t if y in g delay, but we have to remember that titles have to be examined, documents signed, arrangements made forsettlement, and so forth. Mr MoGRATH - I am very mujh afraid that the delayis due to the fact that the business is under military rule. It is the same old style that we find in the Army-if there is a job that two men can do, a gang of twenty is sent to do it. One of the greatest blunders we ever made was when we took the payment of pensions from the Commissioner who had control of the invalid and old-age pensions. It has proved a costly blunder, and the work is done neither tively nor sympathetically as before. I cannot believe it is due to any instruction from the .Assistant Minister, but it is remarkable how pensions to widowed mothers are being reduced.",44
108,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,No pension has been reduced on my instructions.,45
109,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I can cite some cases. In one case a widowed mother who was receiving £1 per week has had that pension reduced to Ss. I always thought that when a pension had been granted to a widow, it was practically fixed for life, seeing that it was paid on account of her dependency on her late son. However, these pensions are being reduced; and when an appeal is made, the reply, in effect, is, "" Oh, the lad was young, and that is about all he was worth to his mother when he enlisted."" No redress can be obtained. I admit that I have not applied to the Assistant Minister personally, and I really do not know who has the control of this business.",45
110,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,The Repatriation Commissioners.,45
111,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I have sent in two or three appeals, and always with the same result.",45
112,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,If the honourable member will give me one or two specific cases I shall undertake to go into them with him.,45
113,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I shall do so. It is only the same old complaint that must ever arise when any business is touched by the military. As to war gratuities, there are soldiers who applied on the very first day, and have not received them yet. I meet numbers of returned men every week, and write letters for them in order to expedite this business, but- without success. There are so many departments and branches at the Victoria Barracks which have' to do with the bonds and military matters generally, that one scarcely knows where to address one's communications.",45
114,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,The Treasury and the Defence Department deal with war gratuity bonds.,45
115,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"The military deal with the issuing of the bonds at Victoria Barracks, and there is considerable delay.",45
116,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,The bonds are directly so'effec- under the Treasury.,45
117,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"There is a War Gratuity Board, which, I understand, examines every case and decides when cash shall be paid, but it takes months to arrive at a decision. I wish the Minister to expedite both the issue of the bonds and the payment of cash. In connection with the vocational training, I objeot to the bringing of students fco Melbourne from country districts unnecessarily. In a case brought under my notice, a lad who could have lived with his parents at Ballarat on £2' 2s. a week, was required to come to Melbourne, althrough the director of the Ballarat School of Mines said that there was a vacancy for him there. Major Ryan, however, was adamant. Later, when I appealed to the Minister, the honourable gentleman saw the injustice of what was being done, and remedied it. I understand that a number of lads have received orders to come to Melbourne for vocational training.",45
118,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,There is a case in my own town.,45
119,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,This shows the stupidity of the military officers. Is it done to keep some of their friends in a job ?,45
120,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"No - In some cases this is necessary because of the requirements of industrial Committees, which lay down certain conditions.",45
121,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"In the case to which I have referred, it was said that the trade union would not allow the lad to get his training in Ballarat, but that was not so. The action of the Department was merely red tape and centralization of the worse kind. The lad was told that unless he came to Melbourne his case would be finalized, and it was finalized; but, fortunately, the Minister ri'rpo+ed that' he should be dealt with fairly. I understand that action has been taken in regard to the stoppage of pay due to vocational students. It would be well for turned soldiers. the Minister to bring before him the officer who imposed this fine, and ascertain why he imposed it . He adopt here the methods that were followed abroad. These men are not parade now. It is to the interest of students to qualify as quickly as possible, because as students they receive only 2s. a week, but when fully trained, they will get £ 4 4s. a week. I hope that the Minister will see that the fines are refunded. I wish to bring before the Minister case which i? hardly one of repatriation, and yet is connected with the Eepatriacessful settlers. tion administration. A soldier returned to Melbourne early in the war, badly wounded. I believe that he appeared before a Medical Board in Sydney, told him to go home, and to report again when called upon to do so. For years that man remained at Brunswick, the Department having forgotten all about him ; but just prior to the termination of the war. he was ordered to report himself, and, passing the medical examinaestates tion, he was sent abroad again. He is now claiming the military pay for the two years that he was at Brunswick. He but obeyed orders as a good soldier, in going home, and reported himself for medical examination when called upon to do so. It is for the Department to pay for any blunder that may have been made. Now - I do not know why-h e cannot get hi"" gratuity. I hope that the Minister see that the case is dealt with expeditiously. In regard to the settlement of our soldiers on the land, I will draw attention to a statement of the Hon. Mr Mackinnon, on whom a deputation, consisting of Senator Guthrie, and Messrs. Gibson, M.P., Gibson, M.L.A., H . A . and E . Currie. The deputation expressed the view that a minimum of 5,000 or 6,000 weapon. acres was necessary for a merino stud, and they wanted £30,000 worth of land that weapon used. exempted. Eeplying, Mr Muokinnon is reported to have saidAbout 4,000 Victorian soldiers waiting for land; and, as only about 1,000 of them could be settled on Crown lands the North-Western . District and East Gippsland, land would have to be purchased 3,000 men. It was hoped that some arrangedeteriorating ment could be made with the New South Government whereby portions of the Eiverina area would be made available to Victorian reMr "" WATKINS - A lot of New South Wales returned soldiers cannot get land ought not to in their own State.",45
122,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Mr Mackinnon's on statement was a remarkable one, in view the of the fact that, when he made it , he was a member of the Victorian M in £ 2 istry, which has agreed with the Prime Minister to spend thousands of pounds a year in bringing immigrants to this State, who are to be supplied ""with land.

124,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"No ; he does not say two that. I do not think, from my knowledge of the country, that many returned men could be settled in Eastern Gippsland. The report continues The owners of those large wool-growing that were suitable for mixed farming snould help the Government by offering portion of their areas. Everything would be done to preserve .the foremost flock masters, there was not the slightest chance of Parliament amending the law to provide for an exemption up to £30,000 unimproved value. If there are 4,000 soldiers in Victoria waiting for land to settle on, the fact does not speak well for the land administrawill tion of the Victorian Government.",46

126,Mr MCGRATH,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"It s programme may be, 'but that programme has not been carried out. The compulsory purchase provisions are not being put into operation, or only to a slight extent.",46

131,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"We are now committed to the extent of £50,000,000. Mr MoGRATH -.There is any quantity of land in Victoria. I cannot understand the honourable member for Corangamite taking part in a deputation, the object of whioh was to get an exemption of £30,000 worth of land. 'Had not our lads gone'abroad, the land-owners of Victoria might now have no land at all. While the merino wool industry is a great one, it will not be destroyed by the ing, up of the large estates.

There are grievances which I could ventilate were I desirous of doing so; but since I have been a member of Parliament I have preferred to take my troubles to head-quarters, and get the in dealt with directly, instead of bringing them before the House, and almost invariably they have been settled satisfactorily. There is, however, a matter that I think it necessary to speak upon now. The Government, in certain cases, makes itself responsible for 60 per cent, of the wages of vocational trainees who are in private employment; but employers have brought it under my notice that it is sometimes a long while, occasionally as much as three months, before payment is made, and that, now that the money market is tight, business men have some difficulty in financing their affairs, and, therefore, do not feel called upon to stand out of their money so long. should like the Minister to look into this matter, and see if it cannot be settled as early as possible. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) has referred to land settlement. For a long time. I have held the view that we have not been following the right lines in this regard. It is undoubted that several States possess large areas of Crown lands which could be developed by returned soldiers, and I think if would have paid the Federal - Government handsomely to have made money available to the State Governments for the purpose of opening up those areas by the provision of good roads and railways, thus removing the one great objectionable feature of the present system of settling our soldiers on the land. There are many instances in which persons who have made a competency by farming and are now desirous of getting off the land are offering their holdings at a high figure for the breaksettlement of soldiers. In my own electorate one man was generous enough to submit his property to the Department at £ 1 6 5s. pen acre, whereas that same holding was on the market for three years prior to the war at £ 8 per acre. He had induced a couple of returned soldiers to believe that his farm was the only property that appealed to them, and they were quite willing to undertake the responsibility of buying it at the figure at which he was offering it ; but, very wisely, the proposal was turned down. We are not carrying out the expressed intention of the Government to develop Australia and primary production if we allow competent men, who have proved themselves to be good farmers, to leave the land and replace them by men with very limited knowledge of - agriculture, and in many cases quite unacquainted with the conditions prevailing in the districts where they have bought out previous holders at a high figure. Of course, this question of settling soldiers on the land is not one for this Parliament, but I have all along held the belief that we would have done better if we had secured from the State Governments large areas of undeveloped land and settled the soldiers on them ourselves. Although it might have meant the establishment of still another Commonwealth pepartment, it would have enabled many of the soldiers to avoid vexatious delays that are brought about by dual control. I Reference has been made to a deputation which waited on the Hon. Donald Mackinnon. From time to time in the newspapers we read of visitors from other countries making an inspection of the various flocks and herds of Australia, and buying the very best of our stud sheep at prices which our own people are not willing to pay. By this means Australia is losing some of her best stud stock, and as the present tendency is to cut up the large holdings where these sheep are bred, and start men on them on small areas, we cannot expect the high standard of excellence which has been attained by Australian sheep breeders to be maintained, because the smaller settlers will have neither the means nor the facilities to keep up that high standard. I do not want it to be thought that I am an advocate of a policy which would retard that closer settlement which is so essentia] for Australia, but at the same time. I want it to be understood that I think a great mistake has been made in placing - men on small areas in certain districts while some of the best of our land is allowed to remain practically idle. Recently I paid a trip to Queensland, and made it my business to visit the Beerburrum soldier settlement. I had travelled through that country several years ago in search of land. The spot on which the soldiers.are now settled was then considered valueless by men on the outlook for agricultural propositions; and the fact that although it was only 40 miles from Brisbane, and had a railway line traversing it , it remained undeveloped for twenty-five years, ought to have been sufficient to satisfy the ordinary man that it could not be altogether suitable for soldier settlement. When I visited Beerburrum I was received very courteously by the overseer, who happened to have been a member of my own unit overseas. He placed at my disposal' a buggy and pair, so that I could drive about among the farms and meet different people, but I noticed that I was always taken to the show farms, and was told that others who have been on a similar, tour of inspection have been treated in the same way. But I made it my business to go out on my own one afternoon and get in touch with the farmers Avithout any official accompanying me. I very quickly ascertained that things were very different from what I had been led to believe as the result of m y conversations with the men I had met earlier.",47
133,Mr MACKAY,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,What did the honourable member find wrong with the settlement?,48
134,Mr LISTER,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"The first complaint made to me, and it was repeated by almost every settler, was that the tenure on which the soldiers held the land did not suit them. The 1 tenure is perpetual leasehold, with a reappraisement of rent every ten years. In other words, the holder of the block taxes himself for any improvements he effects. I am satisfied that we must view this problem in a new light. I advocate the settling of returned soldiers in groups, and providing them with facilities of which the old pioneer was deprived. I know a little about pioneering in Queensland. Eor thirty years I lived on a property which was 40 miles from a railway. We could get our produce to the railway in fine weather, but, owing to the state of the roads, it was absolutely impossible to do so in wet weather. The difficulties with which the early settlers had to contend can be overcome by th-s judicious expenditure of considerable sums of money upon the construction of railwayS and roads. There is a great future before this Commonwealth in regard to the settlement of men on the soil provided the price of the land is not too high - I cannot see the wisdom of buying up farms at an exorbitant figure and putting men with little or no experience on them, hoping that they will make good.",48
135,Mr WATKI NS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Newcastle) [6.17] The conditions of land settlement in New ' South Wales should have the attention of the Minister. An y one who looks at the figures recently produced by the State Government in regard to the cost of settling soldiers must admit that the efforts in this direction, so far as New South Wales is concerned, have proved a ghastly failure. I have not heard of or seen any Crown land made available for the purpose by the State Government that is f it to settle soldiers on. Recently I had occasion to look a f some soldiers' blocks in the coastal area. It was classed as cattle country. It is a hungry, hilly, almost mountainous country, heavily timbered with coastal hardwoods. The mills have taken out all the straight trees, leaving to the soldier the task of clearing off the rubbish. But while it is classed as cattle country, I venture to say that if any returned soldier lives long enough to clear one of these blocks it will not grow one bullock to the block, let alone one to the acre. I saw a most pathetic sight during that visit. I was taken on to one block where there was a woman with her infant and her father, whose age must have been between seventy and eighty. Her husband, a returned soldier, had been a carpenter, but he had essayed the task of taking on one of these blocks. While at work, clearing, he was killed by a falling tree. The widow, with her child and father, was living on in a little bark humpy, acting upon the advice of the Repatriation people,' who had told her to "" hang on."" in the hope that some other returned soldier settler might come along and take over the block, thus permitting her to secure some compensation. The adaptability of settlers and the suitability of their blocks are matters which should receive the profoundest scrutiny and investigation; and, since the Commonwealth is advancing the money, the Government should have some supervision of its expenditure in order to be assured that returned soldiers are getting the greatest possible benefit from the outlay. I know of another case of a block on an irrigation settlement. What hope had the returned soldier settler of making a success of ""this area when water could only be got on to 2 acres of the whole block? From personal knowledge I can say that those who do know something about the land among our returned soldier applicants are the very men who have to wait the longest to get a suitable block. After months of endeavour some of them appear to be further off than ever from being successfully settled.",48
136,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"'The States are supposed to pick out the best land, and the most suitable soldiers' for settlement thereon, and to see, generally, that the best possible use is made of the money allocated. - Mr WATKINS - Fro m the inception of our Repatriation legislation this Parliament was aware of the danger of choosing unsuitable land and selecting wrong men; so that we cannot be .said to have gone into the matter without thought or warning. From the point of view of genuine settlement and of the wise outlay of Commonwealth money, which has been advanced to the States, the whole business has been a ghastly failure. The Government should see to it that they are directly represented in regard to the various land settlement activities of the States.",49
137,Mr CONSIDINE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Barrier) [6.25] I am seeking information concerning Italian reservists who were taken out of this country, and whose wives and other dependants have been subsidized by the Commonwealth Government, and have been also in receipt of a very small sum from the Italian Government. I have received complaints from some constituents of mine at Broken Hill, to the effect that their sources of supply have been cut off by the Commonwealth Government, while, at the same time, the small amounts which they receive from Italy are being paid irregularly and at long intervals. I communicated with the Italian Consul. . His reply was very brief, and to the effect that the payments were made in accordance with instructions received from the Italian Government. That may be explicit from his point of view, but it is poor consolation to the women and children who are dependent upon this scanty assistance. The Commonwealth Government were responsible for "" shanghai-ing "" the husbands of these needy folk out of the country, at the instance of the then Italian Consul; and if they are not legally responsible they are at least morally responsible for the dependants. Nothing has been heard from some of the deported reservists since they were taken away to the war. Their families do not know whether they are dead or whether they deserted or were taken prisoners, and, meanwhile, the women and children are practically living on the charity of their neighbours in Broken Hill. Another matter which I wish to ventilate has to do with Australians who deserted from the Australian Imperial Force. The position of their dependants is a very unhappy one.",49
138,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,There is provision for granting temporary assistance to the dethe - pendants of deserters.,49
139,Mr CONSIDINE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I communicated with the Defence Department a faw months ago, in the interests of certain' dependants, and some degree of temporary relief was granted. One lady - has since informed me, however, that she is now receiving no help at all. She has two or three children to keep.",49
140,Mr FLEMING,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I think the honourable member would find-and my experience confirms it-that , upon application to the Minister, temporary assistance can be secured without difficulty.",50
141,Mr CONSIDINE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) simply notified me that he could not extend any assistance. I will put the particulars before the Acting Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers)-, and I am quite sure that, if he has the power, he wil l see that something is done. When I originally pointed out the circumstances to the Defence Department, its officials replied that the soldier in question was an illegal absentee, that his records were still in London, a nd t b at they had cabled for their despatch to Australia to be expedited ; but that, in the circumtances, they could not extend any financial aid.",50

144,Mr CONSIDINE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"When we adjourned for dinner I was referring to the case of a lady whose husband is, in the phraseology of the Defence Department, "" an illegal absentee."" I have now the letter which I received fro m the Secretary of the Defence Department in reply to my representations on the subject. It readsDear Sir,-In continuation of my letter of 4th November, regarding your representations o.i behalf of Mrs , I desire to inform you that the position of the matter of this soldier's military pay account is as stated by Mrs. ;n her letter which you forwarded on to me, viz., that the London Records concerning her husband, who is an illegal absentee, have not yet been received, in consequence of which adjustment of his military pay account is delayed. I have sent a cablegram to Lpndon office instructing that all documents concerning members of the A.I.F. marked "" Illegal Absentee"" are to be promptly despatched, and immediately on - receipt of those papers relating to Mrs. husband steps will be taken to effect settlement of the account. I greatly regret the circumstances in which this soldier's wife is placed as the result of the illegal absence of her husband, but no action towards rendering anj .financial assistance can, in the circumstances, be undertaken by this Department. If there is any means by which this lady and her children can be speedily helped it should be pointed out by the Department. The circumstances detailed in her letter show that she is absolutely dependent upon charity. It is through no f a u l t of her own that she is in that position, and if there is any governmental method - by which she can be helped it should be availed of without delay.",50
145,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"I suggest that the honourable member furnish me with a statement of the circumstances, with a reference to the soldier's number, when I will try to help this lady and her children under a special provision that we have for deserters' wives. It is only a temporary form of assistance, designed to enable women in such circumstances to carry on pending the location of their husbands.",50
146,Mr CONSIDINE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,Is there not some way of enabling this lady to get the gratuity to which her husband would time is have been entitled ?,50
147,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,No ; her husband's disqualifications debar ^ier u n t il he puts cannot accept himself right. He deprived himself of all benefits when he deserted the A r m y . of providing;,50
148,Mr CONSIDINE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"When the W a r Gratuity Bill was before us I understood that the payment of the gratuity was not to be considered as a right. Surely, because this man is alleged to have done wrong, the Government is not going to refuse to do what is right? Whatever may be the legal aspect of the case, the Government are certainly bound morally to do what they can for this woman and her children. They took away the husband and availed themselves of his services. I do not know what are the cir. cumstances associated with this man's disappearance. It may be that he is suffering from shell shock.",50
149,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,That is why it is very necessary that the honourable member should supply us with all the facts of the case at his disposal. .,50
150,Mr CONSIDINE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"The honourable gentleman seemed to be confident that this woman could not obtain the gratuity. I am not at all certain that, under the ' provisions of the Act, she is disentitled to it . I believe the Department, if it so . desires, can grant it to her. This is a case where the gratuity accruing to the man, whatever it was, at the time of his disappearance, might very well be paid to his dependants.",50
151,Mr RODGERS,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"If she has not done so already, the wife should first of all make application for the gratuity and lodge a caveat against the gratuity being dealt with by. any one else. We will then deal with the matter.",51

155,Mr LAVELLE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"Calare) [ 8 . 7 ] - I desire to support the complaint that has been made today by members of my party concerning the increased expenditure and the lessened efficiency which has resulted from the setting up of a new Department to administer the War Pensions Act. Prior to the transfer of the administration of war pensions from the Treasury to the Departmentof Repatriation we were able to have all matters relating to them dealt with in a satisfactory manner. But since the creation of this new Department I find it impossible to obtain satisfaction. It is almost impossible to get a reply to a letter addressed The Parliament The Prime Minister's DepartmentCommonwealth Shipbuilding Commonwealth Line of Steamers Port Pirie Wharf . .

Unless one continually writes to the Department reminding it) that a certain case is still awaiting consideration, one can get no satisfaction, and in many instances not even a reply is forthcoming. This transfer is not only involving us in an additional expenditure of £30,000 a year, but unfortunately the A special administration is less efficient than it was. I have had cases before the Deputy Commissioner for New South Wales since The June last, and have not yet been able to have them satisfactorily dealt with . I do not even know yet whether the claims are to be recognised or refused. The only reply that one receives, as a rule, to a communication sent to the Department is that it "" will receive consideration.""

The price at which the sugar was pur- 1 chased, including freight, insurance, and exchange, probably did not amount to more titan £ 2 4 per ton, and, allowing COOK, for refining and distribution charges, would not amount to £ 2 8 per ton. Assuming the price to be £ 2 8 , that means 3d. per lb. According to the Budget speech, the whole of the 124,000 tons t h at was imported during 1919-20 was landed here at a cost of £*3 per ton. The cost of sugar is a very vexed question in the community today, and there are also complaints of the shortage of supplies. Notwithstanding the paragraphs which have appeared in the newspapers stating that there is ample sugar available, I am informed that it is impossible to obtain refined' sugar in many of the 'Melbourne suburbs. As to my own household,-the grocer, from whom, under ordinary cir. L I cumstances, we get 12 lbs. of refined sugar per week, was able to supply us with only 3 lbs. or 4. lbs. On the last occasion j however, we obtained 6 lbs., but it was raw sugar. No wonder the Colonial Sugar Refining Company can show such colossal profits as were .announced at their last annual meeting in Sydney. It appears that their profit was £180,000-large r than ever before. The reason is that the company is getting the same price for raw sugar as for refined sugar; at any rate, the publio is paying the same price for both, and I am certainly not wrong in saying that the company have made a record profit.",52

The recent inquiry by the Inter-State Commission did not touch that phase of the question, for the reason that the representatives of the company refused point blank to answer any questions. No company in Australia should be above the Government, whether it be, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Melbourne Gas Company, the British Australian Tobacco Company, or any of the other wealthy combines to whom we pay toll every day. If the Colonial Sugar Refining Company made their enormous profits out of F i j i , it was out of watered stock; and the people of Australia have to payThe Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) informs me that, later on, a little Bill dealing with.sugar is to be introduced, and I only hope that some arrangements will be made for an adequate supply in Australia, particularly to ordinary householders. I am, not speaking now for the Housewives Federation or any other organization, but for the great mass of .consumers who are unablje to pntocure sugar for jam making. That is a serious matter, not only for the housewife, but also for the small fruit-producer i u the Dandenong Ranges, for instance, where raspberries, loganberries, gooseberries and other j a m fruits, are grown, and, according to announcements that have been made, may now be obtained at a certain price. Unless there is an adequate supply of sugar, these fruit s will go to waste. The complaint is made that while jam manufacturers, confectionery manufacturers, brewers and others may obtain unlimited supplies, the quantities allowed the domestic jam-maker are very restricted . There is another phase of the question, which has been mentioned previously. About March last, when the price was in : creased, we were informed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that certain firms in Melbourne, including Hoadley's, and another firm in Brunswick, had been proved to have hoarded sugar. What.has been done in those cases? Were those guilty of hoarding compelled to sell the sugar at 3£d - as they could very well have done-and at a profit ? Can the M in ister for Trade and Customs hold out any hope to the ordinary domestic jam-maker of being able to get sufficient sugar at a fair price?",53

I may then reply at some length to the statements of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). I should like, however, to say a word or two in relation to the supplies of sugar. Later, on I shall state the reason why the supplies have been short during the last few months. I now desire to say that arrangements have been made for the purchase of large quantities of Java white sugar. There are two steamers on their way to Australia now and they will arrive in a few days with , between them, about 9,000 tons of white sugar. This, with the refineries working at their full capacity, will , I believe, enable us to meet the demands of the f r u it season. There are other shipments to follow, and I have no doubt that the position will be so materially relieved with in the next few days that we shall have no more complaints in regard to shortage.",53

165,Mr RILEY,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,'But suppose manufacturers try to corner sugar and prevent the small consumers getting in?,54

167,Mr MASSYGREENE,PRICE OF WHEAT FOB HOM E,"They will not hoard under the conditions I have indicated. There is just one other point I desire to make clear. The Leader of the Opposition spoke of the profits made 'by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company out of the sale of brown sugar. The company does not. get any profit whatever from the sale of sugar. The arrangement made hy the Government with the company is that the latter shall be paid a fixed rate on every ton of sugar which they refine and sell, the Government paying the company, in addition, the actual cost of refining, for the use of the plant. The company make the same return whether they sell white or brown sugar, and, whatever the price may be, it is a fixed charge.",54

SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 4th November (vide' page 6195), on motion by Mr POYNTONThat'this Bill be now read a second time.",56
180,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Y a r r a ) [ 8 . 5 5 ] under .the impression that the Government proposed to withdraw this Bill . I have the same, complaint to make in regard to it that I have made in reference to other Bills we have had before us recently. For instance, clause 3 in - son, forms us that section 3 of the principal Act is -. amended by omitting paragraph c and inserting in its stead a new paragraph c; but unless honourable members a copy of the consolidated Immigration Act, they can have no idea of are what was the original paragraph c. I fact do not know why the Government have the departed from the practice of having a n anmemorandum printed showing in black type the words proposed to be added to the Act; and in erased type the words proposed to be struck out. It could easily have been done with this small Statute, which, as consolidated, covers not more than eleven pages. The Bill proposes to omit the definition m - of ' ' the Minister,'' which. according to original Act , means "" the Minister for  ister for Home and Territories "" in lieu",56
181,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"But , apparently, by omitting the words "" the Minister,"" the Act can be administered by a departmental head. I object to cutting out Ministerial responsibility, and I cannot see any good purpose to be served by this amendment.",56
182,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,What is the object,56
183,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I do not know. When we reach the clause, the Minister may tell us. In any case, it is an important principle which has been introduced for the first time in this Bill . Before the war BILL. no country was more strict in respect to r . its immigration laws than the United States. That strictness, however, was not consistent. A' person had very little difficulty in getting into America, so long as he did not seek to enter as a steerage purpassenger. For twenty years prior to the war an annual average of 1,000,000 immigrants entered the United States. All sorts of tests were made, but so long as one. entered as a first or second class steamer passenger the more stringent ex. aminations could generally be avoided. Canada instituted restrictions in imitation i of the United States, but Australia is now about to institute still nr.ore drastic - I was restrictions.",56
184,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,Because Canada's . experience justifies that course.,56
185,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"On e of our new restrictions is as follows: Person suffering from dementia, insane perperson who has been insane within five years previously, or person who has had two or more attacks of insanity. W it h many of these unfortunate people the attacks are intermittent. During normal periods sufferers are often very shrewd, or cunning. Is it intended to ask every person who seeks to enter Australia if he or she has been insane within the past five years ?  the same kind were conducted while the honourable member was a Minister.",56
186,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"But if a person says he is not insane and has. not been insane within five years, how can his word be disproved ? Can a medical examination reveal anything if the individual at the time is nonmal? Insanity is a most awful infliction, and, of course, we do not want immigrants of that type, l t would appear, however, that they wil l be kept out if they tell the truth about themselves, but may not be prevented from entering if they avoid stating the facts; and very few of these unfortunates would be likely to admit their insanity. We should see that only very healthy persons are admitted into Australia. 1I have been assured by a medical authority that if Australia were to institute stringent regulations governing tubercular disease, and were to prevent infected newcomers from landing on our shores, we could r i d ourselves ;of the scourge within t h i r t y years.",57
187,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,M a n y people came here to regain good health. The Austrasires. lian climate has been their salvation.,57
188,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Yes , they have come to this land as weaklings, and have lived on bo a robust old age. I do not suggest for one moment that we should have officers notice-boards at the entrances to our ports intimating that ""Rubbish should be shot off here."" We should take all reasonable px«cautions, at the same time being carei f u l not to keep out bond fide immigrants difficulty. upon the whim of some Minister or official. I want to know whether all pasthem? sengers, irrespective of the class in which they journey out here, are to be treated alike. Will saloon passengers quired to undergo the same investigations and tests as steerage passengers?  pass a medical inspection, whether he throw travels by saloon or otherwise.",57

190,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,To m Walsh is a assassination Britisher.,57
191,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Britishers , have been kept out of Australia.",57
192,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,What about the case of the six hatters ?,57
193,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,I know all about that. The hatters were fooled on the other side.,57
194,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"And on this side, too.",57
195,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"No ; they were admitted to Australia. They were subject, to a political dodge. I ' k n o w a good deal about the whole thing, for I had been working ab the trade within two years of that period. I know all about the myth that grew from the alleged prohibition against their landing in this country. I know of the political capital which was made of the incident by the opponents of the Barton Government, who were administering our immigration laws at the, time.",57
196,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,The incident waa entirely a matter of administration.,57
197,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,I admit that ; but my objection at this moment is to one class of immigrant being treated differently from another.,57
198,Mr MAXWEIX,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"He a r , hear!",57
199,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,My objection is that the authorities would make their task one of discrimination rather than of administration.,57
200,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Yes ; I have said before that departmental officials will generally administer in the wav their Minister deA keen Minister makes keen officers, and a slack Minister makes slack officers. If the Minister responsible wants to keep out of Australia a certain tvoe of individual, or even a specific person, his will take all sorts of care to institute such tests as wil l prevent the admission of the newcomer. I have seen saloon passengers get past immigration officials n the United States with mighty little",57
201,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,How much has it cost,57
202,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I do not know, and I be redo not want to make any allegations in ' that regard. My main objection to this measure has to do with the proposed new paragraph, which reads: (gd) any person who advocates' the overby force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country or of forms of law, or who is opposed to organized government, or who advocates the of public officials or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph;",57
203,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I b is well named a "" "" paragraph.",58
204,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,It is. This proposed power will be employed for political purposes.,58
205,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"But , surely, the honourable member would not advocate the entry into Australia of persons holding those views?",58
206,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"if one is to judge by a statement attributed to him a good many years ago-migh t have been kept out of Australia under the terms of this paragraph. If the Treasurer advocated the establishment of a Republic in Australia, he could be kept out.",58
207,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,I did not advocate a Republic. Let me say that quite plainly.,58
208,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I certainly understood that the right honourable gentleman had done so at one time. At any rate, the power here set out could be employed; and I say emphatically that had it been part of our laws in the past it would have been used to keep out persons who are good Australians today.",58
209,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,The honourable member would not say they were good Australian citizens if they could be placed under this category?,58
210,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Peopl e have a right to their own political opinions. The powers here sought to be embraced within our immigration laws could be very easily stretched by keen officials who knew what their Ministers wanted. Actions could be taken of a similar nature to that which was witnessed in this House a week ago today. If the ex-member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon) were about to enter Australia at this moment, the provisions of paragraph gd could be employed, so as to keep him out; and the Government would so employ them.",58
211,Mr SPEAKER,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL, Order ! I ask the honourable member not to discuss so much in detail the clauses of the Bill.,58
212,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"After all, sir, the clauses to which I am referring are the principal features of the Bill. specify the persons to whom it is intended to apply, and who are to be kept out of the country. This is neither more nor less than panic leetfslation. I am aware that similar legislation has been introduced in other countries. It used to be our proud boast that Britain was the asylum for the political refugees of other countries.",58
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,Sh e paid for it when the war broke out.,58
214,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Mak e no mistake about that. There were men of French and Italian extraction, as well as political refugees of practically every country, in Britain at that time.",58
215,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,Garibald i was in London in my boyhood days.,58
216,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"And Mazzini and many others sought refuge in England. It was the boast of Britishers that men who had committed no offence in their own country, except that they held advanced political views, found a refuge in the Old Country. Britain did not pay dearly for that spirit of toleration. What she did pay dearly for was the opening, of her doors to the cheap labour of other countries. The cheap labour of other countries was availed of to such an extent in the manning of British ships that on many a British vessel not one member of the crew could speak the English language. Britain went abroad to get cheap labour.",58
217,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,Nothin g of the kind.,58
218,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,That was proved at the International Navigation Conference held in Great Britain in 1907.,58
219,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"The truth is that the people at Home in those days preferred to stay on shore, because things on shore were better.",58
220,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"The truth is that Britishers could not be induced to work in the stokeholds of the Atlantic and other liners for £3 a month, which was all that ship-owners were prepared to pay for such labour. I know something of seafaring life, and of the conditions which used to prevail in Liverpool and on British steamers. That was what Britain had to pay dearly for.",58
221,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,Would the honourable member allow the advocacy of the deThey struction by force or violence of our established form of government?,58
222,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,I have not said that I would. I have said that certain clauses in this Bill could be so twisted by the - Government as to keep out of the country any honourable member on this side of the House who had taken a trip abroad.,58
223,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,Nonsense !,59
224,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"What is more, I honestly believe that it would be so used by some persons.",59
225,Mr SPEAKER,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Order ! I must again remind the House that on a motion for the second reading of a Bill the general principles of the measure may discussed, and the clauses in it may incidentally referred to; but to discuss them in detail, as is being done at present, is wholly out of keeping with our own practice, and that of othei legislative assemblies. Every clause can be minutely discussed in Committee.",59
226,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,I am not sure that shall have that opportunity. I believe that the whole Bill will be used by Government to keep out its political opponents.,59
227,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,And therefore the honourable member says we should not have ah Immigration Restriction Bill.,59
228,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I do not say that. would use such a Bill to debar employers from bringing in cheap labour under contract. It would have been a good thing for Great Britain if in the had had a similar measure. A lot of trouble resulting from the encouragement given to people to go there from other countries in order that cheap labour might be secured would thus have been avoided. This is a piece of political camouflage, and is to be used to keep out certain persons whose political opinions do not coincide with those of the Government. In one part of the measure, specific ference is made to certain persons were our enemies during the war. The war is now over.  evil thinks."" The honourable member says this Bill is introduced for a specific purpose.",59
229,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I do; and I think that some Ministers would use it for that specirefuse fic purpose. This may be followed by Bill providing for deportation, and plying even to Britishers and others whom the Government do not wish to recommercial main here. In 1917-abou t the time the Ready incident-the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), speaking in this House in years? regard to peace terms, said that, once Germany had purged herself of the persons who were at the head of her affairs at that particular time, he would be willing that she should again come into the councils of the nations. I endorse that view; but under this Bill we shut Germans out of Australia. I do not suppose that any Commonwealth electorate is freer of German influence than that be which I represent. When the Governbe ment, about April, 1916, had a ""roundup,'' and compelled all persons to state their place of origin, they were only able to find in my electorate twenty-three persons who were believed to be of enemy - origin, and every one of them proved that they were not Germans. One man we was able to trace back his British ancestry for more than 200 years. That is the more than many of us could do. The Government are ill-advised in introducing the Bill at this time. It is true that we are following the lead of other countries, but we know very well that Britain today is allowing Germany to trade with I her. Day after day we read in the newspapers that certain British industries are being mined by imports from Germany.",59

231,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,That is so. I do not approve of anything of the kind.  mans are excluded from the Commonwealth for a period of five years.,59
232,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"And there is nothing to prevent the Government proposing, when that period has expired, to extend it to the extent of another fifty years. Meantime, we are allowing Germany, through rethe medium of other countries, to do who trade with Australia.  to him who this Bill as to trade.",59
233,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I am aware of that. I am simply pointing out the political hypocrisy of some persons who, like the ostrich, bury their heads in the sand, and to see that this sort of thing is a going on. Under the principal Act, comapmercial travellers and students are exempt. Does that mean that German travellers and students will of be free to come here while other Germans are prohibited for a period of five Japanese, German, and other commercial travellers and students can come into Australia, although their fellow countrymen who are not so employed are unable to do so. I am hopeful that we shall. return to normal times, and will have no more of the panic legislation that we have had during the war period. This is but a part of the aftermath of the war, and I believe that many of those who aTe now supporting this for m of legislation will be heartily ashamed of it before many years have elapsed. Debate (on motion by Sir JOSEPH COOK) adjourned. SUGAR PURCHASEBILL . Message recommending appropriation reported. In Committee (Consideration vernor-General's Message): Sir JOSEPH COOK Treasurer) [9.30] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of Bill for au Act to amend the Sugar Purchase Act 1915-20. I really do not know whether this B i requires a message, but, perhaps, it well to be on the safe side. Theobject of the Bill is to remove the limitation of £1,000,000 v. hich we may borrow an overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank for sugar purchases, and to enable advance ? us to increase the amount.",59
234,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"There w i l be a limitation ? Sir JOSE PH COOK - It is not prowas necessary. posed to have a limit , for' which I see no necessity, in view of the fact that prices are all the time fluctuating.

236,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Not much. do not expect I shall have to find this money out of overdraft. What realized will help by so much, but least we shall require a great deal than £1,000,000.",60
237,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,Y o u have repaid the advances?,60
238,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Yes ; the money all goes into a special Sugar Trust and not into the Consolidated - Revenue. [271] The object of the Bill is, as I say, to remove the l i m it to which we may borrow in order to buy sugar abroad. When we are finding the pinch in London and elsewhere, it becomes necessary that our nnancial operations should be as free as possible, so as to enable us to take advantage of the constantly shifting market. A fortnight ago sugar rose .£9 per ton, and now it is down again ; and we cannot take advantage of operations unless we have freer financial arrangements for the purpose of borrowing moneys temporarily by which to establish credits. In the present disturbed condition of the world, people abroad must have credits absolutely established before they will sell. That is taking place' even between of Gocivilized Governments.",60

258,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"The depositors in the Savings Banks are generally people of small means, with little or no financial experience, or they would, naturally, go. to the bank which pays the largest interest. It is contemptible that a certain portion of our citizens should be robbed in this way; but it all arises from our having' a dictator at the head of the Commonwealth Bank instead of a Board of Directors. With all humility, I suggest to the Treasurer that he could get large sums of money by offering to the people of Australia the same terms he offers to the money-lender across the sea. The great mass of the people of Australia have never refused to help this country in an hour of need; and I do not see why they should not be paid the same rate of interest that we are willing to pay to our creditors abroad.",61
259,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,Do you suggest that we should pay the private banks more than we pay the Commonwealth Bank? That is involved in what you,61
260,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"'The right honourable gentleman misunderstands me. What I mean is that the Government should pay the Savings Bank depositors-the common people of Australia- a rate of interest equal to that paid to the foreign money-lender. If the local depositors were paid a little more interest than at present, the whole of it would be spent in Australia; whereas the interest paid to the foreign money-lender leaves Australia. The public deposit their money in the Commonwealth Savings Bank prindo cipally on account of its acknowledged safety; and I believe that if a special appeal were made to them for funds to enable the Government to purchase sugaT, their assistance would be gladly given.",61
261,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,There is no reason why the Commonwealth Savings should not pay as high a rate of interest as that paid by the State Savings Banks. „ ,61
262,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,I consider that the Commonwealth Bank is robbing the depositors. Mr MCWILLIAMS.'-The worse feature is that in many country places the only Savings Bank is that conducted by the Commonwealth Bank at the local post offices.,62
263,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"And the absolute dictator at the head of the Bank refuses to pay the Australian depositor any higher rate of interest than at present. The position of the Commonwealth Bank clerks is not dealt with in the Bill it does seem to me infamous that the award of the Arbitration Court does not apply to them. In my opinion, i time for those clerks to organize; and I should be willing to assist them to go on strike to obtain their rights.",62

265,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,No one will benefit more from this Bill than the fruit growers.,62
266,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"They have to pay the price for the sugar; but to be without any during the fruit season would mean absolute ruin. The Government are to be congratulated on this extension of their operations. We have the assurance of the Minister that the whole of this money is simply an advance to buy sugar, and that the money will be returned into the purchasing fund as it is realized; that is, it will not go into the Consolidated Revenue, and add to our indebtedness. I have often said, and I repeat, that it is time we put this sugar question on a very much better basis. I am one of those who think that as we have given enormous assistance to the sugar industry, the least we can ask is that it shall provide for the requirements of Australia. I am aware, of course, that droughts and difficult seasons recur from time to time, and that as a result we are frequently faced with a great shortage, - but I think that the big incubus standing between the consumer and the canegrower is the real reason why the sugar industry does not progress, and that we shall never be able to put it on a satisfactory basis until we have such a system of co-operation among the canegrowers, assisted by the Government as far as possible, as will enable the grower to get the full result of his labour.",62
267,Mr GABB,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,You will have the Sugar Journal on to you for this. ',62
268,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I am speaking on behalf of the cane-grower of Queensland, ""and the fruit-growers and consumers of Australia. The time is ripe for some definite action. I speak as the ; but representative of a district which consumes more sugar as the raw material for its industries than any other electorate t .is in Australia. The fruit-growers of the Commonwealth are quite prepared to give the sugar cane-growers a generous deal, but they ask for the removal, as far as possible, of that influence which comes in between them.",62
269,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"It would be bad for Queensland. Mr. MCWILLIAMS - We are always taught by some people to kiss our chains. I am taking a stand on this question, because I realise that the cane-grower of Queensland will never be in a position to get'the full results of his labour until, by some system of Government assisted co-operation, the consumers and jam manufacturers on the one hand and the, cane-grower on the other hand are brought' into closer touch. I welcome the Bill, and hope it will have a speedy passage.",62
270,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Yarra) [9.48] - Earlier in the evening when we were debating another matter the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) promised to reply to certain statements which I had made concerning the sugar industry. The Treasurer's Budget speech, page 11, contains the following:Since the Commonwealth Government aa- sumed control of the sugar industry, sales of sugar have amounted to nearly £40,000,000. From February, 1919, to July, 1920, 123,983 tons of foreign sugar have been purchased at the average eost of £43 9s. 5d. per ton, delivered to Australian refineries. The present Australian sugar crop is expected to yield about 170,001) tons. Now, according to the answers given to me by the Minister for Customs, from the end of June last year to the end of February this year, importations of sugar from Java totalled 66,000 tons.. and from F i j i 4,100 tons. The Java sugar cost £22 per ton f.o.b. for 60,000 tons, and £23 per ton f.o.b. for 6,000 tons, while the F i j i sugar cost £25 per ton f.o.b. Freight from Java was 35s. per ton, and from F i j i 27s. 6d. per ton. Insurance from Java was 9s. 9d. to 10s. l i d . per cent., and from F i j i 8s. per cent. Exchange on the Java sugar cost 15s. per cent, to 17s. 6d. per cent.,, but on F i ji it was nil. This brings the total cost of the Java sugar to £23 17s. 6d. per ton, or 2-^d. per lb., and the F i j i sugar to £26 19s. 6d., or 2-|d. per lb.",62
271,Mr GAUD,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,That was not for refined sugar.,63
272,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"No , it was raw sugar. The sugar from Queensland cost only £22 6s. Sd. per ton, or 2-}d. per lb. This was up to the end of February of this year. If the 1S6,000 tons of Queensland sugar cost the Government only 2^d. per lb., and the Java and F i j i sugar \2^d. and 2§d. per lb. respectively, it is not right that the Australian public today should be paying 6d. per lb. That is all I have to say. They are the Minister's own figures, not mine.",63
273,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.54] - I have .jiot had an opportunity, since I spoke earlier in the evening, of getting the exact data to enable me to reply in the way I would like to the statement of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor). I can only say that his calculations are based on assumptions that are entirely inaccurate. The honourable gentleman is quoting figures for raw sugar.",63
274,Mr TTJDOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,I said that.,63
275,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Then he is taking the average over a period which includes part of the time when we were selling sugar at 3^-d. per lb., and part of the time wo were selling at 6d. per lb. Every pound that we got at the lower rate was sold to the public for 3^d. But when we had to buy at the higher price we raised the retail price to 6d. The retail price was not raised until we had sold to the public all the sugar that we had bought cheaply. The profit that we make on the sugar that we are buying from the Australian grower is about £7 per ton. The market rose rapidly from the date on which we bought the cheap sugar, but - we were able to buy a certain quantity at a price that enabled us to continue to sell at 6d. per lb. retail. We could not, however, have continued buying to sell at that price ",63
276,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"But the Treasurer has told us that the 123,000 tons of imported sugar cost on the average only a little over £43 per ton.",63
277,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"In quoting those figures the honourable member is dealing with a period covering two, seasons. The fact that the average cost over the whole period, which includes that during which our cheap sugar was being sold to the public at 3Jd. per lb., was £43 per head, shows that the balance of the sugar was bought at a much higher figure. Had we not been able to make an arrangement with the Australian grower, our public, instead of paying 6d. per lb. for sugar, would have had to pay for it what the w -'rid has been paying until recently, namely, from Is. to Is. 2d. per lb. It is only because of the arrangement we made with the Australian grower, and because we bought a considerable quantity of sugar before the market rose to the' point which it recently reached, that we could continue selling at 6d. per lb. As to the shortage of sugar, we had to choose between two alternatives. We had either to continue buying on a very high market, and thus secure for our public as much as it might require, or to wait until the marketshould drop. Had we continued to buy, we should have had to pay from £90 to £120 per ton for sugar, and as we believed that sooner or later the market would break, we thought that the right thing to do was to buy only just sufficient sugar to keep us going as it were; just enough to enable us to meet the reasonable demands of the public, putting up with any slight shortage that might occur rather than buy on the top of the market, and give the public a full supply at Is. per lb.",63
278,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I would not advise you to try that. Mr GREENE""-We should have had ta charge Is. per lb. had we continued to buy as the market for sugar was then. We had to choose between a shortage here for a time and buying on the top of the Sugar Purchase [18 NOVEMBER, 1920.] market. ""We thought it better to keep the public on a comparatively short ration of sugar until the market broke, and, as the result, we have'probably saved the countiy over £2,000,000. I think tSiat the little inconvenience that had to be suffered was worth that saving.",63
279,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,As k the mothers if it were a little inconvenience.,64
280,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"The public has suffered a considerable amount of inconvenience, but it was better to put up with it than to pay Is. per lb. for sugar; and, under the circumstances, the community has reason to be thankful that it has come out so well. We kept off the market as long as we could, and thus the public has been able to get sugar very cheaply compared with what people in other parts of the world have had to pay.",64
281,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"East Sydney) [10.1] There is always an interesting debate on the subject of sugar. For my part, I do not know why Australia does not produce enough sugar to satisfy its own needs. This Parliament has always shown itself willing to assist the sugar growers, knowing that the people require cheap sugar. During the past few months I have seen more of Queensland than at any other period of my life, and I know that, ahout Gympie and Maryborough, and in many other districts, there is plenty of land suitable for growing sugar. Tet, notwithstanding this fact, and an increase of £2 per ton in the price given for cane, the community is short of sugar after a bounteous season, and we have had to make up the deficiency by importing from Java and F i I do not know why Queenslanders, especially since there is such a scarcity of beet sugar in Europe-and I am told that it will take two or three years before a decent crop of beet can be grown-ha s not produced enough sugar to supply, not only the wants of Australia, but also to send abroad, and thus to help us out of our financial difficulties. The Treasurer, I understand, desires authority to obtain an overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank to cover the expense of importing sugar that is to come to Australia very shortly.",64
282,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"I want money to pay for the sugar that we are importing. [272] Bill. 6713 Without it, the public must go short of sugar. The condition of the sugar-growing industry is not relevant to the discussion of this Bill.",64
283,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Thos e who are watching the interests and welfare of the people ought to be in a position to elicit all the information they possibly can, so that they may be able to explain why the Government have been compelled to increase the price of sugar so enormously. One reason for the increase in the price of sugar is the fact that sugar-cane land in Queensland, which some years ago was valued at £10 per acre, is now said to be worth nearly £40 per acre. The industrialists of Australia are compelled to contribute to the profits derived by the owners of this land. I do not agree with those who contend that the Queensland growers propose to limit the area under sugar cane, holding, that the smaller the area under crop is the higher will be the price they secure for their cane. £ think better of the people of that State which some people are so fond of abusing, and I think that they could easily be induced to put more land under cultivation. If , as the result of this debate, ' we can instil into the minds of the people of Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales how absolutely necessary it is for them to increase the growth of sugar in order that we may not need to depend on importations of sugar grown by coloured labour in F i j i or grown in Java, it will be of considerable advantage to Australia. In some respects sugar is like coal. While the latj i . ter commodity is the keynote of all classes of manufacture, sugar is an absolute necessity in the preservation or manufacture of articles of food. In any case, the sugar cane growers should have nothing but admiration for the fine spirit which this Parliament has displayed in passing measures designed to assist their efforts, and it is not asking too much to expect them to open up additional areas for sugar-cane growing. One of the first tasks of this Parliament was the imposition of duties upon imported sugar for the purpose of encouraging its growth here, and I hope that the growers will utilize the golden opportunity now afforded to them to create an export trade 6714 Sugar Purchase [REPRESENTATIVES.] which would help to Temove some of the difficulties of exchange which are hampering our dealings with other parts of the world. I hope that this will be the last occasion on which it will he necessary for the Government to give security for an overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose of importing sugar from P i j i or Java.",64
284,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"Wide Bay) [10.13] - I would be lacking in my duty i i I did not cleaT up some of the statements made here to-night, otherwise I would not have risen to speak. The Minister (Mr Greene), in his control of the sugar business, has shown that he is possessed of good business knowledge. He has administered it in a highly satisfactory manner. fact, I do not know that any one could have done it better. However, statements are made in this House occasionally, and also find their way into Hansard, which the people who read them believe to he accurate if they are not corrected in Hansard. I do not contend that members say these things knowing that they are wrong, but some statements, made by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) were quite wrong."" For instance, he attributed the high cost of sugar in Queensland to the operations of the manufacturers as middlemen, whereas, as a matter of fact, when the present arrangement was made by the Federal Government to purchase the Queensland sugar from the Queensland Government, the grower, the manufacturer, and the worker were all brought together, and each set out the return to which he thought he was entitled.. The honourable, member would also have the public believe that the large factories are making all the profits; but that statement is also quite wrong. There are co-operative companies in operation in Queensland. Many of the sugar factories are simply central establishments owned by the surrounding growers, who have borrowed money from the State Government for the purpose of conducting them, pledging their plantations as security for the advances.",65
285,Mr GABB,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],65
286,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS REPEAL,"What the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) wishes to infer is that in Tasmania their - Bill. industries are conducted on co-operative lines and that in Queensland they are not. I beg to differ, because in Queensland the sugar industry is conducted on co-operative lines more than is the fruit growing and jam-making industries of Tasmania: In these circumstances, I do not think the sugar-growers in Queensland should be accused of not knowing their own business by those who cannot teach them. The shortage of sugar this season arose in consequence of drought conditions; and when we get back to normal seasons, I believe that, with the encouragement the Federal Government have given us, we shall be able to produce as much as we require in Australia. We have plenty In of land, but we want to be assured of a continuing profitable return, while competing with black labour productions from overseas. Had the Government given a higher price, I believe there would not have been any shortage. Authority is given in the Bill to borrow £1,000,000, and if the Government act wisely they will always hold six months' surplus supply of sugar on hand, because it is impossible to say what is going to happen in a country subject to cyclone, frosts, droughts^ and floods, which materially interfere with returns from the plantations. The business in Queensland is carried on by the sugar-growers and manufacturers on the best possible lines. Sugar is being refined as cheaply in Australia as in any part of the world, and that was shown in the report of the Royal Commission, which made a thorough investigation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment. INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS BILL .
