There are two issues I would like to raise alleged ‘children overboard' incident, this public opinion. The first relates to the decline growing politicisation of the Public Service. we heard the news last October that babies refugees that was trying to reach Australia. there. The Prime Minister was out there. The were belting this for all it was worth. It seemed ing, but we were told that it was by people least a little honour.

It polarised the nation and it tial murderers and those who keenly felt the This government chose to exploit the story. about the incident-the minister for immigration, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Prime Minister.

If my memory serves me correctly, early on which did question the authenticity of young children had been thrown overboard by made by people in this place who should have would do this sort of thing. Then, just on the media reporting the Prime Minister's address about the accuracy of the story.

It certainly was not inspiring the government did not believe it would get policies some time before, and most of what it government did a bit more in its second term.

In the months since the a long nice holiday: ministers were not seen, the government tried to get back to those dull old what the government intend to do to fill their seem to have much of a legislation program. for this year, I have never seen the parliament current agenda. But then, again, maybe of view because, as the member for Cook and after him, probably the less that members get him the better for him-not better for Australia in this debate today. Both are exemplified by the notorious attempt by the government to pervert in ministerial standards and the second to the I am sure all of us can recall our reaction when had been thrown overboard from a vessel carrying We were horrified. The defence minister was out minister for immigration was out there.
