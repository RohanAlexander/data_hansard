3,Mr KING OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTE E,No . The men now employed on railway construction in the Northern Territory are working r a Port on a line that was sanctioned by Parliament before the Committee was established.

6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTE E,"In today's Argus there is an account of the circumstances leading up to the arrangement between the Prime Minister and the PreThe miers for the postponement of the referenda, and it is there stated thatIn the meantime the Leader of the Opposition, Mr J. Cook, Sir William ""Irvine, and Mr Watt had consulted, and they entered most readily into the consideration of the matter. It is only fair to the Prime Minister and to myself to say' that during the whole, of these proceedings there was not at any time any consultation of any kind.",5
7,Dr CARTY SALMON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTE E,Does the right honourable member speak for ' the otlier honourable members who are mentioned ?,5
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTE E,"I speak for myself only. I wish to put the matter right as between the Prime Minister and myself. ACT. Mr HUGHES - I had not seen the statement until my attention was drawn to it by the right honourable member. There is no truth whatever in t . Apparently the writer of it placed in on juxtaposition the names of anumber of prominent men in the hope that some at least might have been concerned in this business, but they can all prove an alibi. WHEAT FREIGHTS.",5
9,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTE E,Has the Prime M in ister abandoned the arrangement for securing freight for farmers and shippers in favour of a scheme under which the Governments of the States will acquire and ship the wheat of Australia?,6
10,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTE E,"I am sorry that the deliberations of those considering this matter have been so prolonged. The commercial editor of the Argus this morning does us the justice to remark that at least it cannot be said that our deliberations were unduly hurried. The question bristles with difficulties with which we are making an honest attempt tp deal; A concrete proposal has been drawn up covering the matter referred to by my honourable friend, and the conference is to meet fchis morning as soon as the insatiable curiosity of honourable members in regard to this and other matters will permit me to attend ib. Directly a decision is come to I shall announce it to the House.

17,Mr TUDOR,RAILWAY FROM KATHERINE,"It is a pity that the honourable member for Grampians cannot address his question publicly to the honourable member for Henty.

The widow received two amounts, one of SA 13s., and another in August of £ 2 8s. The fact remains, however, that she has received only £7 in three months. EXPEDITIONA RY FOECES.

I was also told that the sorting of the English mails occupied the whole of the attention of the sorting staff, and that when they were disposed of the Egyptian mails were sorted. I asked that the . Egyptian mails should be sorted first, but was told that that course could not be followed, because it would interfere with business. Will the Postmaster-General give instructions that the sorting of Egyptian mails shall take precedence of the sorting of the English mails?",7

Mr KING O'MALLEY - Importe d timbers have been used on some temporary offices at the Victoria Barracks, and at the temporary hospital, Caulfield.

The Government assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or otherwise of the press reports referred to, which were not issued by Defence Department. 2.

When I was addressing myself to this proposal last night the honourable member for Swan asked me what was the agreement made with the Commonwealth. I have now before me a copy of the Northern Territory Acceptance Act to which, as a schedule, the agreement is attached.",10
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,I thought you said that the agreement was to build from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges first.  is in the agreement.,10
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I know what is in the agreement, but I thought you said differently. [5 NOVEMBER, 1915.] Springs Railway. 7291",10
54,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"If the Commonwealth, does not carry out the agreement would the honourable member for Grey be satisfied by South Australia taking back the Northern Territory? „  is that the. agreement made should be carried out by the Commonwealth Parliament. Section 14 of the Act provides in paragraph b that the Commonwealth shall "" construct or cause to be constructed a railway from Port Darwin, southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper,"" and it is set forth that that railway, with a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect therewith, is referred to in the Act as the "" Transcontinental railway."" Then paragraph d of the same section provides that the Commonwealth shall "" construct or cause to be constructed "" as part (No. 2). of the Transcontinental Railway, a line from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect with th© other part of th© Transcontinental Railway at a point on th© northern boundary of South Australia proper. Honourable members will admit ment, which, as I have said, forms the schedule of the Bill, the same words aro used exactly: and my complaint is that the agreement has not been carried out.",10
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I understand your point to be that the railway ought to go from the south to the north, whereas the of the agreement says that it shall go from the north southwards.  not say anything of the kind, but that the railway shall go from both north and south.",10
56,Mr MAHON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Does the agreement mention any particular time?  of a man who is in one's debt, and who has been treated kindly. It was understood by every man in the House that the railway would be constructed within a reasonable time, but it would appear as though the Minister were trying to evade this agreement. On the other hand, we all remember that the Government were given no peace until the other Transcontinental railway to Western Australia was taken in hand. It seems to me that the chief opposition to this proposal is coming from Western Australia, although, in the case of the railway to that State, 7292 Katherine River-Bitter there was only the promise of one or two prominent men that, in the event of Federation, the States would he thus linked up, while, in the case of the line now immediately under consideration, the promise is one made binding by Act of Parliament.  its share.  ing, but merely pointing out that in the present case the promise is even more binding than that of the line to Western Australia.  Waters Agreement.  Agreement was not entered into by the Commonwealth for charitable purposes.",10
57,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I must ask honourable members not to converse across the chamber.  very briefly why I advocate the construction of this line from the south as well as from the north. The Commonwealth already owns something like 376 miles of railway due north from Port Augusta, and by the end of this year we shall have taken over the running rights now being exercised by the State of South Australia. It might have been thought only reasonable that we should proceed with the work of construction so as to be able to feed our own railway. I am surprised at> the lack of sympathy on the part of the Minister for External Affairs, and I remind him that his attitude was quite different when the railway line to Western Australia was under consideration. If the extension be from the south to the north, it will add very considerably to the running powers that belong to the Commonwealth. A little while ago there was a suggestion that we ought to feed the Queensland lines, but, in my opinion, we ought to consider our own railways first. I challenge contradiction to the statement that if the line be constructed from the north to the south it will cost at least one-third per mile more than if it were constructed in the opposite direction.",11

It is proposed to open up the Barclay Tableland, but ther© will be no outlet for the produce, whereas if a railway line were built as I suggest, from the southward, it would become a very important factor in the supply of beef and mutton for th© people in the south.",11
61,Mr YATES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Every drover who comes down says that.,11
62,Mr MAHON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"They will tell the honourable member anything.  to know all about this matter. Apparently, he is unduly bitter towards this project, and towards the agreement with South Australia, but no one would have ranted louder than he had the agreement specified a line running towards Western Australia and steps were taken to stop th© construction of it. A railway running north from Oodnadatta will serve some of the finest country in Australia. This cannot 'be said of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway.",11
63,Sir JOHN FORREST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Where is that fine country 1  - acres of th© finest country in th© world stretching from the Macdonnell Ranges to the Barclay Tableland.,11

Th© Commonwealth is going to build the railway for which the honourable member is asking, and he will gain nothing by labouring th© matter.  right honourable gentleman proposed to do, because, unfortunately for him, we became possessed of the circulars which he sent to the Premier of Queensland. In those circulars there was no talk of building this line. In fact the right honourable gentleman admitted in that correspondence that, unless th© peopl© of Queensland agreed with him, he would be forced to carry out th© agreement with South Australia. He would be "" forced to carry it out""!",11

I do speak on this subject from a parochial point of view, or merely as a representative of South Australia. It has been that the construction of this railway will greatly assist national development, and if the amendment is agreed to, it will prove that the House, even at some distant date, is prepared to honour the original agreement. Th© point made by the honourable member for that the Minister has neglected his in not preparing for this work prior but to the other work being completed is a be strong one. The same point arises in regard to the east-west railway. In the course of twelve or eighteen months we shall have thousands of practical railway and a railway building plant idle, unless steps are taken to properly utilize them. The argument that the proper way to construct this particular railway is from south to north is irrefutable. adopting that plan it will not be necessary to send all the constructional material half way round Australia in order to it to where it is required.

The expenditure necessary to be incurred by Queensland to connect ber western border very small compared with the expenditure that is proposed by the Commonwealth Gois vernment; and, as I have already said, not only disappointed, but, I may add, prised that such an advantageous offer should not have been at once accepted. I can only advise you to again submit the matter, and ask for further consideration. The offer of the the Federal Government is one-sided, but still interests of Australia (which are our main Camooweal. consideration) have to be given prominence, and if the Northern Territory is to be opened up by railways in a few years, we must build from the Katherine southward to Newcastle Waters, and from Camooweal westward to Newcastle Waters.

As construction could proceed from both ends, it could be constructed in the shortest time- a consideration of great importance alike from the stand-point of defence and development. Nine witnesses were in favour of the construction of the railway by the Pellew Islands, on the route to the Victoria River country, but every one of the witnesses who knew anything about the country declared that the north-south line would be the most advantageous.

114,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Barrier) [2.24] - It is unfortunate from the point of view of the development of the Northern Territory that any proposed work there, the cost of which will exceed £20,000, must, first of all, be referred to the Public Works Committee. When the Public Works Committee Bill was introduced in this House by the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then Minister of Home Affairs, I inquired whether it would apply to Northern he was works, and his answer not quite certain, but thought that it would. I then pointed out that it would be unfortunate if it did, since it would mean unnecessary delay. It seems to me that works either in the Northern territory or in other of Australia will have to be delayed unless we are going to create another Works Committee. The task of inquiring into all these big works in the Northern Territory, as well as in all other parts of Australia, is too great for any is one Committee. I take it that the Minishas satisfied himself that it is necessary under the Act that this reference proshould be made. If the Act has been badly drawn, then the fault rests with I am why prepared to support the Government proposal, and shall be very glad if the Public Works Committee can speedily furnish a report, not only for the sake of the Territory itself, but in order with that the 600 men on the spot may added employment. The amendment raises a very serious question, and memwe should have a definite pronouncement as to the attitude of the Government towards it. The lowest possible estimate of the work covered by the amendment would Pubbe £1,500,000. Thus we find a private the member moving to refer to the Publie Works Committee a work whioh will involve an enormous expenditure. Where the Executive of this country come in? If the Act is so framed that any inprivate member of Parliament may, with the assistance of a majority of this House, send to the Public Works Committee any work that he proposes to suggest, then it seems to me that the Government occupies a very strange position. Any honourable member, with the support of a few on this side and the assistance of the Opposition, could send on any work to the Committee. As it is, I take it that the Government have inquired into this project, and have come down with a definite proposal to refer to the Committee the construction of the line from Katherine River to Bitter Springs, the estimated cost of which is £320,000. It is to be assumed that they feel they are in a position to incur that expenditure if the undertaking be approved by the Public Works Committee. I take it that the Treasurer, ing gone thoroughly into the matter, is convinced that the Government cannot afford to spend more than £320,000 on the proposed railway; but the honourable memberCtfor Grey asks us to refer to the Public Works Committee for inquiry a proposal for the expenditure of £1,500,000 on another work altogether.  inquiry.",16
115,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"A proposed work should not be referred to the Committee except on the understanding that, should the Committee report in favour of it, the Government will be able and willing to carry it out. Under any other circumstances, the Committee's inquiry would mean waste of time and loss of money. Do not the honourable members for Wakefield and Dampier, who have been Ministers of the Crown, agree with me in that contention ?",17
116,Mr GREGORY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,I think that the honourable member is wrong.,17
117,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,It would be competent for an honourable member to move to refer an alternative route to the Committee.,17
118,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The reference of an alternative rout© would be quit© proper. The Government have £320,000 to spend on a railway from Katherine River to Bitter Springs, and its officers Tecommend that a particular route be followed. If the Public Works Committee can show that the money could be spent to greater advantage by following another route, and reported to that effect, it would be for Parliament to choose between the two recommendations. «",17
119,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,I ask the honourable member to apply that reasoning to the proposal of the honourable member for Grey.,17
120,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"What the honourable member for Grey proposes is something quite different from the reference of an alternative route. His proposal, if adopted, might mean the expending of £1,500,000, although, apparently, the Government is not prepared to spend more than £320,000. It is the duty of a Treasurer, in making a financial statement, to tell Parliament for what works his Government can provide money. If an honourable member can move to increase a proposed expenditure Havfrom £320,000 to £1,500,000, he could move to increase it to £20,000,000. But we have the right to know whether, if the Committee should recommend the work referred to it, the Government would be prepared to find the money necessary to carry it out. The House should know that, the Committee having investigated a proposal with the ability and thoroughness with which its work is done, and reported in favour of it, the money for it would be forthcoming. Is the Government prepared to find £1,500,000 for the work which the honourable member for Grey desires to have carried out, should the Committee recommend it?",17
121,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Sa y £1,000,000. The country is very easy.",17
122,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The amount makes little difference to my argument; I am discussing a question of principle. For my purposes, the probable cost of the work that the honourable member for Grey proposes could be set down at £750,000. I was in the New South Wales Parliament for a number of years, and have been a member of this Parliament since its inception, and have studied a little the doings of other Parliaments; but I have never known an honourable member to move for the reference of a large work to a Public Works Committe© without the consent of the Ministry.",17
123,Mr YATES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"If the Minister accepts the amendment, will the honourable member support it?",17
124,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I shall have no objection to doing that; but I wish to know first what the position of the Minister is in regard to it. Should the Ministry accept the amendment, a precedent would be created, and in future it would be competent for any honourable member to do what the honourable member for Grey is trying to do. Thus the Opposition, with the help of one or two Government supporters, would be able to get any work referred to the Public Works Committee.",17

127,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I am not now discussing whether the line which the honourable member for Grey favours should or should not be made. My - contention, as a supporter of the Government, is that we should know its position in the matter. If the Minister simply says, "" We have no particular policy on this question. Having gone into the matter, we feel that all that we can afford to spend is £320,000, but if the House wants something more done, we are indifferent,"" we shall at least know the position. Before a precedent of great moment is created, we should be informed definitely of the atitude of the Government towards the amendment.",18

129,Mr THOMAS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I have not said that inconsistent with the Act , but I should like the honourable member to say whether it is not inconsistent with the theory responsible government.",18
130,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I intend to point out that it is not inconsistent with the theory of responsible government. The Public Works Committee created, not only to assist responsible Ministers, but also to form a medium through which information may come to Parliament and to individual members. It is the function of supplying informaonly tion that, in my opinion, gives the mittee its greatest value. The Commoncerned wealth has acquired a line of railway which only portions, one at the north end and the other at the south, have been constructed. Before the Public Committee was formed, Parliament deteracross mined to extend southwards, for about 60 miles, the northern portion of the line, and the Minister now asks us to refer the Committee a proposal to again extend it southwards for another 60 miles or so. The honourable member for Grey desires that the Committee shall be asked fco report to the House whether it would not be better in the interests of the Commonwealth to extend the southern end of the line northwards, or to make an extension simultaneously at both ends. That proposal is, to my mind, in conformitv with the letter and spirit of the Public Works Committee Act , and with the intention of its framers. Whatever the Committee may report, the responsibility for the action subsequently taken' will rest with the Government and the Parliament. It is constantly thrown in the teeth of South Australian representatives that in the matter of this transcontinental line we are actuated only by considerations of State interests. I take such remarks ip pcod part. My reply to them now is that whafc we ask for is merely an inquiry, so that the facts may be made known to Parliament. When that has been done Is'hall be prepared to accept the decision of Parliament, letting the matter be dealt with in the proper constitutional way. The completed portion of the line at the southern end has a length of about 400 miles, and stops short at Oodnadatta, where the land is inferior and the rainfall low. Beyond Oodnadatta, some 300 miles of poor country has to be bridged in order h the fco tap the Macdonnell Range country, the value of which is well known to all it is pastoralists. This country is infinitely superior from a pastoral point of view to any of that between Port Augusta and of Oodnadatta. To leave the line as it has stood for the past twenty years, is like leaving a bridge with a gap in midstream. I am convinced that the expenditure of £1,000,000 or £1,250,000 in the manner is proposed by the honourable member for ' Grey would produce an infinitely better return than will be obtained from the proposal of the Government. It has been said that on the Oodnadatta line fchere is one train a fortnight, which is true Comso far as the passenger traffic is con; but for weeks past there have been of from ten to thirteen special stock trains full y loaded with cattle every week. U n fortunately in dry seasons it is impossible Works to get stock from the Macdonnell Ranges the 300 miles of poor country that intervenes between them and Oodnadatta, but during the present year the existing to line has been of great service in conveying supplies of f at stock, not merely to the market of Adelaide, but also to that of Melbourne.",18
131,Mr HAMPSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Does the traffic pay for the axle grease used on the locomotives t,19
132,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"If the line is extended to the good country northwards of the present terminus it will not only continue to pay working expenses, but to return a substantial proportion of the interest on capital cost. We desire also that the Minister shall give instructions to the Public Works Committee to lay all the facts regarding the southern extension before the House at the earliest opportunity. Experts will tell us that the most economic way of developing country such as that between Oodnadatta and Darwin is to work from the south to the north, because, in the south, all the conditions are favourable for the cheap construction of the line, whereas at the northern end the climatic and other conditions make such work costly indeed. So far as the future returns of that line are concerned, I predict that for every one truckload of produce that will be carried over the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway there will be ten trucks carried over the Pine Creek-Oodnadatta line. That is knowledge which I have gained as a result of thirty-five years' experience, and the facts available in the South Australian Works Department will prove my statement to the hilt.",19
133,Mr SINCLAIR,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Are we not £75,000 a year on the existing line?",19
134,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"-Yes, and we shall continue to lose that amount until the line is - extended, so that the good country beyond the present terminus may become a contributor to the railway in good seasons, and an inestimable boon to the people of Australia in bad seasons by placing meat on the market at a time when, without railway communication, that country could not be travelled by stock without serious loss of condition.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - I think it does. The money question must also be considered. How are we to investigate at this stage an issue that will involve an expenditure of at least £3,000,000? The experience in connection with the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway has shown that the estimates of engineers and technical men are not always correct. I ask the honourable member for Grey to withdraw his amendment so that the Government may proceed at once with the short losing line to. Bitter Springs. Then when the House re-assembles, if honourable members from South Australia still feel particularly interested in the matter, they may bring it forward again and have it dealt with by the House.",19
137,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Flinders) [2.54] - A question arises as to whether, under the terms of the Public Works Committee Act, the amendment can be given effect to. Section 15 of the Act providesKo public work of any kind whatsoever . . . the estimated cost of csmpleting which exceeds twenty-five thousand pounds . . . shall be commenced unless sanctioned as in this section provided. In the first place, the proposed work is to be explained in the House of Representatives by the Minister, and it is provided The explanation shall comprise an estimate of the cost of the work when completed, together with such plans and specifications or other descriptions as the Minister deems proper, together with the prescribed reports on the probable cost of construction and maintenance, and estimates of the probable revenue (if any) to be derived therefrom, such estimates, plans, specifications, descriptions, and reports to be authenticated or verified in the prescribed manners Then the section saysUpon motion made in the usual manner by the Minister or by any member of the House of Kepresentatives the proposed work shall be referred to the Committee for their report thereon. The Act was drawn up by the Government of which I was a member, and was drafted on the lines of the Victorian Act, the operation of which is perfectly familiar to me. There is not the slightest doubt that the Act requires that no public work shall be undertaken until certain plans, specifications, estimates, and so forth, are brought before the House. The House must be in possession of estimates for the particular work which is to be submitted to the Oommittee. The amendment proposes to add to the reference another work entirely apart from that submitted by the Minister. Clearly no explanation is needed to convince honourable members that the provisions of section 15 will not have been complied with if the amendment is carried.  is part of one complete work to be undertaken in accordance with the Agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia. Sir ""WILLIAM IRVINE - That may be a strong argument on the merits of the proposal, and may be a reason why honourable members should assent to that work; but it is no argument on the question as to whether this amendment can be made. "" The proposed work "" in the meaning of section 15 is that of which the Minister has submitted plans, specifications, and estimates. Has the Minister given any such particulars in regard to the addition which is the subject of the amendment ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No .",19
138,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Then I submit, Mr Speaker, that section 15 does not authorize the honourable member for Grey to move such an amendment to the motion brought before the House by the Minister, and if the amendment is carried it will not confer one whit of authority on any person to carry out any inquiry in connection with it. [265]",20
139,Mr WISE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Gippsland) [2.56] - I agree with the argument of the honourable member for Flinders, but the question as to the Committee's powers has already been considered by Mr Speaker in connection with the Committee's report on the extension of the Small Arm3 Factory at Lithgow. When that report was before the House it was pointed out that one work had been referred to the Committee, which had reported on an entirely different proposition, and the Government were asking the House to agree to the new project. I raised an objection similar to that taken by the honourable member for Flinders, and Mr Speaker held that the point involved a matter of law, which was not for him to decide.",20
140,Mr TUDOR,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Yarra-Minister of' Trade and Customs) [2.57] - I am not sure that the honourable member for Gippsland is correct in stating that the original reference to the Committee of the proposed extension of the Small Arms Factory related only to Lithgow. But, apart from that, I doubt whether the amendment of the honourable member for Grey is in order, because it goes beyond the proposal brought before the House by the Minister. The Act requires that plans and specifications of every proposed work shall be brought before the House. I understand that the ex-Minister of Home Affairs was of the opinion that this railway extension could be carried out without reference to the Public Works Committee, and as this is the first railway to be constructed since the Committee has been in existence, pft ^ sibly the same mistake would have beea made by any other Minister. It was only after the matter was brought forward ' here that the point was raised as to whether the work should not be reported upon by the Public Works Committee, and that is why plans and other particulars were not ready for submission to the House. Those circumstances, however, do not permit of the moving of an amendment which would mean an investigation by the Committee of an entirely different project, which would probably cost three times as much as the proposal submitted by the Minister.",20
141,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"On the question of law, I do not propose to express an opinion; but there is another aspect of this question which has not been raised by. honourable members. Suppose some honourable member had moved an amendment that the Committee should inquire also into the strategic railway, which was the subject of discussion some months ago, and which might extend for 1,000 or 1,500 miles. Honourable members will realise that such an amendment would in troduce a question entirely distinct from that submitted to the House by the Minister. The motion before the House relates to a railway from Katherine River southwards to Bitter Springs. There is a definite proposal before the House, and the honourable member asks by the amendment that inquiry shall also be made into some other proposal. The difficulty I am in is that I do not see that there can be any limitation to amendments of the kind if I accept the amendment now proposed. It would be competent, if this amendment were accepted, for any honourable member to move any furthe r amendment-one , for example, to the effect that the Committee should also inquire into the feasibility, and so forth , of constructing a strategic railway between Port Augusta and Brisbane. Honourable members will see that, if I give way, I shall leave it open for any honourable member to propose that any line he desires shall be in quired into. TJnder the circumstances I rule that the amendment is not in order.",20
142,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Franklin) [3.0]. - The ruling just given alters the wholo position; and I suggesfcfchafcthe Government should withdraw this proposal in order that the House may have an opportunity fco express an opinion on the very important issuefchafchas been raised. - Of course, sir, we accept your ruling, which, however, has the effect of debarring honourable members from expressing an opinion as to where this railway shall be commenced, or whether it shall bo commenced from the north and south simultaneously. I think a very great mistake is being made in the manner in which we are dealing with this subject. There can be no questionfchafcthis is an instalment of the complete line, whatever route may be taken; and I point out fco the Government that fchey are simply continuing the costly failure that has attended the settlement and - development of th© Territory for about 100 years. It is just about fchafc length of time since the first settlement at Melville Island; and at intervals from then u n t i l the present time we have had the same disastrous failure as a result of attempting to develop the country from the tropical end. This has cost the Federation between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000, and it represents about the most ghastly failure in the whole history of British settlement. There are two or three pointsfchafcwe ought to consider. This National Parliament musfc be very careful, indeed, not to enter upon a policy of repudiation; and to my mind that is very much the direction in which we are trending. Ifc will be within the memory of honourable members that the present Treasurer and myself debated the question of taking over the Territory; in deed, we were accused by our opponents of "" stone-walling "" the proposal for two days and two nights. We certainly kept the discussion going; and our chief objection was that, under ""the then proposed Agreement, the Commonwealth was distinctly committed to continue the line from Port Darwin to Oodnadatta. There was not a member who did not recognise that that was the distinct Agreement on which we were entering; and Hansard will show that it took two days and two nights to impress this fact on the House. Wifch these facts before them, honourable members deliberately adopted the contract; and I then said whafc I say now, namely, fchafc having accepted the contract, I , for one, would be no party to any attempt at repudiation. All this makes it quite evidentfchafcfchequestion should be very seriously reconsidered. Despite what has been said, it is quite safe to conclude that it will cost afc least 33 per cent, more fco construct fchis line from the tropical end at Port Darwin than from the more temperafce part of South Australia.",21
143,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"And it will be of less benefit to Australia by a long way. Mr . MCWILLIAMS - U n d o u b t e d l y . The debate has shown, I think, that there is a large majority in the House in favour of some distinct policy being adopted in regard fco this railway, which represents a large and very important work. When the previous section was under consideration, I expressed the opinion that the only proper policy was to adopt a definite route as a whole, and to see that, every shilling expended was in the direction of completing that work. Honourable members who hold the same views as myself will have no option but to oppose this pro-, posal, unless the Government are prepared to reconsider the matter; and we do not desire to oppose it . One of the reasons I had for introducing a Bill for the creation of the Public Works Committee was the enormous area under our control. Very costly works are being proposed by Ministers on the advice of their departmental officials, and as to the merits of these works, three-fourths of the members generally are entirely ignorant of them. In the present case we know nothing of the country to be traversed-nothin g of the advantages or disadvantages of the rival routes-and it is only by means of a Committee obtaining reliable information on the spot, and focussing that information for .our benefit, that we can be put in a position to arrive at a proper conclusion. I venture to say that there is not one honourable member who would invest a £ 5 note in a work such as this on the information at our disposal. The Minister of Home Affairs would be the first to admit that he has no personal knowledge whatever of this work, but that he has simply to take the advice of his officers. Honourable members are not in a position to say whether this work, which means the development of the whole of the centre of Australia, is being started from the right or the wrong end, or whether there should be a start from each end simultaneously. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In time, when I get my digest, I shall be able to tell you.",21
144,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"E v e n the valuaable aid of the digest would not give the House the direct knowledge it ought to have. We are not playing marbles, but entering upon the construction of a railway of considerably over 1,000 miles in length, and a railway that is going to cost probably over £10,000,000. Honourable members will acknowledge that I have read every work on the subject that I could lay my hands on, and I am confident that the benefits of starting from the southern end would be infinitely greater than those received from a corresponding expenditure at the tropical end. This would mean starting in a temperate country, running, in a comparatively few miles, into what we know to be good and habitable areas. In the neighbourhood of Alice Springs and the Macdonnell Banges we are assured, from reports, that there is country with considerable possibilities, and we know that [265.1- 2 the rainfall and climate are good. There are areas of really good pastoral land, and, in addition, mineral resources which only require development. Do then let us be reasonable. The whole of the States are interested, because they have to find the money; and it is our duty to our constituents to see that that money is expended in the proper direction, and in the most profitable way. The amendment, which has been ruled out of order, simply asked us to enable the. Public Works Committee to obtain information which we ought to have, and without which it will be impossible to give anything like a reasonable verdict. We do not know whether, when we are spending this money, the line will be found to effect the proper junction at the southern end. I do not say that the work to the north should not be proceeded with, but I do submit that, before a shilling is spent, we should have the information that the amendment sought to make available. The House ought to have an opportunity to deal with this matter on ita merits. But , as it stands now, the forms of the Honse have prevented a majority from securing what they desire. I am convinced that if the amendment had been dealt with on its merits, it would have been carried by a large majority; and the Government should see that the will of the House prevails. Surely they will not permit a two weeks' technical objection to prevent a majority giving effect to their desires? In the absence of information, the House is not in a position to deal with the question on its merits. Then, as I said before, the attempts made during the last 100 years to develop the Territory from the north have practically failed, after an expenditure of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000, and overshadowing all is the fact that the honour of the House is involved in the contract. It is impossible for any one to read that contract or the debates on the question without recognising that we deliberately entered into an Agreement with South Australia-a n Agreement which I , at the time, thought stupendously foolish. We said that if South Australia would hand over the Territory to the Commonwealth, this railway from Port Darwin to Oodnadatta, as shown in the distinct terms of the contract read by the honourable member for Grey",22
145,Sir JOHN POBKEST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,It did not say a word about Oodnadatta.,22
146,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Clause 1, paragraph 6, of the contract, readsConstruct or cause to be constructed a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper.",23
147,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"It makes no mention of Oodnadatta. Mr M o WILLIAMS - P a r a g r a p h d of the same clause readsConstruct or cause to be constructed of the transcontinental railway a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway, to connect . with the other part of the transcontiThe nental railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper.",23
148,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,It might have been Hergott Springs. It was thought so at the time.,23
149,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"It was not. entered into a contract to construct from north to south and from south to north, and now we are giving effect to one part the contract and deliberately ignoring, not repudiating, the other. I appeal to clauses the Minister to retire his motion and bring it forward in such a form as to enable the House to have full and free discussion on the whole question of this route upon its merits, which, by the forms of the House, cannot be allowed today. It is too big and too costly a submay ject to be hampered by the forms of the House. We are pledged to South Austion tralia to carry out the work, but we not fulfillin g our contract. It is thing, sometimes, that States which have no direct interest in rival routes of way should have a voice upon them, cause they can decide the issue entirely on the merits of the respective cases sented. I hope that the Minister will that the House has the opportunity expressing a view on the whole subject; and, above all things, I hope that this National Parliament will not proceed with the work of developing the Noron thern Territory by a deliberate act of pudiation to one of the parties to the tract. Question resolved in the affirmative. KATHERINERIVER TO BITTER central SPRINGS RAILWAYBILL . Motion (by Mr KING agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill Act to provide for the construction of a way in the Northern Territory from the Katherine River to Bitter Springs, the appointment of officers, and the making of charges connection with sueh railway, and to amend section 2 of the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Act 1913. Bill presented by Mr KING OMALLEY , and read a first time. NA (No. 2). SECOND READING.",23
150,Mr TUDOR,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Yarra-Minister of as part Trade and Customs) [3.21] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. object of this Bill is to effect a number of technical amendments which the Commissioner of Taxatiou and his staff have found necessary in order to enable the Income Tax Assessment Act to work more smoothly. It was the intention of We the Prime Minister to explain these amendments, but at the present moment he is busily engaged with the representaof tives of the States in regard to the shipi f ment of wheat. Detailed explanation of of a Bill is not permissible on the second reading, but in order that honourable members may become acquainted with the various amendments proposed, I shall, with the permission of Mr Speaker, take them in order. Fuller explanation be given at the Committee stage. Clause 2 provides an amendment to sec14, and is designed to overcome a are decision of the Supreme Court of New a good South Wales in the case o l In re Chalmers, 1913, New South Wales L . R. a rail711, in which the Supreme Court of be that State held that the share is the source of a dividend, and that the share preis situated where the central control and see management of a company exists, so that of where a company was managed outside Australia, but carried on business in Australia, the dividend was not taxable, al(though derived from a company carrying business within the Commonwealth. reFor example, the dividends of a company conwhose head-quarters were outside Australia would not be liable to taxation. On the other hand the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has a considerable amount of business outside Australia; but as their office is in Australia, the income earned outside Australia would be liable O ' MALLEY ) to be taxed. The Government are not anxious to see the Colonial Sugar Refinfor an ing Company shif t their head-quarters railfrom Australia to some place outside, and thus exempt themselves from paying tax in on income earned by them inside the Commonwealth. The amendment will now make taxable so much of dividends from companies which carry on business in Australia as corresponds to the profits made by the companies in Australia.",23
151,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"In the case referred to, the Commissioner assigned so much for outside earnings, and so much for earnings derived inside Australia.",24
152,Mr TUDOR,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I understand that section 14 as it stands makes companies, whose head-quarters are in Australia, liable to pay income tax, even on earnings from outside Australia. This amendment will avoid it . The next amendment is also an amendment to section 14, paragraph 6. It has been claimed by some taxpayers that under the proviso to paragraph b the income of a company received before the commencement of the Act, that is, during the financial year ending 30th June, 1915, would not be taxable for the year ending 30th June, 1915. The proviso was in tended to' exempt reserve funds accumulated before the year to which the tax was to be applied, and this amendment will carry out the original intention, namely, to exempt reserve funds accumulated before the A ct came into operation. Clause 3 amends section 15. At present this section applies only where the agent actually makes the sale; but as there are many cases where the agent collects the orders, but does not complete the contract and make the sale, it is considered desirable that all these agents should be on the same footing. The proposed new section 17A is designed to meet the case of fire insurance companies not carrying on business directly in Australia, who, under treaty arrangements with other companies, undertake reinsurances of Australian risks. As these non-resident companies undoubtedly derive an income from Australia, it is considered that they should pay tax on that income. The proposed amendments a, b, c, d, and e to section 18 of the principal Act merely make it clear that the deductions must not be losses or outgoings from capital, and must be sums paid in Australia or in respect of companies carrying on operations in Australia. Amendment / , which proposes to add a new paragraph k to that section merely transfers the deduction in respect of children from section 19 to section 17, and also provides that the age of a child is to be ascertained at the beginning of the financial year. The proposed new subsection 2 will make it clear from which class of income the deductions are to be made. On that point I may say that I inquired of the gentleman in charge of the Department whether a taxpayer would be able to claim exemption in respect of a child who attained the age of sixteen in March this year. I was in formed-and this amendment will make the position clear-that as the tax is payable upon the income of last year, and as the child was under sixteen years at the start of the year, the exemption will apply to that child. Personally, I think it is a very fair exemption. The amendment to sub-section 6 of section 19 is proposed because it has been found that in the administration of this section the apportionment referred to in the proviso occasions numerous calculations, and hampers administration. To obviate these calculations the new proviso provides for a simpler method of calculating this class of deduction without any substantial loss of tax. Sub-section c in the principal Act is omitted, as it will be in cluded in section 18, and the omission of the word "" total "" is consequential upon the amendment of the proviso to paragraph' b. Under the existing Act, an absentee is only required to furnish a ret u r n when requested. By an amendment of section 28 he will be required to f u r nish returns annually, the same as other taxpayers. That is provided for in clause 7 of the amending Bill .",24
153,Mr FLEMING,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Peopl e livin g in the Old Country will be required to furnish regular returns of their income from this country ?,24
154,Mr TUDOR,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Yes . That point is made clear. It is necessary that such a person should make returns, just as the honourable member himself has to make a return.",24
155,Mr FLEMING,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Will the returns have to be made at the same time?,24
156,Mr TUDOR,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I have no doubt that the Department will be quite willing to meet the varying circumstances of each case, because, after all, these Departments are run not to injure any one, although those in authority must see that the Act is carried out properly. The absentee has no right to be placed in a different position from that occupied by the man on the spot.",24
157,Mr FLEMING,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,A good deal of discrimination will be necessary in order to prevent hardship.,24
158,Mr TUDOR,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I have no doubt discrimination will be used. A new sub-section is proposed to be added to section 46. If a person dies during the financial year, before furnishing a return for the previous year's income, it is doubtful under the A ct at present whether the executors are liable for tax on the income received by the person during the preceding year, and that amount of income would probably escape tax. posed new section will make the executors liable for tax on the income received in the preceding financial year by that person.",25
159,Mr GLYNN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Does that mean that if a man died in March last he would have to pay for the full year?,25
160,Mr TUDOR,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"No . The amendment only applies to a person dying before he makes his return for the previous year's income. A separate Bill will be introduced dealing with the rates of tax. Debate (on motion by Mr Glynn) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT.

The business that will occupy the attention of the House next week will include the completion of the measure just dealt with, and the War Loan Bill,"" together with the matter the Treasurer has in hand. It will also be necessary to introduce a measure for the purpose of withdrawing the w r it in connection with the referenda. That is all the business, so far as I am aware.",25
162,Mr CHARLTON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Hunter) [3.40] Some time back several honourable hers of the House, including myself, asked should be taken. the Minister representing the Minister Defence several questions in regard to treatment of the Australian wounded i hospital. I do not raise the question in any critical spirit, but in order that it benefit of that money. may be placed properly before the Dewant partment, some investigation be made, and something be done to remedy the condition of our wounded soldiers in hospital at the other side of the world. I desire to read a letter that I have received from a soldier unknown to me, from Ras-el-Sin, Alexandria, which shows that there is room for complaint, and that something should be done. This letter is as follows: Mr Charlton, M.H.E., Melbourne. The pro- Sir,-In reading a parliamentary report of 4th August, I noticed where you asked the Honourable the Minister for the Navy a question re wounded soldiers' pay, and, being myself personally concerned, I noticed the reply you got was not in accordance with facts. The wounded-as o sick-Australia n here, whilst in hospital, receives nothing, and the majority have not got the price of a daily paper. There is a non-commissioned officer comes round once a week, and you can order goods up to the value of 5s - good s which some of the soldiers say should be Bed Cross comforts. But the above sum is credited! against you, to be stopped at your final payment. That is the condition you can order under. If they are not Red Cross comforts, well, in this part of the world, we get none. Now, sir, I was wounded on the 3rd May. In hospital, on the 14th, I received 50 piastres (10s. 4d.). Discharged from hospital on 14th June, proceeded to Base, and on the 17th of the same month I was given 54 piastres (1 Is. Id.), and was told there was a boat leaving for the front on the following Saturday, and if I did not go by that boat I would be immediately arrested. I was prepared to go; but as 1 had not received any money since the 13th March, I thought it was not a fair go. I am now in hospital again, this time ill ; and while in hospital a private cannot get at draw, whilst an officer can draw his full amount. That is all I can tell you, as I will be going' back to the firing line in a day or so. You do not know me, but you can get a reference from Senator Lynch (Western Australia). I realise that the Defence Department has done much at this end to remedy this state of things, but it appears to me that we shall not make the position satisfactory until some one is appointed outside the military to attend to the wounded! soldiers in hospital and to look after their correspondence, and any cables memthat may be sent to them. Such a step A large amount of of money has been subscribed by residents the of Australia for the purpose of assisting n Australian soldiers, and something should now be done to see that the soldiers get the We do not to have it locked up and to be informed at the end of the war that hundreds of thousands of pounds are being stored away somewhere whilst the men - are now suffering, as they apparently I hope the Minister will make a note of what I have said, and Bee if something cannot be done to remedy sucb a state of affairs. I desire also to refer to a matter concerning the Newcastle Camp. Minister stated today that that Camp had been closed in consequence of measles. That is a very strange proceeding, seeing that at the Armidale Camp they have had considerably more measles than at Newcastle- ",25
163,Mr FLEMING,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"But ""measles"" may only be a new name for small-pox ",26
164,Mr CHARLTON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"No , it is not. know what I am speaking about. The Camp at Armidale was not quarantined, and the omcers had no right to quaranproposed tine the Camp at Newcastle as they did. The medical authority who has complete charge of the military in regard health matters, instead' of isolating the cases that occurred, quarantined the whole Camp. There was no small-pox whatwe ever anywhere near the Camp, and when ithe matter was ventilated a curious thing occurred. The soldiers complained bitharshly terly about being compelled to remain Camp unable to see their friends. On the following day the quarantine was rewill moved, and soldiers were allowed to go such communications. out and mix with the public; but the authorities would not allow anybody to enter the camp. It has now been cided that the camp shall be closed. would point out, however, that it serving a good purpose. It is an elemake mentary camp, all the men from which' have to go on to Liverpool, and those who have passed through it declare it to Australia. be 'one of the best in New South Wales. Men enlisting in the district naturally desire to pass through their probationaryarrangements course there, since they thus remain close touch with their friends, and be visited by them without difficulty. That is in itself a consideration which tends to help recruiting. The provision without damage to themselves. of camps close to centres of population induced many local men to enlist, although they would not think of doing so if had to go into camp at Liverpool, many miles away. I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to bring these two matters under the notice of his colleague the Minister of Defence.",26
165,Mr GROOM,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Darling Downs) [3.46]. - I ask the Minister of Trade and Cusare. toms to consider the desirableness of issuing to the local governing bodies of the towns in Queensland and New South Wales which are directly interested in the subject a copy of the book dealing The with Australia and the yellow fever, which has been issued by the Quarantine branch of his Department. In this book much valuable information has been collected which should be very helpful in finding a solution of the problem dealt with.",26
166,Mr FENTO N,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Maribyrnong) [3.48]. In introducing the Income Tax Assessment Bill this afternoon, the Minister of I Trade and Customs read what I took to be the interpretation of the Attorney General's Department of many of the amendments of the principal Aot. I should be glad if the honourable gentleman would cause copies of his to Bpeech to be forwarded to honourable members, so that they may be in a better position to deal with the subject when meet next week. Many of us have received letters from individuals and firms who seem to think that they are rather treated under the Act, and I am in inclined to believe that the information furnished by the Minister this afternoon prove valuable to us in dealing with",26
167,Mr KELLY,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Wentworth) [3.49] deAs the honourable member for Hunter I haB raised the question of the treatment is of returned soldiers, I should like to two suggestions to the Minister. The first of these is that venereal subjects should not be brought back to It is neither fair to themselves nor 'to the community that they should be brought back until cured, but for their comfort should in be made, in some better place than can Egypt, in the Eastern Mediterranean, until such time as they can be brought back with safety to the community and My second suggestion is that the Department might well follow - the example of Gertbey many in dealing with Boldiers who havs lost limbs. In Germany there has been established an institution, known as the Hindenburg Hospital, where soldiers who have lost limbs are supplied with artificial limbs which are specially suited to the occupations previously followed by them. This, I think is not only a fair thing to do for the men so returned, but is an excellent thing for the country as a whole. One of the troubles after' the war will be the immense number of men so situated for whom we shall have to do something in this direction.",26
168,Mr TUDOR,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.52] - I desire to inform the honourable member for Hunter that I have arranged to be supplied with the Eansard report of his remarks, which I shall forward immediately to the Minister of Defence. I shall certainly adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member for Darling Downs regarding the very excellent work, dealing with yellow fever, recently issued by the Department. The technical part of the work, dealing with the Steciomyia fasdata, was prepared by Mr Taylor, as a result of action taken by the honourable member when he held office. . I do not propose to scatter copies broadcast, but I shall certainly gee that the municipal authorities concerned are supplied. I shall also bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence the matters referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth. A suggestion was made recently that, instead of locating in the one State all returned soldiers suffering from venereal disease, the men should be distributed according to the States from which they originally came Some five or six months ago the Director of Quarantine. Dr Cumpston, drew my attention to a very excellent article in an American newspaper dealing with the supply of artificial limbs to German soldiers, and I forwarded it to the Defence Department in' order that it might consider the desirableness of making similar provision here. We shpuld try to make as happy as possible the lot of these men who have suffered for us, and I shall certainly bring the honourable member's suggestion before the Minister of Defence. In conclusion, I bave only to say, in reply to the honourable member for Maribyrnong, that I shall ask the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to supply copies of my speech on the Income Tax Assessment Bill-afte r the report has been examined by the omcers of the Attorney-General's Department-to such honourable members as may desire them. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.54 p.m.",27
