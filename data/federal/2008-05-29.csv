4,Ms NEAL,MAIN COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS,"Thank you for your assistance. The member much later in the debate interrupted another speaker and asked for some comments I had made to be withdrawn and I did not do so. I have had time to reflect on the incident and, though the comments were not completely accurate, I do unreservedly withdraw any remarks that may have caused offence to the member. NA Censure Motion",17
5,Dr NELSON,PRIME MINISTER,"by leave-I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister and his Government for deceiving Australians and letting them down over record high petrol prices by: (1) describing petrol prices at over $1.60 a litre as “a little problem” for Australian ers and giving up on them with his own damning admission that he had “done as much as we physically can to provide additional help to the family budget”; (2) grossly misleading Parliament and the Australian people on the contents of an ACCC report that the Government has used to defend its flawed Fuelwatch scheme; (3) ignoring the Prime Minister's own commitment to evidence-based policy making when he ignored the expert advice of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Resources and Energy, the Department of Finance and Deregulation and ----- the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research; (4) ignoring the advice of the Minister for Resources and Energy that Fuelwatch is anticompetitive and would hurt small business; (5) refusing to immediately lower petrol prices by cutting the 38 per cent fuel excise on petrol; (6) going to absurd lengths to put spin ahead of substance-risking higher prices, just to “appear” to be doing “something”; (7) pathetically claiming high petrol prices are a result of traffic jams across cities; and (8) treating the Australian people and this Parliament with arrogant contempt by refusing to guarantee that his fuel policies won't increase the cost of petrol as his own public servant experts fear. This censure is against the Prime Minister and is against his government because, in the space of six months, the Australian people have been severely let down. A week ago today the Prime Minister in Adelaide declared, ‘There is nothing more that we can physically do to provide additional support to the family budget.' We then had the extraordinary statement in this House earlier this week when the Treasurer of Australia, that nervous man who is desperately trying to fill the very large shoes of the member for Higgins, declared that Australians are happy. consumWe are now in the extraordinary situation also where one of the most senior and respected ministers of the government, the Minister for Resources and Energy, in a letter to his own Prime Minister and his own cabinet colleagues, has argued that FuelWatch will most hurt the people for whom it is allegedly intended and that is low-income families, particularly in areas like the outer suburbs of Western Sydney. He further argued that it would increase regulation on business, that it would be anticompetitive and that it would also importantly undermine the so-called government's reform credentials, whatever is left of them. Not only did we learn last night from Channel 9 and the highly respected political journalist Mr Laurie Oakes that the Minister for Resources and Energy wrote to his own Prime Minister and his own relevant ministers, including the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, saying that FuelWatch was actually going to hurt vulnerable low-income Australian families but also, confirmed by the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer at an extraordinary nine-minute press conference held last night at 6.30, we now know the content of that material from the four economic departments of the government is accurate. We are in a situation now where the Prime Minister of this country-having run around Australia last year as the Leader of the Opposition, picking up apples and bananas in fruit shops and supermarkets throughout the country, making Australians falsely believe that he would do something to bring grocery prices down, occasionally dropping into the family kitchen of an everyday Australian household and making them falsely believe he would be doing something about their cost of living pressures, he would help them with their rent and make sure their interest rates were going to be more affordable in some way, wandering past service stations and making the right kinds of noises on popular television, whether it was Sunrise or Today-made Australians believe that, if he became the Prime Minister of Australia, in some way petrol prices would come down. What has happened here is a great parody-a great summary-of what this Prime Minister and this government is about because, having under a false pretext gotten himself elected as the Prime Minister of Australia, he then turned around to his spin chants, who normally sit in here in the parliament, and said: ‘I have actually told tralians petrol is going to come down. What on earth am I going to do about it?' So he has gone to the book and said, ‘What do I do?' And what he has done is come up with this thing called FuelWatch. FuelWatch is nothing more than a fraud being perpetrated upon the most vulnerable Australians. That is not only the view of the opposition; it is the view of one of the government's most senior ministers, the Minister for Resources and Energy, but we also now know that it is the considered view of the four major economic departments in the government. What happened then was that the Prime key Minister said, ‘Well, I have come up with this stunt; I need to make Australians think that FuelWatch-watching petrol-is actually going to bring the price down.' He said to his advisers, ‘Well, I need some evidence to support it.' So he turned around to his own department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-and the Prime Minister himself has said ‘all of the Public Service departments need to come to the centre of government decision making'-and his own department said: ‘Well, Prime Minister, with FuelWatch there is actually no evidence that it is going to work. In fact, it is possible that it will increase the price of fuel.' So the Prime Minister's own department actually said that the ACCC modelling indicates a small overall price increase cannot be ruled out. In other words, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said, ‘We cannot guarantee that this will not increase the price of petrol; in fact, we think it will.' Then he went to the Department of Finance and Deregulation. That department said: ‘Well, in fact, it is likely to create a de facto floor price. It will increase the regulatory burden on business of over $20 million mera year.' So he went to the second pigeonhole to get a solution-the department of fiAus- nance-and they said that it will actually create a de facto floor price. In plain language, that means that the current lowest price for petrol will be higher than it is. So the second department said it is going to increase the price of petrol. He then went to Resources and Energy and, as we know from the Minister for Resources and Energy, that department said, ‘It is actually going to hurt the people who need the cheapest petrol.' And that is those people who were lining up on Tuesday night down the eastern seaboard of the country. Prime Minister, the people who are going to be hurt according to your own minister and your own departments are the people who are most vulnerable-the people who are most sensitive to the price of petrol-and they are the people who are capitalising on the cheapest price in the cycle on a Tuesday night. He then went to the industry department and that department, amongst other things, said: ‘It is actually going business. It is going to take independent retailers out of the sector. It would cost them an additional $4,000 a year.' So here we are with major oil giants effectively controlling much of the petrol retailing in this country, aided and abetted by Woolworths and Coles, and then we have got a significant and very important part of the sector-the independent small business part of it-and the government's own department is saying that it is going to increase the cost of business for them by $4,000 a year. So what does the Prime Minister do? He then goes to the ACCC report and selectively pulls out bits that he thinks are consistent with the stunt that he has already confected and then tries to tell Australians that watching the price of fuel is going to bring it down. The other very important thing is this: if the Prime Minister wants to listen to people, he should get out of his white car and go down on a Tuesday night to the queues of people lined up outside petrol stations trying to maximise the lowest price in the cycle and, firstly, he should ask them whether they think a cut in the excise of 5c a litre would actually help and, secondly, he should explain to them how FuelWatch is actually going to make prices cheaper-because it is not. The one thing that the Prime Minister would not guarantee was that the introduction of FuelWatch would not increase the price of petrol by a single cent. The RACV, which represents motorists in the state of Victoria, has as its slogan: ‘We are here for you.' They are there for you, but the Prime Minister of Australia is not. The RACV, in writing to me on 22 May this year, said: The RACV does not support the FuelWatch system in its current format as we believe Melbourne motorists would be denied access to weekly disto be bad for small counted fuel. It further said: The most recent report by the ACCC into petrol prices states that in Melbourne 65 per cent of petrol was sold on the four days when prices were at their lowest, whereas in Perth, where FuelWatch operates, 60 per cent of petrol was sold on the four days where prices were above the average weekly price cycle. The RACV, in quoting the ACCC report, further said that there is increased potential for anticompetitive effects in rural and regional areas due to the more concentrated nature of the market in these areas, the potential for reduction in the predictability of price cycles for consumers who have adapted to them, a significant dependence on the media if any of the proposed benefits are to be realised and the administration costs of such a scheme are likely to be large-all of which has now been confirmed by the four major economic departments that advise the government. It also said in conclusion that the RACV will continue to oppose the introduction of FuelWatch: ... as we consider Melbourne motorists will on average pay more for their fuel under this scheme. Similarly, the RAA, which represents motorists in South Australia, wrote to me several days ago. The letter states, in part: The RAA has long opposed the introduction of FuelWatch and continues to remain opposed, because we consider South Australian motorists will be no better off under the scheme and indeed may be distinctly disadvantaged. The letter then states: Please note the RAA has indicated that it is ing to change its position if the federal government or the ACCC can furnish the data that is to demonstrate that their concerns are unfounded. Pointedly, it concludes: However, no data has been provided. I suspect the data provided by the four key economic departments advising the government is quite to the contrary. But as to the bigger issue, even though the government describes $1.64 a litre for petrol as ‘a little problem', there is an even bigger problem now for Australians. This country deserves better than it is getting from this government. Australians have been let down. Australians have been deceived by the man who is now the Prime Minister of this country and the government that he leads. Every Australian should see the front page of today's Melbourne Age, which has the headline ‘Cabinet leak leaves Rudd petrol strategy in tatters'. It is not only the Rudd government's petrol strategy that is in tatters; it is the government itself. There are millions of Australians for whom this is not a game, for whom the government of this country is not about factional people fighting one another, for whom it is not about people getting into positions by virtue of fraudulent, misleading hopes held out to Australians. For millions of people in this country, it is about survival. It is about paying your mortgage. It is about trying to find the money for your rent. It is about deciding what food you can afford to buy this week. It is about meeting your credit card payments. It is about clothing your children. It is about being able to go about your business-to run a small family business, to survive on a farm. That is what it is about. I ask the Prime Minister: Prime Minister, how can Australians have trust in your government if your key ministers cannot trust one another, let alone their own departments? willHow can they further trust a government in which now the Prime Minister of that govsaid ernment himself cannot trust his own ministers and wilfully ignores the considered advice of his four key economic departments? These four departments-the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism and the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research-all had the opportunity to read the ACCC report. These are departments headed and populated not by fools. These are departments which are headed and populated by people who really understand economic argument. I say to the Prime Minister that there may not be a silver bullet in relation to petrol, but Australians deserve much better than a government that is firing blanks. We need a government in this country that is orderly, where ministers have confidence in one another, where they can have confidence in their Prime Minister and where they can have confidence in the advice that is given to them by their key government departments. We are now in a situation in Australia where the Prime Minister of the country-who is more concerned for his own image, his own popularity and currying favour with cheap headlines than actually making decisive decisions to deliver cheaper petrol-has chosen a stunt and then desperately distorted the advice from the ACCC to find the advice which actually suits the stunt of the day, as evidenced by the Australian newspaper, and ignored the advice of the four key economic departments. This is the Prime Minister who goes to one audience and says one thing and then goes to another and says something else. This is the same Prime Minister who said he would be evidence based. This is the same Prime Minister who said that he would bring the government departments to the centre of the policy-setting agenda. On 29 November last year he said: The driving agenda for Commonwealth-State relations is located within both the Prime Minister's portfolio and the Treasury portfolioand that government departments would be brought to the centre of government decision making.",17

7,Dr NELSON,PRIME MINISTER,"In one sense, it is a joke, but I say to Australians-to those of us who have mortgages, who have car loans, who have petrol that we have to buy to put in them, who have groceries that have to be bought, who have kids that need clothes, who are trying to put a roof over their heads-as busy as they are: have a look at the pathetic nine-minute press conference from the Treasurer last night. Australians have to trust and have faith in their government and their ministers. We are in a situation where we have a stunt driven Prime Minister who ignores the advice of the key government departments, a nervous Treasurer who is simply not across his brief, and ministers who will not trust one another-let alone their own departments. We are in a situation where this country deserves better. With petrol at $1.60 a litre and rising, Prime Minister: cut the excise; pull no more stunts-we need real leadership, we need decisive action. We will not allow everyday Australians in particular to be punished by this stunt driven government, and we will oppose FuelWatch.",21
8,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded? Mr Turnbull-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,21
9,Mr RUDD,PRIME MINISTER,I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House censures the Leader of the Opposition for: (1) his failure to stand up for the interests of Australian motorists and consumers; (2) capitulating to the interests of big oil companies; (3) failing to put forward fully costed budget proposals; and (4) continuing the practice of economic irresponsibility.” Mr Robert interjecting,21
10,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The member for Fadden is warned.,21
11,Mr RUDD,PRIME MINISTER,"What we have today on the part of the Liberal Party is something very straightforward and very simple-two propositions: the absolute failure to stand up for the interests of Australian motorists and, secondly, the absolute capitulation of the Liberal Party to the interests of big oil. This is what it is all about. For 12 years in office, those opposite had an opportunity to stand up for the interests of Australian motorists. They had an opportunity to stand up against the interests of big oil. They had an opportunity to do something about the structure of the Australian petroleum industry. They had an opportunity to deliver a decent outcome for Australian motorists, and they have failed to do so-after 12 years. Secondly, in the course of the last six months what they have concluded is that all problems associated with oil and petrol prices in this country uniquely arisen as a result of the last six months that we have been in office, as opposed to the 12 years they were in office. The reality is that we are dealing, right across the world, with governments which are challenged with the problem of global oil prices. Global oil prices have risen, and risen extensively. Every government in the world is trying to deal right now with the flowthrough consequences to their consumers. This is a massive challenge. We have had oil price riots in Indonesia. We have also had protests throughout the United Kingdom. We have had statements in Canada about the impact it has had on Canadian motorists. This is a factor which is occurring right across the world and, therefore, we are faced with very simple alternatives: do you deal with this responsibly and intelligently in a long-term fashion, or do you simply, in your first budget reply, reach up to the old cookie jar and say, ‘Here is a bucket of money we can pull down to buy a few cheap votes'? That is exactly what those opposite have sought to do. When you look across the country and try to find any substantive support for those opposite in their proposal through the budget reply, it is very difficult to find. The core challenge that we have in this debate is whether you are going to take a decision on behalf of the interests of motorists or whether you are going to tap the mat and simply concede the ground to the interests of big oil. What we have had on the part of those opposite is something pretty clear. Their argument, prima facie, in this censure motion is this: every minister in the government should simply blindly follow every piece of departmental advice that they get. That is the proposition. That is the core proposition being advanced. The model of Westminster which those opposite are advancing is this: whenever a public servant have comes up to you with a piece of advice, you are duty bound to implement that-lock, stock and barrel. That is the view which those opposite have. In other words, as members of the executive, as ministers of the cabinet and as members of the government, your job is simply to be here as puppets on a string-with a public servant here and, in the case of their most recent response to our policy, the big oil companies over there, pulling the other strings. In other words, there is no independent capacity for making a decision. We actually take a different view. In the Westminster model, when departments put forward, as they should, their own comments and views in terms of coordination comments, that is helpful to inform the overall public policy debate. But are those opposite who have previously been ministers or cabinet ministers saying to me that they have always responded, to the letter, to every piece of advice in the coordination comments and every piece of advice that they have received from their department? Mr Morrison interjecting",21
12,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Cook is warned!,22
13,Mr RUDD,PRIME MINISTER,"My point is: are those who have been ministers-including the minister who was formerly responsible for Work Choices, ministers responsible for education, ministers responsible for defence, ministers responsible for every portfolio in the government-seriously saying to us that every time the department provided a piece of advice this was therefore their bounden duty, and it would lead to a collapse of the Westminster system if the minister said, ‘Actually, I have a different point of view'? In fact, the reverse model of government, which those opposite are advancing, is this: the responsibility of ministers is to stand up here simply as the mouthpiece for government departments, simply as the mouthpiece for public servants. This government has a different view: not only do we welcome advice from public servants but we will engage in debate with the Public Service. We will not always agree with the Public Service and, as I have said repeatedly, we will take advice from beyond the Public Service. In terms of the advice that is available to government on this matter, we go back to this weighty tome delivered by the ACCC. The ACCC says, on page 247 of the document: The main finding from this econometric analysis is that the average of the price margin reduced by a statistically significant amount for Perth relative to the eastern capitals in the time since the duction of FuelWatch. The relevant weekly average price margin was around 1.9 cpl less on average for the period from January 2001 to June 2007 than for the period from August 1998 to December 2000. This is econometric analysis provided by the ACCC. The member for Higgins, the former Treasurer, who has not graced the chamber yet, said that this outfit-the ACCC, headed by Graeme Samuel, appointed by the previous government-was in fact the most competent to make analysis on these matters. The former Treasurer, who was adulated yesterday by the current Leader of the Opposition as the bee's knees of economic policy, stated publicly at the time this report was commissioned that his view was that the ACCC was the most competent body to examine these matters. That is the first proposition. The second proposition is this: this ‘competent body', so named by the former Treasurer, Mr Costello, produces its report, which contains this econometric analysis and contains that information in the conclusion. Then those opposite are saying: ‘This is the authoritative body. This is the responsible report. Here is the evidence it contains. And you, the government, should ignore it.' That is essentially the proposition of those opposite. Therefore, the argument in public policy development is: as ministers of the government you are therefore bound and obligated to ensure that you take every single piece of Public Service advice and ignore every other piece of advice which exists and when there is a conflict of advice, say, ‘I have got to stick to what one particular department may say.' We have a distinctly different view. We welcome the contribution of the Public Service to the debate. The contribution of the Public Service is absolutely critical. What we have said to public servants since forming a intro- government-and we have not changed any departmental heads-is that we do not mind if you contest our views. We welcome a debate; we welcome an argument; we welcome a discussion, in contrast to those opposite who, when they went in, had a quite different view. Remember the debate with Mick Keelty over the question of al-Qaeda and the question about what happened at the train station in Madrid? What did Mr Downer say in response to Mick Keelty when he offered a contrary view to the government? What did he say to him? Downer said, ‘I think that he is just expressing a view that reflects a lot of the propaganda we are getting from alQaeda.' That is the view which you took to your public officials when it came to any public servant who had a contrary view to the policy decisions of the government-in other words, to attack them, to ridicule them and, even worse in this particular statement by the former foreign minister, say that they were acting in cahoots with terrorist organisations. We have a different view of public policy. We take our advice from the Public Service and from agencies such as the ACCC, which exists within the Treasurer's portfolio. We take advice from a range of sources and we make a decision. The core argument which has been put forward here is that, because individual government departments had a different view from the decision that was taken by the government, there is something inherently wrong in that as a model for public policy decision making. That of itself is a fraudulent proposition. That deals with the process matters. If you go to the substance of the matters which are being advanced by those opposite in this debate, it goes down to the question of whether in fact the FuelWatch scheme is capable of providing a useful guide to prices in the future. Again I go back to the substance of the econometric analysis and its conclusion about 1.9c a litre-and that is contained on page 247. Therefore, based on that, we have also had subsequent statements by the chairman of the ACCC who, I am advised, again today on national radio has confirmed that the advice is robust and that it is the econometric analysis which is available, and he is prepared to state his support for FuelWatch on that basis. So you have the competition watchdog up there saying that this is the best thing for motorists. You have the substance of the econometric analysis saying the same thing. On top of that you have a number of motoring organisations across the country saying the same thing. But those opposite are saying that their responsibility to simply be there at the beck and call of the large oil companies. Let us go to the second proposition which is contained in the substance of this debate: the impost on business. On the question of the impost on business, which is referred to in one of the other sets of coordination comments referred to in the media today, there is reference to that possible impost on business. There are two points to make about this. Currently, petrol station owners across the country, by virtue of the arrangements which many of them have with the price collection data systems which exist often in conjunction with the larger petrol companies, are themselves often paying fees to that data collection company. That is the first point. There is already, if you like, a compliance cost to those individual service stations operators in terms of their current arrangements. The second point is this: when the cabinet considered this matter its decision was that businesses would not have a net cost disadvantage to themselves in the implementation of this regime. This is a core element of cabinet's decision on the day, entirely mindful of the advice which was coming forward about the possible impact on small businesses, entirely mindful of the costs currently being borne by small businesses in the implementation of current arrangements and entirely mindful that government would not allow any of those small businesses and service station operators in any way to be financially penalised by the arrangements which were going to be introduced by the government. That goes to the two core propositions which are being advanced. Then we come to the other one which is advanced by the opposition, I presume, as its most recent element of policy on this, which is that you can have a notification system but there is no requirement for the price to be is held the following day. Has the Leader of the Opposition thought this through? Have you thought through how this would work in practice? You would have a system whereby mum and dad sitting in their house, say, in a suburb in Melbourne, would go onto FuelWatch and see at 8 am on a given morning, when they were about to take off and take the kids to school, that service stations had notified at that particular time of day that their price was X. They jump in the car, drive to the service station and find the price has changed. They have spent 20 minutes driving to the service station thinking that it is a place where they were going to get a cheaper price, and in fact it has changed. That is the model which you have advanced. Have you thought it through in terms of what happens to consumers on the ground? I do not think that the opposition has thought this through at all. Then you go to the absolute absence of any policy on the part of those opposite. As of yesterday, let us go to the core elements of their position on FuelWatch. You had a WA Liberal senator out there yesterday saying that she thought it was a fantastic thing-and I do not know what you have done with her overnight but I presume that she has been put in the can. Then on top of that you have the position on the part of the member for Wentworth saying that he supports part of our proposition, not all of it. He opposes but is not necessarily not supporting the arrangement. That is his position. The Leader of the Opposition I notice for the first time today actually said that the Liberal Party is voting against this. Here we are with a policy introduced and made public by the Assistant Treasurer on 15 April and here we are at the end of May and finally we discover the resolve to take a position. You have had no position consistently on FuelWatch and no position consistently on excise, where the shadow Treasurer says that he is not going to implement it anyway when he replaces the Leader of the Opposition in that position. And beyond that again there is a model of Public Service management which says that your job as ministers is to blindly take the advice of any public servant who comes up to you with a piece of advice, as opposed to exercising the discretion which you have as ministers. This government intends to govern differently for Australia's interests and the interests of motorists. We will stand up for the interests of Australian motorists. We will not stand idly by while those opposite are happy to simply act in the interests of big oil companies. We stand up for the consumer. We stand up for the motorist and we will resolutely maintain our position in support of their interests. (Time expired) Debate interrupted. NA",22
14,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery the Secretary of State for Defence from the United Kingdom, the Right Hon. Des Browne. On behalf of the House I wish him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Censure Motion Debate resumed.",25
15,Mr TURNBULL,PRIME MINISTER,"Nothing better illustrates the shamelessness of this Prime Minister than the remarks we have just endured. Here is a man who says, ‘FuelWatch is designed to take on big oil.' Of course, while the Leader of the Opposition was focusing on what matters most, the price of petrol paid for by motorists at the bowser, what did we hear from Lord Albanese opposite? ‘Populist nonsense,' he said. Really! He should be with the visiting Secretary of State in the UK in the House of Lords. He is wasted here in the House of Representatives. ‘Populist nonsense,' says his lordship. Let me tell his lordship, it is not populist nonsense to talk about the price of petrol that people are paying. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing orders people must be referred to by their correct name. I will not cop being called an elitist by Malcolm Turnbull!",25
16,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Wentworth will refer to members by their titles in this place.,25
17,Mr TURNBULL,PRIME MINISTER,"That is right; absolutely! Any peer in this House has to be referred to by his ministry or his constituency and not his noble title, however recently acquired. What we have is a plan that has been opposed by every single expert department in this government. Each and every one of them giving fearless, independent advice to the government has said that FuelWatch will reduce competition and it will put prices up. In other words, the entire expertise of the Commonwealth Public independent, expert and informedsupported the criticism of the member for Batman, the Minister for Resources and Energy, when he condemned this plan. So why is it being proceeded with? What is the argument? The only case-the only justification-for FuelWatch that the government could make, the only argument for this extraordinary exercise in price fixing, this extraordinary exercise in market manipulation, could be that it will reduce petrol prices. But will it reduce petrol prices? We know what the departments say; they say that it will put them up. We know what the member for Batman said; he said that it will put them up. What did the Treasurer say? Karl Stefanovic asked: A guarantee from you, if you don't mind this morning, FuelWatch will categorically lead to lower fuel prices? The Treasurer: I can't give that guarantee. That's a silly guarantee. I am amazed that he did not throw in ‘populist nonsense' but then he is probably only a baronet; he has not got into the peerage yet. And then, look at the shamelessness that goes right through this government-their preparedness to look the people of Australia in the eye and say that black is white-to say the exact reverse of the truth. On 16 April the Assistant Treasurer wrote a letter to the Leader of the Opposition, and he said: There is simply no independent analysis that has reached the conclusion that there is any upward pressure on petrol prices through FuelWatch. No independent analysis other than the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. Weren't they independent? Was the Assistant Treasurer telling the truth when he wrote to the Leader of the Opposition? Clearly not. The Service- Assistant Treasurer has written to the Leader of the Opposition and told a clear falsehood that has now been found out. He said that there is ‘no independent analysis' and in fact there was a truckload of it and the Leader of the Opposition has been misled. One of the most remarkable efforts in spin and shamelessness that we have seen here was the claim from the Prime Minister that this measure was designed to take on big oil. Oh, yeah! He is a real champion for the battler is the Prime Minister. An opposition member-He's more a champion for the butler!",25
18,Mr TURNBULL,PRIME MINISTER,"That's right. He's a champion for the butler! Let us have a look at what big oil says. Michael Luscombe is the CEO of Woolworths. That is a big oil retailer. Remember, chief executives of public listed companies are under enormous legal regulation about what they say about the affairs of their companies. If they say things that are wrong the consequences are hugepenal, incredibly damaging to them, their companies and their reputations. So they choose their words very carefully, much more carefully than the Prime Minister chooses his. This is what Mr Luscombe said: Look, we provided the government with some information that showed quite frankly the inability to actually match the lowest price in the market place in Western Australia during the day has meant that our margins in Western Australia are stronger than most, if not all, other states. So, thanks to FuelWatch, Woolworths make more money in Western Australia than in any other state. Mr Bowen interjecting",26
19,Mr TURNBULL,PRIME MINISTER,"Chris Bowen says that if you believe that you will believe anything. That is charming! The member for Prospect is accusing the chief executive of Woolworths of lying. That is the level of desperation; he will say anything. I have quoted what he said. The government will say anything. Day after day we have had this report from the ACCC misrepresented by this government. Yesterday I gave the Prime Minister the opportunity to highlight the passages that recommended the introduction of FuelWatch. There are none. He froze. He was not able to do anything because he knew that on pages 17 and 18, right at the beginning-he did not have to get into the depth; he could just read the executive summaryall that the ACCC said was that there are big issues surrounding FuelWatch, big issues about prices and about competition and that a great deal more detailed assessment has to be done before a government could confidently embark upon it. That assessment has not been done. The only assessment that has been done by the government, by its own departments-the departments which the Prime Minister said he would put front and centre in his new style government; he said he would take notice of public servants, give them credibility and listen to their viewswas to conclude that FuelWatch was a dud. As the member for Batman said, in words that were so heartfelt, this will punish people on lower incomes, people who need to buy petrol at the lowest price. Remember that the member for Batman comes from an old Labor family. I remember his father, Jack Ferguson. He was a good, old trade unionist, Labor politician and Deputy Premier of New South Wales, and he was full of very common sense wisdom. Some of that wisdom is in his son Martin. He knew that this ambitious, arrogant Assistant Treasurer, so keen to get into the cabinet, so keen to run over the top of his colleagues, was going to trample not just on the integrity of the Public Service, not just on his colleagues, but on the interests of the people he represents. So when Martin Ferguson, born in the western suburbs of Sydney, representing a Melbourne seat, writes to the member for Prospect and says, ‘This will hurt the people of Western Sydney the most,' he is saying-and he did not need put that in the letter because it is implicit-‘Western Sydney are the people you represent, you dope.' That is what he is saying, and that is what the member for Prospect has forgotten. The ACCC has done a so-called econometric analysis. It has been done by an economist called Stephen King. We met with him last night, as we did with Mr Samuel and Mr Cassidy, the chief executive. The ACCC does not argue for the adoption of FuelWatch in this report. That much is plain. Subsequently, it is true that Mr Samuel has been rather more supportive since December, and Mr Ferguson was very critical about that in his letter. But the fact is that not even Mr Samuel is prepared to say that Fuel Watch will result in lower prices. The most that Mr King, the economist, could say was that, on their analysis, they felt that prices in Perth would have been 0.7 of a cent lower were it not for FuelWatch. That is on their analysis. Their analysis has not been published, not been analysed by others and not been peer reviewed, and nobody has been able to assess it. It has not been published in the report-and we all know that different analyses can come up with different results. There are serious flaws in the analysis which the ACCC acknowledges. For example, it compares prices and calculates the average price by looking at the prices charged by every petrol station and then averaging that over the number of petrol stations. Of course, nobody pays the average petrol price, as my colleague the member for Cowper very wisely observed-nobody gets the average rainfall either. The real issue with averages is: what is the distribution? What is the spread between the lowest and the highest price? The member for Batman was smart enough to work this out. Even if the average is the same between one market and another, if the distribution around that average-the range from the lowest to the highest-is greater, it means that, for those people who are really focused on saving a few cents a litre, there is more opportunity for them to get that lowest price. And, inevitably, a price-fixing mechanism like this will compress the range of prices. That is completely overlooked in the analysis. The other factor is that a price that eraged over the number of petrol stations is meaningless because petrol stations do not all sell the same amount of petrol. The only average that matters is volumetric, and the ACCC say, ‘We don't know that data; we can only work with what we've got.' Just because their data is the best they have got does not mean it is any good. This is a government of shameless spin. I have often wondered about the difference between the Prime Minister and his predecessor but one, Mr Latham. I have realised today what it is: the only difference is that this leader of the Labor Party got found out after the election.",27

23,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Boothby and the member for Stirling!,28
24,Mr BOWEN,PRIME MINISTER,"On 24 November, the Australian people elected a government which did not believe that they had never been better off and which asked them to do something about cost-of-living pressures. The Australian people elected a government to take action on fuel prices. They did not elect a government to sit in Canberra and be cloistered from the real world like you had become after 11 years. They elected a government to hold retailers to account and to give motorists a fair go. That is what hapis avpened on 24 November, and we know you are having trouble coming to terms with itbut that is the reality, and it will continue to be so. The opposition is talking about process. Let us have a little talk about process. Let us have a talk about the cabinet process. Let us have a talk about a robust cabinet debate where views get tested. Let us talk about a robust cabinet debate where people's analysis is put to a rigorous test. And let us talk about when that does not happen. Let us talk about when you take a $10 billion water plan and do not put it to cabinet. You will not find any coordination comments on a $10 billion water plan, because it did not even go to cabinet. Let us talk about what the coordination comments from cabinet would look like on a little policy to spend $2 billion a year cutting petrol tax with no offsetting savings. Let us have a talk about what the Treasury, what the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and what the Department of Finance and Deregulation would think about that. Let us have a talk about real rigour real process. We will not go around the cabinet process-we have a debate in cabinet and views are tested. What happened in this process? I brought forward a policy proposalMr Keenan interjecting",28
25,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Stirling!,29
26,Mr BOWEN,PRIME MINISTER,on the advice of the ACCC. The ACCC's views were tested. The Chairman of the ACCC came to the Expenditure Review Committee of the cabinet. The petrol commissioner came to the Expenditure Review Committee of the cabinet. Mr Keenan interjecting,29
27,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Stirling is warned.,29
28,Mr BOWEN,PRIME MINISTER,"One of the most respected competition economists in the country, Professor Stephen King, came to the Expenditure Review Committee of the cabinet, and the views of departments were put to themand they satisfied those concerns. When you look at the concerns of some of the departments, you will see they said, ‘We think that more work needs to be done on and more rigour needs to be put into the initial ACCC report,' and the ACCC agreed and did that further work, and it came up as being robust. We were elected to make a difference. We were elected to make the tough decisions. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet did not appear on a ballot paper on 24 November. The department of finance did not appear on a ballot paper on 24 November. An Australian Labor Party which believed in making a difference for the Australian people appeared on a ballot paper on 24 November. We said when we announced FuelWatch that this would be controversial. We said when we announced FuelWatch that this would draw criticism. But we said, ‘This is a and bold step, and we do not walk away from tough decisions; we do not walk away from bold decisions.' We knew that vested interests would rail against FuelWatch. We knew that people whose business was to share information on a secretive website would rail against FuelWatch. What we did not expect was that the opposition would be brought into their arguments hook, line and sinker. We do not outsource our policy development to people with a vested interest. If you choose to, that is your interest. If you choose to, that is your right. We will never outsource our policy development to people with vested interests. We, on the other hand, give the ACCC some teeth. We, on the other hand, went to the election with a policy of saying that the ACCC is the people's watchdog. The ACCC was neutered by the Howard government. The ACCC has asked for increased powers, and those were denied to them by the honourable members who sat opposite. The ACCC begged for increased powers and begged for the law to be improved. The opposition when in government would not do it, and we are doing it. We appointed a petrol commissioner to hold oil companies to account and to ensure transparency in the marketplace. We then said to the ACCC and to the petrol commissioner, ‘What more powers do you need?' The ACCC said, ‘We are very concerned about the way the fuel market operates. We are very concerned that there is a situation in place which is conducive to anticompetitive coordination. We are very concerned that there is a website on which retailers are sharing information and the motorist is locked out.' The ACCC said, We want to do something about that, and we think FuelWatch is the right answer.' And what is the opposition's response? To say no to the regulator, to say no to the petrol commissioner-to neuter the people's watchdog. That is what they do and, and I suspect that is why they are sitting over there. They are sitting over there because they sat in Canberra and they lost touch with the Australian people-something we will not do. They did not go around and hold cabinet meetings in Penrith to hear about the cost-of4pm, living pressures. They did not go around and hold cabinet meetings in Mackay to hear about the cost-of-living pressures, because they were out of touch. Well we are not and we never will be! We know what concerns the Australian people and we will always consider any policy proposal which helps them. We will put it through a rigorous analysis and we will not skirt around the cabinet process. We will not say, ‘This is a $10 billion plan, but you can't tell Treasury and we won't take it to cabinet.' We will not say, ‘We'll just secretly work this up in the Prime Minister's office.' We will go through the process, but at the end of make the decisions. We will decide, based on the evidence and based on what the Australian people tell us is concerning them, what the appropriate policy response is. They say, ‘Ignore the ACCC, ignore the Australian people.' But we say, ‘No, we have a different approach.' We hear a lot from the Leader of the Opposition, a lot of crocodile tears about real people. We heard it the other day. The Leader of the Opposition loves the fuel price cycle. Based on his comments, he loves the fact that fuel prices can spike on a Thursday or a Friday before a long weekend or a normal weekend and the Australian people have no notice. I am the member of the government who, on behalf of the government, gets the emails on petrol prices. I am the member of the government who responds to the concerns of the Australian people, and I can tell says: you what the real people think about your plans. Let me share a few with the House. Listen to this, from a real person from the electorate of Cunningham: I'm really angry that profiteering isn't being stamped out. To change the cost of petrol from $1.35 a litre to $1.47 a litre, a jump of 12c between 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock, just after children are getting out of school and just before the workers from BlueScope Steel change shift at is indeed profiteering, and anybody who says it isn't is obviously getting a bonus from such practices. Prices should not be allowed to change during the day. That is from a real person, saying to us, ‘Please do something.' There has been a very interesting debate on news.com over the last couple of days about this-real people telling their views. Well the House should hear from some real people. Brad from Perth says: Wake up Dr Nelson! FuelWatch works extremely well in Western Australia. Also, think outside the square too. If it even breaks the discount cycle, people can fill up any time they want. It's good the day we will for the environment! Todd from the Sydney says: A 24-hour notice for fuel prices is a good step. It will further assist us to manage our already stretched budgets. Jules from WA says: It works fine here in Perth. You know the day before when prices are going up so you can go and fill up with the cheapest petrol. Stop complaining about nothing. Mr Anthony Smith-What about Kev from Treasury!",29
29,Mr BOWEN,PRIME MINISTER,Peter says: Well the only people complaining about the idea are service stations who claim it will close them down. Mr Anthony Smith-What about Martin from Batman!,30
30,Mr BOWEN,PRIME MINISTER,Sparky from Melbourne One of the biggest issues for petrol prices is the lack of information for consumers. Give a little power to the people. Mr Anthony Smith interjecting,30
31,Mr BOWEN,PRIME MINISTER,"They do not like hearing from real people, do they? Mick from Sutherland says: One of the big benefits of FuelWatch here in Western Australia is that we no longer have the situation of you being in a queue to fill up because it is discounted and then the price suddenly goes back up before you turn up at the browser. JoJo of Perth says: Living in Western Australia, I often use FuelWatch. Prices are still lower in the middle of the week here, but by using FuelWatch, I can often find prices later in the week and on weekends at the same low rates as Tuesday. And they go on. This is from a woman who emailed me at Easter: Dear Minister, I am concerned about the price rises in petrol. Just before Easter, when I was taking my family away on holidays, I lined up at the service station and as I was lining up the price went up 15c a litre while I was in the queue. Mr Speaker, I have to confess my life is a lot easier now. Now, whenever I get an email, I am going to press the forward button and I am going to type in Brendan.Nelson.MP@aph.gov.au and say Mr Nelson is stopping FuelWatch, and I am sure he would be happy to explain himself to you. I am sure he would be happy to explain why you should not have information about the cheapest place to buy petrol. I am sure he would be able to explain to you why, when petrol prices are about to go up 10c or 15c a litre before a weekend, you get no notice. I am sure he would be able to explain to you that the difference between the cheapest and the most expensive petrol in any city could range from 15c to 30c a litre but he does not want you to know. He would be happy to explain it, and so now the forward button on my keyboard is going to get a real workout as I forward it to Brendan.Nelson.MP@aph.gov.au, because they are the ones standing in the way of more information for Australian motorists. They are the ones saying, ‘We can shrug our shoulders and do nothing to help you.' They are the ones saying, ‘We don't care about volatility in fuel prices and we don't care about giving you more information to manage it.' They are the ones saying, ‘We don't care what the consumer watchdog thinks. We don't care what Graeme Samuel thinks. We will ignore him, like we did in government, because we don't care about consumers.' That is the message from the opposition today. That is what they say. They say, ‘We're going to sit in Canberra and we're not going to listen to the people who stand up for Australian consumers and we're not going to listen to the Australian consumers themselves!' There is a reason why they are sitting where they are, and that is because, after 11 years in office, they lost touch. They did not listen to the Australian people about cost-ofliving pressures. They have a shadow Treasurer who waltzed into this building and said: ‘Interest rate increases are overdramatised. It's not such a problem.' He probably thinks fuel prices were overdramatised as well when he was in office. He probably thought grocery prices were overdramatised when he was in office. And I can understand why he would think that, but the Australian people do not think that. The Australian people are looking to a government to say: ‘There are cost-of-living pressures and they are not easy to fix. There are worldwide trends, which are not easy to fix. But we can make a difference, we can give you more information, we can put you back in charge, we can give you an even break and we can give you a chance to drive your dollar further.' This government believes it. We will continue stand by it, we will continue to pursue it and we will continue to pursue you for your policy bankruptcy.",31
32,Mr SWAN,PRIME MINISTER,"I rise to speak in this debate. It is a very important debate, a very substantial debate, a debate that demonstrates the complete difference between this side of the House and that side of the House. The difference between us and them is very simple. We sit around the cabinet table working out how we look after working families. That is what this side of the House does. We sit around the cabinet table having a debate about how we can help working families with cost-ofliving pressures. What did they do through their period in government, around the cabinet table? They sat around working out how they could rip away their wages and working conditions. That is the difference. The difference is that we, on this side of the House, understand what life is like around the kitchen table and those on that side do not. Most particularly, the shadow Treasurer does not have a clue what life is like around the kitchen table in this country. He is so out of touch he is in outer space. This man said that inflation was a fairy story. When inflation is at a 16-year high, anybody who could say that it is a fairy story is just completely out of touch. He has lost contact with planet Earth. Is it any wonder, when people look at the way he is stalking the Leader of the Opposition, they think back to the 1980s? And what picture do they get in their mind? They see it very clearly. It was on display at the Press Club the other week. They thought: Andrew Peacock; Andrew Peacock without the suntan-absolutely no substance, all front. For him to get up in this debate and accuse members of the government of being shameless is just extraordinary. He knows no shame. Only a few years ago he was trying to join the Labor Party. He does not have any conviction. He has no conviction or any values that go to the core of this debate-none whatsoever. For him it is all about his slick debating tactics. That it. It is not about cost-of-living pressures for Australian families. The proposition being put here today by the opposition is a simple one, and everybody is expected to believe it because he thinks he is so brilliant. What he wants people to believe is that suddenly at 9am on Monday morning, 26 November last year, everything in the economy went bad. What he wants people to believe is that suddenly the cost of living went up. Suddenly, on the very first day that the change of government took place, the cost of living went up. That is what it wants everybody to believe-it did not happen under their 12 years. Working Australians had never had it so good, according to everyone over there. He sat in the cabinet, along with the Leader of the Opposition, and said working Australians had never been better off. The hide of them to have done that, at a time when inflation, as we now know in retrospect, hit a 16-year high! They sat across there when inflation was at a 16-year high and told working Australians they had never been better off. What gall! The pretender from Point Piper is out there pretending he understands cost-of-living pressures. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am really concerned about the Treasurer's unhealthy obsession with the member for Wentworth. I would ask that he come back to petrol and not the member of the Wentworth.",32
33,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,There is no point of order.,32
34,Mr SWAN,PRIME MINISTER,"I certainly am speaking to the motion and most particularly to the amendment moved by the Prime Minister because of the failure of the opposition to put forward costed budget proposals. This is where it all leads to. They now want the Australian people to believe that somehow they is have got some solution to petrol prices-but we know that the member for Wentworth does not support the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. And we know that because emails can be powerful, can't they? We know what he said in his email to the Leader of the Opposition. Yes, we do! We certainly do. We know he does not support it: it is unfunded, uncosted and undeliverable. And they know it. Every one of them knows it. It is absolutely undeliverable, because it is uncosted. They are happy to sit back and blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus, which is essentially the surplus this country needs to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. It was their neglect, their reckless spending, that gave Australians eight interest rate rises in three years on the back of rising inflation. Shame on you! How could you have the gall to come into this House and talk about cost-of-living pressures, when that is your record? How could you have the gall to do it? But how could you have the gall to say this, at the Press Club, about the Leader of the Opposition's policy on excise? This is what the shadow Treasurer said when he was asked what would be the Liberal Party policy at the next election. He said, ‘If I am, er-if Brendan, er-if that is our policy, er, then I will argue for it as eloquently, or not, as I can.' End of story. How do they expect people to take them seriously? This is what the shadow Treasurer said at the Press Club. There was not one line in that speechMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is a really unhealthy obsesseniors. sion that the Treasurer",32
35,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Order! There is no point of order. The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. That is not a point of order. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, that is the second time that the member for North Sydney has done that during the Treasurer's speech.",33
36,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for North Sydney should be very careful about the way he approaches the chair seeking the chair's indulgence about spurious points of order. I think enough is enough. The Treasurer has the call.,33
37,Mr SWAN,PRIME MINISTER,"For 12 long years they did sit around the cabinet table, but did they talk about cost of living pressures? Government members-No!",33
38,Mr SWAN,PRIME MINISTER,Did they talk about doing anything about what is going on in petrol retailing? No. What did they talk about? A government member-Themselves.,33
39,Mr SWAN,PRIME MINISTER,"Themselves, that's right. There was a lot of talk about themselves, because they had their eye on each other. They did not have their eye on the Australian people. Otherwise they would have known and they would have acted, and they did not choose to act at any stage in those 12 long years. In contrast, what have we done in just six months? Let us just run through it-it is quite worthwhile. We have agreed to a $4.4 billion education tax refund-they never did. We have agreed to a $1.3 billion childcare tax rebate-they never did. We have agreed to a $1.2 billion first home saver accountthey never did. We have got the runs on the board when it comes to delivering for working families under financial pressure and for For 12 years they neglected them. We understand that when it comes to the price of petrol, when it comes petrol retailing, we do need a new approach-an approach that you could not manage to come to in 12 long years. The Manager of Opposition Business over there spent his last 12 months in government ripping away at the wages and working conditions of average Australians. Shame on him! We make no apology for supporting FuelWatch. This is an important initiative. It just shows how much contempt those opposite have for the Australian consumer, because this proposal at its very core gives knowledge to all consumers in a way in which nothing has been put in place in this vein before. What it does is give every motorist who wants to look for the best price on any given day the potential to get there and achieve it-that is what it does. What it does is to take the sale of petrol and democratises it so that consumers can find the cheapest price. At the moment it is a racket. The way in which the fuel price cycle works works to the disadvantage of most consumers. Some are lucky to take advantage of it. Some may get it on Tuesday. Our proposal gives consumers the capacity to get the benefit every single day. We are up against powerful vested interests who do not like this proposal, because this proposal does empower consumers. Knowledge is power. FuelWatch will put before motorists the essential pricing information they require to get the best price on any given day. You treat Australian consumers with such contempt that you do not even understand the very basis of this proposal. There has been some comment about how there is differing bureaucratic advice coming forward to the government. We welcome differing advice as part of a very healthy icy debate that this government is having, because we have set a new direction in this country. It is a direction which will deliver benefits to working families in a way in which you never, ever contemplated. That is why FuelWatch is so important. And we did follow the evidence. We followed the evidence from the ACCC, and this is very important, because the ACCC is the body with the expertise to do the necessary evaluation of what is required. It has done that. The chairman, Mr Samuel, will be placing that before all of you to see. You will not have a leg to stand on, because the work is in. The consumers in Western Australia know it, the ACCC knows it. The only people who do not understand these issues are those opposite, who are so out of touch they are simply incapable of analysing this issue. Essentially the current arrangement has removed competitive risk from the marketplace. FuelWatch is going to empower consumers to get the best price. Where does this all fit into the approach of the opposition? Where it all fits in is that this opposition is so bereft of ideas and so out of touch, all we have is short-term political opportunism. What we do not have is a fundamental framework that meets the needs of the economy, that tackles the inflationary challenge, that does something about putting downward pressure on interest rates and that sets this country up for the future. But what do we get in the face of responsible proposals from this government? We bring down a responsible budget to try and clean up the mess that they left us. Did we accept responsibility for cleaning up their mess? We accepted responsibility for cleaning up their mess on day one. I just wish they would accept some responsibility for creating it-the 16-year high in inflation and zero productivity growth. This is the legacy of those opposite. And they are so embarrassed polabout it that all we get is a flood of shortterm, opportunistic stunts in this parliament. But I tell you what: we have been over there for a while and we understand-they do not work. We have tried a few in our time, and I tell you what, they do not work-and they are not working for you. They are not working for you because what you are doing simply does not add up. You are not credible on economic policy. It does not matter how many speeches you have at the National Press Club, you will not be allowed to get away with the fraud of pretending you had a budget response. There was not one costed alternative proposal in 4,365 words at the Press Club-not one. I do not think in the last decade or so has been a shadow Treasurer who has had the gall to go to the Press Club and not present an alternative budget reply. But this guy did. It was not a budget in reply, it was a Brendan in reply. That is what it was-out there stalking his leader because he does not actually have the time or the desire or the understanding to come to grips with the fundamental policy challenges this country has to tackle. What are they? Tackling inflation, lifting productivity, investing in the futureall of those things are at the heart of a credible economic policy. Those opposite have become utterly irresponsible and it has taken this shadow Treasurer just six months to shred their remaining cred when it comes to economic policy, just six months to completely shred their economic credibility. They should be censured.",33
40,Mr HARTSUYKER,PRIME MINISTER,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate because for a whole year we heard the Prime Minister and the Treasurer hold a conversation with the Australian people during the 2007 election campaign. They came into this parliament and they have been trying ever since to match up with the rhetoric that they put in place during the election campaign. During the election campaign they held a conversation with the Australian people. Every night on the TV screens they came into people's homes and they claimed that they were going to put downward pressure on the cost of living, they claimed that they were going to put downward pressure on petrol prices and they claimed that they were going to put downward pressure on grocery prices. What do they do when they get into government? They give up. They throw up their hands after only six months and admit they do not have a solution to the problems that people face. I think that the people out there are absolutely disappointed. We heard the shadow Treasurer talk about there the issue of the ACCC analysis, which is based on averages, not based on a volumetric average. So averages can create a very curious outcome and sometimes a very inaccurate outcome. The ACCC did not seem to be aware of the relative volume sold across the price cycle in a range of places. But I can help. I can tell this House that in Sydney in a sample month 34.5 per cent of motorists were purchasing fuel in the lowest 10 per cent of the fuel cycle. So 34.5 per cent of motorists were able to take advantage of discounts that were available on the day. In the next 10 per cent percentile band, 14.9 per cent of motorists were able to take account of the next 10 per cent of the percentile band. Then between 20 and 29 per cent, the lowest 30 per cent of the range in the price cycle, some 65.3 per cent of motorists purchased their fuel. No FuelWatch-this is the market at work. What happened in Perth, where allegedly there is all this extra information that is going to allow motorists to make an informed choice, that is going to put power in the hands of the consumer, that is going to make the world an allegedly better place? What happened? Let us look at the situation over the same time period in Perth. In the lowest 10 percentile band only 18.1 per cent of consumers bought fuel compared to 34.5 per cent in Sydney. What happened to FuelWatch? They should have been all down there queued up ready to take advantage of these allegedly low prices because of all of this extra information. Let us look at the next percentile band. In Sydney it was 14.9 per cent; only an additional 8.5 per cent of motorists purchased in the 10 to 20 per cent percentile band. The third percentile band, which I mentioned, between 20 and 30, in Perth only 9.8 per cent of motorists purchased in that band. So in the rough and tumble of the marketplace in Sydney we have 65 per cent of motorists being able to purchase in the lowest 30 per cent of the fuel cycle; in Perth we have 36.4 per cent. What happened to all this extra information? What is it doing? Is it empowering consumers to get the very best price and buy at the bottom of the cycle? Apparently not. But let us look at the other end, at the highest end of the cycle. What was happening there? It is an interesting observation. In Perth 11.7 per cent of motorists paid the top price, paid in the top percentage of the percentile band. What was the figure in Sydney? Was it eight per cent? No, it was not. Was it five per cent? No, it was not. It was 3.1 per cent of motorists in Sydney who paid the top price, when 11.7 per cent of motorists in Perth paid the top price. It seems absolutely amazing that members of the government can come into this House and can crow about ignoring the advice of four government departments and about alleging to be working on behalf of the consumer. And the figures are stark, that under a conventional market operating in a conventional way we have more people taking advantage of the low point in the cycle and fewer people paying at the top of the cycle, whereas in Perth it is a completely different result. We have an overwhelming shift up the price cycle in the Perth market. That is allegedly good for motorists, just as it is allegedly good for motorare ists to fine fuel stations for reducing their price. Will the Prime Minister come into this House and explain as clearly as he can how it is in the best interests of the motorist to a fuel station for providing motorists with cheaper petrol? It is clearly absurd. When we look at the issue of FuelWatch, we see a range of commentators around the country concerned about its implementation. We have heard about the RACV, we have heard about the RAA in South Australian, we have heard of the concerns of the RACQ. These motoring organisations are very concerned about it. They are very concerned about the impact of competition. They are very concerned about the potential to lose independents from the market. We hear a range of commentators and departments commenting on the anticompetitive effect of this measure. Yet this government comes into this House and extols the virtue of a scheme which is nothing more than a fraud. It is nothing more than a cruel hoax on Australian motorists by a government which has given up, which does not have a solution to the problems that people face. It is all about providing a lower level of pressure on the Prime Minister rather than a lower level of pressure on working families. We see a Prime Minister who is more concerned with his own personal situation. We see a Prime Minister who is more concerned about taking the heat off, so much so that he is willing to perpetrate a fraud on the Australian people, a fraud which will push up the price for motorists, a fraud which cannot be justified, a fraud which is not supported by the evidence and a fraud which they are all too keen to come on board with. I really think that the members of the backbench of this parliament should put some pressure on the Prime Minister to let him know very clearly that people want access to cheap Tuesday. The only reason there motorists in long queues at service stations is not for some imperial edict from the Prime Minister but that they believe that in the marketplace it is worth their time to actufine ally queue up and get the savings that are available at the particular service station. That is the only reason they queue up. They are not drafted and forced to go down there and take their places in a queue. They queue up because they have made a commercial decision of their own volition that it is worth it for them to queue up and get the benefit of that discount. They do not need to be told that. They actually make their own decision on that basis. What we have now is Big Brother saying: ‘We are going to take that all away. We are going to take away the opportunity to buy on Tuesday and absorb those savings. We are going to replace it with a flat price structure that is good for you. Believe me, I am from the government, I know what is good for you. I will take away cheap Tuesday. I will get everyone paying up the price cycle because it is in my best interests as Prime Minister of this country to get fuel off the headlines and to get fuel out of the limelight. is what I need. It is not what you need as motorists. It is what I need because I have come into your lounge room everyday, through an entire election campaign, promising cheap petrol. I am delivering nothing. I am under pressure, so I perpetrate a fraud so that you will all believe that I am actually doing something when in fact I am doing nothing.' The Prime Minister's logic is that FuelWatch is a system that you have when you are doing nothing about the price of fuel except pushing it up. FuelWatch is a system that will create a higher cost to the motorists of Australia. You only have to look at the prices in Perth yesterday. We saw a price in Brisbane of $1.40. We saw an average price in Melbourne of $1.49, in Sydney of $1.50 and in Adelaide of $1.51. It increased in Perth yesterday to $1.55. Perth has not been performing favourably compared to other capitals. The ACCC inquiry did not result in an overwhelming endorsement for FuelWatch-far from it. It did not result in a recommendation for FuelWatch at all, yet this government persists with a misrepresentation and persists with this fraud. The people of Australia will not wear it. The media today is full of stories calling the bluff of this government. They are awake to your fraud. They are awake to your misrepresentation. They are awake to the fact that you have rejected the advice of four government departments. Whatever happened to the use of frank and fearless advice? I am afraid frank and fearless have left the building. What we have is the perpetration of an elaborate hoax-a hoax that is going to result in motorists paying more right around the country. I would like to reflect a moment on the words of Mr Luscombe of Woolworths. He said: We provided the Government with some info that showed that quite frankly our inability to match the lowest price in the marketplace in WA That during the day has meant margins in WA were stronger than most if not all states. Mr Sullivan interjecting",35
41,Mr HARTSUYKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for the Planet of the Apes interjects.,37
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"The member for Cowper will refer to the honourable member by his seat. Mr Sullivan- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I take offence to the electorate of Longman being called the Planet of the Apes.",37
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,It will assist the House if the member for Cowper withdraws his remark.,37
44,Mr HARTSUYKER,PRIME MINISTER,"I will withdraw that remark. I was not reflecting on the people of Longman. The people of Longman were not interjecting. Mr Luscombe said the margins in Western Australia were higher than in other areas. The interviewer said: I was interested in the comments on FuelWatch and you said that the analyst's call that you tend to get a better profit margin in the west than you do elsewhere because you do not have to take prices down. Mr Luscombe's comments were: That is not because we want to. It is illegal to take prices down during the day. He goes on to say: If you put in a price but someone is a cent cheaper than you down the road then you do not have the opportunity to match that price. If someone down the road has put in a cheaper price you do not have the opportunity to match it. I put that to the ACCC in a briefing yesterday. I asked, ‘Can the ACCC advise: is the tender effect of service stations putting their price in the day before greater than the market effect of service stations competing during the day?' I asked whether they had any information on it. They said no. Part of the basis for FuelWatch is that service stations put in a price the day ahead and are prevented from competing during the day. But the ACCC, who the government are alleging are so strongly in support of FuelWatch despite there not being a recommendation in the report, were unable to comment on whether motorists would be better off having service stations tendering the day before as opposed to having service stations competing in the market, matching the competition down the road and matching the competition in the next suburb. I put another proposition to members that were present at the briefing. Mr King made the comment that information was useless with regard to the pricing of petrol in an information regime if it was not fixed for 24 hours. He made the statement that information was useless to consumers if it was not fixed for 24 hours. I said, ‘Why is that?' He made the same statement as I think the Prime Minister that the price could change before you get down to the service station. That is an unsubstantiated value judgement. We have markets right around the country that fluctuate during the day. We have markets where people will become aware of a price and take advantage of that price in a range of ways. They do not have to be fixed for 24 hours. Yet the representative of the ACCC was putting forward an absolutely unsubstantiated value judgement that, by somehow not fixing a particular price for 24 hours-if that was not so fixed-then the information would be absolutely useless. I sit here in amazement that the only measure that this government has entertained of any note in relation to fuel is the introduction of this fraudulent scheme. The opposition on the other hand put forward a proposal that will reduce the costs to motorists by 5c a litre; it is a proposal that will provide a real reduction in the price of motoring; and it is a proposal that would be welcomed by many consumers around the country. It is a proposal that the other side decries. There is a stark contrast between a 5c reduction in excise, which would provide real reductions for motorists and real savings for families who are struggling to fill their cars, and the scheme the government is perpetrating, which is merely a fraud.",37
45,Ms GILLARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (10.37 am)-Today we are seeing an opposition in disarray-hysterical and in disarray. Walking into the parliament and moving a censure motion on the Prime Minister is supposed to be an important thing to do. In terms of the weaponry given to an opposition, censure motions, particularly those on the Prime Minister, are the biggest weapon they have. And here we have an opposition that has walked into the parliament using the biggest weapon at their disposal, and they do not have enough speakers ready to talk to it. They missed the jump. We have been treated to a speech by the member for Cowper, who was clearly unprepared, and none of the senior leadership team, with the exception of the shadow Treasurer, is even in the parliament. These people are asking the Australian people to treat them seriously when they cannot even organise themselves to get an opposition tactic ready on a Thursday morning. This is a laughable display from an opposition that is in disarray. And why are they in disarray? It is because they have not come to terms with the fact that they lost the last election. Even more than that, they are trying to perpetuate a collective fraud and get the Australian ple to believe it. The collective fraud that they are trying to get the Australian people believe is that somehow they fell out of the sky on 25 November and fell into the seats on the opposition front bench. They want the Australian people to believe that none of them ever had a moment in politics before 25 November-that somehow they were all born new on 25 November and turned up on the opposition front bench. But of course that is not true, and because it is not true the Australian people can judge them by their record. It is a record that they are desperately trying to twist and turn and get away from, but the Australian people can judge them by their record. All of this emotional, hysterical, feigned concern about working families that they have engaged in since they lost the election stands in stark contrast to their complete indifference to the plight of working families before the election. These are not political novices; these are people who sat around a cabinet table and made decisions to the detriment of working families. There was no feigned concern about the plight of working families then. There was no feigned concern when they were sitting around the cabinet table. Let's go directly to the performance of Leader of the Opposition in this debate. He has been in here in question time highly emotional about people queued in cars at petrol stations with kids in the back and dogs in the back-highly emotional. And let's reflect: this is the same man who sat around a cabinet table for six years, and during those lot. six years what did he do on petrol? Absolutely nothing. Six years around a cabinet table-apparently highly emotional about the state of working families and petrol pricesand he did absolutely nothing. Of course, we are going to see more hysteria and more cover-ups by the opposition peo- of their past. They do not want people remembering their past. All those years around to the cabinet table: six years for the Leader of the Opposition, two years for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and around the same time for the shadow Treasurer. They are all interested in petrol prices now, but when they were sitting in the chairs that would have enabled them to do something about it, what did they do? Absolutely nothing. And at the same time that they were sitting in those chairs with all this feigned concern about working families, what did they do? They brought Work Choices to working Australians. All this feigned concern about working families and what did they do around that cabinet table when the evidence came in that working families were getting ripped off by Work Choices? What did they do-squeal with delight, laugh, backslap each other, do a couple of high fives and say: ‘Exactly what we wanted. We wanted working families to have their penalty rates ripped off. Good on us'? Is that what was happening around the Howard cabinet table? The people who now feign concern for working families delivered that to working people. So let's get away from all of this cant, this the hypocrisy, this fraud, these feigned emotions and this fake concern. This opposition is so phoney. I have seen knock-off Chinese Rolexes that are more genuine than the members of the opposition. At least you can say that a knock-off Chinese Rolex does the job, which is more than you can say about this Amongst the things we have seen them emote about and be concerned about was Bonnie Babes. Do we remember that? The Leader of the Opposition was so paralysed with emotion he could hardly move, on Bonnie Babes. He is the same man who sat around a cabinet table for six years and, when it came to deciding what to do with $121 million, did he say, ‘Let's put that Bonnie Babes,' or did he say, ‘Let's put that into Work Choices propaganda'? We know what he said. He made a choice when sitting around that cabinet table. Fund Bonnie Babes or fund Work Choices propaganda? He chose Work Choices propaganda. That is what these people did when they sat around cabinet tables. That is what they will be judged by. And of course we have had an insight through this motion into the dying days of the Howard government and how they must have conducted themselves. Gee, it must have been easy to be a Howard government minister in those dying days, because apparently, according to those who sit opposite, the responsibility of a minister is to come inMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This censure motion is about fuel prices and the inability of the government to deliver on the promise it made to the Australian people. The Deputy Prime Minister should return to the subject of the motion.",38
46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,There is no point of order.,40
47,Ms GILLARD,PRIME MINISTER,"That was another of the opposition's hysterical tactics. They do not like government speakers, so they seek to interrupt them day after day. It truly is thetic. In relation to the Howard government cabinet ministers-and one is sitting at the table now, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-in the government's dying days there must have been some good times, mustn't there, just sitting there taking public service advice, driving up in the big white car at 9 o'clock, having a cup of coffee and a little bit of a look at the newspapers, having public servants come in with a brief? Presumably they always accepted public service advice. into Presumably the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: ‘Oh, I do not even need to read that; I'll just sign it. It's public service advice; I've got to sign that.' So you would do that until elevenses, presumably, and then a couple more briefs would come in and it would be: ‘Oh, it's public service advice. I am absolutely going to sign that; I will not even read it.' Then at about one o'clock you would be looking to have lunch with Alexander Downer. That would have been a day's work in the Howard government when they were stale, out of touch with working families and making sure that working families were bearing the burden of Work Choices. That is what they were doing. This is ridiculous behaviour by the opposition. We were elected to govern. We were elected to make decisions in the interests of working families and we are doing itMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",40
48,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I warn the honourable member for Mackellar!,40
49,Ms GILLARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Their hysteria does not worry me, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is an example of how irrelevant they are. Their points of order, their interjections, have complete irrelevancy. Let us come to the question of FuelWatch. What we can say about the Howard government is that there was a period when the pa- Australian public believed that the Howard government was competent to manage the economy; I absolutely concede that. There was a period when the Australian people believed that. What has happened since the last election is that the Liberal Party has destroyed any reputation it ever had for economic responsibility. It has completely destroyed it. It destroyed it on budget reply night with its smash-and-grab raid on the surplus of $22 billion, inevitably putting upward pressure on interest rates and inflation-and high interest rates and high inflation are simply enemies of working families, the people they feign concern about now. In relation to FuelWatch, the opposition also seem to have forgotten even the most basic principles of economics. Let us have a little recap of those basic principles. What economics tells you is that markets are tremendously efficient mechanisms for delivering supply and low prices if participants in the markets have perfect information. That is why, when you are at the open stalls of a fruit and veg market and you have people competing in front of you for your business and all the prices are known then you will get the best price. What was happening in our petrol market and what is still happening today is that the suppliers of petrol have great information because of a service called Informed Sources, which they subscribe to and which means that they can track petrol prices in their region and indeed across the nation. Suppliers of petrol and diesel have all of that information at their disposal. But the other participants in this market, the consumers, do not have access to that information. We want to get this market to work properly by ensuring that consumers also have access to that information. And we want to do that through FuelWatch. It is a very simple concept, even though the opposition seems unable to grapple with it-a very simple concept. What I know from my electorate on Melbourne's urban fringe is that people need to buy petrol and they are highly price sensitive. They understand that petrol prices and diesel prices in this country relate to world factors. They understand that, but what absolutely drives them to distraction is the sense that they are being treated like muppets by the oil companies through price manipulation. That is what they hate. They hate the Friday spike before the long weekend. They hate it, and they feel misused by it. We are trying to make sure that those price sensitive consumers who need petrol and who need diesel have good information. What FuelWatch would enable them to do is, in the evening, log on-or even do it through their mobile phone-and check what petrol prices are going to be in their locality, at the petrol stations on their drive to work or to school or to the childcare centre the next day. Because all the petrol stations need to file their price at the same time they do not know what others are going to be pricing, so they are putting in their best price to sustain their sales on the next day, and people can then survey across the petrol stations in their locality or along the routes that they commonly drive and assess which one they want to go and diesel and get their petrol from. What FuelWatch in Perth tells us is that variability in prices between petrol stations on a given day can be 10c, 15c or 20c a litre. If you are a highly price sensitive consumer, if you drive perhaps from Werribee to the city every day-a very common journey for people from my electorate; it is more than 30 kilometres-you would be able to identify which petrol station you would want to stop off and buy at. You would, of course, buy from the one that on that day was 10c or 15c cheaper than the other ones. Why would the opposition want to deny consumers access to a system like that? They have not explained it. They have not explained it because they cannot explain it. The amendment moved by the government talks about how the opposition are playing the game of big oil in relation to the stance they are taking. It is certainly not a stance in the interest of working families. It is a stance in which they are ing manipulated by big oil. I want to take members of parliament to a very interesting article by Steve Lewis that was published earlier this year in the Courier Mail. It relates to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is here in the chamber. It talks about how she made up her mind about Australian workplace agreements. It talks about how she went to an opera, hosted by mining companies, in the Margaret River area. At the opera, she consulted on what to do about industrial relations. Well, I am not opposed to the opera. And I talk to mining companies. But, when you are making a decision, you should also talk to working families. The one thing that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not do, that the opposition have never done on industrial relations, is talk to working families. They are not in parliament today representing the interests working families with this flawed motion that even they have not taken seriously in their performance.",40
50,Ms JULIE BISHOP,PRIME MINISTER,"The events of this week have revealed that this is a government that will be defined by its lack of belief in the policies which seeks to espouse. This is a government that will be characterised by its focus on spin over substance. This is a government that does not care whether a policy is right or wrong, does not care whether it is economically sound or economically weak and does not care whether, in this instance, the policy will drive up the price of petrol and hurt families living in Western Sydney and outer suburbs. This is a government which does not care whether its policy is right or wrong but only whether it can get a cheap headline, a five-second grab on the nightly news. We have never seen a government so driven by spin as the government that occupies the treasury bench today. We have never seen a government that disregards the advice of the befour most significant economic advisers in the Public Service. It ignores that advice, all for the sake of a cheap headline-another symbol-as if it is doing something. What an extraordinary revelation there was this week: we have a government that is prepared to ignore the advice of the experts in government-its own economic advisers, its own experts-for the sake of covering its position, which it took to the last election, that it could do something about petrol prices, when it knew it had no policy to do any such thing. It is extraordinary that after just six months the government has been revealed as a sham. It is in disarray; it is in denial that it is promoting a fundamentally flawed policy. Why should the Australian people listen to the novice Treasurer, a man who is still on probation? Why should the this Australian people listen to the Treasurer of when the economic experts in the government say that this FuelWatch scheme is fundamentally flawed? We know that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised that the scheme might result in a small price increase. Why should the Australian people listen to the Treasurer, who is it still on training wheels, rather than the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who advised that the scheme might result in a small price increase? The Prime Minister went around the country before the election promising that he would do something about petrol prices. He spent six to eight months telling the Australian people, ‘Put me into office and I will do something about petrol prices.' And they believed him. They took him at his word. They gave him the benefit of the doubt. We now know his own Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet says that the quick fix that the Prime Minister has happened upon a national FuelWatch scheme-in fact might result in an increase in petrol prices. Why should the Australian public listen to a Prime Minister who has no background-no experience, not even a passing acquaintancewith economics? Why should they listen to him when Treasury estimated that the scheme would result in ongoing increased operating costs of around $4,000 per annum to affected small businesses? Small businesses are the lifeblood of this nation. They are the backbone of the economy. And you have advice from Treasury that estimates that this fundamentally flawed scheme would result in ongoing increased operating costs of around $4,000 per annum to affected small businesses. Don't small businesses come within the definition of ‘working families'? Isn't this government concerned about putting an extra $4,000 a year on small businesses? What impact will that have on small businesses around the country? Does the Treasurer even care what would happen to the small businesses that would have an increase of at least $4,000 as a result of this madcap scheme? Why should the Australian people listen to a Treasurer and a Prime Minister who have only been in the job for six months, when their Department of Finance and Deregulation advised that under this national FuelWatch scheme the price commitment rule might result in higher average petrol prices? The department of finance has advised that the price commitment rule might result in higher average petrol prices. Why would you introduce a scheme that may result in higher average petrol prices? You have got Treasury advising that it would result in ongoing costs of $4,000 per annum for small businesses; you have got Prime Minister and Cabinet advising that the scheme would result in a price increase; you have got Finance advising that the scheme would result in higher average petrol prices. Why would the government introduce a scheme that will result in higher petrol prices? Finance went on to say that it would add over $20 million to business costs in the first year, with the impact likely to fall disproportionately on independent retailers. We know the government's attitude to independent retailers. We heard the member for Leichhardt yesterday saying that he does not care about the impact on independent retailers. Why won't the Prime Minister and the Treasurer admit that this scheme would result in higher average petrol prices and add $20 million to business costs in the first year and that the impact is going to fall disproportionately on independent retailers? Independent retailers are family businesses as well. Don't independent retailers come within the definition of ‘working families'? Are these another group to be excluded because of this government's ideological fix on trying to get an answer to cover the spin that it so misleadingly put to the Australian people at the last election? They promised people-and this is what they believed-that the government would do something about fuel prices. We assume they were not promising to drive fuel prices up, but that is exactly what this national FuelWatch scheme will do. This is the advice from no less than the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of the Treasury and the department of finance. Then we turn to the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and we know that this department is supported by its minister, the member for Batman. The department of resources and energy is concerned that the scheme will reduce competition and market flexibility, increase compliance costs and has more potential to increase prices. So now you have another department saying that the scheme will reduce competition and market flexibility and increase compliance costs on small business and on independent retailers and has more potential to increase prices. So you have got Prime Minister and Cabinet saying that it will increase prices. You have got Treasury estimating $4,000 in increased costs on small business. You have got Finance advising that it will result in higher average petrol prices and $20 million in the first year of increased costs on independent retailers. And you have got Resources and Energy concerned that the scheme is reducing competition and market flexibility and increasing compliance costs, with the potential to increase prices. With this mounting evidence against the scheme we then get the department of industry describing it as ‘anticompetitive' and ing that it will ‘increase petrol price coordihe nation amongst retailers'. In other words, it will have the very opposite effect from that which the government tries to tell the Australian public it will have. This is breathtaking hypocrisy, when it has received advice from the economic heart of the government, from the people who actually know what they are talking about-not a prime minister who has not even a passing knowledge of economics, not a Treasurer who is still on probation and still on trainer wheels. This advice comes from the heart of the economic advice within this government and it is being wilfully and blatantly disregarded. What has happened since the election? Why has this government become so arrogant that it believes it can dismiss the views of the Australian Public Service that are experts in the very field that the government is seeking to ignore? Not 12 months ago the Labor Party, when in opposition, was referring to Treasury and Finance as the Commonwealth's top economic advisers. Before the election they were ‘highly regarded by the opposition as the Commonwealth's advisers'. The Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, said in March 2007, ‘If you are serious about national economic reform, if you are serious about it, you ask the Treasury for advice.' So back in March 2007 if you were serious about economic reform you asked Treasury for the advice. So we take it that when you are not serious about reforms you disregard Treasury advice. Is that what we take from what has happened this week? When you are not serious about economic reform, when you just come up with a madcap scheme like a national FuelWatch, you ignore Treasury advice. Mr Albanese-What about the WA Liberal Party scheme?",42
51,Ms JULIE BISHOP,PRIME MINISTER,"I will come to that. Then the Treasurer said that he wanted sayto quote an ‘eminent authority' on this, and was talking about an eminent authority on economic reform. Who was he talking about-himself? No, not at that time. Was he talking about the Prime Minister? Certainly not. In May 2007 he said that the eminent authority was the Secretary of the Treasury. What has happened in 12 months? Why is Ken Henry no longer the ‘eminent authority'? The Treasurer, then the opposition Treasurer, said that the government's preeminent economic adviser was the Secretary of the Treasury. Now he has been relegated to the back bench and is no longer the preeminent authority for economic advice. It is capped off by a piece written by the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, when before the election he described the role of Treasury in the heart of government. He said: The commonwealth Treasury is no ordinary agency of state . . . And then he went on to say: As a former Commonwealth public servant, I knowthis is the Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Ministerfrom experience that the Treasury is staffed with the most competent policy elite that can be attracted to the Australian Public Service. The only thing that the Prime Minister knows about economics is that the best economic advisers in the country are within the Treasury. He said that it is ‘no ordinary agency of state'. It is not advice that you take when you feel like it and you disregard it when you have got a cheap stunt that has to grab the evening news and the next headline. The Prime Minister said that he knew ‘from experience'-the only experience that he has got in this area-that the Treasury is ‘staffed with the most competent policy elite that can be attracted to the Australian Public Service'. And now he is trashing their reputation, ignoring their advice, wilfully disregarding Treasury and the other economic advisers within government. In this article the Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, went on to say that Treasury: ... are part of a tradition that sees their role continuing custodians of the nation's long-term economic well-being, providing robust advice to the government of the day, irrespective of the political complexion of that government. That is what they said before the election. Now when they are in a jam and their national FuelWatch scheme is unravelling before our very eyes, they start trashing the Public Service. The minister for finance dismissed them the other day as ‘fat cats'. Don't think that didn't get around the Public Service! The Treasurer has dismissed their advice as ‘academic' and then today-this was a doozy-we had the Assistant Treasurer revealing that the four departments that advised the government against the implementation of the fundamentally flawed FuelWatch had been ‘captured' by the vested interests of the big oil companies. What is the Prime Minister going to do about his four departments that the Assistant Treasurer says have been captured by the vested interests of big oil companies? This is what the government is saying: anybody who disagrees with their fundamentally flawed FuelWatch scheme has been captured by the vested interests of big oil. That means Ken Henry and the Treasury; Terry Moran and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; and all those people in the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. They are all captured by the vested interests of big oil companies. This is how silly the government are appearing now. This is how ridiculous their argument has become. Why do they not just admit that the evidence is overwhelmingly against FuelWatch and that their own departments have pointed out the fundamental flaws? The Treasurer used to have on his website the statement that the coalition would ignore Treasury advice at the economy's peril. That as the is what he used to think-that you would ignore Treasury advice at the economy's peril. And now this government, in its quest for cheap populism, for the five-second grab, for a cheap headline instead of cheap petrol, is ignoring the very advice that it says puts the economy at its peril. This scheme is fundamentally flawed and should not be introduced nationally. (Time expired)",44
52,Mr ALBANESE,PRIME MINISTER,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (11.08 am)-I want to speak in support of the amendment moved by the Prime Minister to censure the Leader of the Opposition for: (1) his failure to stand up for the interests of Australian motorists and consumers; (2) capitulating to the interests of big oil companies; (3) failing to put forward fully costed budget proposals; and (4) continuing the practice of economic irresponsibility. In their last budget the Howard-Costello government shovelled a record $40 billion out the door in new spending-$40 billion in just one budget. It is no wonder that inflation hit a 16-year high. They denied in government that inflation was a problem even though there were 20 separate warnings from the Reserve Bank, and they are still in Now they want to punch a $22 billion hole in the surplus that we need to fight inflation. We delivered a budget that was economically responsible but that addressed the long-term task of dealing with the infrastructure bottleallocated necks and the skills shortages that were in the economy. The shadow Treasurer, of course, is still denial that inflation is an issue-they say it is a fairytale-but of course this is the same shadow Treasurer who thinks that a 25 basis points increase in interest rates is overdramathe tised in terms of the impact it has on working families. They were out of touch in the leadup to the last election, which is why they lost office, and they remain absolutely out of touch. The fact is that the opposition, when they put forward their budget response, put forward a grab bag of unfunded, uncosted and undeliverable promises. It was all about appealing to their backbench rather than the broader community. The community knows that without economic responsibility you cannot deliver on social programs and on long-term economic needs. Indeed, the opposition have even gone so far as to criticise the Building Australia Fund. In his National Press Club speech the shadow Treasurer criticised the BAF for having no rules and no investment benchmarks. But it took them 20 months to issue an investment mandate for the Future Fund. They announced the Higher Education Endowment Fund in the 2007-08 budget but six months later at the election there was still no mandate. But they think that you can just make promises, more promises and then make some more promises without saying where the money is coming from. They have blocked in the Senate the heavy vehicle charges that they called for, that were initiated by the white paper of 2004. That was supported by COAG in April 2007. On 28 June 2007 the then transport denial. minister, the member for Lyne, said: The National Transport Commission will develop a new heavy vehicle charges determination to be implemented from 1 July 2008. The new determination will aim to recover the heavy vehicles' infrastructure costs in total and will also aim to remove cross-subsidisation across heavy vehicle classes. in That was initiated by them in government but opposed by them now that they are the opposition. And they speak about advice from the Treasury! This is what Ken Henry, Secretary of the Treasury, had to say about this issue. On 21 May he said: The road user charge for heavy vehicles is not the most important structural policy matter likely to confront the nation's parliaments this year. But it would be one of the easiest ... and it is a precondition for other, more important, land transport reforms. A ‘precondition' is what the Secretary of the Treasury said about this important reform. Of course, when we announced it this is what industry had to say; we sat down with them. The headline on their 29 February press release by Stuart St Clair of the Australian Trucking Association was ‘Rudd government listens to the trucking industry'. I spoke to the ATA yesterday. This is the Australian Trucking Association, the industry bodyMr Burke-That Hockey thinks is a union.",45
53,Mr ALBANESE,PRIME MINISTER,"that the member for North Sydney thought was a union. I spoke to 600 of them yesterday, and I addressed their dinner last night. It was terrific to spend time with these Australians who do so much to contribute to national productivity. This is what Trevor Martyn, Chairman of the ATA, had to say yesterday: Of course it has been suggested the Australian government could reduce fuel excise but it would be just a gesture. The price of diesel has already gone up by 48 cents and it is likely to rise by an extra 20 cents. A tax cut of even 10 cents per litre would hardly be noticeable. Instead the best approach the Australian government can take is to focus on the long-term and fix the road transport laws that are stopping us from using the latest and most fuel efficient truck designs. I say to the opposition: listen to the Treasury, listen to the industry, listen to all those who recognise that this is an important reform. If you cannot listen to any of that, listen to yourselves of fewer than 12 months ago and get out of the way of this important reform. We heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say that she was going to outline in her speech the issues of why the operation of FuelWatch was a problem in Perth, and then she said nothing. This weekend is a long weekend in Perth, and consumers will be watching their TV news tonight to see what the lowest cost petrol in their area will be. It is on every commercial news channel, just before the weather every day. I want the good people of Marrickville, the people of Parramatta, the people of the Central Coast, the people of Launceston, the people of Melbourne and indeed the people of Hurstville to have that opportunity as well. What FuelWatch does is pretty simple. The oil companies now collect the information and then the information is made available to consumers. It is simple. How could you possibly object? That is why the ACCC found in their econometric modelling that it will put a downward pressure on prices. I listened to the ACCC chairman very carefully this morning reinforcing that advice. But of course the opposition were offered briefings weeks ago but they were not taken up, because they do not want to be informed about this issue. We have had a lot of talk from those opposite about the importance of advice. They know that governments receive a range of advice and the cabinet processes are there. They have referred to some media reports about the cabinet advice of some departments-one would suggest because it is inappropriate to talk about cabinet advice. There are other departments as well that provided advice that clearly does not suit their particular argument. When you have conflicting advice you make a judgement of what is in the national interest, and that is what the Rudd Labor government has done. The sanctimonious nonsense from those opposite about departmental advice is extraordinary. Mr Keenan interjecting",46
54,Mr ALBANESE,PRIME MINISTER,"The nong opposite asks: which departmental advice asked me to breach cabinet confidence? He asks me to break the law, which says a lot about where they are coming from. We know that when it comes to departmental advice there is one section in my department in particular-the Regional Development Section-that stands out as a hallmark of what their attitude was to departmental advice. The Australian National Audit Office found, in volume 1, page 20, that the manner in which the program had been administered over the three-year period to 30 June 2006, examined by ANAO, had fallen short of an acceptable standard of public administration. On pages 35 and 36 they said: A feature of the program's administration ... was the frequency with which practices departed from the published program guidelines and documented internal procedures. This was reflected in funding being approved for projects notwithstanding the absence of a completed Regional Partnerships application or a departmental assessment against the program criteria, and departmental assessments being truncated or fast tracked or assessment procedures not being rigorously applied such that DOTARS did not adequately scrutinise applications before providing advice to ministers; projects being approved for funding notwithstanding that one or more criteria had not been satisfied; ministerial funding decisions being taken or advisory processes other those provided for in the program guidelines in procedures advice to applicants. Listen to this: Of particular note in these respects was the significantly higher tempo of funding applications, project approvals and announcements that occurred in the eight months leading up to the ing of the 2004 federal election compared to the remainder of the three years examined by the ANAO. A surge in grant approvals and announcements occurred during this period notwithstanding that many of the projects recommended and approved for funding were underdeveloped such as they did not demonstrably satisfied the program assessment criteria. On 2 February 2004 the former Prime Minister announced his government would commit $845,000 to the Peel Region Tourist Railway. Funding was to be provided from the Regional Partnerships program. The only problem was that no application had even been submitted. They did not get around to signing a contract until 24 January 2007. It was an absolute farce. The first payment of $517,000 was made on 2 February 2007, exactly three years after Mr Howard's announcement, except that only four days later the rail line burnt down. Did the Commonwealth get back its money? No. But we know that is consistent with the 51-minute spending spree before the 2004 caretaker election mode. Former parliamentary secretary DeAnne Kelly approved 16 projects worth $3.3 million. But it is not just that. With regard to the ARTC, the Audit Office found that the government managed hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds just before June each year. They made three special grant payments: $450 million in June 2004, $100 million in June 2005 and $270 million in June 2006. The Audit Office says the payments were ‘in the context of assisting to reduce higher than expected budget surpluses'. So if than they think there is going to be a surplus they just shovel the money out the door. Note: there was no proper departmental advice, there were no contracts, there were no funding arrangements or documented governance arrangements that required the ARTC to use the $820 million on any particular projects or callin any particular time frame. That is what the Audit Office found about the way that they dealt with public funds. We on this side of the House have produced an economically irresponsible budget-I should have said responsible budget: an economically responsible budget. Those opposite stand condemned for the fact that they have thrown out any economic credibility whatsoever. (Time expired)",47
55,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,PRIME MINISTER,"We have just heard out of the mouth of the Leader of the House opposite that the government had brought in an irresponsible budget, and I have to say we all agree with that-totally irresponsible. That has to be perhaps one of the best Freudian slips that we have heard in this parliamentan admission by the manager of government business that the government brought in an irresponsible budget. This FuelWatch scheme is also irresponsible. It has grown out of the fact that, prior to the election, we had the now government, the then opposition, going around and promising to the Australian people that they would bring down the price of petrol, the price of groceries and interest rates. That was the promise that they made to the Australian people. Since they have come to government-in the six months that they have been here-we have seen a rise in petrol prices, a rise in grocery prices and a in interest rates. We are in the situation where they thought they must be seen to be doing somethinganything-so they have grabbed onto this concept of FuelWatch. It can probably best be described as the streaker's defence-it seemed like a good idea at the time. Quite clearly, what FuelWatch is designed to do is to level out the bumps in the peaks and troughs of petrol over the cycle. It will get rid of the top peaks, the top price, over the cycle but will also get rid of the most discounted price, the bottom peak. That means that, if you are interested in paying an aged price, you will say the average price will be less. But, as was pointed out by speakers earlier today, none of us buys at the average price. We buy at a point in the cycle where we can get the most effective price for ourselves. There are great differences between motorists-great differences between the people who are buying fuel. You have those people who are up at the top end of the scale and do not really care what the price of fuel is-they will simply buy it. It might be put onto an expense account, it might be part of their contract price or they might think their time is more valuable than to be spent in queuing to get cheaper petrol. They really do not care at what point in the cycle they are going to be buying. They certainly do not care whether the price would be frozen for 24 hours. But there are an enormous number of people-retired people, veterans, people who are on fixed incomes, people with a disability who have a car adapted so they can drive it-a whole army of people, who need to buy petrol at the cheapest price they can get it. That is why, in Sydney in particular, if you are driving in the left-hand lane of the road and come across a petrol station, you will inevitably find you have to get out of that lane because there will be a queue waiting to rise get into that petrol station, usually on a Tuesday evening, in order that they can buy their fuel at the cheapest end of the cycle. For the government to come in here and say that they are relying totally and utterly on Graeme Samuel's view of the ACCC report really says a lot about the structure of their scheme and the paucity of their arguments. The fact of the matter is that the inquiry that the ACCC did began in June 2007 and was supposed to report in October but then reported in December. When it did report, it said some quite significant things. One of those most important things is on aver- page 257 of the report, where it says: Assessing any system in the style of FuelWatch that incorporates increased price information and price commitment requires great care due to the potential for anti-competitive as well as pro-competitive benefits. Although the inquiry gained a preliminary assessment of the impacts in Perth from the scheme, it is clear that a case-bycase approach is required to assess the potential impacts on competition of any similar scheme. In particular the ACCC has not analysed the application of such a scheme to rural and regional areas. Apparent extra considerations here include the increased potential for anticompetitive effects due to the more concentrated nature of the market, the extra cost in initialisation, administration and compliance and how to decide which areas to cover. In other words, this report posed more questions than it ever answered; yet the government have seized upon this like a man drowning in the ocean. The fact of the matter is that once that report was made available the government departments which are central to any decision making process in government-the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Prime Minister's own department; the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism; the Department of Finance and Deregulation; and the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research-all said that this was not a scheme that should go forward. Indeed, it would be anticompetitive and it would not deliver the benefits that the government says it would deliver. Now the government has chosen to ignore its own departments. The one minister who did not ignore his department was the member for Batman, who wrote to the Prime Minister and told him that they should not go ahead with this scheme because it was anticompetitive and it would punish people. You can well ask the question: why has the government chosen deliberately to penalise those people-veterans, pensioners, a variety of pension holders, people to whom every cent counts-by ensuring that the cheapest petrol that is now on the market will disappear, forcing them to pay more? One could be kind and say that perhaps they announced the scheme and did not understand the implications of it. One could be less kind and say, ‘Oh well, it means people who are earning more money, who are in the Prime Minister's definition of working families, can afford to pay a bit more.' It does bring to mind this whole focus on the rhetoric of the Prime Minister about only being interested in working families-that is, people in the paid workforce. He seems to have no care at all for people who are retired or outside the workforce. Whether they are on pensions or are self-funded retirees or disabled or single parents, they obviously fall outside his definition of care, which is only for this narrow group of working families. This is totally inequitable, totally against the interests of the Australian people and totally against the idea that this government put out when it was in opposition that it was going to care for those people and bring in policies that would not only not penalise them, but somehow would assist them. The censure motion that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition this morning states that the Prime Minister and the government should be censured because they were letting down the Australian people and deceiving them over record high petrol prices by: (1) describing petrol prices at over $1.60 a litre as “a little problem” for Australian consumers and giving up on them … (2) … misleading Parliament and the Australian people on the contents of an ACCC reportignoring the Prime Minister's own department and the departments of other ministers that advised that this scheme should not go ahead and refusing to immediately lower petrol prices, which is the only way in which government can have an actual effect on what price is paid at the browser, by cutting the 38c a litre in tax on $1.60 a litre. We have said, quite sensibly and rationally, that we would reduce the excise by 5c a litre. The government then put out a little thought that it might perhaps remove the GST from the bowser price. But then we have the situation where the leaders of the Labor Party governments in the states would have to agree to that before it could be changed, and of course they would not agree unless they received compensation and so that would result in a reduction in price of about 3.7c per litre. So the bottom line is that in trying to catch up to the sensible proposal of the opposition to lower the petrol price by reducing excise tax, it came up with a scheme that would in fact deliver less and would be more inefficient. But that seems to have gone by the board also, and we are back to FuelWatch. When one reads further into the report of the ACCC, which the government have chosen as the be-all and end-all basis for this policy, one sees the government have not taken the advice of the ACCC, set out on page 17, that says that the government should conduct a detailed assessment of important issues raised by FuelWatch, including whether it had anticompetitive effects, reduction of predictability of prices and costs. Again and again, when they say they rely on the ACCC report, they are ignoring the major findings of it, which is to say that it is imprecise in the sense that it has more information it must gather. I go back to that quote relating to the fact that there has been no work done by the ACCC relating to rural and regional areas. So we have the situation now where people are being excluded from consideration because this government is only focusing on people who are in the paid workforce; pensioners, veterans, disabled people, single parents are all outside the purview of this government. People who live in rural and regional Australia are also outside consideration in this report, and I repeat: the ACCC has not analysed the application of such a scheme-that is, FuelWatch-to rural and regional areas. Extra considerations here include the increased potential for anticompetitive effects due to the more concentrated nature of the market and the extra cost of initialisation, administration and compliance, and how to decide which areas to cover. It is a very big agenda that is being put by the ACCC to be considered subsequently before any decision was taken. But I would again point out that four government departments, whose advice would normally be heeded, have said that this scheme should not go ahead. These four government departments have had the advantage of studying the ACCC report and making their comments and remarks after having studied that report. The net result of pursuing this FuelWatch scheme-or should we call it a ‘foolwatch' scheme?-is that those people who rely now on getting cheaper petrol by being able to go to the lowest peak in the cycle and buy cheaper petrol are the people who are going to be disadvantaged. Those are the people who now queue on a Tuesday night in Sydney and on whatever the day in the other states is where the lowest price in the cycle is being charged. They are the people who fill up then. They are the people who are then at least able to maintain their purchasing power through the grocery prices which the government said it would bring down and has not. They are being penalised on all counts. This government said it would lower petrol prices, lower grocery prices and lower interest rates. It has done none of those. (Time expired)",48
56,Mr TANNER,PRIME MINISTER,"Melbourne-Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11.38 am)When you are in opposition for a prolonged period of time you go through some difficult periods, and often you have some serious discussions about how you can get yourself back into the political contest and how you can improve your performance. I would have to say that, having spent 11 or so years in opposition, we had a few of those discussions in the Labor Party from time to time. But, equally, over the past few weeks the performance of the Liberal Party on the key economic issues of the day has brought back some interesting memories for me-one in particular. I vividly recall a debate some years ago in our caucus about our economic positioning, which ended up being reported in the media. The contribution I made in that debate was to argue that you cannot sign up to economic credibility; you cannot simply stand up and assert that you are economically credible; you have to earn it. You have to build economic credibility. It is the accumulated outcome of decisions and positioning over an extended period of time. It is particularly difficult to build credibility but it is very easy to lose it. Over the past three or four weeks, the opposition have been engaged in a mad venture to try to destroy what is left of the lingering economic credibility that the Liberal Party has. They have been seen to take every conceivable position that is designed to play for cheap cheers and for short-term popularity but not in the long-term interests of this nation's economic standing and not in the long term interests of working people in this country. The underlying inflation rate in Australia is 4.2 per cent. That is above the Reserve Bank's target zone, as we all know, and, as a result of that inflation pressure, the Reserve Bank has in recent times been putting up interest rates. That pattern has been occurring for an extended period of time-we have had 12 rate increases in a row-but it particularly gathered momentum in the latter half of last year. That momentum, of course, has continued on into the beginning of this year. There has been one important area, amongst the various factors involved in those interest rate increases, where the former government had direct control over, negligently failed to deal with and, as a result, has contributed very significantly to the increase in inflation and the increase in interest rates, and that is government spending. Government spending has been increasing at over five per cent in real terms per annum. In the middle of a mining boom-a situation where the world is paying ever-increasing prices for our mineral exports-which is pushing more and money into our economy, government spending has been growing at an unsustainably fast rate. In particular, that spending largely not been directed to building economic capacity to enable Australia to increase its productive capability and therefore to absorb the additional spending. As a result, the Rudd government has inherited a budget which was set in a very wasteful, inefficient and loose fiscal position, a budget that was pushing upwards on inflation and interest rates. We had no choice but to take action to drastically slow the rate of government spending in order to push back against rising interest rates and rising prices. That is why the government have delivered a surplus of almost $22 billion, or 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product, for the forthcoming financial year. That is why we have slowed the rate of growth in government spending from over five to 1.1 per cent in real terms. That is why we have cut government spending as a proportion of the total economy by around one percentage point of GDP. That is actually a very substantial reduction in government spending as a proportion of the total economy and, in fact, it is the smallest that government spending as a proportion of our total economy has been for almost 20 years. There have been some commentators who have argued that we have not gone hard enough, that we should have tightened even further. There are many who have argued that we have roughly got it about right. But there are hardly any serious economic commentators that I have seen who have suggested that the government have tightened the fiscal settings too much and that we should be spending more. The only significant players in public debate-the only significant contributors to political and economic debate in this country-who have been arguing that spending should be increased more rapidly, that we should loosen the purse strings, have been the Liberal ophas position. In doing so, they are in the process of completely trashing their economic credibility. The opposition want to go soft on inflation. The opposition want to go soft on the battle to keep interest rates as low as possible. They are the only significant group in Australian public debate who are calling for softer fiscal policy, who are calling for more government spending. They want to restore various tax lurks. They want to revive the notorious Regional Partnerships program. In spite of all the holes in the proposal, they want to bring back the access card that was going to cost over $1 billion. They want to hand out various tax reductions. We saw in the budget reply speech by the Leader of the Opposition that they had a variety of tax reductions they were offering, including one that was not even costed: a change in the capital gains tax treatment for small business owners where there was not even an attempt made to identify what cost that would be to the budget. In all of this there has not been a single cent in savings, not a dollar, not a cent-no attempt whatsoever to identify where the money is going to come from. Having been in opposition, having been a shadow finance minister for a total of 5½ years, I know only too well how tough it is. But in opposition we did identify savings. Over a year ago we were putting out savings packages of $3 billion-and copping flak and criticism for a number of the proposals in it. But Labor tried to do the hard stuff in opposition, tried to ensure that when we were putting forward spending proposals we were also advocating savings. The so-called party of economic responsibility, the party that sees itself as Australia's economic managers, is standing before the Australian people today advocating higher spending, advocating a huge hole in the budget surplus-around $4 billion in the forthcoming financial year and $22 billion over the course of the next four years-and not identifying any offsetting savings at all. It is admitting that the spending, this loosening of the settings of the budget, would actually come from reducing the surplus. That is simply a recipe for higher inflation, higher prices in the supermarket and higher interest rates. That is all that that means. You will not find a serious economic commentator who will dispute that proposition. If you ask serious economic commentators, ‘If there is to be a substantial loosening of fiscal policy from where the government has set it in the budget that has just been handed down, what effect would that have on inflation and interest rates?' they will tell you that the effect would be upward pressure-it would increase inflation and increase interest rates. It is not that long ago that the key players in the opposition who are now proposing a cut in fuel excise were part of the Howard cabinet, part of the Howard government, which refused to cut fuel excise and rejected that proposal. It is extraordinary how the opposition has suddenly discovered the merits of cutting the excise on fuel without any kind of offsetting saving and therefore putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. It is extraordinary how it has suddenly discovered the merits of this proposition, after having rejected it when it was actually in charge of the nation's government literally only months ago. Even the wasteful, spendthrift, lazy former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, did not support this proposal when he was in government, and to his credit it is clear that he does not support it now-as a number of key players in the opposition do not support it. The opposition's approach on petrol, on other issues and on the wider economic front is simple-spend, spend and spend again. More spending, a lower surplus, let inflation rip and therefore allow interest rates to be pushed up even further. This has all been put forward in the context of a very appealing grab bag of giveaways. But that is not an economic policy. I will turn to the competing positions that we have in the public debate on the issue in a more specific sense-that is, on the one hand the opposition's position with respect to fuel excise and on the other the government's FuelWatch proposal. The opposition, as I said, discovered the merits of this position relatively late in life after having had many years in government and many long months of opportunity to actually put it in place. They finally discovered the merits of taking 5c off the fuel excise, having found themselves in opposition. The taxes on fuel actually consist of two separate things: the excise levied by the Commonwealth; and the GST, which is levied by the Commonwealth and passed on to the states. The excise, of course, is fixed at a set sum and is not indexed, is falling in real terms and will continue to fall in real terms. That means that over time it gradually becomes smaller and smaller relative to wages and prices and everything else in the wider economy. It only falls very slightly each year but it is slowly eroding in real terms. The GST, of course, was imposed by the former Liberal government, and the issue that arises from its interaction with the excise is a consequence of decisions taken by the former Liberal government. At the time of the inauguration of the Ken Henry-led commission into Australia's tax and transfer payment systems, we did indicate that one of the many issues that was in play was that specific question of the GST and the excise interconnection. In reality all we are dealing with here on the part of the opposition is a desperate attempt to shore up the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition and to ward off the shadow Treasurer, who famously sent an email saying that the policy was wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has shredded the Liberal Party's remaining credibility by in effect standing up and saying, ‘The surplus should be $4 billion less than it otherwise would be and the Liberal Party is quite happy to carry the impact on inflation, on prices, on interest rates that that inevitably involves.' Finally I will turn to the government's policy on FuelWatch. Much has been made of the fact that coordination comments for the cabinet discussion from several departments actually criticised the proposal in various ways. There is one really important thing that we have to emphasise here. Those coordination comments were all about one page long-and in 1½ spacing, from memory. So they were all a few hundred words each. On the one side we have a routine process where individual departments, without being approved by their ministers, rouso it tinely put comments attached to cabinet submissions giving their views. Ministers in some cases disagree with their department's comments. In many cases the comments that come from different departments will actually be in conflict. Some departments will support a proposal, some will oppose it. There will be differing angles. Some will only pursue the specific matters that are relevant to their area and so forth. So it is hardly unusual that you get differing points of view from government departments as part of a process of cabinet discussion of an issue, and in some cases-as in this one-the view being put by an individual department was not the same as the view being expressed by their minister. I refer to my own situation. The key difference is that on the one hand you had four pages in 1½ spacing, about 1,000 or maybe 1,500 words, and on the other hand you had hundreds of pages, economic modelling, serious research, serious analysis by the competition watchdog-the key pool of expertise in the government that is designed to advise the government on these matters: the ACCC with serious research and analysis of this issue. The conclusion they have reached, and the position the government has adopted on their advice, is that FuelWatch has been successful in Western Australia, that it has had the effect of pushing petrol prices lower than they otherwise would have been by somewhere between 1c and 2c per litre and that that can be replicated across the rest of Australia. It is important to note that divergent views in the government and the bureaucracy about these issues are actually symptomatic of a wider situation. There are divergent views in the Liberal Party, there are divergent views across the states and there are divergent views within motoring organisations, because this is a complex issue. You are dealing with a complex phenomenon, petrol pricing, which is affected by a wide variety of factors. You are dealing with a complex market; you are dealing with consumer behaviour and information. This is a complex issue. It is hardly surprising that ferent views. We know the Liberal Party in Western Australia introduced FuelWatch, we know Senator Adams supports it and we know the leader of the Liberal opposition in New South Wales supports it. So there are different views. But we stand by the position that we have taken. We are going to pursue FuelWatch. We do not claim that it is some kind of magic wand or silver bullet that will solve petrol price issues overnight. There are no guarantees, nor were there guarantees given about petrol prices by the then opposition when we were in opposition prior to the election. On numerous occasions the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were asked, ‘Can you guarantee?' and they said: ‘No, we can't guarantee. All we can guarantee is that we will make an effort to do the things within our power to have an effect.' And that is precisely what we are doing. This problem is occurring in developed countries all around the world. (Time expired)",51
57,Mr WINDSOR,PRIME MINISTER,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. The debate that is taking place at the moment is a censure motion on the Prime Minister and then the mirror image censure back on the Leader of the Opposition. I will be supporting neither because I think both individuals and both parties have got something of small significance to say on this particular issue. I would like to firstly address the FuelWatch issue. I do not think it will make a lot of difference, and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation alluded to the fact that they did not think it will make a lot of difference either. But I do not think it is going to do any harm and I do not think some degree of scrutiny of the fuel companies will do any harm. It will probably make, at best, 1c or 2c a litre difference at some periods throughout the year. If that happens, that is a positive. It is not worth wasting the last three or four days on, but let us suggest you get dif- that it is not a negative. On the other hand, we have the Leader of the Opposition proposing a 5c reduction in excise. Most people would be aware that currently the excise is 38c a litre. It is fixed, it is not indexed anymore. Over and above that we have the goods and services tax, which would be running at about 15c. So there is about 50c to 53c in every litre we buy in terms of some form of taxation. The Leader of the Opposition is proposing to reduce the excise by 5c a litre. The tax-on-atax proportion of the 38c excise with the GST interaction is 3.8c, which the opposition, the then government, put into place, so the double taxation effect was taking place under that particular regime. So we have this proposal to reduce fuel tax by 5c. I do not think that is a bad thing and I would support that, so I will not be censuring the Leader of the Opposition for suggesting it. Many members of the public question why we have a regime in this country that actually uses fuel as a cash cow, why that has lasted so long. I am pleased to see that the government is going to have a review into taxation, but it has to have this fuel debacle on the table and it has to have the goods and services tax on the table. It is an extraordinary anomaly where fuel users in this country are paying 33 per cent fuel tax at least. That is an extraordinary thing. For people to suggest, as some from the government do from time to time, that it would be economically and politically irresponsible to reduce that magnitude of taxation on the means of production, the energy that drives the nation, I find quite extraordinary. So I support the Leader of the Opposition on the 5c, given that there is the double taxation of 3.8c in there anyway. It is not much but it is in a sense a positive. From today's wasted hours we have probably got two minor positives that ignore the elephant in the room, which is the 33 per cent taxation that all Australians are paying. We have the argument, and the finance minister put it again, and I understand his logic, and the Prime Minister has been putting it and a number of others have been putting it: ‘If you move on that cash cow, what does it do to the budget surplus? How do you come to grips with that? The opposition is being irresponsible by suggesting that a $2 billion hole in the budget suddenly appears.' I think the present government made a serious error when it me-tooed the Howard government tax cuts. It was a very clever political stratfor egy by John Howard. It actually drained the Labor Party of opportunity to create a new future in how it addressed things. It removed those opportunities in relation to fuel taxation and some of the other taxation anomalies that it will be reviewing in 18 months or two years time. So it took away in one fell swoop a lot of opportunities in terms of the budgetary process. But I think the taxation review that the government is going to embark on really does have to include fuel. Years ago Malcolm Fraser articulated the idea that we need to have a regime of taxation on fuel to try and dampen down people using it. Some others in the last weeks have argued the same thing again, and I imagine the Greens would do the same. How long is that logic going to prop up this tax on energy? V8 cars are put forward as the bane of society in terms of fuel consumption. The suggested solution for dealing with these V8s is to apply a tax that impacts on everybody to try and reduce the impact of these gas guzzlers. I think that is a fairly ridiculous reason for justifying this tax regime, particularly on top of yesterday's luxury car tax debate. Yesterday we had an absurd proposition put by the government and agreed to by the opposition. People in the country who need to pay more than $57,000 for a basic model fourwheel drive were sent the message that they could avoid the luxury car tax. Four-wheel drive vehicles in the country are a necessity as a result of the roads because out of the $14 billion that we raise only $2.6 billion gets returned to roads-and the other argument for fuel excise originally was that we needed road maintenance and construction. Well, only about 16 per cent of it is remotely connected to road maintenance and construction. We had this absurd position yesterday where we sent a message in the opposite direction: if you do not want to pay, or you want to pay very little of, the luxury fuel tax a vehicle that is a necessity, buy a gasguzzling V8. What are the messages that the government is trying to convey in relation to all these issues? Overlaying that we have this overarching climate change agenda where, we are told, we have got emissions trouble. We are told that we have carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and a range of other global warming gases that we have to try and come to grips with. We have got an energy crisis, and some people suggest that there is a global food crisis. Of course if the price of energy goes up the price of food is going to go up. If we assume that we are moving to a different level of energy prices, what can we do about it here? I would suggest that we can do a bit with excise; a third of the cost of petroleum and mobile fuels is tax. Obviously we can do something about that. Maybe we have to look at the goods and services tax provisions and include fuel in that. That would be uncomfortable for some-probably for everybody in here-but maybe that debate has to be on the table. If we are moving to a new plateau of energy prices, we are going to tax ourselves into a comparative disadvantage globally. We will quite deliberately put ourselves into a disadvantageous position. Then in the next breath the farm sector-and I am pleased the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is here-will be told that they are needed to produce food for the starving millions. Then we have the climate change agenda. We are told that transport movements and production-and there is one member here who heard this last night-are going to have some sort of carbon footprint. I will use my example again for the minister for agriculture because I think it is important. We have our Walgett wheat farmer. He has a footprint on his own land. He will have a footprint getting his wheat to the Walgett silo. He will have another footprint getting it to the port by train-or truck, perhaps, in New South Wales fairly soon. Then the boat from the port-Newcastle to Egypt or wherever it goes-will have some sort of carbon footprint. The grain that it carries contains starch, which is carbon, and that will have a significant footprint. Who pays for that? I do not know. We have not developed the emissionstrading arrangements yet, but it is something we should know. We export 80 per cent of what we produce; in fact, we overproduce. The transaction is then made. The wheat is cashed in and maybe the odd bribe is paid to sell it to acceptable markets. Then we move into another corrupt market and bring a boat load of oil back from the Middle East. It has a carbon footprint, I would imagine, as it is a fossil fuel. We do not cart oil on trains anymore, so it will be on a truck back to the Walgett farmer so he can go around in a circle and produce grain to send to Egypt to buy oil. Maybe there are ways we can avoid some of these things, not just with excise and dependency on international factors but maybe internally. The minister for agriculture and others are well aware of the potential for biofuels. Rather than continuing with the ridiculous convoluted energy chase that we are on, surely we should be looking at cutting that corner and looking at local options. We could value-add to what we do well and have an impact on the energy market locally. If we are starting to say that shifting all these things all over the world-a baked bean tin travelling to 17 different countries before it gets to its eventual destination-and having a carbon footprint is problematic, then what are we going to do about it? One of the things I was pleased to see in the recent budget was some money for research into cellulosic ethanol-biomass. There are techniques out there now. They are in their infancy but they are working in Canada, in the States and in other parts of the world. If people are afraid of using grain for fuel because it has got to feed the starving millions then why don't we move to biomass? I think the government has got to encourage that. But we cannot keep the tax system the current government has-it has taken on board the previous government's tax system-where, if you are a renewable energy producer in this country, in 2011 you will start to pay a fossil fuel tax. How is all that going to fit within this so-called emissions-trading and carbon debate? I do not know the answer to that but I think a lot of people do want this tax system, because we have got an absurd debate going on at the moment about little things at the margin when there are big things that need to be addressed, not the least of which is the solar debate. That was another mixed message in the budget. We means tested it. We have been trying to encourage people to get into solar energy, and what do we do? We turn the sun off in terms of their capacity to access the incentives. Either we have got to have some incentives to do these things in this country or we have got to tell them not to bother: ‘We are not going to have a climate change debate,' or ‘We don't believe in emissions trading anymore because it is all too hard.' We cannot keep running these mixed messages that are out there at the moment. A document came into my hands this very morning about a pilot cellulosic ethanol plant being developed in New South Wales. The point I would like to make from this document-it relates to this debate quite well-is this: If the commercialisation program is successful, and research is being undertaken by the government, production time could be slashed from days to minutesThat is the issue with cellulosic ethanoltrying to ferment the starch in a reduced period of time so that you can get the unit costs down. With grain it can be done now; with cellulose it is around the corner but close. The document continues: ... and fuel ethanol production costs dramatically reduced. Feasibility studies have concluded that fuel ethanol produced through this process will have a crude oil equivalent cost in the range of US$36 to US$50 per barrel. If we are serious about having an impact locally, centrally and cutting down on a whole range of transportation issues, we have to start to get serious about renewable energy and do the hard yards, and not exclude it because of this ridiculous food-fuel debate. If we are serious about food in the world, why aren't we encouraging and helping the Sudan, which has the potential to produce six times the grain production that Australia will ever have? The soils are there. We should be doing those things rather than having this ridiculous debate. (Time expired)",55
58,Mr BURKE,PRIME MINISTER,"Watson-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (12.09 pm)I want to acknowledge up front the importance of renewable fuels and a number of the issues that have been raised by the member for New England. Both the member for New England and the member for Kennedy have been at the forefront of making representations to both me and to the Minister for Resources and Energy to make sure that the government are well apprised of, and to make sure that we are taking seriously, the issues surrounding energy security and, in particular, the opportunities that may well be there with respect to the different possible uses of biofuels into the future. There is no more serious motion that a Leader of the Opposition can move than the one that the Leader of the Opposition moved today. When the debate began members opposite were all calling out, ‘Why hasn't the Prime Minister arrived yet?' not understanding of course that when a debate is to be held first thing in the morning, and not by a suspension of standing orders, it will regularly appear on the blue and on the Notice Paper for the morning. They chose not to do that. Mr Anthony Smith-Oh, you always put it on the blue!",58
59,Mr BURKE,PRIME MINISTER,When this sort of motion is moved it frequently can come out of the back of what happens in question time.  a censure motion,58
60,Mr BURKE,PRIME MINISTER,"It is interesting that members opposite interject about what has happened in the last 15 years. I would like to know when the last time was that a Leader of the Opposition thought it was so important for them to move a censure motion that they did not remain in the chamber for the conclusion of the debate. I cannot think of any other occasion on which a Leader of the Opposition has played the most serious card that is open to them and they have known that the motion is going to be moved-but, obviously, when it does not appear on the Notice Paper, the Prime Minister does not know it is going to be moved. I would certainly hope that it had occurred to the Leader of the Opposition that he was going to move the motion, that he had decided to play the most serious card open to a Leader of the Opposition, yet for some reason could not be bothered remaining in the chamber for the duration of the debate. What is at the core of what the opposition have said today and of the arguments that they have put forward, what is at the core of this entire debate, is whether or not it is and proper for a government to act independently, having received advice from their departments to form a different conclusion. We know from the speech made earlier by the Leader of the House that when those opposite were in government they would frequently depart from the advice of their departments. But what were the sorts of programs for which they would do it? They would do it for some pork-barrelling exercise here or there with respect to the Regional Partnerships program. That is an example of where they thought the public policy parameters were so high. But if those opposite have so quickly changed their position that they believe the proper thing for a government to do is for ministers to just match everything that comes forward in departmental advice, I am not sure what they think the point of having cabinet meetings is. For the millions and millions of Australians who do not get the opportunity to be public servants and who do not get the opportunity to contribute to coordination comments, surely there is some role for ministers to listen to them. But apparently not, from what those opposite say. When we hold community cabinets, when we conduct consultation and when I spend day after day going through regional Australia and listening to people on their own properties, apparently, the moment I walk into the cabinet room, I am meant to put all of that to one side and say, ‘Okay, what are the departments telling me to do?' because that is the policy outcome I am meant to get to. That is the core of the objection from those opposite. Essentially, every argument they have wanted to run is about the concept of whether or not it is right and proper for a cabinet to ever depart from the advice that is brought to it. We do need to consider the advice that comes from departments; we do need to consider the advice that comes from other agenright cies, such as the ACCC; and we certainly need to consider the rights and the interests of the millions of Australian motorists and the millions of Australians who rely on petrol and other forms of fuel-most notably diesel, certainly in my portfolio-and to look at how we can, in different ways, provide downward pressure for the difficulties that they currently face. The cost-of-living pressures are real-there is no doubt about that. As the Prime Minister has said continually, this is not a silver bullet and we have never pretended for it to be more than what it is. Mr Anthony Smith interjecting",58
61,Mr BURKE,PRIME MINISTER,"I think the member for Casey can look at plenty of transcripts before the election. It is an extraordinary misrepresentation to claim that that was not said prior to the election-extraordinary. There have been quotations made from this very dispatch box, in transcript after transcript, where the position before the election was made patently clear. The difference is that, while we do not believe that there is a silver bullet on this, where we can help we willwhere we believe we can provide some sort of assistance for the pressures that motorists face. It is not just petrol. They just keep hearing: ‘Petrol, petrol, petrol.' They need to derstand that diesel prices matter too. Get out of the capital cities and talk to someone reliant on diesel. Talk to the fishermen at the moment-the fishing industry-and the pressures they face with respect to diesel. Talk to the people who are trying to run a tractor and look at the pressures that they face with respect to diesel. This is a FuelWatch debate. This is a critical problem with respect to the different difficulties that people are facing. There are global pressures-of course there are global pressures-but that is not an excuse for doing nothing. That is not an excuse for the previous government's neglect year after year and simply coming back with the view that working Australians have never been better off, ignoring all the pressures that come to bear on the cost of living. The costof-living pressures come from both directions: they come from the need to make sure that the market is as competitive as it can possibly be, and they also come from making sure that people have the financial resources to be able to pay. The previous government took them out at both ends. They decided to do nothing on cost-of-living pressures, they decided not to give extra powers to the competition regulator and, at the same time, they introduced Work Choices so that people had a diminishing capacity to pay in the first place. When it comes to the balance of what you do for people's entitlements and the industrial relations debate, we say, ‘Give them fairness in the workplace'; those opposite say, ‘Give them Work Choices.' When it comes to the cost-of-living pressures at the other end of how the family budget gets squeezed, we say, ‘Give the competition regulator every extra power that we possibly can and introduce schemes like FuelWatch so that you can transfer the power from the oil un- companies to the consumers'; they say, ‘Do nothing.' Let us not pretend for a moment that the information is not made available at the moment. At the moment, through Informed Sources, the oil companies get the information. The oil companies and the petrol stations can log on and find out what the price of fuel is at different stations around the country, and yet, at the same time, those opposite do not want to give that same power to motorists. They took a long time to make up their minds and decide. Finally, they decided whether the information should be available to the petrol stations and the consumers or whether it should only be available to the petrol stations. They decided to keep a system that locks consumers out of the information equation. That is the path that the opposition have gone down. Of course, it is the opposition in this place that has that view, but it is certainly not the view of the Liberal Party around the country. You only have to look at the comments made by Barry O'Farrell to see the view of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. They quite sensibly came to a view and said: ‘This won't be a beall and end-all, but we should help where we can.' The most telling point about how this scheme could work was when we asked the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to make clear how her views differed from those of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. She responded across the dispatch box: ‘Oh, I'll get to that later.' Well, we did not realise that she meant she would get to it later-as in not during her speech, not during that day, not during that week. She did not get there at all, and the reason the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not get there at all is that when she goes home to Perth she gets to watch the news. She gets to watch the news and find out that consumers get told where the cheapest petrol prices will be the next day. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets provided with that information. InsteadMr Keenan interjecting",59
62,Mr BURKE,PRIME MINISTER,"The great example now is that we have the member for Stirling interjecting across the table and wanting to offer the arguments that his deputy leader decided were not worth advancing. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave a guarantee to the chamber that it will be explained to us why the position of the Liberal Party in this place is different from the position of the Liberal Party in WA, but she never told us how much later. I am looking forward to one day getting an explanation from the Western Australian members. We have had an explanation from one of the senators, who was very happy to provide that explanation, but certainly the deputy leader decided that at no point would that happen. On all of those cost-of-living pressures that families are facing-that working families face, that Australians doing it tough face-the key issue remains: making sure that government policy does not contribute to the problems with respect to inflation. It is extraordinary to see how quickly they have been willing to throw their economic credibility away. What is left of the group that had previously wanted to claim economic credibility-and yet handed us the highest inflation rate for 16 years-now wants to blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus. People know exactly what that means. People know what a $22 billion hole in the surplus means. It is clear: the $22 billion hole in the surplus puts upward pressure on inflation, and that is what those opposite want to deliver. When it comes to it, they do not care about being able to provide downward pressure on inflation. When it comes to it, they have no interest in trying to provide power to consumers. When it comes to it, they still do not get the costof-living pressures and understand the costof-living pressures that families are facing in all parts of this nation, because their attitude is to still be the party of Work Choices. Their attitude is to still be a party that says, ‘You should earn less and, when it comes to costof-living pressures, we won't care what gets done about it.' You can tell that their hearts have not been in it from the moment the Leader of the Opposition decided to play his biggest card and then leave the room. He left the room. I challenge anyone to let me know when the last time was",61

65,Mr BURKE,PRIME MINISTER,There is going to be a vote. If they think their censure motion has disappeared from the debate entirely then they just do not understand it. Mr Ciobo interjecting,61
66,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The member for Moncrieff and the member for Sturt are warned!,61
67,Mr BURKE,PRIME MINISTER,"Now we hear those opposite desperately calling across the chamber asking for this debate to be brought to an end. At the end of a debate on a censure motion, they are actually calling for the debate to be brought to an end. They are calling and interjecting across the chamber now, saying, ‘It's all over; let's just end the debate.' Those are the catcalls that are coming across the chamber right now. I can now see why the Leader of the Opposition decided to leave. The people here, his alleged front-bench, do not have any interest in the motion that he moved. He decided to leave. They are asking for the debate to be ended. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition decided to tell us what was in her speech and then make sure that she ran out of time before she got to defend any of it. We have got a system here at the moment where the government are making sure that, where we can help, we do; where we can provide power to consumers, we will. The alternative from the members opposite is an agenda to blow a $22 million hole in the surplus.  Party conned the Australian people at the last election that they would establish a new culture of transparency",61

We knowand I notice that the Minister for Health and Ageing is in the chamber-that the Labor Party's view is that, when it comes to health in Australia, the only system that should be embraced is the public health system. In many respects this particular bill underscores that ideological belief that drives the Labor Party. Ms Roxon interjecting",65
72,Mr CIOBO,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I hear the minister for health interjecting about whether I am interested in health on the Gold Coast. Let me put on the record some very specific and pertinent facts about the Gold Coast for the minister for health. We are a city of 600,000 people that have a public health system groaning under the weight of that population. We have been the fastest-growing city for the last 25 years and we are anticipated to be the fastest-growing city for the next 30 years. I am happy to explain to the minister for health the situation on the ground on the Gold Coast. Only one week ago there was a lady who was forced to give birth on the floor in a storeroom in the Gold Coast Hospital. The minister for health will look at the Australian people and say that the proposal before the House today to drive one million extra people from private health into public health is going to fix that system. I have a few more home truths for the minister for health. In this city of 600,000 the former coalition government had a very strong emphasis on making sure that there were opportunities for people to access health services, both privately and through the public system. One of the key measures that we introduced to make sure that people in the community had access to medical health was direct government assistance for after-hours medical care. We recognised that people do not always get sick between 9 am and 5 pm. People look to access health care outside of normal business hours. That is why the coalition had, as a very strong and key part of its focus, the desire to fund private GP clinics with additional funding so that members of the Gold Coast community could access those health centres. The after-hours clinics, and in particular would name but one GP clinic called Medcall, actually used those Commonwealth funds to provide after-hours care where the doctor would actually visit the patient. How is that for a health revolution? The doctor would visit the patient. I thought that this system was working well. It built on the coalition's commitment in my own electorate, as well as my neighbouring electorates of Fadden and MCPherson, to build two new medical schools on the Gold Coast. We were starting to make progress. Two new medical schools were being built to help solve the doctor shortage in a very meaningful and long-term way and additional funding was available to make sure that there was afterhours care available to Gold Coast residents. Then the Labor Party came along and said, ‘We want to end the blame game.' It was as though the Prime Minister had a piece of string coming out of his chest and when you pulled it he would say, ‘I believe in ending the blame game,' and then you would pull it again: ‘I believe in ending the blame game.' That was the sum total of Labor's contribution, at the lead-up to the last federal election, on what they were proposing with health. They never unmasked their true plans, which the Minister for Health and Ageing has now done and which are encapsulated in the bill before the House today. We know that only two weeks ago when a woman in my city was giving birth on the floor of a storeroom in the public hospitalwhere the public hospital is on bypass virtually more often than it is actually accepting patients through the emergency ward-we had the Labor Party stand up and say, ‘We believe the way to help solve this problem is through GP superclinics.' How interesting that, with the rollout of 31 GP superclinics across Australia, not a single one was delivered for the Gold Coast-a city of 600,000 people did not receive a single GP superI clinic. The GP superclinics, I remind the House, were Labor's solution for people being able to access health care. To compound the problem, not only did the Labor Party not fund a GP superclinic on the Gold Coast but they cut funding of afterhours medical care, and now public patients on the Gold Coast who are, for example, injured in the workplace or a car accident or require medical care no longer have the option of seeking after-hours medical care. They no longer have any chance of realising a GP superclinic, as the Labor Party promised. To make matters worse, they now have to fall back on the public health system, which, thanks to the bill that is before the House today, will have an extra million people from the private system pushed onto it. That is Labor's brilliant plan. The Minister for Health and Ageing dares to challenge me about whether or not I will support public patients on the Gold Coast. The minister dares to question my commitment to Gold Coasters by asking why I do not want to see them being forced to use the Gold Coast public hospital. It is because the social engineers that sit on the government front bench, who are completely and profoundly blind and driven by ideology, are so focused on their so-called public health utopia that they fail to recognise that they are destroying public health in this country with their ideological obsession. It just so happens that perhaps the clearest case in point is the city of 600,000 people that I represent. I say to the minister for health: ‘Don't you come in here and lecture me about public health.' I say to the Rudd Labor government: ‘Don't you dare lecture the 600,000 people on the Gold Coast about how your plans for health are going to be an improvement,' when the only thing that they will be realising is that they will lose after-hours GP clinics, they will not get a GP superclinic and they will be forced to use the public hospital, which cannot cope with current demand let alone the million extra people who are going to be driven from the private system to the public system, thanks to the bill currently before this chamber. I think it is time that the Labor ously considered what it is doing. In its pursuit of ideology, it is clear that the inroads and the important steps that the coalition made over the last 11 years are being completely eroded. The coalition stand for one very clear principle: it is the right of all Australians to have choice when it comes to their healthcare needs. It is the right of all Australians to choose between whether they would like to use the public system or whether they would like to seek private medical insurance. In many respects, it is interesting to have a look at the passage of time and the way in which social trends have been influenced by government policy. In the early 1970s about 90 per cent of the Australian population were covered in some form by private medical insurance. Then we had the great Labor icon Gough Whitlam. He decreed that public health should be universal so that millionaires could use the public health system and be subsidised by taxpayers. After that great Labor icon Gough Whitlam went about tinkering with Australia's health system, we saw private health insurance rates plummet to basically an all-time low of about 33 per cent at the end of the Hawke-Keating era. So we went from about 90 per cent of people having private health coverage to about 33 per cent. What was the consequence of that? We had so many Australians reliant on the public health system but it did not matter to the Labor Party whether they could pay their own way or not. It did not matter that you could have a millionaire lining up beside an Aussie battler on $30,000 a year, both seeking to use the same public health service. As a result, our public system started to collapse under the sheer weight of numbers. That is the reason why the former coalition government took the very considered and deliberate action of providing an incentive for Australians Party serito utilise private health. A key part of doing that was not just the 30 per cent rebate on private medical insurance and the introduction of community rating in private health insurance but also the fact that we introduced the Medicare levy surcharge. When the coalition introduced this policy, we took the view that if you earned over $50,000 you were in a situation where you could afford to make a contribution to your private health. And, in making that contribution, we wanted to make sure that people still had the choice of utilising it or not. they chose not to take out private medical cover, they could remain in the public system but they would be charged an additional Medicare levy. We on this side of the House know-as much as the Labor Party is driven by and blinded by ideology to have one universal public health system, and that is itthat without that additional surcharge the public system will groan and strain under the sheer weight of numbers. That is why that policy was introduced. With the bill that is before the House today, the Labor Party has now changed and moved the goalposts, so much so that on Treasury's own forecasts, according to the budget, we are going to see 485,000 taxpayers-and I emphasise the word ‘taxpayers'shift from private health back into the public system. I notice the parliamentary secretary at the table nodding in furious agreement. We now see that 485,000 taxpayers will move from the private system to the public system, and the Labor Party is happy about that. So now we will see-according to the private medical insurers, who have done their research-that those 485,000 taxpayers actually equate, when you start to take into account family units and so on, to nearly a million Australians making the transition from the private medical system to the public health system. Mr Gray interjecting",65
73,Mr CIOBO,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I notice the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia saying that it is about exercising choice. Let us put this in another perspective. Is it fair for those who cannot afford to exercise choice to have to wait in a public hospital room for emergency treatment for seven or eight hours because they do not have a choice? Is it fair for someone who earns $30,000 a year and might have two kids to have to line up in a public hospiIf tal room and wait for seven or eight hours to get access to public services? Is that a fair choice? Or is it fairer that those who earn significantly higher incomes than the Australian average should be given incentive to take out private medical cover? That to me is a much more sane and logical public health policy than the bill that is before the House today. What the Labor Party say is that they want to take away any incentive that exists, basically, for private medical cover. So I ask the parliamentary secretary: is it fair that someone who cannot afford private medical cover should have to give birth on the floor of a storeroom in a public hospital? Is that fair? Is it fair that a woman who is having a miscarriage should have to do that in a public toilet at the Royal North Shore Hospital because they are so understaffed that they do not have a situation in which they can tend to that woman's miscarriage? Is that fair on that woman? Is it fair that they should have to suffer that kind of trauma? The reality is that we have seen wholesale failure by the Labor Party when it comes to public health. Again, there is no clearer example of the kind of failure that we see by the Labor Party than what exists in the Queensland health system. The Labor Party has been in power in Queensland for over a decade. And what have we seen over that period? We have seen the Queensland public health system basically collapse. It is a disgrace that in a modern-day country like Australia we should be laboured with the kind of public health system that we see in Queensland or indeed in New South Wales. That is a reflection of a decade of state Labor government ideology, the same ideology that permeates the front bench of this government and that, I believe, is in the longer term cally going to destroy any public confidence that still exists in the public health system. So I suggest to members opposite that they do not lecture us about choice. They might like to go out to their electorates in Western Sydney, western Melbourne, the south side of Brisbane and to places like Nerang on the Gold Coast and explain to those who cannot afford the luxury of choice why they should have to line up in a public hospital for five, six or seven hours alongside someone who could not only afford to be in the private system but should be given the incentive to be in the private system. I would also like the Labor Party, while they are at it, to explain why it is that, when the Labor Party solution is a GP superclinic, a city of 600,000 people is not getting one. To make it worse and to rub salt into the wound, not only are they denying 600,000 people a GP superclinic but they are cutting afterhours medical funding. That is what the Labor Party's plan is for public health. I cannot believe-and I find it gallingthat the Minister for Health and Ageing came into this chamber at the start of this debate and questioned my commitment to public health on the Gold Coast. So I say to those Labor members opposite that they need to have a good long hard look at themselves. Do not stand up and say to the Australian people that this bill that drives a million people from the private system back into the public health system at a time when our public health system cannot cope with the demand that is already on it is in some way going to be beneficial. I am yet to hear a single speaker from the Labor Party stand up and explain how the public health system is going to cope with a million extra people. When I hear a Labor member stand at the dispatch box or in their place and say that there is so much capacity in the public health system that they can accommodate a million basiextra people, then I will start to take them seriously. But none of them say it because they know the truth-that a woman having a miscarriage in a toilet in a public hospital foyer, a woman giving birth on the floor of a storeroom in the Gold Coast Hospital and emergency rooms being put on bypass basically as often as they are accepting patients are signs that our public health system is in crisis. Under the former government, when the coalition were in power, we were looking about doing something to improve that situationMr Gray interjecting",68
74,Mr CIOBO,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"We did a lot of things. We took policy initiatives to make sure that we did improve it. We did that by making sure there was incentive for those who could afford to pay to go into private medical insurance, and the proof is in the pudding, more importantly. When the former government took over in 1996 about 32 per cent of the population had private medical insurance. When the former government left office the figure was about 50 per cent of the population. So our policies had a real impact. What is more, under the Australian healthcare agreements that the former government negotiated with the state Labor governments, we saw record funding flying from the Commonwealth government to the state governments. Under the coalition there was record health funding, a massively significant increase in the number of Australians who had private medical cover and increased incentive for those who were on the margin of whether they could afford private medical cover, by giving them a 30 per cent rebate. Now we have the new Rudd Labor government, and one of its first acts is to rip the carpet out from underneath all of those incentives and, in a perverse way, to proudly stand up and say, ‘Oh, yes, we know that the bill before the House, this policy initiative, going to put even more strain back on the public system.' It is extraordinary that such a short sighted and ideologically driven policy would be implemented by a government at a time when our public health system is in crisis. And it is extraordinary that even in this debate I have had the minister for health and the parliamentary secretary at the table challenge assertions that are based on fact. They are not based on ideology and not based on a mistaken belief but based on fact: the fact that our public health system cannot cope at the moment-and they want to inject a million more people into it-and the fact that under the coalition private health insurance went from the low 30s to nearly 50 per cent of the population. This Labor policy is now going to reverse that. The fact is that, at every state level, state Labor governments, which have been in power for over a decade, have seen a revolving door of employment as doctors leave the private sector, come into the public system, work there for about six months, have enough of it and then leave it again. The state Labor governments say, ‘We don't understand what's wrong.' Let me explain to the Labor Party what is wrong with their policies. Having massive numbers of patients, so that people wait six, seven or eight hours in public hospitals, is not great for doctors' motivation. Having doctors, along with the auxiliary staff of nurses and others, work in a public system under so much pressure, faced with people who are angry-because not only are they sick but they have been forced to wait for seven hours-is not good for morale. That is the reason it is a revolving door of employment not only in Queensland but also in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Each of these state health systems is a reflection of a decade of state Labor administrais tion. Now, because we have a pull-a-string Prime Minister-when you pull the string, he says, ‘I want to end the blame game,' and that is the extent of it-we are faced with a situation where it is going to get even worse.",69
75,Mr GRAY,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (1.08 pm)-I rise to speak in favour of the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill 2008. Labor has always accepted and supported a balance between public and private when it comes to delivering hospital services, GP services, specialist services and other services. It is a balance that traditionally has cut the cost of health care in our country by delivering excellent health care of a very high quality. Over the years, we have been able to lower the cost and deliver a better service than those generally available in countries to the which we like to compare ourselves: the US, the UK and Canada. It is a great achievement. It is an achievement that has been arrived at through a system that blends public and private. Let me put a bit of history on the record to provide a bit of context. In the early 1980s, Labor was elected to power on a promise to deliver Medicare. It was a promise which Labor delivered because we said we would do it. This is a concept foreign to those opposite, but it is what we do. A system was created that won not only massive support but also, inevitably, the opprobrium, the hatred, of those opposite. At the 1984 federal election, the Liberals opposed Medicare. Andrew Peacock campaigned up and down the country to oppose Medicare, to rub it out. At the 1987 election, the then leader, John Howard, did the same thing: he campaigned up and down the country to get rid of Medicare. At the 1990 election, we were back to Andrew Peacock. He campaigned up and down the country to get rid of Medicare. At the 1993 election, John Hewson campaigned to get rid of Medicare. Suddenly, by 1996, the new leader of the Liberal Party-that is, the old leader of the Liberal Party-had achieved a status that those opposite have failed to understand. John Howard understood the importance of trial and error learning. By 1996 he made a commitment. Astonishingly for the Liberal Party, they funded radio as in all markets across our country, telling us that the Liberals in 1996 would support Medicare, telling us that Medicare would not be changed and telling us that the position of the then opposito tion and the then government on Medicare was identical. Why did he do that? He did that because Medicare was held in high regard by the Australian community and by the OECD. By any international comparison, healthcare delivery costs in Australia were substantially lower than those in other comparable OECD economies-and they were not just lower cost; they were actually a better service. Policy experts-Professor Deeble and Professor Swerissen-all argued for the integrity of the Medicare system. After 13 years of opposing Medicare in opposition, the then Leader of the Opposition sought to neutralise the issue by saying there was no difference between the then opposition and the government. But he planned to damage Medicare through insurance, through a tax. How? Through the surcharge. Let me explain. The surcharge was put in place to drive people, by tax, into private health insurance. In so doing, he also shifted funding from the public sector into the health insurance sector. It was not about healthcare delivery; it was actually about insurance companies. Earlier today, we had hours of the parliament's time taken up while those opposite argued for the big oil companies. Now we see the arguments for the big insurance companies. It is not an argument about health care; it is an argument about the health insurance companies. Let me tell you: they are big enough to look after themselves. While you are in bed with the insurance companies, look at who else you are in bed with: the AMA. The last time the AMA engaged in political processes in my home state of Western Australia, it was under the guise of Liberals for Forests. They did that in the guise of Liberals for Forests because they did not like the then position of the coalition government. You need to pay more attention the people you are in bed with: health insurance companies and the AMA. No wonder you all look tired. No wonder you cannot sleep. This bill has been attacked by those opposite, but it is good public policy. It is policy to remove a tax trap that was catching hundreds of thousands of Australians, particularly many thousands of Australians who did not earn the average wage. We pursue a balance in public policy and health care-a mix between public and private. Former health minister Michael Wooldridge had some very strong points. On medical research, he is simply outstanding. I believe he also understood when he introduced the surcharge that it should have been indexed to wage movements. But it was not because those opposite saw a cash cow that had to be driven into the hands of the private health insurance companies. Let me explain how that works. Those opposite talk about a million people being driven into the public hospital system. You know full well that that million people are younger Australians. You know full well that that younger cohort generally has less need for high-cost healthcare measures. Some have specific needs, and they need to be looked after, but in general the younger, healthier cohort does not need the kind of health insurance which is offered at such high cost. So if they make the choice to opt out of that health insurance, they make that choice in an informed and understanding way. The problem with the tax, which those opposite support, is that it drives young ple into private health insurance. Of course will. We on our side of the House have always argued that human behaviours can be changed by tax. We would like them changed for the better. That is why we will introduce legislation and take measures to increase tax on highly alcoholic drinks that are drunk by younger people. Tax drives behaviours. In this context those opposite want to use tax to drive healthy young people into a product which otherwise they do not needprivate health insurance. They want to use healthy young Australians simply as cash cows. There will not be a tsunami of people descending into public hospitals. Those opposite know that. The healthy insured certainly know that because they are the cash cows. They do not use the system that they are being asked or forced to pay for under this ridiculous and punitive tax surcharge. In 1997 when it was introduced it was intended to get high-income earners into private insurance. It was to drive them into private insurance through the surcharge. The choice: insure or pay the tax. You would have expected it to be indexed. It was not. We propose through this bill to effectively restore the intent that the former government had when it introduced the levy in 1997. So this bill will increase the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds for individuals and families. It will shift the threshold because that is the answer to bracket creep. The Medicare levy surcharge imposes a one per cent increase in Medicare levy liability on certain individuals who do not have appropriate private patient hospital cover. If we do nothing for the 2007-08 income year, individuals with taxable incomes over $50,000 and couples with a combined income of $100,000 may well be liable for that surcharge. Those opposite think that is fair. The government does not. This bill increases the threshold to peo- $100,000 for singles and $150,000 for couit ples and families. It is reasonable. It is thoughtful. It is good public policy, and it is a reasonable threshold. The Medicare levy surcharge imposes an additional one per cent Medicare levy on taxpayers who do not have private patient hospital cover. When the Medicare levy surcharge was introduced the policy at the time was targeted at highincome earners. At the time the then health minister, Michael Wooldridge, said: High-income earners will be asked to pay a Medicare levy surcharge if they do not have private health insurance. These are people who can afford to purchase health insurance. Shortly afterwards, Australians paid hundreds of millions of dollars into private health insurance. The government at that time then launched a massive advertising campaign to back up the stick which it had introduced with advertising. So it was not just a carrot and a stick; it was all stick-a punitive tax measure matched up with a massive barrage of television advertising. But the income thresholds for the Medicare levy surcharge have not been increased since 1997, and since 1997 of course average weekly earnings have increased significantly. This measure simply increases the thresholds to an income level around that which originally applied in 1997. That is to say, if the original levels had been indexed, it is fair. In his address in reply to the budget the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Dr Nelson, addressed a whole part of his budget speech to the issue of bracket creep. He said: We know that, as incomes rise over time and workers move into higher tax brackets, the value of today's tax cuts will be eroded in the future. Economists call it ‘bracket creep'. We call increases on the sly. Those opposite do not refer to their current measures to keep this tax in place as a ‘tax on the sly'. Of course they do not. They think that it is about standing up for people who need hospital care. It is not. It is standing up for the private health insurers in the same way as those opposite have been standing up for big oil companies. What the honourable Leader of the Opposition has ignored in this debate is that more and more people on average wages have also been required to pay the Medicare surcharge. Bracket creep has done massive financial damage to Australian families who have been struggling under the burden of higher food prices, higher cost of living and interest rate increases and a former government which did not seem to understand that relieving pressure on the family budget was a reasonable and proper thing to do. To put this into perspective, around eight per cent of single taxpayers are estimated to have exceeded the Medicare levy surcharge threshold in 1997-98 when it was introduced. Under the changes announced in this budget, the proportion will be restored to around 8½ per cent. At the end of the forward estimates a single taxpayer is likely to exceed the new singles threshold in years 3 to 4, which is eight per cent in 1997 and eight per cent in 2008. If we did not act, the proportion would be much closer to 50 per cent. So by acting we make the proportion close to 8½ per cent; by not acting-by doing what those opposite wish us to do-it would be 50 per cent. The increase in the threshold will help reduce financial pressure on many working families who have previously been subject to the Medicare levy surcharge. And yet we still support the public-private reality and the same relativity that has been established a decade ago. We often hear that the Liberals are the it tax party of choice. We heard that repeatedly from the previous speaker. I would have thought that the party of choice would support lifting a tax on people who are not highincome earners that is designed to force them into certain behaviour. People on $50,000 a year should have a choice about how they spend their money and not be taxed because of an ideological policy. Those on the government side have been accused of having ideology in this debate. Those opposite have the ideology and the baggage, and simply read from the script prepared by the AMA and the private health insurers. People should have a choice: there should be a choice as to whether they are insured or not and a choice between the insurers that they select. This measure does provide real choice. Taxpayers can choose whether to take out private health insurance without the imposition of higher penalty rates unless they are on high incomes. The amendments that we propose today will apply to the years 2008 and 2009, and later income years. Full details of the measures are of course contained in the explanatory memorandum. But the detail of the bill is only part of the story. The real story is that those on the government side are acting to restore not just choice to families in Australia but to lift a financial burden from Australian families. Those opposite are acting in the interests of big insurance companies, the AMA and, frankly, themselves. A curious alignment has taken place in this House: after one debate that ran for the better part of four hours, where the interests of big oil companies were put front and centre, the next debate is a debate where those opposite put the interests of big insurance companies. It makes you wonder what will come next. Where stand the rights and interests of ordinary Australians in the face of an opposition that has not just lost its way but also its sense Rea, K.M. of decency? It is an opposition which does not care about the interests of a viable healthcare system, mixing a balance of public and private, delivering high levels of excellent service and delivering to ordinary Australian families. No, it is a debate which is actually about the interests of big insurers. I commend the bill to the House.",70

NA BILL 2008 Cognate bills: INCOME TAX (FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS MISUSE TAX) BILL 2008 NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by Mr Swan: That this bill be now read a second time.",75
78,Ms LEY,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and associated bills and, in doing so, to make some remarks on the very important subject of housing affordability. The opposition will be supporting these bills, while placing on record our view that they will not be as effective as the government anticipates. In response to the housing affordability crisis, the Prime Minister has proposed three measures: a Housing Affordability Fund, a National Rental Affordability Scheme and this one, the first home saver account. Both the Productivity Commission and the Reserve Bank of Australia have recognised the difference between the demand and supply sides of the housing equation. The danger with demand side policies is that they are likely to be capitalised into higher house prices, giving people more money to spend in an already tight market. So if you act on the demand side, you need to act very vigorously in the environment we are in on the supply side. Regarding the supply side, the Reserve Bank of Australia said that efforts to improve housing affordability should be focused on policies regarding land use and improving efficiency in the supply of land and housing. The Treasurer's response reminds me of a story. The story is told of a local police force that was chasing a criminal who had fled into a large, disused building. Their first thought was to surround the building, but they soon realised that it was too large, with too many windows and doors, and they did not have enough police to cover the exits. Instead, they surrounded the building next door, which was much smaller and had fewer exits. The government is not doing the main thing that it needs to do to address the problem with housing affordability in this country today; something that would address the supply shortage would be the most effective. Instead, this measure that Mr Swan has proposed will in all likelihood increase demand if it does what the government tells us it will. It will send more young people into the housing market to compete with everyone else for the already constrained stock of houses. Just on that point, it is disingenuous of Treasurer to say in his second reading speech that, for example, a couple-each earning average incomes, both putting aside 10 per cent of their income et cetera-would be able to save more than $88,000 after five years. That may well be true, but it is the government contributing in a small way to that, it is not a government creating that $88,000. The main thing that would create that saving is a change in mentality and a change in the culture of saving. Because we need a change in the culture of savings, we are supporting the bill. Any small measure that will encourage young people to save is to be supported. We are underbuilding in Australia by 30,000 dwellings a year. The evidence is that the cost of land on the fringe of cities is much higher than it should be. The price to enter the property market has increased from roughly four times the average wage to seven times the average wage over the past decade. Thousands of young Australians are now denied the chance of ever owning their own home. Menzies said one of the best instincts within us is to build a home and bequeath it to our children, to have a little piece of ground into which we can retreat that we can call our own. In Australia our heritage is very much tied to the quarter-acre block and government policies that allowed a small population in a big country earning a modest wage to own their own affordable home. Make no mistake, government ministers, people from overseas laugh at us: ‘What? You've got a country this size, you've got 20 million people and you can't find enough room to build an entry-level home for a first home buyer? What is wrong with you!' Do we really believe that half a generation of Australians will never be happy to own their own home, as we in the baby boomer generation sit here with our high records of home the ownership? We have a responsibility to fix this. People are used to listening to governments and oppositions talk about the problem. Sometimes I think we get too good at describing the problem, and I am sure that the Minister for Housing would describe it in similar terms. I now move to the details of this bill. The explanatory memorandum says that it is: … a simple, tax effective way for Australians to save for the purchase of their first home … through a combination of low taxes and Government contributions. A government contribution is applied for up to $5,000 of personal contributions into an account in a financial year, 17 per cent individuals and a total cap on accounts of $75,000. I congratulate the government for listening to the opposition when we said that the government contribution should certainly not be twice as much for high-income earners as was in the original proposal. But I do note that we are already three months late with this, and I call on the Treasurer to guarantee that these accounts will be open on 1 October and to release modelling and research indicating how well they are being taken up. As I said, we approve of the savings culture. Anything that encourages young people to save must be applauded. But in order for this measure to have its intended effect, it must be taken up by those it is aimed atfirst home buyers. It must be offered by sufficient financial institutions so as to give consumers opportunity and choice. It must not distort the housing market-in other words, making houses more expensive than they otherwise would be without this measure and without sufficient additions to the supply of housing. And it must be costeffective in its implementation and administration. We need to be careful that we do not create armies of people with clipboards and blow out our public service salaries. But if we look at the proposal from the perspective of first home buyers, accounts belong to individuals and it is the individual's home ownership status that matters, not that of their spouse. So if your spouse owns a home in his or her name and you have never owned a home in your name, you are entitled to open a first home saver account. You are entitled to withdraw the money after four years, during which you contribute a total of $70,750 and the government contributes $4,250. You then need to live in the house for six months within the first 12 months of purchase. You may not be the struggling first home buyer that this bill is trying to help, but for all you have accessed $4,250 of taxpayers' money to help you on your way. I think we could have tightened up the eligibility criteria in that area. I sound this note of caution, not because I believe that people on higher incomes should not have the opportunity to access this account but to remind the government of who they are trying to help and who may not need the assistance of fellow taxpayers quite so much. Remember: the first home saver account will be transformed into a product by our friends in the financial services industry. It will form part of a range of investment strategies. It will be incorporated into tax planning, retirement planning and the best way to manage your money-all good up to a point, but I remind the Treasurer that the more people who are not struggling first home buyers who are assisted by this measure or who use this measure for tax planning purposes, the worse the policy is. If it acts by putting further pressure on an already frighteningly low stock of housing supply, it is failing the Australians who need its help. Back to the operative provisions of the bill: I must make a contribution of $1,000 in four financial years. The government will provide a contribution of 17 per cent of what I pay in, up to a maximum of $5,000, which equates to a maximum government contribution in any year of $850. So that is 17 per cent; $850 a year. It is not an automatic government contribution. For example, if you only saved $1,000-and for some young people, my gosh, that is difficult!-you would get $150 from the government. You must wait a minimum of four years before you can access your money for a deposit on a first home. In fact, it will be longer, because you have to wait till the end of the financial year in which you make your final contribution and you lodge your tax return for that year, before the commissioner processes your tax return and is given 60 days after receiving both the income tax return and the first home saver account contribution statement from the account provider. It is a long way in. What if your plans change? How easily can you access your money? Not very easily at all. In fact, I cannot withdraw the money even with a penalty. I think it was the consumer organisation Choice who recommended that you be able to take your money out if you wanted to. Yes, you could give up the tax advantage that you have had, but you should be able to take your money out. Well, you cannot. The only thing you can do is transfer your balance to superannuation and then rely on the early release provisions, and we all know how complex and inflexible they are. Payments can only be made to purchase a first home if personal contributions of at least $1,000 have been made in respect of the first home saver account holder in each of at least four financial years. I refer again to page 19 of the explanatory memorandum. But what if I am in a position to contribute $10,000 one year and zero the next? Maybe my job is one of the 134,000 Mr Rudd says will be lost over the next 18 months. It appears that I then do not meet the criteria. Do I forfeit the right to the money I have deposited, so that it gets rolled into superannuation and I have to battle with the trustee to get it out or wait until I retire? Make no mistake; there is considerable inflexibility surrounding these accounts. It is an area that I have concerns with. Also, I have not seen enough in there to indicate what happens if joint account holders separate. What happens in the case of family breakdown? I think there might be some nasty tax twists if that does happen. The level of financial literacy among young people is low. ABACUS, in its submission to Treasury, raised this concern. They said it would be unfortunate if the standing of the First Home Saver Account policy came to be tarnished by evidence that large numbers of young Australians had stumbled unwittingly into these products that had gone backwards in capital value terms, exacerbating for them the very disadvantage that the First Home Saver Account policy was designed to address. This might happen if deposits are made into these accounts which cannot be withdrawn and which have low earnings. Remember that the bank is setting the earnings rate on the accounts. Through no fault of the depositor, they cannot keep up with this requirement of $1,000 for four years. The depositor struggles, the account stalls and the holder is left much worse off than if they had just used an ordinary savings account or had scraped together the money for a home deposit on day one. If the first home saver account is offered by a registrable superannuation entity-for example, a life insurer or a friendly society-and the product is investment linked, it is not capital guaranteed. I say to the Treasurer: these should not be a vehicle for the first home saver account. An ordinary, plain, simple deposit account, capital guaranteed in a financial institution, would work in the sense that you want it to work, but I do not think that superannuation entities with investment linked funds should be offering these accounts. We all know that your superannuation can go backwards. It is a long-term investment and this is a short-term exercise. As I said, you may well be better off saving for your deposit, making the deposit and not putting your money into the account. The Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability has heard a great deal of evidence on this subject in the last few weeks, and the transcript makes very good reading. Organisations have expressed the view that the savings plan could be outstripped by price rises, so, by entering into a first home saver account, you are in fact worse off than if you had put the money up-front, because your house price would have increased by more than your earnings and the government cocontribution. In terms of those who would provide these accounts, I note that there has not been a stampede of financial institutions rushing forward and putting up their hands. I am sure there will be one or two by 1 October, three months after the due starting date, but there needs to be many providers in order to offer a robust product that competes well in the marketplace and gives the best value to consumers. On that subject, I will say that the portability between first home saver accounts needs to be sorted out, because, in line with the Treasurer's statements about portability of your home mortgage account, this has not responded to consumer concerns. I make the point that, for any financial instisaid, tution, there are quite a few hoops to jump through with this legislation. ADIs and life insurance companies must, of course, notify APRA before they offer first home saver accounts. They must obtain relevant licences and, in many cases, establish whole separate trusts. Financial institutions need to keep detailed records, because earnings are taxed to the account provider at 15 per cent, rather than to the individual account holder. This means more detailed reporting requirements, particularly to the Commissioner for Taxation, who administers the government cocontribution. This leads me to the next point: to remind the House that this is a measure targeting the demand side of the housing equation. It does nothing for the supply side. What is the most popular consumer item for sale in Australia today? It is a plasma TV. In 2001, a plasma TV cost $16,000. By 2003, the cost of a plasma TV had gone down to between $12,000 and $14,000. Today, I ring up my local Harvey Norman and I can get the same plasma TV for $1,500. There is a very high demand for plasma TVs, but we have kept up with the supply and that has made the difference. It has not meant a tightening of demand whereby I cannot get my plasma TV. We also need to mention cost and compliance. The Commissioner of Taxation is required to undertake the compliance work. I think that might be considerable, given that you only need to live in the house for six months after its purchase or construction. I am not sure how that gets monitored and audited by the ATO, but we need to know what the cost will be to administer that part of the scheme. I believe that serious concerns were raised during the public consultation process for the first home saver accounts and that these have not been addressed. If young people ignore this product, there is no harm done, but, as I if they are trapped into putting what little money they have into an account that does not help them save for their first home then this will be a tangible example of this government failing to make the tough decisions that would ease the mortgage pain for families. There will be no opposition to this bill for opposition's sake, but I remind Mr Rudd that everything we do in connection with his announcements about reducing petrol, mortgage and grocery costs and easing the squeeze on the family budget will be aimed at one thing: to hold him to account for the false dawn he has promised Australian families. We do not want to give up on the great Australian dream of owning your own home, and we have a responsibility to future generations of Australians not to give up on that dream for them.",76
79,The SPEAKER,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"Order! It being approximately 2.00 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA",80
80,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"On indulgence and for the benefit of honourable members: it is proposed that after question time the MPI debate will not be proceeded with. We will proceed with the introduction of the notices of motion for bills. There are 16 of those15 with notice and one without notice. Parliament will continue to sit until such time as those bills have been introduced, but certainly it is the intention of the government to ensure that there are no votes held this afternoon because of the function for Stewart MCArthur that a number of the opposition members have to attend. That is why the Medicare bill was brought forward for debate prior to question time. On behalf of the government, I pass on our best wishes to Stewie. Certainly we have attempted to cooperate in the interests of opposition members. I also want to give members a bit of notice for next week. It is the government's intention to ensure that all our budget bills are passed in this sitting fortnight, and it can anticipated that the parliament will be sitting late on Tuesday night. We hope to sit late earlier in the week rather than later in the week, as people often have plans towards the end of the week. I will certainly update members as we go through. I thank all members of the House for their cooperation. NA",81
81,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Sport and Minister for Youth will be absent from question time today. The Minister for Health and Ageing will answer questions regarding sport. The Deputy Prime Minister will answer questions regarding youth on her behalf. Furthermore, the Minister for Trade will be absent from question time today. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will answer questions on his behalf. As discussed and agreed between myself and the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, I will be leaving for Sydney not long after 3 pm to attend the world congress of FIFA to put Australia's case for hosting the 2018 World Cup. NA Fuel Prices",81
82,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree with the chairman of the ACCC, who stated this morning that FuelWatch may result possibly in higher prices?",81
83,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we go to exactly what Mr Samuel said today on ABC radio 774 with Ali Moore this morning, he said: FuelWatch will not in our view lead to an increase in prices. It will, based on our analysis of the Perth situation, lead to a statistically significant reduction in prices. But there is a far more important element of FuelWatch-it is about giving consumers the power to determine when to buy petrol and where to buy it at the lowest possible price. be The choice in this House is very simple: either we vote for additional information to be provided to Australian motorists and consumers or we vote for a cosy, continuing deal with big oil companies. Fuel Prices",81
84,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House the impact that rising global oil prices are having on Australian motorists? What is the government's response, and are there any obstacles to that response?",81
85,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Look around the world today. We are confronting the full dimensions of the global oil crisis, which has seen global oil prices go up by 400 per cent since the Iraq war. As we know, the Iraq war of itself represented an enormous impediment to the successful continued flow of oil onto the global market. But it is just one element. There are other supply-side factors, including supply-side constraints in Nigeria and huge demand-side challenges which come from the rise of China and the rise of India. With the Indian economy booming, you are going to have another one million-plus Indian motor vehicles on the road each year. Look at the rise of China and the projections out from where China was just a few years ago onto 2010, 2020 and beyond, and the total proportion of world oil consumption which China will represent is a huge new demand factor in overall global oil prices. China's global energy demand means that we also see, through Australia's resources boom in the coal sector and the resources sector more generally, that that demand is leading to an acceleration of our own terms of trade. On the question of supply and demand, the other responses which are important in terms of global oil deal with what we are going to do in terms of alternative fuels into the future. This government is embracing that as a strategy for the future through work being done by several of my ministerial colleagues. On the question of fuel-efficient cars, tralia needs its own manufactured hybrid car. That is why we have put money through a half billion dollar green car fund to assist Australian motor vehicle manufacturing to bring onto the streets of Australia our own hybrid car so that Australian consumers can go out there and buy with confidence, knowing they are supporting Australian manufacturing jobs when they buy that vehicle and at the same time contributing to a better outcome for themselves in terms of what they pay at the bowser, not to mention a better outcome in terms of the environment. Beyond these measures-how we deal with the demand-side and supply-side factors, how we deal with alternative fuels and more fuel-efficient cars-is the great challenge of public transport investment. Historically the government which has preceded us has said, ‘That this is not our zone; we don't go there.' In fact they have said that this is exclusively a responsibility for the states. We have said the reverse. If you look at urban congestion in the major cities of Australia up the east coast-in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne-and the fact that we still, in the 21st century, do not even have the beginnings of anything that looks like a comprehensive metro system in these large cities, surely that is an indictment on us all that we have failed to act. We are facing gridlock in Sydney, gridlock in Melbourne, gridlock in Adelaide and gridlock in Brisbane and in other cities because of this: an absence of effective measures to deal with public transport. That is why we have, in part, a Building Australia Fund: so that we can investigate these sorts of proposals for the future and, if they pass muster, to get behind them to get people out of cars, into decent public transport and to work on time so that they can also contribute to the overall challenge of reducing demand on global oil. Of course, the other thing which governAusments can do is to make sure that the family budget is assisted to the greatest extent possible. What we have done through this budget is to make sure that through the tax measures, through the childcare tax rebate and through the education tax rebates that we are providing, we are also delivering extra dollars into the family budget each week. Let me give you one example: a family of four with a combined income of $87,000, one full-time worker $60,000, one part-time $27,000, two kids, one in child care and one at school. What do they get as a consequence of the budget that we have just passed?",81
86,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about cars?,82
87,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to the cars question in a minute. It is worth actually calculating the quantum here. Through the tax cuts, a family of that nature-that is, with a $60,000 full-time worker and $27,000 part-time worker and two kids, one in child care and one in school-are delivered an amount equalling $1,050 per year for the 2008-09 year, that is $20.19 a week. That is the first thing. The second thing is that the childcare rebate delivers $1,255 for the year, $24 .13 a week, and the education tax rebate $375 per year. Add those together and that is $2,680 a year in extra disposable income delivered by the measures which have been introduced through this budget. That is what we mean by practical assistance to the family budget to assist them in dealing with all the challenges coming about through increase in the price of petrol, increase in rents, increase in mortgages, increase in grocery prices and the rest. That adds up to an extra $52 per week. What have those opposite offered in this respect? If you are to believe that those opposite are serious about their policy on excise, given that the member for Wentworth has said he cannot guarantee that they would actually implement this policy if they were elected at the next election, on 30 litres being consumed a week that means you are adding $1.50 extra per week to the family budget, in contrast with $52 per week that we are delivering through these budget measures. Can I say that at the end of the day it is one family budget and the question is: where do you find the extra disposable income to help on these critical cost of living pressures? That is what shapes so much of our determination in this budget to make sure that we could deliver extra to the budget table. In the bill rently before this House, which I think has just been voted on, the Medicare levy surcharge alone assists families in the bracket of $50,000 to $100,000, who are currently regarded by those opposite as high income earners, because that was the basis on which it was established-high income earners. We do not have that view and we think it is better that we allow those individuals to have some choice when it comes to how their precious family budget dollars are spent. So through the tax measures, the education tax refund, the childcare tax rebate and the measures which have just gone through the House of Representatives on the Medicare levy surcharge, we deliver extra real dollars to the family budget. It is $52 per week extra based on the cameo I referred to before against $1.50 a week extra on the basis of the excise promise which those opposite do not have sufficient confidence to say to the parliament they would actually deliver when they are in government. I conclude on this: at the end of the day it is about responsible economic management, and responsible economic management means that, if you are putting downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates, you have got to deliver a decent budget surplus. We have done that with a $22 billion surplus. Those opposite have conducted a $22 billion raid on the surplus, and what that is going to produce is upward pressure on inflation, upward pressure on interest rates and therefore upward pressure on prices when it comes to those in the Australian economy currently doing it tough.

Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Fuel Prices Mrs D'ATH (2.13 pm)-My question is to the Treasurer. With the international price of oil at record highs, how does the government's FuelWatch plan stack up against any alternative promises?",84
97,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As the Prime Minister was saying before, global oil prices are the rise and that is pushing up domestic petrol prices, putting a very considerable strain on family budgets. That is why we on this side of the House are so committed to doing something practical with FuelWatch. Those on the other side of the House are fond of saying that watching petrol prices does not make them go down; that is what they have been saying. They should know: they sat in cabinet and watched them go up for 12 years. That is what they did-for 12 years they sat there and watched them go up. And they did not care what was happening to working families during that period. Now they pretend they have an answer. The shadow Treasurer spoke for 15 minutes in the House this morning when we were debating our proposals for FuelWatch. In that 15 minutes the shadow Treasurer did not once mention their proposal to cut excisenot once! The Leader of the Opposition is up here talking about it but his policy is not supported by the shadow Treasurer. He has done it again. The shadow Treasurer has dropped another clanger this morning. He said this at the doorstop interview this morning: ‘The new modelling from the ACCC is as inconclusive as the old modelling.' That is what he said this morning at the doorstop. He was asked a question by a journalist, who said, ‘Have you seen it?' Mr Turnbull answered, ‘No.' He is an expert on modelling he has never seen. His arrogance knows no bounds. Those on that side of the House do not have an alternative proposal. The only proposal they have is to blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus and put further upward pressure on inflation, interest rates and prices for average families. Economy",84
98,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his ‘Adelaide surrender' that he has done all he can to help Australian family on budgets, to the Treasurer's declaration that the budget has made Australians happy and to the Minister for Resources and Energy's attack on Labor's flawed FuelWatch stunt. Prime Minister, after only six months, is your government out of touch, out of ideas and out of control?",84
99,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let us look at the question which is being put forward by those opposite on the impact on family budgets.,85

101,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There actually is a reason why I occasionally refer to notes,85
102,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those members on my left will come to order.,85
104,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and that is, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I prefer to have one position on all policy matters, not multiple positions as the Leader of the Opposition has. He has multiple positions on inflation, multiple positions on the question of whether there should be government spending cuts, multiple positions on whether there should be means testing and multiple positions on whether they are going to support or oppose FuelWatch. The reason I am a bit careful about things is that I prefer to be consistent. would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he should be consistent as well. On the question of the budget and its impact on working families, the key thing is what you deliver into families' pockets. What can you also help working Australians with? What can you help those pensioners and carers who are doing it tough out there with? Through the budget we have provided levels of support which assist in meeting some of the cost of living pressures which working families are under. If you go to the example of a family of four that I referred to before, $2,680 per year in extra disposable income is what is delivered by this budget outcome. That results in something like $52 per week extra. I contrast that with the proposal by those opposite on excise-whether in fact they are serious about it or not. Let us go to another cameo of a family of four on a combined family income of $105,000 with no private health cover. Put all these measures together and they are better off after this budget to the total of $5,628 in extra disposable income from 2008-09. That is $108.23 per week. These are practical measures. We know from the family budget that whether it is petrol, whether it is groceries, whether it is rent, whether it is mortgages or whether it is the cost of child care, it is all going up, up and up. As a consequence of that we must ensure that we provide levels of assistance like this to help families balance the budget. That is the first thing. The second is, if you were to quantify what those opposite have put forward on the excise and actually translate it through into a figure of dollar per week assistance to the family budget-I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to do that-what does it actually add up to in terms of the total yield per week or the total yield by the end of each year? Of course overall the challenge is this: I how do you help in delivering assistance to families who are under financial pressure and to Australians doing it tough out there. You can, through the budget, invest in Australia's future through infrastructure in schools and in hospitals. You can deliver a responsible budget with a $22 billion surplus. I contrast that with those opposite, who have said, ‘Let's throw economic responsibility out the window and engender instead a $22 billion raid on the surplus.' That is not responsible economic management; that is absolute political desperation underpinned by the content of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply. Fuel Prices",85
105,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. Will the minister outline to the House the positive benefits of FuelWatch and the reasons why the government are supporting it?,86
106,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for her question. FuelWatch is the only system on offer which will halt the intraday price movements and put consumers back in charge of their purchasing decisions. We support FuelWatch because it was a unanimous recommendation of the consumers' watchdog, the ACCC. We support FuelWatch and we are pursuing FuelWatch because the ACCC and the government think that this is the way to give motorists an even chance-an even chance against the big oil companies and the petrol stations for whom the deal is stacked. Motorists and consumers often say to me, ‘Don't you think there is collusion? Don't you think the oil companies are colluding? Why do the prices all move together?' I say to those individuals, ‘No, I don't think there is collusion because they do not need to. It is all stacked in favour of the retailers. stacked in favour of the oil companies.' The oil companies and the retailers share information, and consumers and motorists are locked out. We saw today the chairman of the ACCC call the fuel market in this country as close to collusion as you can get, backing up what the ACCC said in their report that the current fuel market arrangements are conducive to anticompetitive coordination. On this side of the House we do not think that is acceptable. Apparently that does not go for members opposite. For the benefit of honourable members, in the ACCC analysis, and in the full analysis which was released today, the conclusion was that from the econometric analysis, on a conservative basis, the ACCC can say that there is no evidence that FuelWatch led to any increase in prices and it appears to have resulted in a small price decrease overall. Importantly, the ACCC has dealt with the myth perpetrated by the Leader of the Opposition that people who only buy on Tuesdays would be worse off. The ACCC said that prices decreased by an average of 0.7c per litre for the lowest day of the week. I shared with the House this morning some views of real people who have been emailing and writing to the government about the debate on FuelWatch. I got one in my email at 12.52, which I read just before I came down to the House. It is from a constituent of the honourable member for Canning. I enjoy reading my emails because it does keep you in touch. This is what the constituent of the honourable member for Canning says: Here in Perth our experience with FuelWatch has been quite good. Initially, I myself was sceptical and didn't bother about it. But when we experienced the wide price ranges from petrol stations of sometimes 20c within a radius of just a couple of kilometres of where we live, and the substantial savings by using it, we use it all the time. It is all He goes on to say: Petrol stations with the highest prices had the least customers. Informed buyers are not stupid. Considering the wide range of prices, the volume of sales are definitely greater at the cheaper ones, hence the average petrol sold in Perth is definitely lower than if there was no FuelWatch service. Brian from Canning can work it out but the member for Canning and his colleagues cannot. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, I ask that the Assistant Treasurer table the letter from my constituent.",86
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the Assistant Treasurer quoting from a document?,86
108,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I was.",86

113,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, to protect the confidentiality of the individual I am happy to table the document after removing the individual's second name. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, further to the point of order: I ask that the minister table the document with the address as well. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The standing orders with regard to questions are particularly structured to protect the privacy of individuals, including those who write letters to members of parliament, and it is not appropriate to undermine that privacy principle through the device of a request for tabling by someone who might then be able to go and visit the person.",87
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Canning made a request, as is permissible under the standing orders, for the tabling of a document. That request was handled in the way that it has been handled for many years in this place. Subsequent to that, the minister has indicated that he will be position to table a document. And I remind the House that a minister does not need leave to table a document. Has the Assistant Treasurer concluded his answer?",87
115,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Almost, Mr Speaker.",87
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Hopefully. The Assistant Treasurer has the call.,87
117,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Real people understand how FuelWatch works. They understand that it puts motorists back in charge. The shadow Treasurer's argument is that oil companies oppose FuelWatch because it benefits them. His argument is that oil companies will benefit from FuelWatch but they oppose it. I will leave the House to draw its own conclusions as to the logic of the honourable member for Wentworth's proposition. But the Australian people know who is on their side-it is the ACCC and not the oil companies. Treasurer,87
118,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer stand by his previous statement: Disciplined economic managers do not wantonly ignore the advice of Treasury.,87
119,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the front page of the member's website, where he says, ‘Disciplined economic managers do not wantonly ignore the advice of Treasury.' Leave not granted. Alcopops",87
120,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister provide information on any new research about binge drinking and the opinions of experts in the field?,87
121,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I am pleased to be able to take this opportunity to address some of the latest information that has been in a released about the consumption and sale of products that have been the focus of our binge drinking initiatives in the past. This morning and last night, the alcohol industry distributed to media outlets some recent figures on the sale of spirits. I would like to take the House through those figures, because the figures in the newspapers this morning and in the press release that was released today show that the sale of alcopops has now dropped by almost 40 per cent-a measure that the government is very pleased about. Forty per cent is quite a big decrease on its own, but when you look at the limited amount of data that has been released, what you will find is that in the latest week the most recent figures, from 11 May, actually show a 50 per cent drop. This is a staggering drop in the alcopops industry and something that we believe the distillers have deliberately understated. Mr Baldwin interjecting",87
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Paterson!,88
123,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a positive sign that sales of these products, which are designed to attract young people, to seduce them into a drinking habit, have dropped.",88
124,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,88
125,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have the members opposite begging us to address what has been the increase in the sales of some other products, so let me take those interjections since the members opposite are so keen. What this data has revealed, by the industry's own admission, is that there has been an increase the sale of a number of other products-a 20 per cent increase in the sale of hipflasks of full-strength spirits and a 21 per cent increase in the 700 ml bottles of full-strength spirits. Mr Baldwin interjecting",88
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Paterson will cease interjecting!,88
127,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is a very good question that the member for Paterson asked: how many does that equate to? What it equates to, by the industry's own admission, is an overall decline, when you look at the decrease and the increase, of 100 million-sorry, one million",88
128,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,88
129,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are only talking about two weeks. One million standard drinks of spirits fewer have been sold in a two-week period. I challenge the members opposite, whatever mathematical skills they have, to tell me that a decrease of one million sales of products is not a good reduction. Dr Nelson interjecting",88
130,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition just interjected across the table that he wrote the book on this. I tell you what, I hope young people are not reading the book that you wrote, Leader of the Opposition, because what it would show in this debate is that we have the industryMr Baldwin interjecting",88
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Paterson!,88
132,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"with a clear self-interest aligned with the opposition, and we have every other health expert in the country aligned with the government saying that this is a measure which is positive. I will take the House through some of those health professionals: Dr John Herron, a former Liberal in senator, now at the Australian National Council on Drugs; David Templeman, the CEO of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia; John Rogerson of the Australian Drug Foundation; Mike Daube from the Public Health Association; and Daryl Smeaton from the Alcohol, Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. But perhaps what will be of most interest to members opposite is that I came across a quote the other day which was given in March by the President of the AMA, Dr Rosanna Capolingua, who gave a very vivid description of the urgency that the problem of alcopops presents to us. Let me read you the quote: Alco-pops are a specific issue within the bingedrinking problem. Here you have drinks that are about affordable prices and pretty colours, particularly targeted at young girls - and we're talking about 12, 13, 14, 15-year-olds. We have to look at the alcohol industry and how it targets young people with alco-pops. It builds brand loyalty and the kids connect with a type of drink - they're hooked in. Then they go off and have an accident, or they're king hit while waiting in a queue outside a tavern, or they're raped or are having unprotected sex. That was from Dr Capolingua, who is not known for necessarily coming out and supporting the position of the government. She is the president of the AMA, a position that the Leader of the Opposition has held himself and apparently wrote the book on. What I am worried about is whether he wrote the book in the week that he supported this measure or in the week that he opposed this measure, because we do not know where the Leader of the Opposition stands on this. But this debate is becoming very clear. You have the health experts and the Rudd government on one side; you have the industry and the opposition on the other side. And there may be a little bit of deja vu in this debate, because it is very like the debate on fuel, where you have the opposition siding with industry and the Rudd government siding with the experts and the consumers. We are interested in protecting young people, and one million standard drinks fewer that have been consumed in the last two weeks is good news. Fuel Prices",88
133,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, given that the Motor Trade Association of Western Australia says that the FuelWatch scheme in Western Australia benefits big oil companies and that Woolworths says that Western Australia is its most profitable petrol retail market, will the Prime Minister now abandon his flawed FuelWatch stunt?",89
134,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me draw the honourable member's attention to another remark made today by the chairman of Australia's competition watchdog. It goes to the matters which the member has just raised: Importantly, and I have to stress this point, the fuel companies have it all over us. They have a very sophisticated price-sharing system run by a company, called Informed Sources, out of Brisbane, where they know the price that every one of their competitors is charging at every service station in the metropolitan areas of Australia at any point during the day. That is as close to collusion, it's as close to tacit coordination, as you can ever get. That is what, seriously and soberly, the chairman of Australia's competition watchdog has had to say. This is an important consideration, and the choice before the parliament in this matter is very clear-cut. You either vote in support of Australian consumers and motorists or you vote for a continued cosy deal between Australia's major oil companies. That is the choice that is alive here, and the choice which the Leader of the Opposition faces very soon is whether he is going to kill this option for Australian consumers and motorists in the future through his vote in this chamber or whether he is going to allow this to proceed so that Australian motorists have the same information available to them as big oil has available to it. Family Policy",89
135,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Minister, how has the government's approach to family policy been received?",89
136,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for her question. The government is firmly committed to economically responsible family policy. We want to have family policy that supports people who are doing it tough in this country. That is why we are introducing a number of measures to better target family payments, including payments like the baby bonus and family tax benefit part B. We will be introducing an income test that will apply at $150,000 a year-a reasonable limit for these payments. Around 280,000 families will continue to receive the baby bonus, and around 1.4 million Australian families will continue to be eligible for family tax benefit part B. We consider that it is responsible to target government support to those families who are in the most need. It is the case that these changes have been heralded by a number of commentators. ‘Praiseworthy' is the way in which Ross Gittins, the economist writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, described it. By contrast, it has taken the Leader of the Opposition quite a while to come to a position on the government's changes. It does seem like it has been a rather long and very painful process. First, he said he opposed income testing. Then he could not decide which position to take. We know he could not get his colleagues into line. Eventually, I understand, he has agreed that he will be supporting the bill. We do know that he could have gone either way because it is not as if he actually believes that family policy should be both economically responsible and fair. It is the case of course that this Leader of the Opposition has more positions on a range of issues-more positions than even a yoga instructor.",89

139,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am glad you are listening and I am glad the Leader of the Opposition is listening. I am sure he will remember what he said to the Age back in 1994. He said: I would feel equally comfortable as a moderate Liberal as I would feel in the Labor right.,90
140,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,90
141,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear my colleagues in the Labor Right indicating that they would not feel comfortable, and the moderates over there do not look very comfortable either. This is the man who wants to be considered the alternative Prime Minister of this country, and he does not know where he feels more comfortable-whether it is in the Labor Right or the moderate Liberals. He is so confused he has no idea what he stands for. On this side of the parliament we know what we stand for. We stand for an economically responsible and fair family policy. Taxation",90
142,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Treasurer's contemptuous description of the expert departmental advice from four departments in relation to FuelWatch as being, in the Treasurer's words, ‘bureaucratic and academic'. Given the Treasurer's lack of faith in Public Service advice, why did the government appoint the head of Treasury to head up the government's own ‘root and branch' tax review?",90
143,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the interesting things about the ACCC and the attitude of the member opposite and the sources of advice for pricing questions is that there is a view on the part of those opposite that all wisdom lies in the regular bureaucratic departments, whereas I am always taken by what the member for Higgins says and what he is up to. We are all taken by what he is up to in recent times-and he should inform the Leader of the Opposition of what that is in due course. The member for Higgins had this to say when this report by the ACCC was first launched: … the ACCC is an independent market regulator which has more expertise in the area of access and pricing than any other Federal Government instrumentality or agency and that is why it is very important that it is engaged in all of these pricing issues. That is what he, whom even you described yesterday as the fountain of economic wisdom, had to say when this report was launched. That is why this government, in considering its position on FuelWatch, has been entirely mindful of the econometric modelling contained within the ACCC report.",90

145,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker. Cluster Munitions",91
146,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House of developments on an agreement on a treaty banning cluster munitions?,91
147,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. Australia joined over 120 states at a diplomatic conference in Dublin, commencing 19 May, to negotiate a legally-binding convention prohibiting cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. The Australian government joined this process because we believed that the time had come for the international community to address the impact of cluster munitions, particularly those that cause indiscriminate harm to civilians long after the cessation of conflict. Australia has a good and proud record in such areas. We have long been a supporter of Mine Action and of alleviating the terrible adverse impacts of the so called explosive remnants of war on innocent civilians. Over the last decade, Australia has committed over $175 million for Mine Action and to alleviate the adverse impacts on victims. Most recently, on Mine Action Day on 4 April, the government announced a contribution of $10 million to the United Nations Mine Action program for Afghanistan. In the months and weeks leading up to the Dublin conference and during the recent negotiations, the government has worked very hard to achieve a text that delivers that important humanitarian objective that I have outlined, while at the same time safeguarding Australia's national security interests. We have worked very hard with the Australian NGO community, the non-government organisation community, with the Australian Red Cross and World Vision Australia having membership of the Australian delegation. During the period of the conference I have spoken to Norwegian and UK ministers and the Prime Minister has spoken to the Norwegian and the New Zealand prime ministers on deliberations before the conference. The news overnight from Dublin is that very good progress has been made at the conference so far as the text is concerned. A draft text has been agreed and it is expected that it will be formally adopted at the conference tomorrow. The treaty will then be opened for signature formally in a treatysigning opportunity in Oslo in December this year. States that sign the treaty can then move to formal ratification and adoption of the obligations of the treaty as state parties to it. I am pleased to advise the House that the government's preliminary consideration is that the text represents a strong humanitarian outcome, particularly with regard to protection of civilians in conflict zones, victim assistance and clearance of adversely affected areas, and is consistent with Australia's longheld humanitarian traditions. The text establishes a broad prohibition on those cluster munitions that randomly scatter battlefields with tens or hundreds of so-called submunitions and that have no self-destruct capacity, posing a threat on innocent civilians for many years to come. This does not include modern, precision guided weapons with selfdestruct capacities such as the so-called SMArt 155 antitank munition recently acquired by the ADF. The text also addresses the government's concern to ensure that cooperation between nations through peacekeeping and other joint operations with states who may not become party to the treaty is able to continue-for example, the United States. This cooperation, formally known as interoperability, is a vital pillar of Australia's strategic security and defence arrangements. It is also a vital element of Australia's ongoing peacekeeping operations, and I note that today is formally the 60th anniversary of the start of the United Nations peacekeeping operations in which Australia first took part. I congratulate the Irish government on the hosting of the conference. I congratulate the Norwegian government on its leadership in initiating this negotiation and this process. Members of course would be aware over a long period of time that Australia has worked very closely with Norway on non-proliferation and disarmament measures. I congratulate the Australian delegation, in particular Ambassador Caroline Miller, who so ably led the delegation. Ambassador Miller is of course our Ambassador for Disarmament and our permanent rep to the UN in Geneva. I am pleased to conclude by advising the House that, whilst the government will review carefully all of the elements of the treaty text the lead-up to its opening for signature in December, I am very optimistic-indeed, very confident-that Australia will be in a position to sign this treaty before the end of the year.",91
148,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, if I may, Mr Speaker, I strongly associate the opposition with the remarks of the foreign minister. Fuel Prices",92
149,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, given that your four key economic departments had provided advice to the cabinet that petrol prices may rise as a result of Labor's FuelWatch, can the Prime Minister explain why the Assistant Treasurer, in a letter to me of 16 April 2008, asserted: There is simply no independent advice that has reached the conclusion that there is any upward pressure on petrol prices through FuelWatch.",92
150,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government in framing FuelWatch has been entirely mindful of not just the advice contained within the econometric analysis within the ACCC report but, as the Assistant Treasurer has also referred, subsequent advice provided to him as well. These have been skipped over, I notice, by those opposite today. When we speak of departmental advice I also draw to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth that the ACCC falls within the Treasury portfolio. It is there and it has the characteristics described, I think, accurately and elegantly by the member for Higgins-and I do not often say that about the member for Higgins-when he said that the ACCC is an independent regulatorMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition in quoted from a letter from the Assistant Treasurer which stated that there is simply no independent advice that has reached the conclusion that there is any upward pressure on petrol prices",92
151,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the point of order is simply on relevance, the Prime Minister is responding to the question.",92
152,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So I am fully endorsing the member for Higgins in this particular observation that the ACCC is an independent regulator and, as I have just said, falls within the Treasurer's portfolio. It is not a minor matter. It is not an agency staffed with people who are not up to the task. In fact it has the range of expertise unique in the areas of access and pricing. This is quoting exactly what your economic hero the former Treasurer had to say about this particular body. Furthermore, in the subsequent econometric modelling which has been put out by the ACCC today, I draw again to the attention of honourable members the conclusion at the end of this document. I notice that they are not making any questions on the basis of this document because it is so definitiveMr Hockey-There is nothing in it!",92
153,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would suggest that this conclusion is definitive. It says: The purpose of this econometric analysis has been to satisfy the ACCC that the introduction of the FuelWatch scheme nationally would not, based on the experience in Western Australia, to consumers paying higher prices for petrol. From econometric analysis on a conservative basis, the ACCC can say that there is no evidence that FuelWatch led to any increase in prices, it appears to have resulted in a small price decrease overall. The government has been entirely mindful of this advice in framing its position on FuelWatch. It is a contentious matter for debatewe recognise that. But we have turned to the same agency that the former Treasurer turned to in seeking advice on this matter in the first place. If those opposite contest that that is what the former Treasurer was saying when he made those remarks back in June-July last year, I suggest they raise it with the member for Higgins. Climate Change",93
154,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Will the minister outline the government's commitment to responsible economic management through taking responsibility for tackling the challenge of climate change?",93
155,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. Responsible economic management and a resolute commitment to tackling climate change go hand in hand. They are the necessary foundations for building a sustainable Australia, economically and environmentally. And that commitment to responsible economic management is underwritten by Labor's $3.3 billion in the federal budget climate change program commitment. This is an unprecedented investment in meeting the greatest social, economic and environmental challenge we face. We know the investment is unprecedented because it compares with a commitment of $2.8 billion in the last coalition budget. In fact, that figure of $2.8 billion contained in lead last year's environment budget overview was the coalition's claimed total spending on climate change since 1996 and projected out as far as 2020. The Rudd Labor government has already committed more to meeting the challenge of climate change in our first budget than the last government did in their entire 12 years in office and projected over another 12. And it is not just about headline figures; the government has a strategic approach to ensuring Australia reduces its greenhouse gas emissions at the least cost cost. At the centrepiece is an emissions-trading schemeruled out by the previous leader of the Liberal Party in his term here as Prime Minister. This will be a most substantial reform-to use the market to drive a least-cost approach to delivering Australia's emission reduction targets in the future. It will be complemented by a range of measures addressing non-price barriers and, importantly, reducing the overall cost of tackling climate change. We are committed to a 20 per cent renewable energy target to help Australian households and communities tackle climate change. We are investing $1 billion, including $300 million for low-interest green loans, $150 million for energy-saving insulation in rental homes and $480 million to make every school a solar school. As sea levels rise we understand the fundamental point that the risks and associated costs of neglect of climate change are greater than the cost of action. The Rudd Labor government's budget is the first down payment on tackling this great challenge. It is an investment that is economically responsible both in the immediate term and with a view to secure a sustainable Australia in the future. Where is the opposition going on this critical issue? We should not forget that the Liberal Party has form on climate change12 years of climate change denial, 11th hour makeovers as the election came on and people got concerned about climate change, and suddenly wasteful and expensive climateclever green wash, but it just did not stick. The Australian public was not fooled by this. As the headlines and the reports continue to pour in, with more evidence of the impact climate change will have on our coastline, our farming communities and our way of life, we look in vain for the Liberal Party take climate change seriously. Yet the opposition leader's budget reply, all 3,500 words of it, mentioned climate change just once, and even then it was the familiar Liberal Party scaremongering-all about the perils and costs of acting and nothing about the truly perilous consequences and missed economic opportunities if we do not act. The Leader of the Opposition said, ‘We'll be back to you on a carbon price,' and that has been his contribution in the House on climate change. But this is not a time for scaremongering; it is a time for rising to the challenge of sound economic management which recognises the critical importance of ensuring that Australians have a sustainable future. And that is exactly what this government is delivering-$3.3 billion on climate change for the Australian people. Fuel Prices",93
156,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to a statement on FuelWatch by the Assistant Treasurer on 27 April 2008 on Sky News. He said that the government will be: ... covering the cost of the setup, and there'll be no increased compliance costs for service stations whatsoever. Given the Treasury has estimated that the cost to small business of FuelWatch would be $4,000 per annum, does the Prime Minister stand by his minister's statement?",94
157,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do, and both the Assistant Treasurer and I said this when we did a press conference together just before coming into the chamber. The Leader of the National Party would have been better advised to have observed our comments then rather than expend a question in the way that he just has. The text of the government's decision on this matter was that there would be no net establishment costs to participating retailers; these net establishment costs for participating reto tailers would be zero. That is a decision which we took at the time, and we stand by that decision because we recognised a couple of things. One is that there are already cost imposts on retailers in this sector because many of them are either required or are participating inMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was not about establishment costs; it was $4,000 per annumthat means every year.",94
158,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,94
159,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When cabinet considered this matter it was entirely mindful of any compliance costs faced by business. That is why we took the decision that we did. We are unapologetically a party that supports business, and we are unapologetically a party which believes that we have got to get behind our small business entrepreneurs out there rather than leave them in the lurch like those opposite have done by doing nothing to assist them in practical terms after 12 long years in office. We stand by the decision we took as a cabinet and we will honour that commitment. Laser Pointers",95
160,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. Will the minister inform the House about the latest information regarding laser pointers being pointed at aircraft?,95
161,Mr DEBUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. I expect that the House will be interested to hear that the government will ban the importation of laser pointers above one milliwatt, with the regulation to take effect from 1 July. That means that lasers will, rightly, be treated like other dangerous weapons like knives, tasers and crossbows. Last year there were 325 laser incidents involving aircraft reported to the department of transport, and yesterday in Senate estimates the Office of Transport Security revealed that since January this year there had been 563 attacks. It is obviously concerning. Those sorts of numbers are of major concern considering the potentially devastating consequences an attack could have. Indeed, aircraft pilots are very anxious to see these changes. Obviously there are legitimate uses for high-powered lasers-in the construction and mining industries, in surveying and in astronomy. Therefore, under the government's new regulation, importers will have to obtain police authorisation from the relevant state or territory police force before applying for an import permit. Customs will work with them to make sure that they are aware of the new scheme and know how to access it. I do not pretend that this ban can immediately prevent all illegal use of lasers. There are thousands of them already in the community. Several jurisdictions-Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory-have already introduced laws banning possession of lasers, and similar laws are at present before the parliament of New South Wales. Of course, this import ban has to be supplemented by these kinds of possession laws if it is to be effective. It is difficult to locate the source of laser lights directed at aircraft and therefore to apprehend offenders. There is often a long distance between the origin of a laser light and its target. Nevertheless, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Air Services Australia are working with the Australian Federal Police to improve procedures for detection of these incidents, and the AFP is working on a mapping system which will help narrow down the location of the light source. I thank Customs, the Attorney-General's Department and other agencies for their work in getting this ban quickly in place. Together with the state possession laws, involving significant jail terms, I am confident that the new Commonwealth regulation restricting laser importation will restrict the availability of laser devices and help us to change the culture which has led some people in our society to so disregard the potentially disastrous effects of their improper use. Fuel Prices",95
162,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister release the regulatory impact statement provided to cabinet which fully examines the costs and impact of FuelWatch? Will the minister guarantee that, if the regulatory impact statement is released, has not been altered since being presented to cabinet?",95
163,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer to the member's question is no. Mr Dutton-You won't guarantee it hasn't been altered?,96
164,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked and answered. Employment,96
165,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is the Minister for Employment Participation. Will the minister inform the House about how the government will support Australians looking for work?,96
166,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank the member for Forde for his question. It is a very important question, and I know he shows a great deal of concern about job seekers in his electorate. The government wants to boost the nation's workforce to improve productivity and ensure that we stay globally competitive. Employment participation is one of the key elements of the government's war on inflation. This inflation legacy-the highest inflation in 16 years-was bestowed upon the Australian people by the previous Liberal government and needs to be tackled on all fronts. Increasproportion ing participation in our workforce, of course, is also a foundation of the government's social inclusion agenda. We know that having a job creates opportunities for financial independence and personal fulfilment. The previous government were lucky but lazy. An unprecedented mining boom, of course, led to a welcome fall in unemployment, but the Howard government sat back and did what all Tory governments always do: they let the nation's natural resources do the work for them instead of doing the work as a government. They ignored, for example, 20 Reserve Bank warnings on the skills crisis it that besets this country. They constantly ignored the warnings of the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and other employer bodies who were crying out for the government to address the skills crisis. Of course, as we know, recently the shadow Treasurer has informed us, either in this place or publicly, that he does not believe there is a skills shortage in this country. The only skills shortages he likes to talk about are those that are exhibited by the Leader of the Opposition. That is the reality in this place. The only thing the shadow Treasurer likes to do is to get on the phone, and also use his email, to indicate how much he thinks the Leader of the Opposition is deficient as the leader of the party opposite. He is happy to talk about those skills shortages all day long. We know that the Howard government also ignored those who remain unemployed and failed to adjust employment programs to suit the new workforce circumstances. Mr Simpkins-That's not right!",96
167,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will give you a few facts, Sunshine. There is no greater reminder of the Howard government's policy inertia than the fact that the of the very long-term unemployed more than doubled over the life of the Howard government. In 1999, one in 10 job seekers had been on income support for longer than five years. By 2007, this rose dramatically to almost one in four-one in four job seekers who had been on income support for more than five years. The current Job Network system as we know it is outdated and is being strangled by red tape. Job Network fails to sufficiently assist the highly disadvantaged people and we are going to address those concerns. The other thing that the Rudd government has done because of the failure of the previous government is to listen to employers who have been crying out for training to provide the proper skills for the vacancies that exist in this country. That is why this government has a plan to provide 238,000 training places for job seekers over the course of the next five years at the cost of $880 million. This is a massive boost in training for job seekers and it is something that employer bodies and employers have been asking for. It is something they asked the previous government to attend to and of course they failed. We know that is a critical area and we will address that. The second fundamental change in our approach to assisting job seekers is providing a work culture. The government will deliver a new system commencing in July next year that will instil a work culture through a no show, no pay rule. If you turn up and do what is required you will receive your benefit but if you do not turn up without reasonable excuse your income will be dockedjust like a real job. Just like a real job, your income will be docked if you do not turn up without reasonable excuse. This approach will be more effective than the harsh and counterproductive imposition of the eightweek non-payment period. Not only does this current approach push job seekers further away from employment; there is mounting evidence to show it is leading to family breakdown, homelessness and impoverishment. We know that we have got this new proposal right. I welcome the support across the political spectrum with respect to our new proposal. We have certainly been applauded by the Brotherhood of St Laurence with respect to this particular matter. They believe it is and more effective system. The Executive Director of the Institute of Public Affairs, John Roskam-no friend of the Labor Party-the former chief of staff of former education minister David Kemp has said he agrees with the Brotherhood of St Laurence in supporting the government's position with respect to this. He said that it is a better approach. He said: I agree with Tony Nicholson on this. If we can make the system more flexible it will get a better result, mainly to get people to stay engaged. So we have the Institute of Public Affairs and the Brotherhood of St Laurence and many other bodies coming out and supporting this system because we are attending to the training issues that were ignored by the previous government and a skills crisis that was ignored by the previous ministers that sit opposite. That is the reality. We are attending to that. Mr Simpkins interjecting",96
168,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Cowan is now warned!,97
169,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are not into playing games like those opposite. We are about getting on with the business of government, addressing the skills crisis in this country and putting productivity back on the nation's agenda. Ms Roxon- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. During that answer I heard the member for Bowman make a quite offensive comment about the Brotherhood of St Laurence. I ask that he withdraw that comment. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on that point of order, I certainly did not hear that, but at the same time when a comment is made it is asked to be withdrawn at the time the comment is made; therefore, I would suggest that it should be ruled out of order. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, if it assists a fair you, the comment was also offensive to members of this side of the House. The comment was, ‘How much did you pay them?' alleging that we had bribed the Brotherhood of St Laurence. That is offensive to us and it is offensive to them.",97

I refer the minister to the advice of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet which warned that FuelWatch would involve increased compliance costs of $4,000 a year to affected small businesses.

181,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer his answer through the chair.,98
182,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I will read it out to him. At the government's urging the FuelWatch scheme was designed in such a way as to minimise any compliance costs. There is no need for businesses to establish and maintain IT infrastructure to communicate with the ACCC under the approved FuelWatch scheme. They can use a toll-free number. They will still have to notify petrol prices to the ACCC but this is a once-a-day event and integral to the scheme as a whole. I compare that with present subscribers to Informed Sources. Do you know about Informed Sources?",98
183,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,98
184,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left will curb their enthusiasm.,98
185,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under Informed Sources those subscribers must subscribe and notify of any price changes many times a day. Under this scheme they will have to do it only once. Treasury has ensured that the legislation is simple and easy to comply with. There is no need to establish recordkeeping IT systems or records on petrol prices. The ACCC will wear the cost and will keep the records. My attention has been drawn to a statement that has obviously just been made today by the Queensland Liberal leader Mark MCArdle-he is a relatively new leader in Queensland. He was on ABC radio today and I am advised that he has contradicted his federal counterparts and expressed support for FuelWatch. Mr MCArdle says FuelWatch is worth considering. He said: The issues around FuelWatch are very complicated, but certainly it is an initiative that to have worked in Western Australia and I think it should be looked at here in Queensland and across Australia as well. Go Mark! He said: I understand that my federal colleagues may have a different view, but that is their point of view. Here is the Liberal leader in Queensland saying FuelWatch is worth considering. So, Brendan, give Mark-the Liberal leader in Queensland-a ring on the toll-free number. Ring Mark MCArdle. Mark MCArdle knows what is in the interests of motorists.

They support FuelWatch and so they should, and it is about time you got onside. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On his way to the dispatch box, the minister was handed an answer, which he read. I ask him to table the answer which he read off that piece of paper, which is in his hand.",99

193,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Would the minister update the House on excavation activities at the site of the Battle of Fromelles?,99
194,Mr SNOWDON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Further to the answer that I gave to the House yesterday, I would like to advise the House that work has resumed at Pheasant Wood following the inspection of the site by the French police who approved the continuation of the dig. However, at this stage no further discoveries have been made. The meeting of the Fromelles Evaluation Group agreed on a tighter security regime and agreed that work should continue until 13 June and that investigation should proceed on the future of the land. I should mention, however, that conditions at the excavation are proving quite difficult. The watertable is high, requiring pumps and waste water storage; the clay is very heavy and quite difficult to dig, so hand trowels are being used, and that is necessary for the care needed in such a delicate task. I have been overwhelmed by the public response to the decision to proceed with his dig. Yesterday I paid tribute to Mr Lambis Englezos for his support and, indeed, leadership in providing us with guidance as to where we might look. I would also like to give recognition today to General Leahy, Chief of Army, who acceded to requests to consider the evidence objectively and to obtain expert advice. It is indeed a salutary feeling for a modern commander to remain committed to recovering those lost in old battles. But I also want to recognise that this parliament is no stranger to the debate over the recovery of the missing; nor, should I say, are we strangers to the people who fought at Fromelles. Indeed, General ‘Pompey' Elliott, who led the devastated 15th Brigade from Victoria on that fateful night in July 1916, tried to prevent the attack from proceeding and wept inconsolably the next morning at his 1,600 casualties, was a senator in the parliament for two terms. Sadly, though, he took his own life. That perhaps is an illustration of how disaster can ruin lives-not just through death in battle but through the horror of the memories. It is worth pointing to the difficulty that confronted him at that battle and what he said following it. He said not soon after: I presume there was some plan at the back of the attack but it is difficult to know what it was. I trust those who gave the order may be made to realise their responsibility. The general who gave the order, General Haking, is quoted as saying of that battle that the experience would do the Australians ‘a great deal of good'. This was, of course, after General Elliott further said, some years later, about the battle, ‘It was a wretched, hybrid scheme which might well be described as a tactical abortion.' In conclusion, I also want to remind the House that 1,300 men were missing after that battle. A mass grave for 410 Australians already exists at VC Corner, just down the road from Pheasant Wood. Even if the Pheasant Wood site is proven and approximately 170 lost souls are in fact identified as being Australian-and we think we may know who they are-many hundreds more remain missing. There are in fact 7,243 individual graves in France, Belgium and Gallipoli marked ‘Known only to God'. I undertook yesterday to keep the parliament and the public informed of progress, especially the families, who have such a keen interest, and I will continue to do so. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Fuel Prices",99

198,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"On pages 46 and 47 of yesterday's Hansard there is a record of events that occurred after the suspension motion for the member for O'Connor. The member for O'Connor would have been due to return to the House at about 2.14 pm this afternoon, as I understand it. I first of all apologise for two things. You will find at the top of page 47 I got a little carried away with myself and used the royal ‘we' in saying: We will deal with him when he returns. I also apologise for making the Chief Opposition Whip's task in keeping the member for O'Connor in town a bit more difficult. But, upon reflection of the events following the decision of the House, it would have been my intention to indicate to the House that I would not be taking any further action. At the time, the member, in progressing out of the House, made comments that I believed to be a reflection against the chair. It was on that basis that I sought that he return to apologise. After further consideration, I understand that it was not a reflection on the chair. There is therefore a lesser transgression that occurred-that is, the member for O'Connor did not go quietly! But I explain to the chamber that, if that had been the case, I would have applied standing order 271, which applies to common sense: I would have ignored his comments and let him go, and there would have been no record in the Hansard. I do not see this as a precedentand I hope that others will not undertake to use it as a precedent-but I believe that, to my mind, this suffices to conclude this incident.

203,Ms GILLARD,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (3.30 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Lifting workforce participation is one of the key aspects of the Rudd government's five point fight against inflation. We know that for many parents the accessibility and affordability of quality child care affects their decisions about staying in or returning to the workforce. An ABS survey has found that concerns about the quality, accessibility and affordability of child care were important factors in the decisions of 85,000 secondary earners to stay out of the workforce. Child care has become an integral part of modern Australian family life. More than 700,000 Australian families use child care each year. In the last five years childcare costs have grown much faster than the price of other goods and services. In the 12 months to June 2007 alone, after factoring in childcare benefit, childcare costs rose by 12.8 per cent, the fifth year in a row of double-digit increases. That is why federal Labor developed its Affordable Child Care Plan-a $1.6 billion investment in the future of Australian families and in Australia's future economic prosperity. This commitment is part of an overall $2.4 billion investment over the next five years in integrated early childhood initiatives that will provide high-quality services for young children and help build a productive, modern economy for Australia's future Through this bill the government is making good on its election commitments. This bill will increase the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-ofpocket childcare costs-up to $7,500 per child per year. It will also allow the rebate be paid quarterly, rather than annually, helping parents to meet the costs of child care as they arise. The changes to childcare tax rebate will make child care much more affordable for working families, making it easier for those families who want, or need, to return to work. These changes are supported by an agenda that will deliver rigorous quality standards and expand the supply of quality child care and early learning. This bill also contains a number of amendments which will enhance the operation of the Child Care Management System to ensure payments to families are delivered in a timely and efficient way. The government is also making good on its commitment to responsible economic management by reducing the value of payments for those who can most afford it. From July 2008 there will no longer be a minimum rate of childcare benefit for approved care. This will only affect high-income families. This is an extension of the current system where a family's income affects the amount of CCB they receive. However, instead of the rate reducing only down to a minimum rate, it will continue to reduce until the family's rate is zero. The income levels at which the payment cuts out completely will depend on the number of children using approved child care. This means that high-income families will no longer receive any childcare benefit. Families using approved care that were eligible for childcare tax rebate before the changes will continue to be eligible for the childcare tax rebate. Overall families will gain more assistance through the childcare tax rebate changes than they lose in childcare benefit. This change will not affect childcare benefit for registered care-that is, care provided by relatives, friends or nannies who have to registered with the Family Assistance Office. The bill also includes a range of measures that make improvements to childcare benefit compliance. This includes extending pecuniary penalties to service providers who contravene their obligations under the current legislation. The bill also amends powers of entry for authorised officers to improve their ability to determine if a service is complying with family assistance law. It will also introduce a number of other changes which will enhance the integrity of outlays of childcare benefit by making childcare service providers' requirements clearer. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to Australian families to make child care more affordable and to ensure taxpayers' money is used correctly. It is an important step in the government's plan to provide access to affordable, high-quality child care to all Australian children. Debate (on motion by Mr Ian Macfarlane) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",101
204,Ms GILLARD,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (3.36 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to implement the Rudd government's education revolution 2008-2009 budget package in higher education. These measures carry through on our election commitments. The government's immediate priorities for higher education implemented through this bill will address skills shortages in critical areas, restore equity and support access to higher education, and fund places and infrastructure in key areas. The commitments delivered in this bill are complemented by the budget's two major education infrastructure initiatives-the Better Universities Renewal Fund and the Education Investment Fund-that together will begin the process of restoring university facilities after years of being run-down under the Howard government. These funds will fund major infrastructure investments in our universities. These initiatives are part of the government's commitment to ensuring higher education plays a leading role in equipping Australians with the knowledge and skills to make Australia a more productive and prosperous nation. This bill makes important amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to address urgent and immediate priorities. One such priority is to amend the act to provide considerable incentives for students to study mathematics and science at university. The maximum annual student contribution amount for students studying mathematics, including statistics, or science units will be reduced from $7,412 a year to the lowest national priority rate of $4,162 in 2009 for an equivalent full-time student load. Commencing maths and science students will enjoy the same rate as students studying education and nursing units of study. These are all areas of particular workforce need. Existing students will also benefit if they transfer into a mathematics or science course. The bill also ensures that higher education providers' funding for mathematics, statistics and science units will be maintained by compensating them for lost revenue associated with this measure. This will be through a new Transitional Loading under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. The bill will also provide incentives for maths and science graduates to pursue related careers through the new HECS-HELP benefit, which implements the government's policy for HELP debt ‘remissions'. The HECS-HELP benefit will encourage graduates to pursue careers in mathematics and science, including teaching these subjects in secondary schools. The HECS-HELP benefit will also encourage early childhood education teachers to work in areas of particular need.",103
205,The HECS,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"HELP benefit will reduce an eligible person's compulsory HELP repayment. For certain eligible persons, if no compulsory repayment is required to be made, the benefit may be a reduction in the person's accumulated HELP debt. The amendments to the act provide the framework for the HECS-HELP benefit and for the details of the eligibility requirements and the amount of the benefit to be specified in HECS-HELP benefit guidelines. It is proposed that the guidelines will vide for the HECS-HELP benefit to be claimable for a total lifetime limit of 260 weeks, the equivalent of five years. A person will receive a benefit for an income year based on the number of weeks in the year for which they are eligible. The HECS-HELP benefit will be claimable from the 2008-09 income year onwards. An application for the benefit will be made to the taxation commissioner, generally at the same time as a person lodges their tax return. The maths and science HECS-HELP benefit will be available to people who graduate from a maths or science course from the second semester of 2008 onwards, having undertaken that course as a Commonwealth supported student, and who are employed in a related occupation, including the teaching of maths or science at secondary school. The early childhood education HECSHELP benefit will be available to eligible people who have graduated at any time from an early childhood education teaching course undertaken as a ‘HECS' liable or Commonwealth supported student, and who are employed as a teacher in an early childhood setting in an eligible location-regardless of whether their repayment income is such that they are required to make a ‘compulsory repayment amount' in the income year. Another of the government's key election commitments reflected in this bill is to ensure that students gain access to higher education on merit and not on ability to pay by phasing out full-fee-paying undergraduate places for domestic students in public universities from 2009. From 1 January 2009, universities will not be able to enrol a new domestic undergraduate student on a fee-paying basis, except in circumstances where the act prohibits their enrolment as a Commonwealth supported student. Additional exceptions are for stuprodents who accepted a fee-paying place this year but have deferred taking it up and for students who commenced their courses as overseas students but later become domestic students. Fee-paying students who began their courses before 2009 will be able to continue their courses on a fee-paying basis. The government will allocate up to 11,000 new Commonwealth supported places by 2011 to replace the full-fee-paying places that will be phased out from 2009. Funding for the places will be ongoing. If universities demonstrate that assistance is required to ensure the delivery of replacement Commonwealth supported places, the government may provide additional funding, over and above that for the places, through the new transitional loading that is being introduced through this bill. In addition to the measures I have already outlined, the bill will also provide for increased funding under the act: - for additional Commonwealth supported places in early childhood education and nursing; - for the expansion of Commonwealth scholarships including the doubling of the number of undergraduate scholarships from 44,000 to 88,000 by 2012 and the doubling of the total number of Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) holders to nearly 10,000 by 2012; - for capital infrastructure, additional Commonwealth supported places and clinical outreach funding for the establishment of the James Cook University Dental School; and - for capital infrastructure and additional Commonwealth supported places in medicine, nursing and education at the University of Notre Dame Australia. Mr Speaker, the measures in this bill, in addition to our commitment to the $11 billion Education Investment Fund and the $500 million Better Universities Renewal Funding (BURF) that are not covered by the act, represent the start of the government's education revolution in higher education. Together with addressing these immediate priorities, the government will take its reforms further to make long-term, systemic improvement in the higher education sector through the Review of Australian Higher Education, led by Emeritus Professor Denise Bradley AC. This is important work. It will report on the future direction of the sector, capacity to meet the needs of the Australian economy, and the options available for ongoing reform. The government's response to the review will build on this legislative package that I present to you today. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ian Macfarlane) adjourned.

206,Ms GILLARD,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (3.45 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. In the first sitting week of this parliament, the Rudd government apologised to Indigenous Australians for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on our fellow Australians. At the time, the Prime Minister made the point that this is not the end of the government's commitment, but the start. If Australia is to be truly reconciled there must first be an acknowledgement of past wrongs, but this must be followed up with actions to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Shortly after the national apology, I was proud to introduce amendments to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 which appropriated funding for the its first of our election commitments to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous outcomes-an initiative to provide an additional 200 teachers in the Northern Territory. Today, during Reconciliation Week, I introduce further amendments to the act to appropriate funding for another two initiatives aimed at closing the gap. The primary purpose of this bill is to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 by appropriating additional funding of $8.353 million in the 2008 calendar year to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous students. This amount, when indexed under the provisions of the act, will amount to $9.050 million in 2008 prices and is part of an $85.3 million package over four years. The remaining funding for 2009 and beyond will be appropriated through subsequent legislation. This funding will be used for the expansion of intensive literacy and numeracy programs for Indigenous students, professional development support to assist teachers to develop individual learning plans for their Indigenous students and the provision of three new boarding college facilities for digenous secondary school students in the Northern Territory. In 2006, a 13 to 32 per cent gap existed between the proportion of Indigenous students who achieve years 3, 5 and 7 reading, writing and numeracy benchmarks and the proportion of all students who achieve the same benchmarks. The Australian government places great importance on achieving better educational outcomes for Indigenous students and has made a commitment to assist education providers to have the literacy and numeracy achievement gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students through the $56.4 million Building Strong Foundations program. This program will assist education providers to ascertain which intensive literacy and numeracy programs are demonstrating the best results with Indigenous students so that what is working in one school can be tried in other schools. Funds will be used to establish an evidence base around innovative literacy and numeracy projects which will contribute to a national menu of best practice. Education providers will be able to choose programs from this menu to suit the needs of their tems, schools or Indigenous students and integrate them into their teaching. With the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students greatest in numeracy, early focus of the program. The program will also provide teachers with extra materials and support to assist them to prepare and maintain individual learning plans for every Indigenous student for each year of schooling up to year 10. This measure will complement the National Action Plan on Literacy and Numeracy with resources to assist education providers In- to have the gap in literacy and numeracy outcomes between Indigenous and nonIndigenous students over the next decade. The second measure this bill provides for is the government's commitment to provide additional funding of $28.9 million over four years to construct and operate three new secondary boarding colleges in the Northern Territory. These facilities are expected to cater for 152 Indigenous students from remote areas. The proportion of young Indigenous people living in remote areas who reach year 12 is approximately half that of their metropolitan peers, and only one in 10 actually completes year 12. Approximately one in four 15to 19-year-old Indigenous people lives in a remote area. An additional capital contribution of $15 million will be provided from the Indigenous Land Corporation which is committed to establishing student hostels to enable Indigenous young people from remote areas to obtain secondary school education. Agreement on the siting of boarding facilities and their construction will be negotiated with Indigenous communities and their representatives, the Indigenous Land Corporation and Northern Territory education prosysviders. Management options for these facilities will be developed in consultation with relevant education providers, local communities, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd and other interthis will be an ested parties. The increased funding for this program will provide support for Indigenous young people to relocate from remote and regional areas to access high standards of education, training and employment opportunities not otherwise available to them. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ian Macfarlane) adjourned. NA NA (EMPLOYMENT ENTRY PAYMENT) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",105
207,Ms GILLARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (3.52 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Consistent with its theme of responsible economic management, the government identified a number of programs that were inefficient or wasteful, or were largely duplicated elsewhere. The employment entry payment is one such scheme. The employment entry payment was initially introduced in 1989 to assist with costs associated with taking up employment. Since then, three other schemes have been introduced which provide similar or better assistance and which are more flexible in their application. These are the special employment advance, job seeker accounts provided via the Job Network, and the working credit. Further improvement will be implemented under the new employment services model. This bill will repeal the employment entry payment, effective from 1 July 2008. Removal of the payment will simplify the assistance available to those commencing work, particularly in relation to the complex interactions now in place between the employment entry payment and the special employment advance and will realise savings of $60.8 million over five years and deliver on the government's commitment to responsible economic management. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ian Macfarlane) adjourned. DENTAL BENEFITS BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",107
208,Ms ROXON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The bill will allow the government to deliver on a key part of its election commitment to improve dental health for working families and address Australia's dental crisis. The Medicare Teen Dental Plan is the first part of the Rudd government's plan for improving dental services in Australia. The second part is a new Commonwealth Dental Health Program, through which the Commonwealth will provide additional funding to the states and territories to reduce public dental waiting lists. In the recent budget, the government announced funding of $780 million over five years for these two new dental programs. We are providing $490 million over five years for the Medicare Teen Dental Plan and $290 million over three years for the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. These significant commitments will help ease Australia's dental crisis, end the blame game, and start addressing the parlous state of Australia's dental health-the dire state of which should be laid at the feet of the Howard government: they closed the Labor government's previous Commonwealth Dental Health Program and refused point-blank to work with the states on addressing this growing problem for a decade. Before discussing in greater detail the policies which the Rudd government is implementing through this bill, I want to outline the magnitude of the problem which we have inherited from the previous government. Latest estimates still remain at about 650,000 Australians languishing on public dental waiting lists. Thirty per cent of Australians are reported to have avoided dental care due to the cost of services. Fifty thousand people end up in hospital each year with preventable dental conditions, putting more pressure on our public hospitals not to mention the pain and agony those individuals go through. These problems with accessing affordable dental care have contributed to the dismal and deteriorating state of Australians' dental health. Tooth decay is Australia's most prevalent health problem, with gum disease ranking as the fifth highest. Over a quarter of the Australian adult population have untreated dental decay-untreated because they are not accessing the dental care they require. What is most troubling is that poor dental health is starting with our kids. It then becomes entrenched as our kids transition as teenagers to adulthood. For example, between 1996 and 1999, five-year-olds experienced a 21.7 per cent increase in deciduous decay. Children in lower socio-economic groups experience tooth decay at twice the rate of children in higher socio-economic groups. In New South Wales, in the decade between 1994 and 2004, there was a 91 per cent increase in hospitalisation rates for children under five for the removal or restoration of teeth-that is, the hospitalisation rate has nearly doubled. I know that the Deputy Speaker and I share a particular interest in this being mothers of children of that age. Neither of us would like to see our children unnecessarily in hospital, as I am sure no parent would. This poor dental health deteriorates even further through teenage years. According to dental health experts, there is a fourfold increase in dental decay between the ages of 12 and 21. Almost half of all teenagers have some signs of gum disease. According to the OECD, the rapid deterioration in dental health occurring in teenage years leads to the dental health of Australian adults ranking second worse in the OECD. This comes after a history of very good ratings in the past. This alarming state of affairs is even worse among the poorest and most needy Australians. Concession card holders, such as pensioners, have lost on average 3.5 more teeth than non-concession card holders. The children of concession card holders have over 50 per cent more decayed teeth than those of non-concession card holders. Above all, when we talk about statistics and waiting lists, preventable hospitalisations and decay rates, we must always remember we are talking about people. We are talking about Australians who sometimes have such severe dental problems that it affects not only their health, but their work and personal lives. We are talking about pensioners who may not be able to eat food comfortably or easily and teenagers whose confidence to go out in the world to study and work is badly affected. We are talking about everyday Australians who will not visit their friends, who cannot apply for a job or cannot get a job, simply because they cannot get the dental treatment that they need. It is clear from these terrible facts that Australian working families need action on dental health. As we know, rather than addressing these problems, the Howard government spent much of the past decade cynically playing the blame game. Rather than taking any responsibility, the previous government passed the buck. They shifted blame. They repeated the all too familiar mantra that it was the states' fault. the past decade, the previous Commonwealth government did nothing to address the dental crisis in Australia. They did nothing but say that dental health was not their responsibility and blame the states. But it was the Howard government that helped create some of these problems in the first place. As I have mentioned, one of the first acts of their government was to scrap the previous Labor government's Commonwealth Dental Health Program, ripping $100 million a year from the public dental system-and this led to the explosion in public dental waiting lists that we see today. Then, belatedly, the Howard government introduced a dental scheme whose referral processes and eligibility criteria were so complex and restrictive that few people could access it. I do acknowledge that, for those able to navigate their way through the complicated referral process and the red tape, the program offered some help. But many people missed out-often the most needy in our community. For example, over four years of the previous government's scheme, right up to 30 April 2008, in the whole of the Northern Territory, no services at all had been provided to children and young adults up to the age of 24. We know that the Northern Territory has some of the poorest, most marginalised people in our Indigenous communities. We know that they have some of the worse dental health problems in Australia. But how many of these young people did the previous government's scheme help? Not one at allzero. Across all age groups in the Northern Territory the picture is similarly poor-only 28 people accessing treatment over nearly four years. In South Australia, over four years, no For services at all had been provided to children up to the age of 14. Again, zero. This means that, during the entire term of the Howard government, no child born and raised in South Australia or the Northern Territory got any assistance at all from their failed dental scheme. In Tasmania, over four years, only eight people up to the age of 24 have received these services. That is only two young people a year on average. And the picture is similarly poor in the larger states. Only 52 people in Queensland under the age of 20 accessed the previous government's program over four years. On average, that is only about one young person a month over four years across the whole of Queensland. Only 94 people in the whole of Victoria under the age of 20 have received services in nearly four years. On average, that is only about two young people a month over four years across the whole of Victoria. These figures are nothing to be proud of. They clearly show that the previous government's dental scheme had failed. In total, over almost four years to 30 April, the Howard government's failed dental scheme will have spent less than $50 million (currently it stands at about $42.8 million). This compares to the investment provided in the budget of $780 million by the Rudd Labor government and the new dental programs that will be introduced and run over the next five years. Moreover, even the limited support provided by the Howard government's failed scheme was poorly targeted. As I said, we recognise that some people here and there received assistance under the failed scheme. But the problem is that it was not a targeted program. It did not help those most in need. The poorest people with the worse dental health did not get access to the previous government's failed scheme. If you were simply poor and had bad dental health because of your poverty, you could not get treatment under the program. However, if you were wealthy and had a chronic disease with complex care needs, you could get access to the program. Meaning that a millionaire could get access to the program-once they got through the red tape. A pensioner with an excruciating toothache but no chronic disease got no assistance at all. The failings of the Howard government's approach are manifest. They failed pensioners. They failed the poorest, most needy people in our community with the worse dental health. They failed our kids and teenagersfailed to help them maintain their teeth and prevent much worse problems later in life. In implementing our dental commitments, the Rudd government is helping to fix these problems. We are not going to let the Howard government's failed scheme continue, while the dental health problems of millions of needy Australians go unaddressed. That is why the government is redirecting funds from this underutilised scheme to support better targeted dental programs, such as the Medicare Teen Dental Plan that is being introduced today and the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. We have made a decision, as governments need to do, that we should be helping the most needy people in our community first, in the most effective way possible. We have made a decision that providing up to one million dental consultations and treatments under the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, and enabling more than one million teenagers every year to access preventative dental checks under the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, is a good investment for our money. We will work with the states and territories and the dental profession to expand the provision of dental care, with a focus on treatment for those in greatest need, and preventative care for eligible teenagers. Both of our programs are squarely targeted at people who are most in need of help, many of whom could not afford dental care without this assistance. Commonwealth Dental Health Program Under the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, the Rudd government will be providing an additional $290 million over three years to improve access to public dental services, working in cooperation with the states and territories. This marks a stark change from the last decade of the Howard government criticising the states for not doing enough on dental health. We do agree that the states and territories should be encouraged to do more-but instead of just passing the buck, the Rudd government is going to do its bit to help the states to do better. Discussions with the states and territories about the implementation arrangements for the Commonwealth Dental Health Program are well advanced. As health minister, I am keen to end the blame game and to work with the states and territories to fix Australia's dental care system, and the health system in general. We have already made a good start through COAG discussions over the last few months. Commencing in July this year, the Commonwealth Dental Health Program will assist the states and territories to reduce waiting times by funding up to one million additional dental consultations and treatments over the next three years. The states and territories are well placed to ensure that this extra funding will have maximum impact. Often public dental services are the only services available to treat people with the most severe dental conditions, especially in rural and remote areas. The public dental services target the most needy people in the community, and the additional $290 million in funding will ensure that these vulnerable and needy people will be assisted. We will be putting strict conditions on the states and territories to ensure the Commonwealth funding goes where it is most needed. We will be requiring the states to target people with chronic disease as a priority, such as patients with cancer, cardiac patients and people with HIV-AIDS. Another priority will be people with increased oral health needs, including preschool children and Indigenous Australians. States and territories will also be required to maintain their existing efforts in dental health, and report consistently on expenditure, the number of services being provided, and the number of people on the public dental waiting lists. This means that pensioners will get more help. It means that concession card holders will get more help. It will assist the poorest members of our community, and the people with the poorest dental health. It will also give priority to Indigenous people, and preschool children-groups that the Howard government's program so spectacularly failed. In government we have to make choices. And, instead of persisting with a failed dental scheme, we are choosing to provide up to a million more dental consultations and treatments for the most needy Australians. Medicare Teen Dental Plan The Medicare Teen Dental Plan will also commence in July 2008, subject to the passage of this bill and the Dental Benefits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. Under the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, the government will provide up to $150 per eligible person towards an annual preventative check for teenagers aged 12 to 17 years in families receiving family tax benefit part A. Teenagers in the same age group receiving youth allowance or Abstudy will also be eligible for the program. About 1.1 million teenagers will be eligible for the Medicare Teen Dental Plan each year. The program will assist families to help keep their teenagers' teeth in good health, and encourage young adults to continue to look after their teeth once they become independent and move out of home. This is an investment in preventative care. Adolescence is a time when many young people strive for independence from their families, and move outside the parental structures which have supported their health. It is precisely at this stage in life that many young people's dental health declines. As I noted earlier, there is a fourfold increase in dental decay between the ages of 12 and 21. Dental experts also tell us that the highest levels of reported toothache are in those aged between 18 to 21. We need to stem the dramatic decline in dental health that occurs among our children in adolescence. We need to avoid the terrible health consequences this leads to in later life-which requires more expensive treatment, as well as entailing personal and social costs. We have said on many occasions that preventative health is a key priority of the Rudd government. The health system needs to be refocused so that it keeps people well and prevents disease. The $490 million investment that the Rudd government is making in the Medicare Teen Dental Plan demonstrates our determination to make this priority a reality. Under the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, we are going to encourage teenagers to care for their teeth properly-to get annual checkups, so that any problems that might arise do not get worse further down the track. Providing preventative checks is also an effective way to maintain good oral health and reduce the need for expensive treatment in the future. The Medicare Teen Dental Plan will operate as part of the broad Medicare arrangements, through a new Dental Benefits Schedule (DBS). The Dental Benefits Schedule will be administered by Medicare Australia and will operate in a similar manner to the existing Medicare arrangements. However, unlike the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the DBS will be targeted to specific age groups and working families receiving family tax benefit part A. The annual preventative dental check will include an oral examination and, where clinically required, X-rays, scale and clean, and other preventative services. These include fluoride application, oral hygiene instruction, provision of dietary advice, and fissure sealing. Eligible families and teenagers will be automatically sent a voucher by Medicare Australia once the program commences. Once the voucher is received, the teenager can receive a preventative check from his or her dentist. Teenagers or their parents will be morrow. able to claim a rebate back from a Medicare Office, or their dentist may decide to bulk bill the dental check. Up to $150 towards the cost of the service can be reimbursed through Medicare Australia. Eligible teenagers will be able to use their voucher to receive a preventative dental check either from a private or public sector dentist. The dental check may be performed by a dental therapist or dental hygienist on behalf of a dentist, under appropriate supervision. The Dental Benefits Bill establishes a legislative framework for the payment of dental benefits under a new Dental Benefits Schedule. Summing-up In summary, the Rudd government is delivering on its election commitments and making a $780 million investment in Australia's dental health through the Medicare Teen Dental Plan and the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. This marks the end of the blame game that, thanks to the previous government, has afflicted dental health for more than a decade. It marks the end of the buck-passing and blame-shifting that has prevented the poorest, most needy people accessing the dental care they need. It demonstrates that the Rudd government can make tough decisions to close down illtargeted programs which have demonstrably failed, and replace them with targeted programs that help Australians most in need, such as pensioners and concession card holders. It also demonstrates our commitment to investing in preventive health, ensuring our kids preserve their dental health today, rather than only treating their dental problems toThe programs demonstrate the Rudd government's determination to address the immediate pressures on Australia's dental health system, the 650,000 people on public dental waiting lists who are the Howard government's sad legacy. And they also demonstrate the Rudd government's commitment to building for Australia's future, by encouraging our teenagers to develop good dental habits and preserve their dental health for the long term. Together, these programs will attack the sorry state of dental health in Australia. They will address Australia's dental crisis by delivering up to one million more consultations and treatments through the public dental system. And, by enabling more than a million teenagers to take better care of their teeth, they will support better dental health into the future. This is the start of a new era in dental care. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ian Macfarlane) adjourned. NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon.

Before I commence my speech, I have a note here saying that 100 very excited grades 5 and 6 students from Carranballac College in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate are here hoping that Julia Gillard is going to be here to wave to them. I have to report that, unfortunately, she was here looking for you but left at five to four and asked me to acknowledge you. You are very welcome in the House. I hope you all look after your teeth well. The Dental Benefits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 makes amendments to a number of other acts, including the Medicare Australia Act 1973, the Age Discrimination Act 2004 and legislation relating to the family tax benefit part A, youth allowance and Abstudy programs. These amendments are necessary for the effective operation of the Teen Dental Plan. The amendments will ensure that the Medicare Teen Dental Plan does not breach the Age Discrimination Act, and ensure that the investigative powers of Medicare Australia may be exercised in relation to offences contained in the Dental Benefits Bill. The amendments will also allow the exchange of information between Centrelink and Medicare Australia so that vouchers can be distributed to eligible families and teenagers.

NA (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS-COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",113
210,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits-Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 amends the National Health Act 1953, which I will refer to as the act, to vide authority for the cost recovery of services provided by the Commonwealth in relation to the exercise of powers for listing medicines, vaccines and other products, or services, on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and designation of vaccines for the National Immunisation Program (NIP). The aim of the PBS is to ensure that Australians have affordable access to highquality medicines in the community. An initiative of a Labor government 60 years ago, the PBS is now accepted by both sides of politics as a success story. Access to highquality medicines is maintained by subsidising the cost of PBS medicines and limiting the amount that people pay for prescriptions at the point of sale. Medicines that are listed on the PBS are assessed by experts to be clinically safe and cost-effective. The PBS serves Australians well and is justifiably regarded as one of the best systems of its kind in the world. Similarly, the government is dedicated to ensuring that all Australians can continue to receive fully funded vaccines under the NIP. The NIP is a joint program of Commonwealth and state/territory governments which provides fully funded vaccines for major preventable diseases. NIP funding is provided through grants from the Commonwealth to the states and territories. The states and territories provide vaccines free of charge to health providers for them to administer to the community. The cost of providing subsidised medicines and fully funded vaccines to the Australian community is a significant financial outlay to the Commonwealth and taxpayers. In 2006-07 the Commonwealth paid $6.4 billion to approved pharmacists, hospitals and medical practitioners for the subsidised supply of medicines under the PBS. A further pro- $280 million was provided by the Commonwealth to the states and territories for the fully funded supply of vaccines under the National Immunisation Program within their respective jurisdictions. The government was in opposition when the previous government sought to introduce cost recovery of services associated with listing on the PBS and NIP and, in fact, banked the savings despite never introducing the legislation. We shared some of the reservations of some stakeholders about the model proposed by the previous government. It was arguable that the independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) could be threatened if it was reliant upon the pharmaceutical industry for its funding. However, in the model reflected in the bill I introduce today, the independence of the PBAC is guaranteed. The government will continue to directly fund all the activities of the PBAC and its subcommittees. The PBAC will have no role in setting fees and it will not receive any revenue from industry. All revenue collected from cost recovery will be paid directly into consolidated revenue. I would like emphasise that the expertise, integrity and sense of propriety that PBAC members bring to their task will not change as a result of cost recovery. The PBAC will continue to provide expert advice on medicines, independent of government and industry. Cost recovery will not affect the structure or the operation of the PBAC, nor will it compromise the independence of the committee's decisions. There are other notable examples of agencies, such as the Therapeutics Goods Administration, the TGA-which regulate in the public interest and where that regulation necessarily results in commercial gain-where cost recovery has been implemented successfully and without a loss of independence. In implementing a cost recovery fee for Commonwealth services, it is important to note that the Australians accessing the PBS and NIP will not be required to pay any extra for PBS listed medicines or vaccines as a result of this measure. Cost recovery is not a new policy. Cost recovery arrangements have been applied with success to many departments and agencies at state and federal level, including for example, the TGA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. The pharmaceutical industry is familiar with cost recovery-the industry has been paying for the pre-market evaluation of products by the TGA since 1991. Achieving a product listing on the PBS provides a high level of commercial certainty to a company in relation to that product's sales. In this context, it is not unreasonable to recoup taxpayer incurred costs associated with new listings, or changes to existing listings of medicines on the PBS or vaccines designated for the NIP. Australian pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors with medicines or vaccines listed on the PBS and designated for the NIP receive considerable financial benefits via the PBS from the supply of their products to the Australian community. For example, in 2006-07 the top 20 pharmaceutical companies, by total cost of payments, each received, on average, $223 million from the Commonwealth via the PBS subsidy. The Productivity Commission has commented that, by ensuring that those who use regulated services bear the costs, cost recovery can promote economic efficiency and equity by instilling cost consciousness among agencies and users. In this case, it is expected that cost recovery will provide benefits to both government and industryfor example, potentially increasing the compliance of submissions with the PBAC guidelines and reducing time and costs associated with resubmissions. As I mentioned earlier, the PBAC is an independent expert body, established under the act. Its members are selected from consumers, health economists, practising community pharmacists, general practitioners, clinical pharmacologists and other specialists. This remains unchanged. The functions of the PBAC include making recommendations to the minister on products which they consider should be made available under the PBS or NIP. This also remains unchanged. In deciding whether to recommend products for listing, the PBAC is required under the act to give consideration to the cost-effectiveness of the treatment, including by comparing alternative options. This is also unchanged. In fact, the whole process remains unchanged. The PBAC makes recommendations for listing and changes to those listings three times a year. In conjunction with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority, the Department of Health and Ageing undertakes price negotiations for brands listed on the PBS and for designated vaccines. The schedule of PBS benefits is updated and published 12 times a year to reflect new and changed listings. The evaluation, pricing and listing of products, and changes to those listings, involves activities undertaken by various parties, including the PBAC, its subcommittees, the pricing authority, departmental officers, and contractors and subcontractors to the department. Currently, the cost of these activities is borne fully by taxpayers. This bill changes only this part of the PBAC's current function and structure. The government supports the principle of cost recovery in appropriate circumstances to alleviate the burden on taxpayers and, consistent with responsible economic management, is proceeding with the previously announced intentions of the last government The bill is to commence on 1 July 2008, and the cost recovery will begin following commencement of regulations prescribing the necessary fees and arrangements These proposed amendments to the act will provide the necessary legal authority for the charging of fees, which will be prescribed in regulations under the act. The bill is not a taxing bill and the fees may not amount to taxation. Cost recovery will include the costs of submissions to the PBAC and all processes that arise from those submissions in relation to new or changes to existing listings of medicines on the PBS or designated as vaccines for the NIP. Although any person may lodge a submission, in practice, the fees will generally be payable by pharmaceutical companies. The bill does, however, provide for regulations to be made for exemptions and waiver of fees so that, when it is in the public interest, no fees will be payable. The trigger for fees will be the lodgement of a submission, which, in the case of pharmaceutical companies, is purely a commercial decision. Pharmaceutical companies are free to market their products in Australia independently of the PBS or NIP subsidies. However, financial returns from the PBS and NIP, especially in relation to high sales scription only' items, are significantly increased by PBS listing. The desired scope of the regulationmaking power for cost recovery is broad in order to allow for the flexible, efficient and transparent administration of the cost recovery arrangements. The regulations will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Without limiting the scope of the regulation-making power, the regulations may include, but are not limited to: the administration processes surrounding the making of submissions, - prescribing of fees, the timing and manner of payment of fees, - penalties and refusals to provide services for late and non-payment, - exemptions from fees and the waiver, remission and refund of fees, and - the review of administrative decisions made in relation to cost recovery. During consultations with stakeholders by the previous government in 2006 and 2007 there was a general agreement on a fees-only model with two payment points: the first for the receipt and evaluation of a submission, and the second for pricing and listing activities following a positive PBAC recommendation. A simple fee structure is proposed, in line with the existing submission categories with which the industry is already familiar. Each passage through the PBAC will be treated as a single event-a drug that is resubmitted on several occasions, following a refusal by PBAC to make a positive recommendation, will be liable for an evaluation fee on each occasion. This reflects the fact that a complete evaluation is required each time a submission is made, and is a disincentive for poor quality submissions. A further ‘prepayment point will apply for an applicant seeking an independent review of a negative PBAC decision. The regulations may allow for exemptions from fees, as I have noted. For example, it is expected that Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) designated orphan drugs and drugs approved for temporary supply will be automatically exempted. The regulations may also provide for the refusal to provide services until a fee is paid. If fees go unpaid, a simple ‘tools down' approach is envisaged, involving no further consideration until payment is received. Furthermore, this bill clarifies that the minister may refuse to exercise certain powers (under section 9B or a provision under part VII of the act) if prescribed fees are not paid. The regulations may also allow for the recovery of unpaid fees as a debt due to the Commonwealth. The government is very committed to ensuring that there is a due process to ensure that fees and charges are levied in a fair and equitable way. For that reason we will be ensuring that there is a system in place to allow drug companies and others who may make submissions to the PBAC to have their medicine evaluated, or to the Department of Health and Ageing to have their medicine listed, will have a right to ask for a review of the charges that have been imposed. In the first instance, and if the matter cannot be resolved through discussion, the department will ask a departmental officer who has not been a part of the original decision to review the case and make a fresh decision. And if this still does not satisfy the company, they will have a right to take their case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This will be an important feature of cost recovery and will provide assurance that fees and charges are being applied consistently, fairly and equitably. There will be no additional fee charged for this process. In making preparations for implementation, my department is liaising with the Department of Finance and Deregulation and following the Australian government cost recovery guidelines. The department has consulted with key stakeholders, including peak industry, consumer and healthcare provider bodies. In addition, a cost recovery impact statement will be finalised to report on consultations and document compliance with the government's cost recovery policy. In accordance with the cost recovery guidelines, the department will introduce ongoing monitoring mechanisms to ensure fees remain based on efficient costs, and will continue to liaise closely with key stakeholders. Revenue from PBS cost recovery will depend on the number and type of submissions brought to the PBAC for consideration. As a general rule, the more complex and time consuming the evaluation and price negotiation, the higher the fees. Once fully operational, annual revenue from fees is expected to be about $9 million in 2008-09, rising to around $14 million a year in following years. It is expected that fees will be indexed annually and a full review undertaken within five years, in accordance with cost recovery guidelines. The recovery of costs incurred by the department for the assessment of submissions made to the PBAC and subsequent evaluation, pricing and listing processes is an extension of an already established cost recovery model operating for the TGA. In that case applicants pay a fee for the work undertaken by the TGA in assessing their drug for use within Australia. Applicants are familiar with this process and have accepted its introduction. Cost recovery within the PBAC process will be a simple system recovering costs from parties that are in a position to gain significant financial benefit from the listing of their drugs or changes to listings, within the PBS subsidy framework and from the designation of their vaccines for funding under the National Immunisation Program. It is all about ensuring that the PBS continues to be able to provide reliable, timely and affordable access to a wide range of medicines for all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

Second Reading",113
211,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), as I said in speaking to the previous bill, is one of the cornerstones of our health system. It has provided Australians with affordable access to quality medicines for almost 60 years and is justifiably regarded as one of the best systems of its kind in the world. One of the reasons it has been so successful is that PBS subsidies are provided directly to consumers at the point of purchase of medicines in the community. At the same time, the PBS provides an efficient, transparent and predictable system for industry and the supply chain. In 2006-07, government expenditure on the PBS was approximately $6.4 billion and we expect it to be around $7 billion this year. This is a significant level of government expenditure, but we believe that the money is well spent. This bill contains a number of largely technical amendments to the National Health Act 1953, with the exception of a safety net measure that will provide great relief to families separated by poor health or working for the government overseas. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",118
212,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"These changes will strengthen the PBS and improve access to PBS entitlements. I will now outline each, commencing with the safety net measure that I just mentioned. The PBS safety net, as people in this House know, protects individuals and families who need a large number of medicines from high cumulative health costs. Members of the family can combine certain PBS charges toward a joint safety net tally. In 2008, the PBS safety net thresholds are $290 for concession card holders and veterans, and $1,141.80 for general patients. The same threshold applies for a family unit, whether as an individual, a couple or a family with dependent children. After a family reaches the safety net threshold amount, all members of the family benefit from the reduced PBS charges for medicines for the rest of the calendar year. In 2008, the copayment reduces from $5 to free for concessional payments, and from $31.30 to $5 for general payments. In broad terms, a PBS family for safety net purposes consists of a person, their spouse, and dependent children. Under the current rules, a legally married or de facto couple must be living together on a permanent basis to qualify as members of the same family. If a couple is living apart permanently, neither person meets the PBS definition of spouse to the other. In that case, each person is treated as an individual with a separate safety net for him or herself, together with any dependants in the person's care, meaning a much higher threshold has to be reached by the couple. This rule currently applies even if a couple is living apart permanently due to illness or infirmity; for example, if one partner is living separately in long-term nursing care. For such couples, the effect of having separate safety nets is that they may need to pay up to twice the amount in PBS contributions to reach the safety net threshold as they otherwise would. The amendment in schedule 3 removes this harsh rule and improves access to the PBS safety net for legally married or de facto couples living apart permanently due to illness or infirmity. It provides relief to couples, particularly elderly couples, at a difficult time in their lives. It will allow such couples, who are currently treated as individuals, to use the safety net as a family, in the same way as they would if they were still living together. This amendment extends the PBS safety net definition of spouse so that a legally married or de facto couple living apart permanently due to illness or infirmity, of either both persons, is not taken to be living separately on a permanent basis. This will mean that couples, often longtime life partners, can continue to be treated as members of the same family for the PBS safety net. They will be able to contribute PBS payments to the same safety net threshold; be included on the same safety net concession or entitlement card once the threshold is reached between them; and both will have access to reduced copayments for medicines supplied as safety net benefits. In effect, this change will mean that the amount of PBS payments required for both members of the couple to reach the safety net is the equivalent of one safety net threshold-not two. It has the potential to reduce the out-of-pocket costs for PBS medicines for such couples by an amount equal to the relevant safety net threshold amount. This is an important measure that will provide significant financial relief and appropriate recognition to eligible couples struggling to afford their medicines. There is no good reason why people who, as a result of illness or infirmity, are forced to live apart should not have the same PBS entitlements as other couples. This is essentially a matter of fairness. It might assist the House, given the time of day, if I table the rest of the speech in accordance with the one that has been distributed. The other measures are mostly technical measures which will have benefits for Australian residents who are working for the government overseas. If that is an appropriate method for the House, I will do so.",118

FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY NA NA AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",120
222,Ms MACKLIN,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (4.38 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill introduces amendments to the social security law, the family assistance law, the Veterans' Entitlements Act and related acts to implement certain measures from the 2008 budget and some minor amendments. The Rudd government's first budget delivered over $55 billion to support working families, seniors, carers and people with disability. The budget delivered our election commitments and invested responsibly in building a modern Australia. It was carefully framed to meet challenging economic times. It recognised that many Australians are under increasing financial strain from rising cost of living expenses and high interest rates. The budget also reflected the economic reality that inflation is the No. 1 enemy of families, pensioners and the vulnerable in our community. Fighting inflation is essential to responsible economic management, and this budget delivers critical measures to achieve this. Central is the better targeting of government payments so that assistance is being directed to those who need it most. The first of the budget measures in this bill will establish a $150,000 limit on primary earner income for family tax benefit part B. Claimants of related tax offsets will be subject to a similar income limit. Family tax benefit part B, along with part A, is one of the two components that may make up a person's rate of family tax benefit. The part B rate for a single person is not currently subject to an income test. For a member of a couple, the part B rate is currently subject to an income test on the secondary earner only. As a result, very high income singles and couples with children may currently be eligible for taxpayer funded family assistance, a situation that has been of some community concern. Under this measure, a family will not be eligible for family tax benefit part B where the primary earner in a couple, or a sole parent, has adjusted taxable income of more than $150,000 for the financial year. Single parent families with income at or below the $150,000 limit will continue to receive the maximum rate of payment. The limit will be indexed each year in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. Related dependency offsets delivered through the tax system-namely, dependent spouse, housekeeper, child housekeeper, parent or parent-in-law and invalid relative tax offsets-will also be targeted to those on incomes of $150,000 or less per year. There are four measures in the bill relating to baby bonus. Baby bonus is currently a flat rate, one-off payment made on the birth of a child or the adoption of a child under the age of two. The payment is currently indexed twice a year, in March and September. The baby bonus will increase to $5,000 on 1 July 2008. The government is committed to a child centred approach to family policy and this bill will make baby bonus simpler and fairer, and help direct it to those families who need it most. The first of the baby bonus measures in this bill will introduce an income test, limiting eligibility to families with incomes equivalent to $150,000 or less per year. The income test will be applied on a pro rata basis for the six months after the birth. Families with estimated adjusted taxable income of over $75,000 in the six months following the birth, or following the commencement of care by an adoptive parent or a long-term carer, will no longer be eligible for the payment. Families will need to provide a reasonable estimate of their income over this period. This can be easily provided through things like evidence of their income, their partner's income and any approved leave, including paid leave. The government's emphasis in administering the income test will be on upfront verification of estimates. Families do not have to worry that a debt may be raised against them because their income changes. If false or misleading information is provided then the usual sanctions will apply. The new income test takes into account the fact that family income is often reduced when a new child arrives, and ensures that the timing of the birth or adoption within a financial year does not arbitrarily affect a family's eligibility. As with the family tax benefit part B income limit, the baby bonus income limit will be indexed each year in line with movements in the CPI. The second baby bonus measure will result in eligible families being paid their baby bonus in 13 fortnightly instalments from the date of claim. This will provide families with financial support and certainty over an ongoing period, providing families with the cash they need to pay the bills as they come in. The third measure will change the indexation date for baby bonus to 1 July each year after the legislated increase to $5,000, in line with other family payments. The first application of annual indexation will be on 1 July 2009. The fourth change will increase the age limit for baby bonus eligibility from two to 16 years where a child is adopted. A parent will now be eligible for baby bonus for an adopted child if the child is aged under 16 when adopted, and if the adoptive parent claims the bonus within 26 weeks of the child being placed into their care by the appropriate authority. The baby bonus will be available for a locally adopted child, regardless of whether this payment was previously made to the birth parent or other primary carer. Extending the eligibility criteria for the baby bonus to allow more adoptive parents to claim payment will create a fairer system and treat all new parents in the same way. It recognises that, as with a newborn, an adoptive parent incurs similar set-up costs and may need to spend periods of time out of the workforce to welcome and settle their child. A further budget measure recently announced will see the development of a compliance regime for the Commonwealth seniors health card. The card helps self-funded retirees of age pension, veteran pension or qualifying age, who pass an income test with living costs, by allowing access to transport and health services at a cheaper rate and viding entitlement to the seniors concession allowance and telephone allowance. There is currently no mechanism to determine ongoing eligibility for the card, unlike other cessions and benefits in the social security system. The bill provides for the collection of tax file numbers to enable data matching, similar to existing arrangements for social security payments and payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, to ensure compliance with the income test. The bill also introduces amendments to the social security law to allow a person to enter into an agreement with the secretary under which the person voluntarily agrees to be subject to income management. Income management redirects a percentage of a person's income support and family payments to meet costs associated with shelter, household essentials, food and clothing. Currently, income management is being implemented under three differing models, all with the objective of ensuring that income support and family payments which are paid for the benefit of children are used as intended. The three models are: - income management in the Northern Territory emergency response; - income management for child protection cases in Western Australia; and - the Cape York welfare reform trials. The bill allows people to refer themselves for income management where they feel, for example, that this would assist them to manage their finances better. Anecdotal evidence from the Northern Territory and other areas within Australia has indicated that some people would like the option of using income management to ensure the priority needs for themselves and their children are met. The pro- voluntary scheme of income management introduced by this bill will give people this option. Income management will provide an avenue for individuals to learn money manconagement skills in the longer term and will assist in meeting any essential financial priorities. The final budget measure will align the minimum eligible age for partner service pension, paid under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, with that of veteran service pension age. This measure will increase the eligible age for partner service pension-for males, from 50 to 60 years of age; and, for females, from 50 to 58½ years of age-as currently set under age equalisation rules. Lastly, the bill will make some minor policy and technical amendments to portfolio legislation, including to the family assistance law in relation to the 1 July 2008 child support reforms, and to provide a discretion for the Child Support Registrar to deduct child support arrears from Centrelink and Department of Veterans' Affairs payments at less than the full prescribed amount in cases of hardship. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.",120
223,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"by leaveThe new safety net definition for spouse also applies for couples accessing pharmaceutical benefits under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS). The amendment is proposed to commence on 1 January 2009, as the PBS and RPBS safety nets operate by calendar year. The proposed safety net arrangements can provide significant benefits for the people involved. I also note that this measure of fairness comes at a modest cost to the PBS. The overall cost is estimated to be around $1.1 million per year, which is a small tion of total PBS expenditure. Illness-separated couples are provided for tralia. in other Commonwealth legislation such as the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The change to the PBS reflects a similar approach and will apply to couples in similar circumstances to those already recognised under those other acts. This measure recognises that when couples need to live apart for reasons of ill health, frailty or dependent care they do not cease to be a family. The proposed amendment provides continuity for joint access to safety net entitlements for those couples deterritory spite their living circumstances having changed permanently. It will improve the affordability of PBS medicines for these people at a time when they may be most in need of the benefits of the PBS. The amendment in schedule 2 proposes changes to provide access to the PBS for people working overseas as government officers, and for accompanying spouses and dependants. Only people who are otherwise eligible to receive PBS medicines will be able to take advantage of this measure. Under the current legislation, access to the PBS is restricted in the following way: - only Australian residents may receive PBS medicines; - pharmacists must not dispense a PBS medicine for a person who is not in Australia; and - it is prohibited to take or send PBS subsidised medicines to a person overseas. The existing provisions are appropriately designed to protect the PBS by making it hard for ineligible people, such as nonresidents, tourists and visitors, to obtain PBS subsidised medicines. However, these safeguards also affect the ability of Australian fracgovernment officers to obtain supplies of PBS medicines when working outside AusAccessing medicines in some overseas locations may be difficult or uncertain. In some places where officers are sent to perform duties for an Australian government, the range and quality of medicines available locally may not match that of PBS medicines, supply of medicines may be unreliable, or medicines may only be available at a high cost. This amendment provides that, for PBS purposes, a person who is working outside Australia as a Commonwealth, or a state or officer, is taken to reside in Australia. This will enable pharmacists to dispense PBS prescriptions for medicines required by these officers. It also provides for PBS medicines to be supplied for accompanying spouses and dependent children of these officers. PBS medicines for these officers and their families will be able to be taken or sent out of Australia in quantities required for personal use. Under the proposed changes, access to pharmaceutical benefits outside Australia is extended only to government officers, spouses and dependants who are otherwise eligible to receive these benefits when in Australia. Around 3,000 people will be eligible. The present prohibitions on export of PBS medicines for or to other persons outside Australia remain in place. The new arrangements do not cover people working overseas for private companies, studying overseas, providing services as an independent contractor to governments, conducting personal business, travelling as tourists, or living overseas permanently. Established compliance and surveillance activities by Medicare Australia and the Australian Customs Service will continue to ensure that controls on access to PBS medicines are enforced appropriately. Arrangements will be established to identify those eligible and to ensure that non-eligible people cannot benefit from the measure. The proposed changes will provide people working overseas as government officers with access to pharmaceutical benefits. It is important that this access be implemented as soon as practicable. The amendment in schedule 1 expands the criteria for determining that brands of pharmaceutical items are co-marketed. This is to ensure that legislation in relation to comarketing operates as it was originally intended. PBS amendments to the National Health Act in 2007 introduced the concept of comarketed brands. This concept permits two or more brands of a pharmaceutical item that are prescribed in the regulations, or meet certain criteria, to be treated as one brand the pharmaceutical item. This is important, because while these brands are co-marketed they are not subject to statutory price reductions that would otherwise apply to the brands as multiple brand medicines. The criteria for determining co-marketed brands require amendment so that comarketed brands, in certain circumstances, may be co-marketed brands even if they are brands of more than one pharmaceutical item. As I said earlier, this simply ensures that the act operates as intended. I will use a fictitious example to show how this amendment works. - The drug Alpha 500mg tablet has the brands X and Y as co-marketed brands. The manufacturers of both X and Y want to list an Alpha 250mg tablet and want those brands to remain co-marketed. - Currently this would not be possible because the 500mg tablet is a different pharmaceutical item to the 250mg tablet. The listing of the 250mg strength of tablet would stop brands of either pharmaceutical item being co-marketed and the brands would be subject to statutory price reductions. - These amendments remove the requirement that there be no brands of other pharmaceutical items containing the same drug in order for brands of a new pharmaceutical item to be listed as comarketed. This means that brands X and Y could remain co-marketed in the 500mg strength, and be listed as comarketed brands in the 250mg strength. However, brands X and Y for both the 500mg strength and the 250mg strength would also need to meet the other comarketing criteria. This amendment also contains provisions for the minister to determine, by legislative instrument, that co-marketed brands cease to of be co-marketed. This is an important amendment as it allows the minister's determination ceasing a co-marketing arrangement to take precedence over the regulations which prescribe certain co-marketed brands. This is necessary to ensure that the comarketed status of brands grandfathered into the regulations when the concept was introduced in 2007 can be adjusted in a timely fashion when new brands of pharmaceutical items are listed on the PBS. This will mean that once a determination ceasing comarketing is made the prescribed comarketed brands that no longer meet certain criteria for co-marketing can be treated as multiple brands. And finally, to two miscellaneous amendments that are made by this bill: - amendments that make minor changes to two PBS-related definitions; and - amendments that remove provisions for the gazettal of determinations made in relation to pharmaceutical benefits which may be prescribed by participating dental practitioners and authorised optometrists. With regard to provisions for gazettals, the legislation currently requires that the determinations which specify the pharmaceutical benefits that can be prescribed by participating dental practitioners and authorised optometrists, be published in the gazette. The amendment removes this requirement and provides that these determinations are legislative instruments. Under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, the registration of legislative instruments on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments generally replaces the requirement for gazettal. The changes bring the requirements for the PBS determinations I mentioned into line with the Legislative Instruments Act. Inclusion of these determinations on the register is already occurring. There are no implications for consumers, business, or regulatory procedures associated with this change. In conclusion, the bill contains amendments which recognise that the way the PBS operates is important to the health of Australians. The proposed changes demonstrate this government's determination to ensure that the PBS continues to meet the needs of Australians as users of PBS medicines, while providing workable requirements for the pharmaceutical industry. This bill contains fair, sensible and practical changes which maintain that balance between the cost of the PBS for the community as a whole and the cost of medicines for individuals and families. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time.

224,Ms MACKLIN,INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (4.58 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill makes amendments to legislation related to Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. The amendments are aimed at allowing greater flexibility in dealings with land which is owned or controlled by Aboriginal people, and at facilitating the provision of improved housing and infrastructure for Aboriginal people by better allowing for security of tenure to government providers of facilities. The bill allows for additional flexibility in relation to township leases under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 to encourage more communities to enter into township leases. In particular, a minimum term of leases will be set at 40 years and leases will be able to include provision for extension of the original term of the lease to a maximum of 99 years. These changes will allow traditional owners to propose a lease tailored to the needs of a particular community. The government sees many advantages to whole-of-township leases and will work with traditional owners through land councils to progress these leases where communities are interested. The amendments will allow the finalisation of the Regional Partnership Agreement in relation to the Groote Eylandt region signed on behalf of the Australian and Northern Territory governments and the Anindilyakwa people on 20 May 2008. That agreement includes township leases over the communities of Angurugu, Umbakumba and Milyakburra for an initial term of 40 years and a renewal period of 40 years. This flexible position which was taken on the term allowed agreement to be reached with people who were understandably concerned at committing future generations to a centurylong land arrangement. The amendments will allow these leases which have been agreed to be put in place. The bill also allows the Executive Director of Township Leasing to hold other types of leases or subleases over land held primarily for the benefit of Aboriginal people. This simply provides a further option to Aboriginal people in considering whether to grant leases over their land. Aboriginal people may prefer a position where a lease granted for the purpose of supporting housing and infrastructure is held by the Executive Director of Township Leasing that is a Commonwealth statutory office with a measure of independence. This measure is an additional avenue for landowners to consider when leasing or subleasing their land to government to enable much needed housing and infrastructure construction to occur with certainty for both governments and landowners. The bill contains some minor changes to the land related provisions of the emergency response legislation. In particular, it provides streamlined processes for payments to landholders for the acquisition of five-year leases. The bill amends schedule 1 to the Northern Territory Land Rights Act to include 13 parks and reserves which were the subject of land claims under the act. This arises from a landmark agreement struck in September 2003 between the Northern Territory government and the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land about the future tenure and administration of the parks and reserves. The government is pleased to be able to finalise the agreement, and notes that the previous government failed to do so in the more than two years between the request for scheduling and its losing office. Resolving Indigenous land claims by agreement where possible and not through the courts is the position this government takes when approaching Indigenous land issues. The government recognises the foresight and determination of the Northern Territory government and the Northern and Central land councils in reaching an agreement that provides lasting benefits for all Territorians. As a result of the agreement, the land will be granted to the traditional owners on the basis that it will be immediately leased back to the Northern Territory government to continue to operate as national parks. This is similar to the arrangements the Northern Territory government has with the owners of Nitmiluk National Park and the Commonwealth has with the owners of Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu national parks and ensures that Aboriginal people and other Australians can jointly enjoy the benefits of significant pieces of the national estate.

Second Reading",125
225,Mr BURKE,WHEAT EXPORT MARKETING,"Watson-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (5.04 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Australia's wheat export marketing arrangements are not working effectively. The previous government's wheat export marketing arrangements failed to protect the interests of growers. First, there was no effective separation of the management of the listed company AWB Limited and the subsidiary AWB International. Second, the export monopoly resulted in a lack of contestability in services. This meant that returns to growers from the national pool were not maximised because the costs of operating the pool were not minimised. And third, the body established by the former government to protect the interests of growers, the Wheat Export Authority, as well as its successor, the Export Wheat Commission, was not given the powers it needed to do its job. Worse, the government failed to ensure it used the limited powers it had effectively. These failures were highlighted over the years during a range of inquiries and reviews, including the Cole commission. For example, the 2000 National Competition Policy Review of wheat marketing arrangements, the study by ACIL Tasman in 2006 and a recent analysis by ABARE all failed to find any compelling evidence that single desk marketing can deliver price premiums in the international market. These studies provided convincing evidence that the old single desk had an inhibiting effect on both innovation in marketing and the realisation of cost savings in grain transport and handling. The research found any price premiums were largely attributable to freight advantages or to the provision of services associated with the sale of wheat-not the single desk arrangement. In addition to those authoritative reports, successive ‘grower reports' produced by the Export Wheat Commission suggest that growers were not getting the best financial deal under the old single desk arrangements. For example, the 2007 report raised concerns about the financial risk faced by growers under AWB Limited's hedging practices relating to the 2005-06 and 2006-07 pools and chartering rates charged by AWB Chartering. The failings of the previous government's wheat marketing policies are well documented. Risks to growers were increased by forcing them to rely on a single exporter. For example, by forcing growers to export through AWB International, Australian growers temporarily lost access to the Iraq market, a critically important market which has only recently resumed Australian wheat imports. The former government's policy reduced incentives for much needed investment in rail and port infrastructure. It stifled innovation by restricting growers' capacity to invest in their own marketing options. It prevented growers from being able to take full advantage of high-premium niche export markets. It restricted the marketing choices for growers. And it prevented industry from working collaboratively to maximise supply chain efficiencies. An evidence based assessment clearly demonstrates the failings of the old single desk system. In the wake of the Cole commission, the previous government had an unprecedented opportunity, indeed a clear responsibility to act, and to act decisively. But it failed to do so. It failed to do so because the Liberal National coalition was paralysed by division on the issue. Instead, in response to Cole, the previous government put in place a series of halfhearted temporary measures which were nothing more than a patch up job. The temporary measures, which remain in place today, not only failed to remedy the underlying defects but in fact exacerbated the problems. Worse, the previous government politicised the complex arrangements by granting temporary veto powers for bulk wheat exports to the then minister. We now have the absurd situation where it is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries Forestry who decides who can and who can not export wheat in bulk. Even the monopoly holder has described the current temporary arrangements as unworkable. AWB Ltd Managing Director, Mr Gordon Davis, recently said, and I quote, ‘No responsible board of directors would agree to continue running a national pool in these circumstances and in the current US subprime environment.' The temporary arrangements are a stark reminder of just how badly the issue of wheat marketing paralysed the previous government. Members on all sides of the House need to appreciate that this legislation is about providing choice for growers. This should not be considered an unreasonable step. After all, it is their wheat. This bill delivers on a key election commitment to establish a system that will provide Australian wheat growers and the grains industry with a structure that will maximise incentives, minimise costs, increase supply chain efficiencies, reduce risk and protect growers. The bill will make marketing services more cost efficient, and will open new markets for Australian wheat. In developing the draft legislation, the government has undertaken an extensive consultation process: we have released an exposure draft of the legislation for public comment the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee has conducted an inquiry into the bills we established an industry expert group and which has consulted with industry and reported on the most effective delivery of industry development services and I, and my department, have consulted with a range of stakeholders, including growers, grower organisations, bulk handlers and potential exporters. The government has conducted several detailed private briefings with each of the state farm organisations. And a significant number of nongovernment members and senators also took up the offer that I made of private briefings. The government is particularly pleased with the response to this consultation process and the willingness of industry to look to the future and work cooperatively with the government to refine the legislation before the parliament today. The government has listened to the views expressed by industry members and the Senate committee, and has accepted arguments put forward on a number of issues. The draft legislation has been amended accordingly. The new arrangements will be in place by 1 July 2008 so that growers and other industry participants will know, with certainty, arrangements that will apply for the 2008 harvest. The government will conduct an independent evaluation of these arrangements commencing in 2010. By then, the scheme will have been operating for long enough to allow a true indication of its effectiveness. This review will be conducted by the Productivity Commission, and will include an evaluation of the costs and benefits of the arrangements. The new arrangements centre around the establishment of a new industry regulator, Wheat Exports Australia, which will control bulk wheat exports by managing an export accreditation scheme. Wheat Exports Australia will be established as an agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and will be subject to the provisions of that act. It will be comprised of a chair, and between three and five other members who will be appointed based on their skills and experience in relevant areas. I have established a selection committee to provide me with a list of candidates for consideration. I expect the committee will provide its recommendations shortly. The primary responsibility for Wheat Exports Australia will be to develop, refine and administer the accreditation scheme. The scheme will be made as a legislative instrument under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. It has been done this way to make sure Wheat Exports Australia has the flexibility to manage the scheme effectively. While Wheat Exports Australia will be the given the power to make and administer the scheme, it will do so under broad policy parameters set out in the bill. The final scrutiny will be by parliament, as the scheme must be tabled and is a disallowable instrument. As well as granting accreditation, Wheat Exports Australia will have the power to suspend or cancel an accreditation if the exporter ceases to meet its probity requirements or is not complying with the conditions of accreditation. Wheat Exports Australia will regularly review the financial conditions, and activities, of accredited exporters to make sure they are complying with the conditions of their accreditation. Accredited exporters will be required to provide annual compliance reports and other relevant information to assist with this ess. Wheat Exports Australia will also be able to audit accredited companies. There will be severe penalties for exporting wheat in bulk without accreditation, for breaching the conditions of accreditation or for providing false or misleading information to Wheat Exports Australia. These will vary, depending on the breach. These powers and related penalties will mean that, unlike its predecessors, Wheat Exports Australia will have the teeth to effectively perform its monitoring and enforcement responsibilities. The bill contains an appropriate balance between the need to apply strict probity and performance tests to protect the interests of growers while not applying an excessive regulatory burden on accredited exporters. Any company or cooperative may apply for accreditation. The government does not believe it is necessary to extend accreditation rights to individuals, as prudent managers would operate as a company to reduce their exposure to risks associated with shipping what are expected to be high-value tonnages. The bill sets out the criteria that Wheat Exports Australia must consider in assessing applications for accreditation. Wheat Exports Australia will be looking at things such as the financial resources available to the company, its risk management systems and the demonstrated behaviour of the company and its executives including making sure that they are abiding by Australian law and complying with foreign laws and United Nations resolutions. To ensure continuity of accreditation, exporters will be able to apply to have their proc- accreditation renewed before it expires. Wheat Exports Australia will apply the same criteria as it would with any application for accreditation. However, as Wheat Exports Australia will already hold significant information relating to the applicant, the process should be less onerous when it comes to renewal. While applicants will need to comply fully with some of those criteria, Wheat Exports Australia will be able to exercise some flexibility in respect to others. There are some eligibility requirements that Wheat Exports Australia must consider, and it will have to make a judgment on whether the applicant's record is likely to impact on its ability to fulfil its obligations as an accredited exporter. Wheat Exports Australia has the discretion to make decisions based on the applicant's particular circumstances and proposed export arrangements. In determining whether an applicant is fit and proper for accreditation, Wheat Exports Australia is to have regard to a number of clauses as spelled out in section 13(1)(c) of the bill. In reference to section 13(1)(c), I stress that the 17 clauses that follow are not of themselves the test, but are issues to which Wheat Exports Australia must have regard when determining whether or not the company, in the present, is a fit and proper company to be accredited to export wheat in bulk. If a company does not meet one of the criteria to which Wheat Exports Australia is to have regard in determining whether an applicant is fit and proper for accreditation, it does not necessarily mean it will not be accredited. For example, Wheat Exports Australia may also consider what action the applicant has taken to remedy the situation. Wheat Exports Australia will need to exercise judgment as to whether the applicant is fit and proper to be accredited even though business. it may not pass all of the items in section 13(1)(c). The assessment of the probity and performance of businesses applying for accreditation will go back five years. All applicants will be treated the same der the assessment process. However, different conditions of accreditation may be applied depending on the content of their application and their ability to deliver on their proposed activities. AWB International will not hold any special status, and will need to apply for accreditation based on the same criteria as applied to other exporters. These criteria are designed to make sure that growers are dealing only with companies or cooperatives of good standing and financial capability. Growers need to know that exporters have the reputation and financial backing to pay for their crop. I appreciate that growers will want to know as soon as possible who has been accredited and with whom they can deal. A timely assessment of applications is essential. I expect Wheat Exports Australia to assess applications as a priority, and I will make sure the government provides any assistance needed to help it cope with the initial flurry of applications. One of the concerns identified during sultation was the risk of a single wheat export monopoly being replaced by three regional monopolies. There were varying views on how to manage this risk, and the government considered a number of options to meet the principle of ensuring effective competition without imposing an unnecessary regulatory burden on The government was also mindful that imposing a significant regulatory burden on the supply chain would only result in increased costs being passed back to growers. So we have decided to impose specific reunquirements on accredited exporters that operate bulk grain terminals at ports, as these are the facilities with natural monopoly characteristics and are the infrastructure bottleneck in the export supply chain. Unless all exporters can obtain access to these critical facilities on fair and reasonable terms then one of the major objectives of the policy could be frustrated. Compliance with these requirements will be a condition of accreditation. If Wheat Exports Australia is satisfied that an exporter has breached these conditions it will have the power to suspend or revoke its accreditation. For the period until 1 October 2009, accredited exporters who operate bulk grain terminals at ports will be required to publish the terms and conditions under which they will provide access to other users. After 1 October 2009, they must have an approved access undertaking with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The reason for the different conditions for port terminal operators before and after 1 October 2009 is that, according to advice from the ACCC, it is unlikely that the ACCC con- could receive, process and approve access undertakings in time for the 2008-09 marketing season. The Senate inquiry also identified concern in relation to the potential for bulk-handling companies to restrict access to up-country storage facilities in a similar manner cerns in relation to port facilities. It is unclear from the evidence presented to the Senate inquiry whether the problem would necessarily arise, and if so, the extent of legislation that would be required to rect it. If the highest level of regulation were be imposed on the more than 500 up-country facilities, there is no doubt that this would create increased compliance costs which would almost certainly be directly passed back to growers. The government will, therefore, continue to monitor the ability of exporters to access up-country storage facilities. Let me say here, if any problems are ideninformation. tified then the government will take steps to remedy the situation including, if necessary, the development of a code of conduct. Wheat Exports Australia will require an annual budget of around $4 million which will be funded through the existing wheat export charge at its current rate of 22c per tonne of wheat exported. This will be complemented by accreditation fees which will be determined on a cost- industry. recovery basis. Funds left over from the Export Wheat Commission will be transferred to the new regulator on its inception. The government recognises that these funds will be limited, as revenue from the 2007 crop has been well below expectations because of the drop in wheat exports as a result of the drought. In addition, the funding streams for Wheat Exports Australia will not generate significant revenue until exports from the 2008 crop are fully underway. Therefore, some additional start-up funding will be needed, particularly given that operational expenses are expected to be to congreater in the initial year. The government will provide up to $5 million to help Wheat Exports Australia through the transition period. As part of the reforms, the government escor- tablished the Wheat Industry Expert Group to advise on the most efficient and effective to delivery of industry development functions previously provided by AWB (International) Ltd. For most of these services the group recommended a mixture of commercial and industry driven solutions that do not need to be set in legislation. The government agrees with this assessment. The exception is the availability of market The success of the new arrangements will depend on all industry participants having equitable access to key market information. The government will facilitate delivery of this information by providing up to $2.52 million over three years to the Australian Bureau of Statistics to collect the necessary information and to ABARE to prepare a monthly report which will be available to This approach is consistent with the recommendation of the industry expert group. While I agree with the group's assessment that technical market support is a matter for exporters, I appreciate that it may take time for new entrants to develop support arrangements. The government will therefore provide funding of up to $600,000, over three years, to help new marketers develop arrangements to deliver effective technical market support. The government will be talking to relevant industry representatives on how to best utilise this assistance. The IEG strongly supports the development of a code of conduct along the lines of that being developed by the National Agricultural Commodities Marketing Association, NACMA, and its members. The NACMA code is aimed at improving clarity in prices posted at silos and thus allowing growers to make better informed marketing decisions. Among other things, compliance with the NACMA code would mean: first, prominent listing and use of standardised language and means of expressions for all fees, charges and statutory deductions applicable to all types of transactions in grain; second, posting on silo boards and on the web, the transparent net return figures for all types of transactions; and third, expression of base marketing costs charged against all types of transactions. The government supports the IEG recommendation and will provide some funding to NACMA to help with the finalisation and promotion of that code. There is also a need to help growers understand the proposed changes so that they may be able to take full advantage of the benefits the new system has to offer. The government will provide up to $1.15 million for information sessions for growers and major customers right across the country starting in July. This will include informing wheat growers about the new arrangements and associated marketing options and financial dealings, and appropriate checks and balances that will be in place to protect growers' interests. The government will work closely with the state farming organisations in developing and implementing this initiative. The government is also committed to finding solutions to problems associated with grain rail infrastructure and is providing up to $6 million for taskforces in Western Australia and New South Wales to investigate ways of stimulating investment in this critical transport industry for rural Australia. The bill is accompanied by the Wheat Export Marketing (Repeal and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. This bill provides for amendments to other legislation to make it consistent with the provisions of the main bill. This is an exciting time for Australian agriculture. Australia's wheat export marketing arrangements must be changed if the Australian wheat industry is to realise its true potential in the global market place. With grain prices at historically high levels, growers are now very well positioned to directly benefit from the changes the government is introducing. These benefits, in turn, will flow back to regional and rural communities that depend on Australia's grain growers. Under these changes, for the first time in more than 60 years, Australian wheat growers will be able to choose whom they sell their grain to based on the very best deal they can get. Today's farmers continue to benefit from the abolition of trade tariffs and the trade liberalisation reforms introduced by the Hawke-Keating Labor governments. Today's wheat growers also enjoy the benefits offered by the deregulation of the domestic wheat market in 1989. Tomorrow's farmers stand to benefit from the reforms introduced to the parliament today - allowing Wheat Exports Australia to Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned.

227,Mr BURKE,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Watson-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (5.31 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction The Farm Household Support Act 1992 (FHS Act) was introduced in 1993 and allows farmers and some small business operators to access financial support or exceptional circumstances relief payments (ECRP) to help them manage through the drought. Changes broadening access to the ECRP were introduced in September 2007. We supported the former government's introduction of these changes while we were in opposition and we will now honour that commitment by formalising them in legislation. This bill will provide the legislative basis for these changes and will validate the payments people have received between then and when this legislation passes. This bill amends the FHS Act to help more small rural businesses, who are suffering a downturn because of the drought, access relief payments. This not only supports rural business but also the communities that rely on them. The bill will increase the income exemption for the ECRP income test from $10,000 to $20,000. This effectively doubles the amount of off-farm or non-business salary and wages that farmers and small business operators can earn without reducing their payment. This recognises that during this prolonged drought many farmers have had to seek some off-farm income to keep their business viable. The bill will also remove an inequity between the treatment of Newstart allowance recipients and recipients of the ECRP. Currently Newstart allowance recipients may travel overseas for a limited number of humanitarian or family reasons and still receive their payments; ECRP recipients can not. We see education and the welfare of young Australians as vital to the economic prosperity of this country. By amending the Social Security Act 1991 (SS Act), this bill will provide concessions under the Austudy and youth allowance means tests for newly eligible recipients of the ECRP. It will also ensure that all newly eligible recipients receive a health care card. The bill Exceptional circumstances assistance continues to be the Australian government's primary vehicle for providing direct assistance to eligible farmers and small business operators impacted by rare and severe (‘exceptional') events, including drought events, which lie outside the scope of farmers' and small business operators' normal risk management strategies. Extending the ECRP to more farmers and small rural business operators This bill will amend the FHS Act to allow more farmers and small business operators to access the ECRP and the associated ancillary benefits. It will do this by increasing the level of exempted off-farm or non-business salary and wages earned by the applicant and their partner from $10,000 to $20,000. It will also amend the eligibility criteria to extend the ECRP to more small business operators. These small business operators must be located in towns that have a population of 10,000 or less, are located in exceptional circumstances, prima facie, or interim assistance areas, and are substantially reliant on income sourced from providing products and/or services to farms, farmers, farm workers, or their families. These small business operators must also show they have experienced a significant downturn because of the drought. Validation clause This bill will amend the FHS Act by validating the payments made between the announcement on 25 September 2007 and the date the bill receives royal assent. This dation clause will provide a legislative basis to make these ECRP payments as if the bill commenced on 25 September 2007. The validation clause will also provide a legislative basis for the provision of ancillary journed. benefits such as the health care card and exemptions from the Austudy and youth allowance means tests provided to recipients between 25 September 2007 and royal assent of the bill. Specifically, these amended provisions will provide automatic access to the health care card to newly eligible recipients of the ECRP and exempt the Austudy and youth allowance payments of the dependent children of recipients of the ECRP from reductions through means testing of their parents. Removal of the requirement to be ‘in Australia' to receive ECRP The bill will amend the FHS Act to allow ECRP recipients to continue to receive payments while temporarily absent from Australia for specific family or humanitarian reasons. This measure treats ECRP recipients in the same way as those in receipt of the Newstart allowance and means they can continue to receive benefits while they are overseas if their reason for travel is covered by an exemption. Conclusion The government will continue to support farmers and small business operators throughout the drought and give them the opportunity to have a sustained recovery. We want to maintain the long-term viability of our farming families, rural small businesses and our rural and regional communities. The effects of climate change, prolonged drought and structural change present critical challenges faced by our farmers every day. Through the exceptional circumstances assisvali- tance measures, the Australian government will enable the sector to meet and actively manage these challenges into the future. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adTAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bowen.

228,Mr BOWEN,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (5.37 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's tax laws. Schedule 1 to this bill amends the income tax law to restore the original tax treatment of rights issued by companies to shareholders to acquire additional shares. This will overcome the impact of the High Court of Australia's decision in Commissioner of Taxation v MCNeil. MCNeil's case overturned long standing tax treatment in relation to put options which has caused great uncertainty in the market. The changes in schedule 1 will provide certainty to the market as to the tax treatment of put options and call options which will allow companies to continue to raise capital through the use of such options. These amendments will ensure that no amount is included in the assessable income of a shareholder in a company as a result of acquiring certain rights issued by the company to acquire further shares. The amendments will also ensure that an amount that is included in the assessable income of a shareholder, as a result of acquiring rights issued by the company to dispose of shares, is appropriately reflected in the cost base of the rights. To ensure that taxpayers are not disadvantaged, these amendments will apply to rights issued on or after 1 July 2001. Schedule 2 to this bill amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to overcome a deficiency in the scope of the restriction of GST refunds following the Federal Court of Australia decision in KAP Motors versus the Commissioner of Taxation. The restriction of GST refunds will apply regardless of whether transactions giving rise to a refund are supplies for GST purposes. This schedule also amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to overcome a deficiency in the four-year time limit on payment and refund of indirect taxes and ensures that it applies as intended to bring finality and certainty to the indirect tax affairs of taxpayers. Schedule 3 to this bill exempts rent assistance paid to Austudy recipients from income tax. This will ensure consistency with the taxation treatment of rent assistance paid to Newstart allowance, youth allowance and Abstudy recipients. Rent assistance has been payable to Austudy recipients from 1 January 2008. The payment provides assistance with the living costs associated with full-time study and training. Schedule 4 to this bill exempts the carer adjustment payment from income tax. This will ensure consistency with the taxation treatment of other one-off payments made to carers in previous years. The carer adjustment payment provides up to $10,000 in financial assistance to families with a child, up to six years of age, who has suffered a catastrophic event after 1 January 2007. It is designed to assist families adjust with the increased costs arising from a severe illness or medical condition, or major disability as a result of the catastrophic event. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned.

229,Mr BOWEN,NATIONAL FUELWATCH,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (5.41 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction and overview Mr Deputy Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to introduce this bill to create a national Fuelwatch scheme. The creation of a national Fuelwatch scheme will finally put power back into the hands of Australian motorists. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill will introduce a national Fuelwatch (Fuelwatch) scheme to address the existing retail fuel price transparency imbalance between retailers and consumers. It will empower consumers in, and improve the operation of, the retail petrol market. The stated object of the National Fuelwatch (Empowering Consumers) Bill is to provide intraday price stability and decrease search costs for consumers. The act contains a number of provisions to enable the effective and efficient operation of Fuelwatch and to provide consumers with greater information at the bowser. Background to the bill Mr Deputy Speaker, for too long the motorists of Australia have been disadvantaged in their purchasing decisions by the actions of petrol retailers. For too long the motorists of Australia have lacked the tools necessary to make informed choices as to where to buy the cheapest fuel on any given day. Mr Deputy Speaker, for too long the big petrol retailers have held all the cards. Mr Deputy Speaker, no longer. Today, the government introduces a bill to assist motorists in buying the cheapest petrol, at the cheapest petrol stations, at the cheapest times. Fuelwatch will give motorists highly detailed and up-to-date information about local petrol prices to help motorists avoid being ripped off. No longer will motorists drive past a petrol station in the morning and notice a price, only to return in the afternoon to find a 10c per litre jump in the price of petrol that afternounced, noon or that evening. Rather than guessing the best time and the best place to buy petrol, consumers will know where and when to buy the cheapest petrol in town. Mr Deputy Speaker, on 15 June 2007, the former government agreed to the holding of a price inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC) into the price of unleaded petrol, pursuant to section 95H (subsection 2) of part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act. On 18 December 2008, the ACCC released its report Petrol Prices and Australian Consumers: report of the ACCC inquiry into the price of unleaded petrol. In this report, the ACCC concluded that there was an imbalance in price transparency between buyers and sellers in Australia. It identified three options for addressing the retail price information imbalance, including the introduction of a Fuelwatch scheme. While the ACCC identified three options to address the relative imbalance in price transparency, the only viable option to address both the price information imbalance and price volatility in the form of intraday movements is the adoption of increased pricing information and price commitment rules in the form of Fuelwatch. On 15 April 2008, the Prime Minister and I announced the establishment of Fuelwatch to empower consumers and encourage transparency in the fuel market. Fuelwatch is proposed to commence nationally on the 15 December 2008. Provisions of the bill Fuelwatch will apply to petrol retailers that offer motor fuel for retail sale. Fuels covered by this scheme are those defined as suitable for use in an internal combustion engine. As the government has already anthis would include unleaded petrol, premium unleaded petrol, LPG, diesel, 98 RON and biodiesel blends. Fuelwatch will apply to metropolitan and major rural and regional areas. The legislation provides for this initial coverage to be specified by regulation. Furthermore, to ensure that other regional and rural areas have the opportunity to become part of Fuelwatch, the bill enables the minister to make further declarations, to expand or adjust the coverage of the scheme as required. In making the declaration, the bill provides that the minister must have regard to: the size of the locality; its population; the number of vehicles in the locality; the number of service stations; the ownership and operating arrangements for service stations; and submissions made by the relevant local government body. This will ensure that Fuelwatch can increase price transparency, wherever it is needed in Australia. The crux of the Fuelwatch scheme is the requirement for petrol retailers to notify the ACCC of their intended price for the next day. This must be done by 2 pm on the immediately preceding day. Commencing from 6 am the following day, petrol retailers are required to maintain this notified price for a 24-hour period. However, if a petrol retailer has not changed their price from the previous day, they will not be required to notify the ACCC of their price. The bill deems this price to be their notified price automatically. For its part, the ACCC will be required to publish notified prices from petrol retailers on a dedicated website. This information will be publicly available each day by 4 pm. The bill enables the ACCC to approve other methods of publication of this price information. Civil penalties will apply if a petrol retailer notifies the ACCC of a price, but does not sell fuel at all times during the fixed price period; or if a petrol retailer notifies the ACCC of its price for fuel, but sells that fuel at another price. The requirement to sell the fuel at, and not above or below, the notified price is crucial to the design of the Fuelwatch scheme. Without it, retailers could simply notify a price well above their intended retail price, and subvert the purpose of the scheme in providing greater transparency. The bill provides the ACCC with the ability to give a person an infringement notice, if it breaches key provisions of the bill. The ACCC has the discretion not to issue an infringement notice. The infringement notice regime provides the ACCC with sufficient flexibility to make a proportionate response in relation to breaches of the bill. In relation to compliance costs, which were mentioned in the House today, the cabinet regulation impact statement, which I have tabled as part of the explanatory memorandum, was considered by the cabinet. In considering the regulation impact statement and the implementation costs involved in FuelWatch in the proposal, cabinet took a decision that the implementation cost should be nil. The reason for this was on the basis that information technology systems would need to be installed at each service station, based on the experience in Western Australia. Instead of this, and to eliminate implementation costs, no software will be required. Service stations will be able to notify prices via a website or a toll-free number. As the explanatory memorandum notes, there will be no ongoing compliance costs because no software will need to be maintained. A very large number of service stations subscribe to the Informed Sources website, which involves a considerable subscription cost which will no longer be relevant. Those who do not subscribe to the website will, in most cases, spend some time each day checking a competitor's price movements, which, of course, will no longer be necessary either. Conclusion At a time of record world oil prices it is incumbent upon the government to do everything in its power to assist motorists. It is not a time for stunts or economically irresponsible gimmicks. It is a time to introduce real initiatives empower consumers and drive transparency. This is a reform designed to give motorists a fair go that they have missed out on for so long. Up until now motorists have been disadvantaged. They have not been able to access information on where to get cheap petroland if they do have access to some price service the information is out of date by the time they get to the station because the price may have changed. Just like the woman who emailed me over Easter to complain that the price of petrol had jumped 15c while she was waiting in the queue. Mr Speaker, at present the oil companies have all the information and motorists have none. At present petrol retailers subscribe to a website known as Informed Sources, where they share information every 15 minutes on their own and their competitors' prices. The ACCC inquiry into petrol prices had this to say about Informed Sources: ‘The direct exchange of price information between suppliers is conducive to anti-competitive coordination.' Fuelwatch is designed to redress this imbalance. With Fuelwatch, companies are obliged to sell at their best possible price or else risk being out of the market for a 24-hour period with a price which is higher than their competitors' prices. This means motorists benefit. Retailers must put forward the best possible price if they are to retain business. Motorists will be able to conveniently find the cheapest petrol via the Fuelwatch website, or by SMS or email alerts. Just as over 30,000 Western Australian to motorists do receive an email every day from WA FuelWatch. In Western Australia the FuelWatch website gets approximately 200,000 hits per month, proving how highly valued this system is as a consumer tool. Mr Speaker, FuelWatch has been in operation successfully in Western Australia for seven years and the benefits to motorists are clear. The ACCC inquiry had this to say about the operation of FuelWatch in Western Australia: ‘The publication of petrol prices on the FuelWatch website and reporting of prices in the media have increased price transparency for consumers in the market for petrol in Western Australia.' One of the key tenets of a wellfunctioning market is the ability of all participants to have access to transparent information-or, as economists would say, perfect information. This is at the heart of Fuelwatch. Under Fuelwatch, motorists will be able to map out their route to and from work or for any other journey and see where the cheapest petrol is that day and the next day. Motorists will be able to decide when and where to buy petrol based on perfect, realtime information. This means, Mr Speaker, that the days of driving past a petrol station in the morning and noticing a different price in the afternoon will be gone under Fuelwatch. Price savvy motorists will stand to be some of the biggest winners from the introduction of Fuelwatch. That is because they like to shop around for a bargain and with Fuelwatch they will be able to do exactly that. Mr Speaker, on any given day there is on average a 15c per litre difference between the cheapest and most expensive fuel in a city. Sometimes it can be as high as 30c per litre. This means that price sensitive motorists will know exactly where they can save 15c and will make their purchasing decisions accordingly. Fuelwatch will empower motorists by giving them access to greater transparency on petrol prices. The econometric analyses undertaken by the ACCC also indicate that Fuelwatch can have a positive effect on prices at the bowser as well. I take the opportunity of tabling the ACCC's comprehensive econometric analysis, as was considered by the cabinet and the expenditure review committee of the cabinet, as they were briefed on. The ACCC report found that ‘the main finding from this econometric analysis is that the average of the price margin reduced by a statistically significant amount for Perth relative to the eastern capitals in the time since the introduction of FuelWatch'. The ACCC report concluded that comparing relative price levels between Perth and the eastern states before and after the introduction of FuelWatch, prices in Perth were around 1.9c per litre less on average for the period from January 2001 to June 2007 than for the period from August 1998 to December 2000. Using the low points of the weekly price cycle rather than the simple weekly average, the price difference was around 0.9c per litre on average. And the ACCC also found in relation to the low points of the price cycle ‘The results are also robust using the low points of the week's prices'. Also a benefit to price sensitive motorists. This was confirmed in the further analysis that the ACCC conducted, which was provided to the cabinet. FuelWatch is one the most empowering tools for consumers ever debated in this House. It will provide the transparency and reductions in intra-day price volatility that motorists have been crying out for. It will redress the imbalance that the big oil retailers currently enjoy over motorists. It will allow consumers to take purchasing decisions into their own hands. And it will assist motorists in buying the cheapest petrol, at the cheapest petrol stations, at the cheapest times. I commend this bill to the House. It is an important bill. It has been supported by the rigorous analysis of the ACCC, as the cabinet was briefed on. This is an important bill which the House should adopt if they wish to put the interests of motorists first.
