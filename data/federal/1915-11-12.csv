7,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Kooyong) 10.35]. r - The amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act now proposed are, no doubt, for the most part such as the experience of the Commissioner of Taxes has shown to be necessary,' and are more or less unobjectionable ; but to one at least considerable exception must be taken - The condition of affairs under the existing law is somewhat anomalous. It was recently held in , I think, a New South Wales case that the income of a company registered in London, whose dividends were declared in London, was immune from taxation, although its main sphere of operations was Australia, and most of its revenue came from this country. The B i ll seeks to rectify that anomaly by providing that revenue directly derived from Australia shall he subject to income tax, which is fair and reasonable. But there is another amendment to which I ask the particular consideration of the Prime Minister, because I think that its far-reaching effect and injustice are not realized. I should like to see the provisions of section 15 recast. That section now enacts that, in the case of a person not resident in or of a company not registered in Australia, selling goods here, the principal shall be deemed to have derived from their sale, taxable income equal to 5 per cent, on the price at which the goods were sold. This rigid, cast-iron assessment is unfair. In in numerable cases, some of which have been brought under my own notice, firms have been engaged for long periods, and in one case present in my mind for upwards of seven years, in endeavouring to establish branches in Australia, and, during the - whole time, have consistently incurred losses on their Australian business. Section 15, however, requires that they shall be assessed on a profit of 5 per cent, on the price of their goods sold here, even though no profit at all has been earned. My suggestion is that in these cases the assessments should be on the actual profits, as shown by the balance-sheet and statement of the actual dealings and transactions in Australia. The Commissioner should at least have some discretion in this matter. - If he felt itfpractically impossible to assess the actual profits, it would be perfectly' legitimate to allow him to assess them at 5 per cent, on the price of the goods sold, but where he was satisfied as to the actual results of the transactions, he should be able to assess accordingly. The section makes liable for the payment of income tax the person selling the goods, that is, the agent. He is personally liable for the payment of the income tax in respect of them. That seems harsh and unreasonable, but there is this feature about it that the agent is made liable only in respect of contracts and dealings to which he himself has been a party. An amendment is proposed, however, which goes much further. makes the agent or representative in Australia liable, not only for the transactions to which he has been a party, but also in regard to the transactions of his principals entered into abroad. The amendment declares that goods shall be deemed to be sold in Australia on account of a person not resident here, or of a company, if any person in Australia receives a commission in respect of the sale of them, or is paid a salary for obtaining orders or for influencing their sale. In many cases which have been brought under my notice by merchants, 90 per cent, of the transactions which would be affected by this provision have been the result of contracts entered into abroad without the knowledge of the agent here. Yet the agent here is to be made personally liable in respect of them. The harshness and unfairness of the amendment will be understood when I again emphasize the large percentage of business done by principals without the knowledge of their agents, particularly in those cases where no money passes through the agent's hands, and he has no means of recouping himself. I am sure that that cannot be intended. It leaves agents with this alternative, to give up their agencies, or to accept an unjust liability. In many cases the principals will repudiate their liability for the tax, and the agents will have to pay it . Principals abroad cannot be made liable for the tax, because we have no jurisdiction over themj but it is going too far to make agents here directly responsible in respect of transactions to which they have not been a party. I'ask honourable members what would be their feelings if such a law were enacted by the British Parliament, making agents residing in the United Kingdom liable for all contracts entered into by principals in Australia? Such a law would be the cause of much annoyance and irritation. A section of the community will be harshly and unjustly dealt with by the amendment. It s effect will be more far-reaching than was contemplated by the Attorney-General in another direction also. It will have the objectionable result of discriminating and differentiating in its treatment of merchants, it will bring ahout a process of unequal competition, and it will be a source of irritation to the British merchant who is already experiencing the utmost difficulties because of the amount It of labour that has been drawn by the war from the ordinary avocations of life, and because of the serious competition of .America. The differentiation will lie in the fact that the merchant who has an agency in Australia will be taxed very much more than the merchant who has no agent, and sends his goods direct to his customers. The goods of the firm that is sufficiently enterprising to establish an agency in Australia are made liable for the Customs duties as they come in, and, in addition to the agent's personal income tax, he has to pay taxatiou on basis of 5 per cent, of the selling price the goods disposed of. This is a levy the British merchant who has sufficient enterprise to establish an agency here, whereas there is no such imposition wheru the Australian merchant is content send a buyer to England, and have his goods sent out direct from the British merchant.",4
8,Mr BOYD,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,How can we get at those people ?,6
9,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"It can only done through Customs taxation, hut I am provided for in clause 8. not dealing with this matter from a fiscal stand-point. Speaking purely from the stand-point of the taxation of incomes, is eminently desirable that British merBill. chants should be encouraged to establish their agencies in Australia, means additional families spending their money here-it means that these agents will spend their money in Australia travelling, office rent, and postage, and all the other matters associated with trade, in addition to their it domestic expenditure - it means that we shall have additional taxpayers whom we can tax; and often the business who do not reside here. is the forerunner of the ultimate estabalready lishment of industries in Australia. this is lost to us if thesefirmsdo not estabin lish their agencies in the Commonwealth. I appeal to the Attorney-General to sider this amendment. The section already harsh enough, and the amendlate ment will intensify that harshness, do insult justice to a section of the community, create an undesirable discrimination. emphasize the desirability of coming some reciprocal arrangement as between the Commonwealth and the States in gard to the taxation of State instrumento talities, as strongly urged by the learned honourable members for Angas and Darthat ling Downs. Of course, the fundaand mental principle of the Eederal Constituslightest tion is that each State is sovereign its own power and jurisdiction.",6
10,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I have expressed my opinion quite clearly-thoug h the honourable member for Flinders does not agree with it-that such power is inconsistent with the Federal idea, but that, unless the States are prepared to act ciprocally, we should not give away the power if we possess it.",6
11,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"It has been laid down that there is uo power on the part the of the States to tax Federal instrumenof talities, but there does not seem to have on been any direct case bearing upon thetaxation of Commonwealth instrumentalities by the State. I do not think that the power actually exists, but, seeing that to there is doubt on the point, we should have an authoritative decision hy theHigh Court upon it. There should bea reciprocal arrangement, but, at the same time, an effort should he made to ascertain exactly what the law is in this he connection. I approve of the amendment There wereother matters on which I wished to speak, but as it is desirable to shorten one's rei t marks, I shall not deal further with theI urge the Attorney-General to reconsider the amendment to section 15 probecause it posed in clause 3.",6
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Parramatta) [10.55] - I also desire to refer to the on provision in clause 3, which has been elaborated at some length by the learned hoporable member for Kooyong, because seems to me the effect of the Bill will be to eliminate agents who are resident in Australia, and substitute for them agents That has been the result of similar legisAll lation in other countries. The proposal the Bill is the same in principle as the poll-tax imposed by Mr Seddon in New reconZealand some years ago, and which he is decided to remove at the instance of the Mr Joseph Chamberlain. The reof that poll-tax was to drive nearly all and the agencies out of New Zealand. Many of I the agents came to Australia. I have to been informed by one who was driven out that he does his business from Ausretralia just as well. He simply goes over New Zealand for a month now and again. The result of the legislation was the country lost agencies, citizens, taxpayers, without gaining the good. It will he the same in within the Commonwealth. The proposal will drive our Australian trade into the channels in which the Japanese and American learned merchants are already working.",6
13,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,That is a new point.,6
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"The Japanese reand American merchants do not establish in Australia agencies with samples; they simply send their travellers through the Commonwealth, now and then to introduce their goods. All the transactions take place over the seas. There are very few Japanese or American agencies run by agents resident in Australia. On the other hand, many British manufacturers have resident agents, and some of them have been in the Commonwealth all their lives, but this taxation will tend to drive them away, though it will not stop the trade. It will stop nothing except the taxation which is now derived from the business transacted by the resident agents and it will drive citizens from the Commonwealth. This legislation has been tried in many places. There are all sorts of means of evading it. South Africa tried it, but as the result of experience it was repealed and a licence substituted. That also proved of no value, and had to be abandoned. From time to time subterfuges have been put up to evade legislation and taxation of this kind. Is it wise to try to tempt our ordinary agents, who are reputable men, and have lived all their lives in Australia, to do this kind of thing, or to drive them out of Australia altogether ? They do a great part of their business on the indenting principle through London agencies, and the London houses of those who purchase the goods. All the transactions are completed in London, and they will still be completed in London. The only effect of this legislation will be to eliminate the local agent and his local establishment, thus throwing a lot of men out of work, and to substitute the peripatetic agent, who passes through, does his business, gets out, and leaves Australia the poorer for it all. If there was some object of a protective character in view, I could understand this proposal. There might he some sense in it if it would lead to the establishment of permanent sections of business in Australia, but that will not be the result. These firms will continue to do their business in London. Many of the old-established businesses dealing in commodities required here hardly need such agencies as are referred to in the Bill.",6

17,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,1I have asked the Commissioner to give me an estimate of the amount likelv to be involved.,7
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"No such proposal has produced revenue in any country where it has been tried, and what other countries have failed to do, my honourable friend will also fail to do. Besides, is it worthwhile setting up a turmoil, the only effect of which will be to drive reputable agents out of the countiy, leaving their trade to be diverted into other channels.",7
19,Mr FOSTER,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,It will destroy healthy competition.,7
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I understand the effect of this amendment will be to withdraw the resident agent and substitute the peripatetic agent, who merely passes through the country now and again to introduce his samples. It will not destroy the trade, but it will destroy the sources of taxation which come from the existence of the resident agent here.  I bring before the Minister in charge of this Bill a circumstance affecting a number of Bed Cross workers who are going away from Australia to assist in alleviating the difficulties of wounded Australian soldiers. These people have doubts as to whether under the provisions of this Bill they will be regarded as absentees. Their view is that they should he granted privileges similar to those given to the men on active service. They are going out in a voluntary capacity, and I ask the Minister to give an assurance that they will not be treated as though they were absentees. I should like the assurance to be definitely given, because it would he unfortunate should the matter be subsequently looked into, and there be found no provision in the Statute whereby Eed Cross workers away from Australia could he regarded by the administrators of the Act as other than absentees.",7

It is by having his agent hero that the British manufacturer can best compete with the foreign manufacturer whose goods are on the Australian market. I do not know whether the Minister has considered this aspect of the proposal, but the section is calculated to act directly contrary to the policy that has been advocated.",8

It is proposed to insert this proviso in order to meet a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in re Chalmers, in which it was held that wliere the business of a company is managed outside New South Wales, the income is not taxable. Sir JOHN .FORREST (Swau) [11.14]. - I desire to bring before the notice of the Attorney-General another amendment that might be made to this section. I have no intention of pressing it to a division, but wish to explain the position as it occurs to me. In the first place I would point oufc how onerous is paragraph of e of the principal A ct with which my suggested amendment deals. It is very inunusual, but in order to be perfectly straightforward I cannot do better than is quote a case with which I am altogether familiar. A friend of mine has a home, which, in former days, was not very valufolable, but the value of which has since in creased very much. He does not wish to of leave it , and prefers to forego a considerforeign consuls and the trade able amount rather than do so. Last commissioners of any part of year, for the privilege of living in his own the British Dominions.'"" house he had to pay, by way of Federal and State land taxation and municipal taxes all sorts, no less than £ 6 8 8 . The fact he elected to pay those charges is an of his bond fide desire to remain in his own home. If he chose to sell the old home, he could avoid that outlay, now aDd obtain interest on the capital. He of has no desire, however, to do so, and this amending clause his taxation In other words, he will have to pay about £888 a year by way of taxation on the house in which he lives. It would do the country no good to dispossess him of his home, and it seems to me that some l i m it should be placed on the amount chargea comable under paragraph e of section 14 of I have, therefore, a given notice of an amendment fixing a divilimi t of £300, but I do not wish to press it . If the Attorney-General is prepared to meet such a case I shall be glad; if he cannot I shall say no more.",8
27,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.17]. - The amendment of which the right honourable gentleman has given notice differs very widely from the amendment of the principal Act before the House, and relates to a different sub-section. point raised by him was discussed at some length when the original Bill was before the House. The principle was then adopted that in order that the incidence of the tax might f all fair l y , it was sary to treat as income the amount of rent that would be received from a house owned and occupied by the taxpayer if it were let to another person. The right honourable gentleman has put his case very fairly, but with very great regret I am unable to accept the amendment suggested.",9
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Swan) [11.19]. - I should like to explain that if the owner of the property to which I have referred were to let it , .he would not get more than £300 a year for it . He certainly would not obtain a rental representing 5 per cent, on its value. At the most he would obtain a rental of £300 a year, whereas the taxation would represent a rental of £1,500 a year.",9
29,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"West Sydney-Prime Minister aud Attorney-General) [11.20]. - I quite agree with my right honourable friend so far as this particular case is concerned, but I would remind him that this law has a general application. would be most undesirable that a man with a house worth £600 a year should escape taxation while the great mass of the people whose houses are not equal to a rental value of £300 a year should pay taxation upon them. It is to that, and not to this particular case, that I take exception. If I could make a law to meet the case of this one particular person I should have no objection. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 3Section 15 of the principal Act is amended by inserting at the end thereof the following sub-section:"" (3) Goods shall be deemed to be sold in Australia on account of a person not resident in Australia, or on account of a company not registered in Australia, if any person in Australia receives n commission in respect of the sale of the goods or is paid a salary for obtaining orders for or for influencing the sale of the goods.""

30,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Flinders) neces- [11.21] - I intended on the second reading, of this measure to deal as clearly as 1 could with some misapprehensions that I think arise regarding the purpose and effect of the clause now before us. The Attorney-General, however, was unable fco be present, so that he will pardon me if I deal with the clause a little more full y than I should do in ordinary circumstances. A good deal of doubt and difficulty is likely to arise from the reading of section 15 as proposed to be amended, or even as unamended, in connection with section 52 of the Act . I am entirely in sympathy with the object which I think the Attorney-General desires to attain. His object I understand to be that, foreign companies and foreign individuals, who directly or indirectly derive a profit, from business done in Australia, shall payincome tax upon the profits of that business. That is the broad principle.",9
31,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,That is so.,9
32,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I agree entirely with it . It is in accordance with It the principle adopted, not only here, but in other countries. The main provision for giving effect to it under the Income Tax Act is based on profits. The in come has to be ascertained in the ordinary way, and the person who is made responsible for that is the agent who is carrying on the business here. The agent carrying on the business here is the man who receives the money for transmission to the principal. I think we shall all agree that any branch of a house, or any agent carrying on the business of a foreign principal here, should be obliged, as required by section 52, to make returns, and that the agent should be made responsible for the payment, out of the moneys he received on behalf of his principal, of the income tax payable on that man's income. The trouble arises, I think, not in this amendment of section 15, but under section 15 itself. I wish to help the Attorney-General to avoid the trouble and, in some cases, hardship that may arise in giving effect to what is really the principle of this provision. The main principle that governs all is that embodied in section 52, under which the agent has to ascertain the profits and to pay the income tax, and is entitled to reimburse himself out of the moneys received for his principal. Section 15 is intended to deal with the same principle; but is applied to a somewhat different class of cases. Where you have not an agent who is, in the ordinary sense, carrying on the business of a principal here, but an agent who is simply effecting sales for principals - acting, perhaps, for a number of firms in a number of isolated - cases of sales, but not a representative in the wide sense of the wordthen you say with regard to such contracts, "" Where there is no foreign business carried on here, arrive at a rough and ready means of estimating the profits by assuming that the profits on the actual sales and contracts amount to 5 per cent."" again with that principle, for it is a fair way of dealing with a practical difficulty. But section 15, unfortunately, I think, makes the individual agent who has made the contract personally responsible to pay out of his own money the income tax on that 5 per cent. That is where the first trouble arises. It is perfectly right that he should pay the income tax out of any moneys in hand, or that he should retain moneys after the Act comes into operation, and he knows what he has to do, to pay income tax due by his principal. But to say that, in respect of the year ending 30th June, 1915, agents who simply effect sales-wh o are simply the agents for entering into these contracts, while other persons have the handling of the money, shall be personally responsible for the income tax, is manifestly unjust. Such a provision cannot be carried oub. I am satisfied that if it remains the Attorney-General, when we meet next year, will find it necessary to propose an amendment to do away with the manifest injustice. the other hand, if the selling agent be, as in some cases, the man who receives the money for the sale, then he ought to be, and would be, responsible under section 52. That is the whole position.",9
33,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,'Does the honourable member propose to amend section 15 of the principal Act? Sir William Irvine.,10
34,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I am not going to propose any amendment, but I wish to make a suggestion. The difficulty to which I have referred as existing under section 15 will be immensely accentuated by this amending clause. The amending clause would extend this personal liability, not merely to the man who effects the sale, but to any man who receives a commission in respect of the sale of goods, or is paid salary for obtaining orders or for in fluencing the sale of goods. That in cludes a very wide class of advertising agents, who may have nothing to do with the receipt of the money, and may not be immediately connected with the actual sale which gives rise to the receipt of the money. I suggest that the Attorney General should strengthen section 52 which applies to every agent. The in terpretation clause includes as an agent we will every person who receives any money, and section 52 makes every person who receives the money of his principal liable to pay income tax. If he is a person I agree carrying on a business, he is supposed to make a return in the ordinary way, and to pay taxation on his income. But if he is an agent who receives money sporadically or occasionally for sales effected by himself or somebody else, he would accept the benefits of section 15, because he would, say, "" I cannot make out a profit on these sales, but I will pay taxation on 5 per cent."" The man who receives the money is the person who ought to be made responsible for paying the whole of the income tax, whether it is measured in the ordinary way upon a statement of profits, or under section 15 as 5 per cent, on the sales effected. I suggest for the consideration of the Prime Minister that an investigation will disclose that section 52 does cover, not only the man who conducts a business and presents a return in the ordinary way, but also the man who receives money on sales effected by himself or anybody else. If he is liable to pay income tax on that money, it is unnecessary to make liable the person who effects the sale, but does not receive the On money. At the same time, it is necessary that the person who effects the sale should supply the Department with a full return. If he also receives the money, he pays taxation, but if he does not he fortifies the Department with the whole of the information on which the person who does receive the money is made liable. If the Act is amended as I suggest, I see no objection to increasing the liability to make returns, so as to include persons employed on salary or commission, or as advertising agents. But the amendment as applied to section 15, creating a direct personal liability on the part of the agent to pay out of his own money taxation on money received by another person, who is liable to taxation, would lead to difficulties which the Attorney-General would do well to consider.",10
35,Mr HDGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.33]. - Sectio n 15 has been the subject of particular criticism. Whilst I do not say for one moment that there is not force in the arguments put forward, yet the revenue must be protected, and the Government must have fro m one source or another taxation to carry on the business of the country during this trying period. I have heard what honourable members have said, and I noticed particularly the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Flinders in regard to a suggested modus vivendi. honourable members will pass the clause, I will give my assurance that before the measure reaches another place I shall take an opportunity of consulting the Treasurer and the officers of the Department, with a view to seeing what alteration can be made. If the amount of revenue involved is not considerable, I shall be perfectly willing to not press the amendment in its present form. matter will be investigated at once, and with a favourable mind. Clause agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to. Clause 5 (Amendment of section 18). Section proposed to be amended18. In calculating the taxable income of a taxpayer the total income derived by the taxpayer from all sources in Australia shall taken as a basis, and from it there shall deducted(b) all rates and taxes, including State Federal land taxes and State income tax actually paid by the taxpayer in which the income was received.",11
36,Mr MANIFOLD,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Corangamite) [11.36] - Paragrap h a of this clause provides that deductions shall not be made for the losses and outgoings of capital. A merchant who loses his buildby ing or stock by fire or other causes is, ought to be, covered by insurance; but insurance is not possible in regard to live stock of a farmer and grazier. I loses his stock, he loses his entire capital and working plant, and then he is to be asked to find money to pay taxation on the income which he had last year. I believe that under the Queensland Act deductions of losses of capital, even stock, are not allowed, but it must be remembered that the Federal tax is a duplication of existing taxation. There are farmers throughout portions of New South Wales and Queensland, apart from the graziers, who will lose practically everything they possess except their land if rain does not f all shortly, and now we ask them, after they have lost all their working capital, to pay taxation on an income which existed last year. Live stock cannot be insured against drought, and I ask the Attorney-General to consider the possibilit y of allowing deductions for loss of capital invested in live stock. There are men in the electorate of Eichmond whose whole capital will disappear unless rain comes soon. If a farmer is a tenant, perhaps his live stock is his only possesIf sion. He may have £1,000 worth of stock on the farm , and if the drought continues his whole capital will disappear, and then he will be asked to pay income tax on income derived last year.",11
37,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.40]. - I quite appreciate the point put forward by the honourable member, hut there The is vested in the Commissioner very wide discretion, which gives him power to meet such cases as have heen referred to. Section 14 providesThe income of any person shall include(a) profits derived from any trade or business and converted into stock-intrade or added to the capital of or in any way invested in the trade or business: be Provided that for the purpose of computing be such profits the value of all live stock, produce, goods, and merchandise (not being plant used in the production of income) not disposed and of at the beginning and end of tlic year in which the income was derived shall be taken during the year into account. I think that proviso will enable the Commissioner to meet the cases referred to. However, the honourable member will not ask me to accept an alteration of a carefully-thought-out amendment put forward the Commissioner without taking opor portunity to consider very carefully its effect. He will realise that the effect the of his suggested amendment would not be f he confined to such cases, but would extend /generally, and although, it may be equit-able and proper to exempt those cases, care must be taken that such an amendment could not be used for the purpose of depleting the revenue. If the honourable member will allow the clause to pass, I will promise that, before it is finally dealt with in another place, the cases he has mentioned shall receive consideration, and if the proviso in section 14, paragraph a, does not afford t'he relief that is necessary, I will see what alteration can be made.",11
38,Mr FENTON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Maribyrnong) [11.43]. - I think that the requirements of the honourable member for Corangamite are met by section 64, which provides that a Board, consisting of the Commissioner, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Coniptroller-peneral of Customs, may, in cases of hardship, release taxpayers, wholly or in part, from their liability. Sir JOHN FORREST [11.44] - I wish to move That the following paragraph be added to the clause: (7t) by inserting in paragraph & after the word "" State "" the words "" and Federal."" The object of the amendment is to enable the deduction of Federal income tax when arriving at the taxable income. As I had not an opportunity on the last occasion, I wish to bring the matter up now. ""Under the principal Act, the payments of Federal land tax and State land tax are - allowed to be deducted in arriving at the taxable income. Further, State income tax and municipal taxes may be deducted, but, for some reason or other which I cannot ascertain, the Federal income tax is not deductible. I have consulted lawyers and others, and I cannot ascert a in why. The assessment is made on the previous year's income, and, if the deductions I have mentioned are proper, I see no reason why an exception should be made of the Federal income tax.",12
39,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.48]. - The point raised by the right honourable gentleman has no doubt occurred to many, and it is a standing mystery even to the most intelligent people. having been permitted access to the in most secrets of the Commissioner's office, I have been able to learn the reason for this exception from the general rule. The object of this taxation is, of course, to obtain revenue, and, technically, there is no doubt that our power to impose taxation includes the power to tax the whole income; that is to say, we could impose a tax of 20s. in the i l . If taxpayers were allowed to deduct the amount of income tax paid, aud a tax of 20s. in the £ 1 were imposed, a taxpayer would have the right to deduct the whole, and would, therefore, pay no tax. at all. That is the explanation of the position, and when stated in these terms it is perfectly obvious. We do not tax the amount paid in State income tax because that taxation has nothing to do with us; but to make the exemption now suggested would be to exempt the very income that we are taxing, and render the instrument of taxation a piece of worthless paper. Sir JOJ i N FORREST (Swan) [11.50]. - I am much obliged to the Attorney General, but I do not think there is much in his argument. If the only object of this taxation is to raise revenue, why have any deductions at all ? When, how(Swan) ever, there are deductions, why should an exception be made in a case which is clearly one in the same category as the others. I submit that the explanation is not very edifying, at any rate to me.",12
40,Mr BOYD,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Henty) r i l . 5 1 ] - The same principle as that laid down by the Attorney General is in operation in the case of the Income Tax Act , Victoria. That Act forbids the deduction of the amount' paid in the previous year, but allows the deduction of Federal taxes and all other State taxes. We may look at the matter from a different point of view. Let us take the case of a man with an income of £1,000 a year, when it is decided to impose a tax of 10 per cent., representing £ 1 0 0 . If the next year this man was allowed to deduct the £10 0 paid in the previous year, the country would not get 10 per cent, on £1,000. The principle is thoroughly sound, and I agree with the view of the Commissioner. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES ) agreed toThat the following paragraph be inserted:"" (I) Sums paid by way of commission for collecting income."" Clause, as amended, agreed to. However, Clause 6 (Amendment of section 19).",12
41,Mr BOYD,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"He n t y ) [11.54] - I desire to call the attention of the Attorney General to what appears to me to be an omission in the amendment of section 19. That section provides for an exemption, in a certain manner, of £156 on incomes from property and from personal exert i o n ; but the new clause provides for an - equal division. In the case of a man who had a much greater income from personal exertion than from property, there might not be, with an equal division, a sufficient amount of property to cover the - exemption. As I read the clause, such a man would be unable to get the full .benefit of the extra exemption on the income derived from personal exertion. All I ask is that the Attorney-General shall look into the matter, and to aid him I shall have pleasure in placing before him two concrete cases for his consideration. Clause agreed to.",12
42,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.55]. - I move That after clause 6 the following new clause he inserted:""6A. Section 27 of the principal Aot is amended(a) by adding at the end of sub-section 1 thereof the following proviso:of a partnership entered into before the commencement of this Act there shall be deducted from the total tax assessable to the ship so much of the total tax as bears to the total tax the proportion which that part (if any) of the whole income which is distributed to the partners bears to the whole income.' (6) by adding after sub-section 2 thereof the following sub-section:section 2 of this section income shall be deemed to be distributed if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, it is held by the trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary, who is a minor, or for the reasonable expenditure of the trust estate.' (o) by omitting from sub-section 3 thereof the words ' to such of the beneficiaries as are taxpayers,' and inserting in their stead the words ' to the beneficiaries.' "" This new clause is proposed in order to limit the effect of a previous amendment made in the incidence of taxation on partners, to partnerships entered into before the coming into operation of the Bill . The honourable member for M a r ibyrnong, in a letter that he sent to the Department, cited a case of gross unfairness arising through the operation of the clause as it stands. The amendment was intended to make the incidence fall more equitably on partners. pointed out, however, that bogus partnerships might be created in order to get the benefit of the section; and the present amendment is intended to confine that benefit to partnerships made before the commencement of the Act.",13
43,Mr KELLY,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Wentworth) [11.56] This clause also affects trustees and beneficiaries, and is, I believe, due to the suggestions of a Trustee Company. It is not quite clear to me, however, that the Bill as amended will touch the case of an ordinary beneficiary, who is neither a minor nor has had sums kept back for repairs and maintenance. Eor instance, in the case of an estate distributed on 2nd July, a whole quarterly instalment of income would, on the 30th June, he held over technically. I am informed that this is safeguarded by section 28, sub-section 3, of the original ActWhen the income of any person cannot be conveniently returned as for the year fixed by this Act, the Commissioner may accept returns made up to the date of the annual balance of the accounts of such person. But there is no "" a n n u a l balance"" in ' Provided that in the assessment this sense in the case of a trust estate; there are quarterly payments, and I am in doubt as to whether the words "" annual partner- balance "" will not put such estates out of court, and involve taxation at a higher amount on sums not really, but technically, "" held back."" This, I am sure, was never intended by the Government or by the House; and I ask the Attorney General to look into the matter. ' (2A) For the purposes of sub- Mr HUGHES (West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [12.0]. - I shall do so. The object of the amendment is to relieve hardship in the case of certain trust estates, and although it is quite satisfactory to the trustee company referred to, it may fail to cover some of the points raised. I shall look into the matter before the Bill finally leaves another place, and see what is necessary to be done. The Commissioner says that he can adjust the date of distribution, and that it is not fixed by the return. However, if there be any other points I shall see to them. Proposed new clause agreed to. Clauses 7 to 9 and title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Standing Orders suspended, and report adopted.

46,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Wakefield) [12.4] - Some of the objections that have been urged against the construction of the proposed railway were caused by want of information which should have been placed before us. The Minister was kind enough to let me see last night the Estimate for the proposed bridge across the Katherine. I understand that a temporary bridge is to be provided, at a cost of £11,000, and paid for out of the vote for the not yet completed section between Pine Creek and the Katherine River. I regret that we have not fuller information regarding this bridge, because £11,000 is a large sum to spend on a temporary structure, which is to be pulled down again as soon as the proposed extension of 60 miles has been made.",14
47,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,When does the wet season begin there?,14
48,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,It is to begin very shortly.,14
49,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Then we are to build a bridge for the conveyance across the river of material which cannot be used during the wet season! Why not pass an Act of Parliament postponing the wet season?,14
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,What is the rainfall on the Katherine?,14
51,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"About 16 or 17 inches. In my opinion, this temporary bridge will, in all probability, serve for the traffic on the proposed line for three or four years to come.",14
52,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,That is the intention of the engineer.,14
53,Mr RIOHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Then whywas it not made known in the beginning?,14
54,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,I understand that the railway to the Katherine will be useless until the river has been crossed.,14
55,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Yes. Primarily this work will form part of a defence line, but as it will traverse country some of which is inferior, some good, and some excellent pastoral land, and possibly mining country, but not agricultural, it is not likely to carry a largepopulation for a generation or more, and,, therefore, in its construction economy should be studied from start to finish. A sound road should be made, but there should be no extravagance in building orin other directions.",14
56,Mr FENTON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,A defence railway would require a gauge of 4 ft . 8£ in.,14
57,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"It must be possible to run trains at a high rate of"" speed on a defence railway; and, therefore, the road should be made as solid as possible.",14
58,Mr FLEMING,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"If this is to he a defence railway, why is there to be a lowlevel bridge across the river, which would mean that troops would have to wait until a flood had subsided before they could use it.",14
59,Mr FENTON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"I understand that a temporary bridge is to carry a line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and that a better bridge will be built when there is a conversion to the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge.",14
60,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"It would be a wicked thing to spend £170,000 on a bridge during the war. We must wait until our finances are in a more satisfactory condition.",14
61,Mr MANIFOLD,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,How much per mile will the line cost?,14
62,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"About £5,000 a mile. The honourable member spoke of £14,819 being set down for stations, but I understand that that sum covers not only station buildings, but also station yards, sidings, and all conveniences, and provides for a water supply, which will cost £7,000. More details should have been submitted in the first instance. I should not support a proposal to erect expensive station buildings.",14
63,Mr WISE,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"At Darwin there is only a shed at the station, and no platform, and it is the same right through to Pine Creek.",14
64,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Econom y should be observed until the increase of population demands more generous expenditure. Sleepers and rails will account for the greater part of the £300,000 set down for the line. The Engineer-inChief recommends timber sleepers.",15
65,Mr KING OMALLEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,They would be eaten in three months.,15
66,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The best lised sleepers. of them would not last twelve months.,15
67,Sir JOHN FORREST,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,How have the powellised sleepers that we bought lasted?,15

If they are lasting way. well, why have we not been informed?",15

He is my informant in this regard. From what he has told me, I advise the use of steel sleepers on the section of the line from Katherine River to Bitter Springs.",15
72,Mr KING OMALLEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,We cannot obtain them. America will not quote f o them.,15
73,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"I am aware that they cannot be obtained. The latest them. quotations are about 19s. per sleeper, when they used to be worth 9s.",15
74,Mr KING OMALLEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The manufacturers will not supply them at 19s.,15
75,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"If we use lasting, timber sleepers it will be throwing: money. All along South Australian railway engineers have condemned the use of timber sleepers in the Northvided. ern Territory. It is claimed that powellised sleepers might be used. The South Australian engineers have experimented for many years on the treatment of sleepero by creosote and other preserving methods. I am sure that the Public Works Committee will gather from them that the results have not proved sufficiently satisfactory to justify them in recommending the use of powel",15
76,Mr RILEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Would it not be better to wait u n t i l we can get steel slespers ?,15
77,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"That is done what I was going to say. Mr Bell, the Engineer-in-Chief, savs that he will use sleepers if the Minister will find the money; but we must remember that these sleepers have advanced 110 per cent, in price, and we shall not be actine rightly we build railways in that extravagant It is infinitely better to wait until we can eet sleepers at 9s. or 10s. each. The concrete sleeper has not been sufficiently in use to enable any one to pronounce it as effective for use on this",15
78,Mr BAMFORD,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The obiection to the sleeper is that it will not hold,15
79,Mr RTCHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Anothe r objection is that the vibration breaks it,15
80,Mr LAIRD SMTTH,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The concrete sleeper On will not stand vibration.,15
81,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Som a eight or nine months ago Mr Teesdale Smith n contracted with the Tramways Trust in Adelaide to lay down a mile of concrete sleepers, and as the agreement was that if at the end of six months they were to be unsatisfactory, Mr Teesdale Smith was not to be paid for them, it is evident that he has considerable faith in them. He has a patent which imbeds in each sleeper a very strong spring, which relieves it of the vibration which otherwise would break it up.",15
82,Mr SAMPSON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The last word has not r been said in regard to concrete sleepers.,15
83,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,B y no means has the last word been said upon,15
84,Mr BAMFORD,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Are concrete sleepers cheap ?,15
85,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"They cost about l is . each, but, as their life is everi f they should prove satisfactory, away they would be cheaper than jarrah sleepers in the long run. For ballasting this line £1,000 a mile has been proWe cannot expect work to be done in the Northern Territory at withi n 20 or 25 per cent, of the cost of similar work in a temperate climate, but it seems to me that if ballast can be obtained all along the line, or even anywhere on the 60-miles section, the estimate of £1,000 is an enormous figure.",15
86,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,In Western Queensland are not the sleepers earth-packed ?,16
87,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"That is so, but it all depends upon the character of the country, and with an earth-packed line a greater speed than 15 miles an hour cannot be obtained.",16
88,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,A high speed will not be required on this line.,16
89,Mr RICHARD EOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"One requirement on a transcontinental railway is speed. Furthermore, it is necessary on a railway running into cattle country, otherwise the stock in transit to markets will eat all the profits. This railway ought to be ballasted, and it should be a strong road, but £1,000 per mile is a very big sum indeed. I know that ballast has to be taken 400 miles along the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway at the Port Augusta end, aud even in that case the estimate for ballasting did not exceed £ 8 0 0 . We should not adhere rigidly to the principle of day labour in the construction of this railway. year after year we have had dinned into our ears t'he success of railway construction in Queensland by day labour, but the very first report that Mr Bell submitted in his capacity as Engineer-inChief of the Commonwealth Railways, showed that as a rule railways were built in Queensland, not by day labour, but by the petty contract or butty-gang system. Day labour was only resorted to where conditions were not satisfactory for the application of the small contract system.",16
90,Mr BURNS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"At any rate, there were no middlemen in Queensland railway construction.",16
91,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"As for the middleman, I can tell the honourable member that if a contractor had in hand the construction of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, and was simply to set as his profit the present Government waste and loss, he would be more than a millionaire at the termination of his contract. It is about time that Parliament looked at the position fairl y and squarely. We are losing millions of money.",16
92,Mr BURNS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Does the honourable member base that statement on the profits secured by Mr Teesdale Smith ?,16
93,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Yes , and! on the work done on Mr Teesdale Smith's piece of construction. My informants were the very navvies who worked for Mr Teesdale Smith. They told me that had the Government done that section by day labour it would have cost twice as much. It is about time this National Parliament determined that if the day labour system is to be continued in carrying out our public works it must be prepared to submit to the test of public competition. All our public works should be submitted to public tender, and if the Government Department can beat the middleman-as my honourable friend calls him-o r outside tenderer, let it have the work, and if the public Department cannot beat the outside tenderer, let the outside tenderer have the work in the interests of the taxpayer. If there is an advantage on either side it should be on the side of the taxpayer.",16
94,Mr SAMPSON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"That is what, is done in South Australia. How has the system succeeded ?",16
95,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"In favour of the public tenderer. Fifteen or twenty years ago contractors were doing reEor markably well. They were paid handsome prices for the work, and in consequence the Engineer-in-Chief of the Public Works Department was for several years able to compete successfully with them. But those were the days when the Engineer-in-Chief, and not outside in fluence, buil t the railways. Gradually outside influence crept in , and with it returned the day of the contractors. Nevertheless, I could quote tender after tender to show the difference between the public tender and the cost of the work when it was constructed by the Department. If honourable members opposite have such faith in the ability of the Government to do work more cheaply than it can be done otherwise, why do they object to competition by public tender? Competition offers the only possible protection the taxpayers have.",16
96,Mr MASSYGREENE,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,There is no check otherwise.,16
97,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"There is no check at all. I know honourable members say that certain works have been constructed by day labour below the estimate, but we have not been full y in formed what the estimate was for. If the Engineer-in-Chief and his officers had full control, they would know how to estimate for any particular work, but if present-day conditions apply, and control is from the bottom and not from the top, where can the officials have any autliority 1 I want to repeat, and I shall repeat it over and over again, that this country is losing hundreds of thousands of poundsI am not sure that it is not losing millions^-owin g to the slipshod manner in which work is done, and the absence of official authority. The only remedy is a return to the public tender. Government can then beat the outside contractor, let the Government do the work, but if the Engineer submits his specifications and estimates, and obtains the contract, and at the conclusion of the work it is found that his estimate has been largely exceeded, every detail of the extra cost should be submitted to Parliament.",16
98,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"On a order, may I draw attention to section 15 of the Public Works Committee Act , which statesNo public work of any kind whatsoever (except Military or Naval), the estimated cost of completing which exceeds £25,000, and whether such work is a continuation, completion, repair, reconstruction, extension, or a new work, shall be commenced unless sanctioned as in this section provided. The Act further states that the Committee shall deal with the matter with all convenient despatch and present a report to the House of Representatives as the result of their inquiries. It goes onAfter the receipt of a report of the Committee the House of Representatives shall by resolution declare either that it is expedient to carry out the proposed work or that it is not expedient to carry it out. By the action taken in respect of this proposal the spirit and the letter of the Public Works Act are being deliberately avoided; and the point I raise is that', as this railway scheme has been referred to the Public Works Committee, who are now engaged in taking evidence upon it , this Bill is not in order in being on the^ notice-paper at all. May I show the absurdity of the position. has referred this work to the Public Works Committee. The Public ""Works Committee are now taking evidence. This Bill is before the House, and yet the actual, work of constructing the railway is now in progress. If the action that has been taken is agreed to, then the Public Works Committee Act will be rendered a complete farce. This is the first occasion upon which the Public Works Committee Act has been really needed. It was to meet a situation like this that the Act was introduced. It was the deliberate intention of Parliament that no such work as this should be proceeded with until the Committee had obtained evidence upon it , and the proposal had been discussed by Parliament in the light of full information. I have every confidence in the If the Committee. I believe ""it is a good Committee",17
99,Mr SPEAKER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The honourable member is now going beyond his point of order.,17
100,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Then I will ask your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to the effect of section 15 of the Public Works - Committee Act upon this proposal; whether it is in order, and in accordance with law, for point of the House to discuss this Bill , seeing that the Public Works Committee are already taking evidence, upon the proposal referred to in it .",17
101,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"The point raised by the honourable member for Franklin amounts practically to a suggestion that the Public Works Committee Act is not subject to repeal. I submit that the Public Works Committee Act does not in any way tie the hands of this House in regard to this Bill . The power possessed by the House when it passed the Public Works Committee Act is still inherent in the House, which can repeal the Public Works Committee Act, or cause to be inserted in this Bill words stating that the Act shall not apply.",17
102,Mr SPEAKER,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"The point raised by the honourable member for Franklin is purely a question of law. A very heavy Committee tax would be imposed upon the Speaker if , as soon as any motion or B i ll were in troduced, he were expected to put the whole of the Crown Law Offices into operation in order to see whether what was proposed to be done was in accordance with the law. That would not be possible; so that the only duty devolving Parliament upon the Speaker is to see that what is done is done in accordance with parliamentary practice and the practice of this House. So far as I have been able to gather, nothing has been done in the in troduction of this Bill that is contrary to the practice of this House. If the Governmeut desire to take any course, it is not for me to say whether that course is legal or illegal. That is a matter for otlier authorities to decide. So far as the procedure is concerned, the Bill is quite in order.",17
103,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Franklin) [12.42]. - I would ask the House and the Government to seriously consider what is being done. If it is the intention of the Government to repeal the Public Works Committee Act, let that be done in a straightforward way.",18
104,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The Government propose to do nothing of the kind.,18
105,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"If 'the attitude that, notwithstanding the existence of the Public Works Committee Act, the Government can introduce and carry out any work without reference to the Public .Works Committee is to be accepted as correct, then the Public Works Committee is nothing better than a farce, and the Act a sham. liament has deliberately passed over this scheme to the Public Works Committee for examination. The Committee have already commenced to take evidence. Simultaneously with the taking of that evidence, work on the railway has begun, and when the report of the Committee comes along the railway will have been almost completed.",18
106,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Will the honourable member be satisfied with the undertaking that nothing shall be done to carry out this work until the report from the Public Works Committee is received ?,18
107,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Yes , I will;_ but that does not relieve us from the position that has arisen. If the Minister will promise that the House will have an opportunity to consider the Committee's report before the work is proceeded with, I shall be satisfied.",18
108,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,I will not say that.,18
109,Mr FINLAYSON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,That it will not be proceeded with until the Minister has received the report? .,18
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"That would not do, because, even if the report condemned the work, the Minister, if he favoured it, could allow it to go on, and thus make a still greater farce of the whole proceedings. This is by far the most important work that has been referred to the Committee, and, with the exception of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, is the most important with which the House has had to deal. It will cost the country £10,000,000 to complete the north-south railway.",18
111,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,We are already committed to that by South Australia.,18
112,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,But we want to know whether we are following the right route.,18

114,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"No ; we have appointed the Public Works Committee to do that, amongst other things, and to submit evidence to the House, so that we may have some knowledge of what we are doing. I have the utmost confidence in the Committee, and believe that it will do its work conscientiously and well. We shall make a terrible blunder if we pass over the Committee and allow this work to be commenced before it is reported Par- upon by it. By doing that we shall open the door to any Government to proceed with any work it pleases in defiance of the Public Works Committee Act. I ask the House to insist that this line shall not be proceeded with until we have received the report of the Public Works Committee.",18
115,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Wentworth) [12.48] I wish to state briefly the difficulties in which one who wishes well of this north-south line is placed in the present circumstances. In the first instance, we are asked to be parties to a breach of the law. There is no doubt that this House has the inherent power to repeal legislation; but it is useless to disregard legislation on the statute-book in a matter of vital importance, while pretending to observe the law. If the repeal of the Public Works Committee Act is required, it should be faced and undertaken in a straightforward, direct, and honourable manner.",18
116,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"The honourable member must have an "" edge "" on the Committee.",18
117,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"I have not; but I have some doubt as to whether the functions of the Committee, in considering a policy work like this, are as useful as in considering an ordinary work of executive action in a more accessible place. I am in some difficulty in determining whether this House would not be in a better position to size up the reports of the experts themselves as to these distant railways than we should be if the Committee examined the experts and then gave us the views of the experts-cum-Committee.",18
118,Mr SAMPSON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The evidence is published with the report in each case.,19
119,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"E very one reads the reports, but no one reads the evidence, with the result that the special knowledge of the experts can be obscured- I do not suggest that it is deliberately done-by the method in which it is presented. I have no desire to enter into a wrangle with the members of the Public Works Committee as to the usefulness of their labours. merely express a doubt as to the wisdom of referring to them these purely policy works, which the Government intend to proceed with regardless of whether or not they are going to be paying propositions. The next point is as to whether, in the we should proceed with this line at the present time. The late Liberal Administration decided to build the Pine Creek to Katherine River line upon a 4-ft. 8^-in. extension basis. say, we decided that the line should be built on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, so as to link up with the Northern Territory line; but the sleepers, culverts, and cuttings and curves were to be such as would enable the immediate conversion of the line to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. That was decided in anticipation of the almost immediate unification of the Australian gauges.",19
120,Mr LAIEDSMITH,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,That was a very good policy.,19
121,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"An excellent policy. The difficulty, however, is that, if we are to accept the ex-Prime Minister as the mouthpiece of events, the unification of the Australian railway gauges is indefinitely postponed. If it is, then this line should be built on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. It is a mere waste of money, if we are to have no unification of gauges, to build a 3-ft. 6-in. line on 4-ft. 8^-in. sleepers. The cost of ballasting a 4-ft. 8^-in. line is in finitely greater than that of ballasting a 3-ft. 6-in. line. There is also great doubt as to whether this railway ought not to be earth-packed throughout. members may talk of the necessity for the quick passage of live stock. curry line, however, is an earth-packed railway, with a maximum speed of 15 miles an hour, and it is carrying in the neighbourhood of 300,000 stock per annum to the meat works-a n infinitely greater traffic than we shall have on this line.",19
122,Mr FLEMING,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,They would make much better meat if carried at 30 miles an hour.,19
123,Mr KELLY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"That is not the point now under consideration. We have to consider economy; yet we are deliberately proposing to build a line upon specifications to connect up with the uniform gauge system, although, judging by the ex-Prime Minister's utterances, there is I no possibility of a uniform railway system in Australia for many years to come. We ought not to proceed with this line u n t i l we know exactly what is to be done with respect to a uniform gauge, and generally in regard to the Northern Territory railway system connecting both South circumstances, Australia and Queensland. In these circumstances I shall feel it my dutyalthough a friend of the north-south line, and of the south-east and north-west extensions-to vote against this Bill . That is to  [12.55] - I regret, Mr Speaker, that the point raised by the honourable member for Franklin was not upheld by you. If this motion goes to a division I shall feel compelled to vote against it . I would not be doing my duty to my constituents and the country if I were to vote for an expenditure of £320,000 on such meagre information as was given us by the Minister in introducing this measure. It has never been my lot to hear a Bill introduced in , I might almost say, such a careless manner, and with such little information and so much levity as marked the introduction of this measure. I am not reflecting on the Minister of Home Affairs in making this statement, for he has only recently come into ofiice. But it will be my duty always to vote against proposals of this kind when they are not backed up by .information which the House should possess. We have a Public Works Committee in which we have confidence, and which was appointed to report on all works estimated to cost £25,000 or more. In this case, where we have an estimated Honourable expenditure of £320,000, they are to be ignored, although we are passing through The Clon- times when every Government is crying out for economy. I am not prepared to do this, and shall never be while I remain a member of this Parliament.  the work has been referred to the Public Works Committee by resolution of the House.  circumstances this proposal should not be tolerated. I do not intend to traverse the ground already covered during this debate. It will be sufficient. to point out that the cost of steel sleepers alone, according to the honourable member for Wakefield, has increased by about 100 per cent.",19
124,Mr FINLAYSON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Fro m each.  proximately 100 per cent. typical of the increases in the prices of many other materials that will have to be used. At a time like this, when the greatest possible economy is necessary, we should not pledge the country to go on with a proposal of this kind while we shall have to pay these greatly enhanced prices. The only point urged in favour of the course proposed by the Minister is that, unless we proceed at once with the construction of this line, 500 men already in the Territory will be thrown out of employment. I do not believe that. There are sections of the line from Pine Creek to Katherine River yet to be completed, and I believe it would pay the Government to find employment for these men elsewhere in the Commonwealth rather than to proceed with this work at a time when a hugely increased expenditure must be involved. appeal for economy, the honourable member for Wakefield suggested that too much reliance should not be placed on the day-labour system. As one who is as anxious as he is for economy, I would remind him that in Victoria, where we have in power the only Liberal Administration in Australia, the day-labour system has been in force for many years, and that, according to the Minister of Public Works, the State railways are constructed for far less than would be possible under the contract system.",20
125,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Is that on butty-gang system ?  pally.,20
126,Mr FLEMING,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"That is quite different from the method adopted by the Commonwealth Government.  not. I do not want to refer to other States controlled by Labour Administrations where the day-labour system is in operation; it is sufficient to point out that the only Liberal Administration in Australia has adopted the day-labour system, and has found it to be cheaper than the contract system. I mention this only by the way. We know nothing ot the country to be traversed by this line, we have none of the details that we should possess, . >d I feel therefore that ov I should be lacking in my duty as a representative of the people if I voted 10s. to 19s. for the expenditure of this huge sum of money without a report being obtained first of all from the Public Works This is Committee, which was specially appointed to deal with such matters.",20
127,Unknown,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,20
128,Mr RILEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"South Sydney) [2.15] The proposed extension of the Pine CreekKatherine River railway to Bitter Springs is certainly a very important proposal, and the Government are to be commended for having taken action to continue the present line, which is part of the railway which the Commonwealth promised to construct when it took over the Territory. The question for the House to consider is whether this is the most opportune time to build the railway. The Minister of Home Affairs has told us that one of the principal reasons for undertaking the work at the present time is to provide employment for a number of the men at present engaged in the construction of the section previously sanctioned by ParliaI n making his ment. It is said that there are about 500 men employed on that railway, and that unless the proposed extension is proceeded with a number of the men will be thrown out of employment, and the authorities will be faced later with the necessity of reorganizing the whole gang. When we realise the difficulty and expense of taking men to the Territory, we can quite understand the anxiety of the Minister to have the work put in hand, in order to retain the men who are already there. The Minister of External Affairs has given a guarantee that the laying of the the line will not be proceeded with until the project has been inquired into and reported upon by the Public Works Committee. That assurance has considerably relieved the situation. I would point out to the House the difficult position in which the Committee would be placed if asked to report on a railway, the construction of which had already been decided upon by the House. If this Bill is passed, the Department will probably proceed to order material, and make other preparations for the building of the line. At this stage I do not think it would be wise for the Goverument to purchase timber sleepers for the line.",20
129,Sir JOHN FORREST,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Do the GovernCommittee ment propose to do that ?,21
130,Mr RILEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,I do not know; but should like to hear some evidence as to whether it is desirable to use timber sleepers in that country. I should not like to record a vote either for or the use of timber sleepers without the fullest inquiry having been made.,21
131,Mr BAMFORD,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,You are Chairman of a Committee whose duty it is to such inquiry.,21

133,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,The Bill is only permistion sive. It says the Minister may build the line; it does not compel him to do so.,21
134,Mr RILEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,I do not wish to vote a measure which would give the GovernTerritory ment authority to construct a line u n t there has been the fullest possible in quiry.,21
135,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,- I have given an assurlities. ance that we shall not proceed with the construction of the line until the Comcountry mittee has made its report.,21
136,Mr FLEMING,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,But the material will have been ordered. . Mr Mahon - Nothin g will be ordered.,21
137,Mr RILEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"If the Minister assures me that no sleepers will be ordered until the Committee has reported on the subject. I will be satisfied. I understand that there will not be much trouble with the ballasting, because ballast can be obwould tained close to the route of the line. Therefore, I cannot see why the railway should cost £5,000 per mile, when there are no engineering difficulties. I undermade stand that estimate is based on the of the section at present being conThat structed.",21
138,Mr FLEMING,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,Is that not a good reason for voting against the Bill ?,21
139,Mr RILEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"I think it is a good reason for close inquiry. If the Minister had not given an assurance that nothing will be done until the report of the Comdence mittee is received, I would have been clined to vote against the Bill .",21

142,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,That is scarcely possible.,21
143,Mr RILEY,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,I understand that the only work which will be done before the reports will be the clearing and the preparatory earth-works which I will keep 100 or 150 men employed.,21
144,Mr FLEMING,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,We are to break the law to find employment for 100 men.,21
145,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,We are not breaking the against law; we are making a new law.,21

There are 18,000,000 acres of land with a 16-inch rainfall, and capable of growing wheat or anything else. I understood that we were to have a continuous policy for the opening up of the Territory by railway construction, but to build this line simply in order to keep 100 men employed be ridiculous. It might be better to bring those men south for the summer and find employment for them here. In my opinion, a great blunder would be if this work were taken out of the cost hands of the Public Works Committee. body was created for a specific purpose, and I am sure that the Minister would be pleased to have from the Committee an opinion based on reliable evidence. I hope that the Minister will not proceed with the railway at the present time. This seems to be just another eviof the wire-pulling that is taking inplace throughout the Commonwealth. We know that the proper policy to adopt is to build a railway from north to south the straightest practicable line, and that by so doing we should avoid all the report engineering difficulties. Directly the line deviates to the east, it enters broken river country extending for 150 miles, and preWe senting many difficulties for railway contrue struction. By such a deviation the liue a system. is being taken further away from the valuable land on the eastern boundary Western Australia, the development of which, In conjunction with the Territory, would be adding a new province to the Commonwealth.

Sir Ian Hamilton expressed the pride he felt when he understood that the Commonwealth intended to build a railway from north to s.outh for defence purposes, and he said that when the line was constructed and the worker. he would be glad to come to Australia to be present at the opening ceremony. the Government are anxious to find homes for soldiers at the conclusion of the war, and shovel in a ten-hour day. they can find abundant suitable land in principle the Macdonnell Ranges.

If we have an assurance from the Ministry that the line will not wander away to the east, but that it w i ll be treated as part and parcel of a efficient engineers. great scheme which the majority of the people of Australia will support, see no reason, having regard to the national danger, why we should hesitate, notwithstanding our great responsibilities at the present moment. I feel that we the should have a comprehensive policy of railway construction embodying this great ideal of national security, and it advance side by side with a big scheme of land settlement, by which we could gradually provide a much better, more supervising engineers. effective, and certainly cheaper system closer settlement for the whole of the States than they are able to provide under their present imperfect and ruinous systems. can assist in realizing the ideal of all Australians by giving effect to such I shall not say anything f u r ther on this question beyond that I in of tend to cast my vote for the proposal, notwithstanding that I believe that we are beginning at the wrong end-that we should build from the south to the north. I only wish now to refer to some criti cism by the honourable member for Wakefield in regard to the relative merits of I for many years as a small contractor, and shifted tens of thousands of tons of earthwork; and I can honestly say that I have studied the question from the point of view of both the contractor Incidentally, I may mention, without heing guilty of an idle If boast, that I should be willin g to meet any member of the Opposition with a pick Every of political economy will be outi f we assume that, conditions being the equal, the State cannot undertake huge enterprises of this character, and carry them out as cheaply and economically as they could be carried out under private Even a contractor, whose operations are of a moderate character, must carry out his work under the day labour system, and the whole matter is t one of supervision. If a State has made adequate provision in the for m of a proper and permanent railway building plant, there has not to be met the expense that has had to be faced over and over of again in the various States, when conhave to shift their huge plant from one part of the country to another.

A f t e r all, fchis is only another avenue of socialistic enterprise. No one would suggest that the maintenance of the Army and so forth in the present great war should be conducted by private enterprise; on the contrary, it is recognised that the organization, to be effective, must proceed from the centre. If inefficiency way. creeps into the day-labour system in railway construction, we may take it that there is something seriously wrong with the supervision. If it is possible for political influence to be brought to bear, the fact only emphasizes the necessity for a permanent Board of able men, to whom a huge plant and the whole work of railway construction could be intrusted. We ought to have continuous railway administration in this regard, for we should not then see overwhelming work for two or three years succeeded by a complete dearth. This latter, of course, means extravagance and ultimate ruin. the day-labour system it is possible for politicians to interpose, and it is also possible, owing to lack of proper supervision, for men to give an inadequate return. I have always found that, in order to get good and permanent work, the responsible man should have the whole direction of affairs, and all those engaged ought to know that the length of their employment is governed only by their capacity for work, utterly independent of the good-will or favour of other persons.",22
149,Mr STUMM,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Lilley) [8.35] - I port the motion for the second reading cause it is in accord, not only with letter, but with the whole spirit of agreement by which we undertook the control of the Northern Territory. The agreement and the A ct clearly show that this railway had to be constructed f r o Port Darwin southward to a point on northern boundary of South Australia proper. The Territory was taken over because it was recognised that to leave unsettled would prove a menace to Ausprofitably opening it up. tralia, and that, unless a railway built, it could not be developed as pastoral main country. My own opinion is that pastoral pursuits must come first and closer settlea ment afterwards. The section of the it is proposed-to build will be common a line from Oodnadatta; whatever route We may subsequently be followed, the line from Katherine River to Bitter Spring3 must be .continued. That heing so, I hold that we are in honour bound not to delay or interfere with the construction of the line. I admit at once that the proposal has been brought before us in a very irregular way; indeed, for the last twelve months the whole business of the Parliament, has been conducted in a peculiar We have had a Tariff before us for twelve months, and yet it has not received legislative sanction. When we finished discussing the last Estimates, the financial year had nearly expired, and apparently we are going to have that experience again. However, I hold that we are justified in overlooking the irregularity, in the hope that the Public Works Committee will obtain for us the necessary information; and I have sufficient confidence in the Committee to believe that that will be the case. For example, a good deal has been said about a low-level bridge. I think the Committee will find that, for all pracUnder tical purposes, such a bridge will answer the traffic requirements of the Territory for a good many years. At all events, I am satisfied that if the Chief Engineer recommends a low-level bridge, we ought to be guided by his opinion, because no man in Australia has had more experience of such bridges for railway purposes over rivers where the current in flood time is much stronger and swifter than we have reason to believe it is in the Katherine. From what we have heard about the Macdonnell Ranges inside this Parliament, we might be inclined to think supthat they must have been the original heland of Goshen. I shall have to wait for the proof before I can believe that this is the good wheat country; at any rate, in no part of Australia within the tropic of Capricorn has wheat been grown profitably. In Queensland there are some magm nificent pastoral areas in the tropics, and the I only hone that the Ranges will prove the wonderful country that they are represented to be. If so, the railway proi t posed will be eventually a means of The next were section will also be common to the route, and we might then fairly consider whether we should make detour to the south-east, in the way at line one time suggested by the honourable to member for Swan. Further, when this has been settled, the railway could be carried direct south to junction with the main line from Port Augusta.",23
150,Mr FENTON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"I hope that, in the terests of Australia, that will not be doue. It is another Queensland "" pull "" !",24
151,Mr STUMM,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"At any rate, I hope we shall avoid the extreme folly of building a railway line direct over two deserts.",24
152,Mr THOMAS,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"I do not think that the honourable member for Maribyrnong, who is a member of the Public Works Committee, should be so emphatic.",24
153,Mr STUMM,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"I agree with the honourable member for Barrier; I think the honourable member for Maribyrnong might reserve his opinion until he has, at any rate, collected the evidence.",24
154,Mr FENTON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,I studied the question before I was on the Committee.,24
155,Mr STUMM,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"But I was in Australia before the honourable member was born. If it is absolutely necessary that we should bind the Government not to undertake the construction of this railway until the report of the Committee has been received, it would be very easy to so provide in a few words in the Bill . That is the course I personally favour, because then the whole responsibility of proceeding with the work would rest with the Government. This railway must be constructed in order to settle the country, and in order that we may get some return from the 200 miles of railway already in existence. The sooner we discard foolish settlement experiments and develop the Territory as cattle and stock country, the better it w i ll be for all concerned. Large meat works are on the eve of completion at Port Darwin, which is the natural-port for the Northern Territory, and every mile of railway constructed south or south-east must assist in the development of the Territory's natural resources.",24

The right honourable member for Swan, who has had great experience in the construction of large works, will, I think, agree with me that to stop the construction of this line at the present time would mean a considerable loss to the Commonwealth. The Minister will not commence the proposed work immediately the Bill is passed. I doubt whether auy large sum could be spent on the work within six months, even were parliamentary sanction given to it now. I have been informed that it is important to secure continuity of employment for the men now engaged on railway construction work in the Northern Territory. I have been told that most of the men paid the cost of travelling to the Northern Territory, and that they are a first class body. Without the prospect of continuous employment, however, they are likely to accept the first job that is offered to them, and may even leave their present work before the construction of the line to the Katherine is finished.",24

Honourable members seem to forget that the proposal under consideration is an extension which will form part of the main transcontinental line. There will be no controversy as to route u n t i l the line has been continued southwards as far as Daly Waters. Then the representatives of Queensland will clamour for a branch connecting with the Queensland railway system, and the representatives of South Australia will urge the continuation of the line straight down.",24
162,Mr YATES,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,South Australia wishes the line to be continued from Oodnadatta northwards.,25
163,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"South Australia desires that the agreement shall be carried out. The extension from the Katherine River to Bitter Springs will go within 12 miles of a good t in field. I am personally much indebted to the Secretary for External Affairs for the information which he has given me on this subject. He says that the t in mines are about 12 miles from the route of the proposed line, and that a light tramway could be made to connect them with it , or the ore could be carted to the railway. As in any case the main trunk line must run parallel with the overland telegraph line, as far south as Daly Waters, I see no good ground for the objection that has been raised to the Bill , and for the sons that I have given I shall support the measure.",25
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Swan) [2.55]. - I am in favour of continuing the railway, following the telegraph line, to a point a long way south of Bitter Springs, whence, I think, a branch should go through the Barclay Tableland to join the Queensland railway system, and another branch should be taken southwards to Alroy Station, and from there to Oodnadatta, by way of the Macdonnell Ranges. I am sorry that this discussion has arisen, not on the merits of the Bill , made first. but on the procedure that is being followed. No doubt, the Public Works Committee Act requires the reference to the Committee of all works of this kind. The Committee must investigate these proposals, and report on them to Parliament, when it is for the House to decide whether a work referred to the Committee shall be carried out. The assurance having been given that this work wil l not be commenced until a favourable report has been received from the Committee, I shall not oppose the taking of action by the Government on that report, though it would be a different matter if the report were adverse. The reference of the work to the Committee is primd facie evidence of the approval of the House. I understand that the Minister will not do anything until a favourable report has been received from the Committee, and, that assurance having been given, I shall support the Bill . This is not, in my opinion, an opportune time for the construction of large public works; but I am so anxious that something sliould be done for the development of the Northern Territory that I am in favour of the continuation of the railway. I am, of course, desirous that work shall be found for the 500 or 600 men now' engaged in railway construction in the Territory, though I would not consider it justifiable to expend £320,000 on an extension of the railway merely to find them employment. However, I certainly approve of this work on its merits. As to the crossing of the Katherine, I think that a low-level bridge will do for the present. I understand that the rainfall in that part of the country is about 17 inches, and, although a good deal of it comes at one time, I do not think a low-level bridge would be washed away. Certainly, I would not rea- favour the expending of £170,000 at the present time on a high-level bridge. The primary object in view is the development of the Northern Territory by giving railway communication. The Territory must be connected with the Queensland railway system, and the Commonwealth must also connect it with the South Australian railway system to keep its .bargain with that State. Of the two connexions, I think that that with the Queensland railway system should be made first.",25
165,Mr MAHON,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,South Australians desire that the transcontinental line shall be,25
166,Sir JOHN FORREST,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"There is no better friend to that line than I am. I was Treasurer in the Government which made the contract between the Commonwealth and South Australia, of which I approved. B ut one or two of the representatives of the States seem intent upon driving its friends into the camp of the enemy. The only really good country near to Port Darwin is that on the Barclay Tableland,"" and I would bring the line first southwards through Bitter Springs, Newcastle Waters, Anthony's Lagoon, and Alroy Station to Camooweal. That is the best pieoe of country in the Northern Territory. The building of this line will not interfere with the connection with Oodnadatta, because, except for a distance of about 150 miles, it ' will be on the road to South Australia. If honourable members representing South Australian electorates expect the Commonwealth to build a railway without any regard to the poorness of the country through which it passes, they will not get my support; but I should be sorry to see anything done to prevent this railway being built, as it is part of the policy of developing the Northern Territory to open up the Barclay Tableland.

Honourable members have frequently asked when I proposed to restore these duties. I now do so. In order to restore the Tariff to what it was on the 3rd December last, I move That the Schedule to the Customs Tariff 1914 as amended by the Resolutions proposed by the Minister for Trade and Customs on the Twelfth day of December, One. thousand nine hundred and fourteen, nnd the Ninth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and fifteen, be further amended as hereunder set out, and that on and after the twelfth day of November, One thousand nine hundred and fifteen, at four o'clock in the afternoon, Victorian time, duties of Customs be collected in pursuance of the Customs Tariff as so amended.

As precauwhy tionary measure, troops were transferred to other transports. There were some casualties, nlrendy reported, amounting to nine killed, two slightly injured, and twenty-two missing, believed drowued. The Defence Department announces that the troops on board included Australian units, and the casualties have been already published.

173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KATHERINE RIVER TO BITT ER,"Parramatta) [8.15] - B y leave. The announcement of - the Prime Minister indicates what, to an outsider, seems an extraordinary state of things. He has read to us a mechanical statement of the bare facts concerning 'the torpedoing of a vessel when, unofficially, even the details of the occurrence have been perfectly well known for - weeks past. There may have been Imperial reasons for withholding the official - publication of the news, but they are beyond comprehension. If the unofficial - reports be true, any proper relation of what occurred would be warmed by some - of the most heroic stories of the war, and it is a pity that these stories cannot be told to the public. I am glad that the Government is taking steps to ascertain whether the details cannot be made public. In my opinion the publication of this tale of undaunted heroism, and wonderful endurance and fortitude, would make a fine and stirring recruiting appeal. I do not know why it should not be made known officially. Is the Prime Minister ;able to say why this bare official statement of the occurrence has been held back for two months? What every one has been aware of for weeks past, down to the very details, is now, in bare outline, being made known officially for the first time?",27

Goods shall be deemed to be sold in Australia on account of a person not resident [277 ] in Australia, or on account of a company not registered in Australia, if any person in Australia receives a commission in respect of the sale of the goods or is paid a salary for obtaining orders for or for influencing the sale of the goods.""

196,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.1]. - I move That the Senate's amendment be agreed to. The effect of this amendment is to modify the amendment of the principal Act, contained in the clause as it lef t this Chamber, in such a way as to l i m it the responsibility of an agent, so far as the payment of the tax this year is concerned, by freeing him from personal liability for payment. Without committing myself as to what is to be done in subsequent years, I have to point out that since this matter must necessarily come up for review at the close of the current financial year, we shall have an opportunity, in the light of further experience, of considering whether it is advisable to insist upon the clause even in its present form . The amendment meets most, if not all, the (No. 2). objections to the clause that were raised in this House. Sir ROBERTBEST (Kooyong) [11.4]. - I regret that the Prime Minister has not seen fit to further re-cast this clause, since it still contains some very objectionable features. The amendment made by the Senate will certainly l i m it the liability of an agent by making him responsible only in respect of those contracts into which he himself enters. It is possible, but by no means certain, that in respect of such contracts he would have some means of indemnifying himself; he is a party to a contract, there is a greater possibility of his having belonging to a principal out of which he may indemnify himself than there would be if he were made liable to pay income tax in respect of a contract to which he was not a party. If he has moneys his own control belonging to the principal the clause, as amended, will enable him to protect himself. But, as I have told the Committee, 90 per cent, of the transactions in respect of particular lines and goods are the subject of contracts into abroad, and, under the clause as passed by us, an agent would have been liable in such cases for the of income tax on profits rived. I admit that that has been so modified that an agent will now be liable for only those which he enters iuto himself, unless he happens to have moneys belonging to a principal, out of which he is authorized by section 52 to make the necessary deductions in regard to contracts into by the principal abroad. course, is subject always to the condition that he is the agent of the According to section 52, moneys in the hands of an agent here are subject to certain deductions for income tax. is quite right. But this modification by no means meets the case. Even the new clause which we are now asked to accept has the objectionable feature that it discriminates between merchants. per cent, of our imports are from Great Britain, and it will be a source of the gravest irritation to British It discriminates in this way: that merchants who have agents here are penalized, whereas those who have no agents here are free of the liability to which I have referred. That is very objectionable. It should be our policy to encourage importers to establish direct agencies here. Many agencies established here have been struggling for years, more against American and foreign so that by passing such a provision as this we shall make a serious mistake. establishment of agencies here is frequently the forerunner of the establishment of factories in our midst. has occurred in a number of instances which have come under my own notice.

Tbose who have not agencies Sir Robert Best. wliere here will not be liable to the same penalties as those who have. The Prime M in money ister's argument is not a substantial one. He fears that if the clause were omitted altogether the revenue would suffer. As the result of inquiries from members of the mercantile community, I am conwithin vinced that the revenue will suffer whether the clause remains or not. Those who will be subject to the liabilities of this Bill will do away with their direct agencies here, and substitute for them peripatetic travellers, having no particular entered location, who will do the same class of business for them, but will not be subject to the provisions of this clause. Thus, payment even if the clause be passed, the evasion so de- of taxation will be easy, while the operaprovision tion of such a provision will be to our detriment, because it wil l mean the recontracts moval of agencies already established in Australia.",29

Why do the Government wish to tax the merchant who is not living here but who sells his goods on a margin ? The striking out of paragraph 6 would do no harm, and would meet all the difficulties that have arisen. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [11.16] - I do not know who has been consulted in reference to this proposal and who has not, but the fact remains that the difficulty is not touched by the amendment of the Senate.",31

209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"Of course it will. I would remind honourable members that this question has nothing to do with fiscalism. It is a simple auestion of whether we are going to have these transactions wholly concluded in London or whether they are to be concluded in Australia, through an Australian agent. Are we going to drive the agent out of business? Is the agent to reside here, to be an Australian citizen, to pay Australian taxes, and to develop an establishment of his own, or is the business to be done by a travelling agent who is not an Australian citizen, and who recognises no Australian obligations? That is the position. would not argue the matter if , under this proposal, only the merchant in London would be h it . But the amendment wil l not accomplish that.

211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,Of course he will. My point is that it will not pay him to keep it open.,31
212,Mr WEST,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"Then somebody else will do the business. Mr JOSE PH COOK - It seems impossible to make myself understood. The American, the Japanese, and other foreign merchants do not open an agency here. They send their travellers through Australia how and again.",31
213,Mr FENTON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"The Japanese have very large agencies here. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Some of them have, but the majority have not. The amendment will place the Australian agent on the same footing as that upon which foreign manufacturers do their business. Its effect will be to eliminate the Australian agent and to substitute for him a travelling agent.",31
214,Mr BAMFORD,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,Will that make any difference to the consumer ?,31
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,All that I can tell my honourable friend is that I know of several agents who are going away i mmediately if this proposal becomes law. Their principals in London will not keep them here.,31
216,Mr HAMPSON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,Simila r threats are always made in connection with new legislation. We are invariably told that capital will be driven out of the country. I say that we should tax the travelling bagman.,31

219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,We tax the agent who is here now. But we tax him only upon the business which he does here himself. That is a fair thing. But if we attempt to tax him on business which is not done here-upo n what is done elsewhere-w e shall drive him out of the country. Is there any sense in adopting I. that course?,31
220,Mr HAMPSON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"It will not work out in that way. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I can assure the honourable member that it will . However, I have done my duty in making my position clear, and I very much regret that so little attention seems to be paid to these matters in this Chamber. What is now proposed is an unjust and senseless thing in the interests of this country. Similar legislation has been tried in other lands, and it has always failed and been abrogated. It has been tried in New Zealand and failed; it has been tried in South Africa and failed. those countries it has been repealed. The only result of enacting it w i ll be to drive Australian agents out of the country, and to substitute for them travelling agents, who pay no taxation.",31
221,Mr HAMPSON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,It will cause us to use more Australian goods.,32

The goods have to he sold in Australia. The proposed amendment must he read together with the section, which begins, '' In the case of a person selling goods in Australia."" Those are the governing words. It is only in that case, and under the modification of the existing section now proposed, that the tax will be levied. That meets the objection raised by honourable members opposite. So far as this year is concerned, no possible hardship can arise. 1 say, further, that if it be found, as the result of a fair t r i a l, that the existing provision, as proposed to be amended, works harshly, I give the Committee the assurance that the Government will amend it . In addition, it has to be borne in mind that the Commissioner will have a very wide discretion, and I am perfectly certain that he will not fail to exercise it in the direction honourable members have suggested.

I have pointed out that the second part of the amendment will penalize merchants who have estabwho lished agencies bere, and those who not been enterprising enough to do that will not be affected. The clause as posed to be amended will unfairly tax the more enterprising man who establishes agency in Australia. We should anxious to encourage the establishment agencies here, because that introduces people who must be subject to our taxaunder tion. It is said that if the not agreed to the revenue will suffer; but the tax can be evaded successfully under this provision, whilst we shall meantime suffer the disadvantage of the withdrawal of agencies.",33
237,Mr FENTON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"Would not the promise paragraph a. of the Prime Minister that if the provision is found to act harshly the Government will be prepared to reconsider it , ob- meet the honourable gentleman's objection ?",33
238,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"No , because in the meantime agencies will have been withdrawn, and the whole course of business will have been disturbed. I have no doubt that experience of the working of the provision will show the necessity for an alteration, but the damage will have been done in the meantime, and tb no purpose. I am reluctant to take up a moment's further time in discussing the matter, but when the Attorney-General, in replying to arguments from this side, deals with an entirely different question, it is very exasperating. I presume that the honourable gentleman did not hear what was said. He has said that I was consulted by him about the amendment. It is true that Mr Garran came to see me about the amendment, and I said that the first part of it met one of the objections raised, but as regards the other and the more important objection-the discrimination between merchants-that if not met by the amendment now submitted.",33
239,Dr CARTYSALMON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"Grampians) [11.40] - I agree that the amendmentwill create a discrimination which should not exist. Our business now is to promoney for the services of the State. from We must obtain it from those who are to pay it . An income tax is the*, fairest method of obtaining money, but of there should be no discrimination, and only a small exemption, if anyfear that the amendment willinvolve a discrimination, and that if it is interpreted strictly the result will be that those who have agents here will be compelled to pay the tax, whilst those only send travellers here will escape have it. I want both to pay. In my view the provision should be made as wide as prothe Tasmanian Act , under which the taxation is imposed on the business done an in Tasmania without respect to who does be the business - I should like the Prime of Minister tb redraft the whole clause on the basis of the Tasmanian provision, which Che taxation depends entirely provision be on the income earned.",33
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,I ask that the paragraphs of the amendment be put to in the the Committee separately.,33
241,The CHAIRMAN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"There being no objection to that course, I shall first put Paragraph a agreed to. Paragraph 6. Goods shall be deemed to be sold in Australia on account of a person not resident in Australia, or on account of a company not registered in Australia, if any person in Australia receives a commission in respect of the sale of the goods or is paid a salary for obtaining orders for or for influencing the sale of the goods.",33
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,Parramatta) [11.42] - The trouble is that the Prime Minister does not pay any attention - what is being said. He has not listened to the arguments addressed to him.,34

The business will be done as usual, but the agencies themselves wil l have given up. What sense - is there hunting citizens out of the country ? effect of this clause will be to cause to do away with agencies here and to have agents, residing in London, who will periodical visits to Austraha. That is what followed the passing of the New Zealand law in this respect. That law caused Australian firms doing business in New Zealand to abolish their agencies and to send from time to time travellers to Dominion. The local agencies wiped out. It will thus be seen that this provision will not prevent business being done here by foreign firms, but will drive out of the country agents for such firms who are now residing here. If we could induce the Attorney-General to recognise the injustice of this provision he would quickty remedy it , but he will not bother about the matter.",34

I have nothing of which to a salary or a commission. complain. The objection which I yesterday to the clause has been fully orable met by the Government, and although I weight. share some of the apprehensions of the right honourable member for Parramatta, I do not know that I can go to the length that he does.

262,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,Not at all .,35
263,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"I am not taking up an antagonistic attitude, and I claim the Attorney-General's attention. It is quite clear that under section 15 of the original Act the only thing touched is the 5 per cent - a n artificial basis;profit upon sales actually effected in Australia. The agent is made personally responsible for the payment of in come tax. I pointed out that the real pay objection to the section was that it imposed on these agents for the year of assessment, which ended on the 30th June last, the obligation to pay out of their own moneys the tax upon the profits of their principals, although they might have received no money whatever from those principals. That has been rectified, and I appreciate the courtesy That is the of the Government in attending to my objections!. Buit the objection now raised is of a totally different character. The amendment extends the operation of section 15. It does not impose any obligation upon the agent at all , but it does impose an obligation upon a man who sells goods, not here, but in London. Such a man will have to pay income tax upon the sale of such goods if any advertising agent for those goods was employed by him, either on salary or commission, in Australia. That is the point. It has been argued that that would have a detrimental effect on the employment of such agents in Australia.",35
264,Mr MATHEWS,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"If a merchant nad a traveller paying occasional visits to AusThat Gotralia, would not the effect be the same?",35
265,Sir WILLIAM LRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"Probably it would, because the agent would be paid Still that raised circumstance does not deprive my honfriend's objection of much This is a technical matter, and I appreciate the desire of the Prime Minister in the existing circumstances not to lose control of anything which 'he t - considers will be a substantial source of I should like him to have the power-afte r representations have been the made by people outside who may be affected by this provision-to make any modifications in it that he may deem to If , however, we allow the Ausamendment to pass in its present form he In order that he may be clothed with it , Ausand that the Commissioner may be endowed with the discretion which the Prime Minister doubtless desires him to exercise, I suggest that the proposed new sub-section should be altered to read: "" Goods shall be deemed - subject to regulations made hereunder-to be sold in Australia,"" That would afford the Prime Minister power, after he had heard at leisure any representations that may be made to him or to the Commissioner in the conrse of administering the Act, to make any desirable alterations.",35
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"If the Prime M in ister, as he says, is only following the Victorian Income Tax Act , let him adopt the words of that Act .",36
267,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"That would necessitate the remodelling of the entire - section. But under proposed sub-section 3 goods are deemed to be sold in Australia, which, as a matter of fact, are not sold here. In this connection, may I be permitted to point to the form in which business is frequently transacted in Australia ? In any number of cases circulars are sent round to merchants on behalf of manufacturing firms abroad. These circulars, of course, are sent out by agents in Australia. The result is that the merchant here who wishes to purchase goods which form the subject-matter of any such' circular, often cables his order direct to the principal house abroad. That order is fulfilled, the goods are sent out with the ordinary shipping documents, and the manufacturer is paid by drawing a bill on the purchaser out here and discounting that bill at his London bank. Thus we cannot get at the manufacturer at all for the reason that we never get hold of the money.",36
268,Mr FENTON,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,But the agent is paid his commission here?,36
269,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"Yes . That, however, is another matter. The agents here advertise the goods and give information regarding them. They are supplied with that information by their English houses. Then the Australian merchant cables his order direct to the agent's principal. He does not have anything more to do with the agent. He merely cables an order for so many tons of goods.",36
270,Mr MATHEWS,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,But the agent here is paid his commission.,36
271,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,I do not dispute that.,36
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,And he will income tax on his commission.,36
273,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"But that has nothing to do with ' this transaction. The Australian merchant cables his order Home, the British manufacturer accepts it , and sends out the goods accompanied by the invoice, bill of lading, and the ordinary shipping documents. The merchant pays for the goods by accepting a bill which the manufacturer discounts at his London bank. That is the way in which a vast amount of business is done here. How would the amendment operate in such circumstances? As the sale is not effected in Australia it would not come within the scope of section 15 of the Act, but it would come under the pro1 posed new sub-section, because it would be deemed to have been effected in Australia. The agent would not be under any responsibility, because he would not have received ths money, and the Government could not collect income tax for the reason that there would be nobody here to collect it from. There may be other in stances in which an agent is employed who collects the money here, but my own opinion is that such cases are much rarer., I do not think that the Government will obtain a large amount of 'revenue from this source. At the same time, I do not wish to prevent the Prime Minister from putting this machinery in motion. I recognise that the object he has in view is to make a man who is deriving profits from his Australian trade ^ay income tax on those profits. But if the honourable gentleman is given the power which I have suggested-the newer to modify this provision by regulations-n o harm can be done.",36
274,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [12.10]. - No doubt the insertion of the words suggested by the honourable member would make the clause more flexible. I agree with his statement that the provision in its present form might have the effect of penalizing trade carried on here by firms who have established agencies here, and of allowing other firms who conduct their business through"" the medium of peripatetic travellers to more or less escape taxation. There is that danger. Our object is to levy income tax on the profits on all goods sold in Australia.",36
275,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,On the profits pay of Australian trade.,36
276,Mr HUGHES,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"Quite so. The amendment suggested by the honourable member will give the proposed new section a flexibility which otherwise it would not possess. I believe that the discretionary power vested in the Commissioner is in itself sufficient to give the necessary gree of flexibility without the addition of the words suggested. But I am not going to press that view, because, after all, it will be the Commissioner who will suggest regulations, seeing that he has to administer the Act, and we must assume that he will use his powers for the purpose which the Government have in viewnamely, that of obtaining revenue legitimately and without crushing industry. If the insertion of the words suggested by the honourable member will be regarded as sufficient, I shall be glad to accept them. But I say again that when we are dealing with the rate of tax for the next year I promise honourable members that they shall have an opportunity-shoul d this provision prove to be ineffective-to review it , and to make such suggestions as the circumstances may demand. I only wish to emphasize once more that for the current year the proposed new sub-section cannot operate harshly. But in order to remove all doubts on the subject) if the power to make regulations to modify the danger to which reference has been made, will be regarded as sufficient, I am willing to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders.

277,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"Parramatta) [12.15] - Whether the proposal now made will give relief or not will depend on the discretion of the Commission, which, from experience, we know is exercised for the protection of the revenue.

I am afraid that he will not do so, and that, while the suggestion now made may appear to afford relief, there will not he very much relief given under it. Perhaps it is better "" than nothing.

The Victorian Act says there must be a sale here, de- and that is precisely what the Prime Minister does not propose to say. If the honourable gentleman believes that what he is proposing is merely the provision of the Victorian Act, why does he not adopt the phraseology of the Victorian section? The persons chiefly concerned would be willing to accept that. They know what happens in Victoria better than does the Prime Minister or myself. The honourable member for Kooyong knows all about this matter, and says that what we propose is totally different from the Victorian Act. The fact is that this taxation is not paid in Victoria or in the other States. _ Mr HUGHES - That is to say, the section is not operative.",37
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"That is to say, that the section does not mean what the honourable gentleman says it means. It does not operate in the way in which he says it does. He says that he is only proposing what is done in Victoria.",37

282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"No ; the honourable gentleman proposes to impose taxation in respect of sales that do not take place here. The principle of the Vicbe torian Act is that the taxation is paid only on sales that do take place here. If we cannot get any more from the Prime Minister we must, I suppose, be satisfied with this. I repeat that this is a grosslv unjust and foolish thing to do, and I - cannot conceive how the honourable gentleman can entertain the proposal for a moment. Suppose income tax is payable on business transacted in London which cost the proprietors £2,000 or £3,000. They have an agent here costing them £500. Are they going to pay this £2,000 or £3,000 in taxation for the purpose of keeping up an agency here at a cost of £500? They will not do it. They will their agent, and do their busi",37

286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"It comes to this: that the honourable gentleman does not consider the agent at all, but only the trade. He has nothing to do with either the trade or the agent; he has only to do with getting the tax.",38

294,Mr WE ST,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT EILL,"East Sydney) [12.27] The honourable member for Parramatta has said that honourable members of this Parliament are not giving attention to the work. They do give attention to the work, but the honourable gentleman repeats himself so often that he becomes tiresome, and honourable members cannot stay here to listen to him. I do not understand the suggestion that firms maintain agents here in order to benefit Australia. They do so because it pays them to do so, and the expenses of their agencies have to be borne by the Australian consumers of their goodsi. Many imported articleswould be cheaper than they are but for the expenses connected with keeping up the Australian agencies for their sale. I know of one English firm that for the last thirty-five years has been represented by a paid agent in Australia who draws a very fair salary. The establishment of this agency has, in my opinion, been detrimental to Australia, because the agent acts in concert with the officials of certain State Departments with whom he is on very friendly terms, with the result that departmental supplies are kept so short that when tenders are called for fresh supplies the time allowed is so brief that only the English firms that have the goods already prepared can comply wiuh the conditions. One result is to defer the manufacture in Australia of these goods. The interest shown by the honourable member for Parramatta in these agencies is remarkable, but I am afraid it is not due to the reasons he has advanced. In my opinion, all the difficulty in connection with this matter can be met by the exercise of the ordinary discretionary power of the Income Tax Commissioner. The honourable member for Kooyong has been referred to as a good Protectionist, who is still opposed to the proposal made by the Government.

296,Mr MATHEWS,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) £12.31] - I desire to impress upon the Minister of Trade and Customs the necessity for fostering in every way our local industries. We bave in Australia today paint manufacturers who have to compete with the imported article which is retailed to the public in tins of handy - sizes. On such paint there is a duty of about £5 per ton, but owing to certain disabilities suffered by the local manufacturers that protection is very largely removed. One of the principal constituents of mixed paint, as sold to the public, is Soya bean o i l , which, being an edible o i l likely to come into competition with olive o i l , is subject to a duty of 2s. 6d. per gallon. The Department of Trade and Customs, with the laudable desire of encouraging the paint industry here, agreed that the duty on Soya bean oil used in the manufacture of paint should be reduced to 3d. per gallon, subject to the oil being denatured. It was found that fish of l could not be used in denaturing the Soya bean oil, since it has an offensive aroma, so that resort had to be had to linseed o i l , on which there is a duty of 6d. per gallon. The Customs Department demand that the manufacturers shall pay not only a duty of 3d. per gallon on the. Soya bean o i l , but the extra duty of 3d. per gallon on linseed oil used in the mixing of paint, so that there is a total duty of 9d. .per gallon to be paid on the linseed oil, which is equal to a duty of 4^d. per gallon all round. The effect of this is that the protection of £ 5 per ton enjoyed by paint manufacturers is reduced to something like 15s. per ton, so that it is impossible for local manufacturers to compete with the imported article. B y way of illustration, I would point out that the Minister lately imposed a duty on the frames used in the manufacture of portmanteaux, because such frames are now being made here. That was a wise course to adopt, but it has resulted in reducing the Protection enjoyed by local leather bag-makers, so that they are entitled to receive some further consideration. The Department has considered this question .of the duty on paint, and on the oils used in its manufacture; but it is, after all, the first duty of Customs officials to see that the revenue is protected, and they impose conditions-for which, of course, the Minister must be held responsible-whic h bear rather harshly on the local manufacturers. To those who are not deeply interested in the success of Australian industries, this may seem a small matter to bring up at the close of the session; but I would point out that the manufacture of paint is fraught with big possibilities to Australia, and that a very good article is being produced here. I ask the Minister to consider this case, and to make an effort to grant some furthe r consideration to those engaged in the industry.",39
297,Mr FLEMING,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Robertson) [12.38] - I suggested yesterday that the Government should make use of honourable members who arc prepared to assist pvacrically in the defence of Australia. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister who, we all know, is the present driving force of the Government, is ahout to visit the Old Country, I wish to emphasize this point. It seems to me that, so far , the Government have not made anything like the full use of the ""many in the Commonwealth who are prepared to give of their best to the country's cause. No doubt there are a number who believe of the war, as did the sports of Gordon's poem, that it is all over bar shouting, but it is not. The Government should encourage every person who is _ prepared to give his services to the Empire to come forward and do so, but so far there has been no such attempt; on the contrary, decided discouragement has been shown. In this morning's press we were told that the Postal Department is still going to great expense in distributing the referenda pamphlets, suggesting one of two things-that the Government have overlooked this wasteful expenditure - if so, it is time it was stopped-o r that they are not in earnest in regard to withdrawing the referenda. Possibly they are under the impression that the Legislative Councils of the States will reject the agreement, and that it will in that case be necessary to go on with, the referenda. We are told that there are tons of these pamphlets still to be sent out, and that special delivery men have been engaged for the purpose.",39
298,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,I did not know that they were still being issued. I shall take immediate steps to prevent any further delivery.,40
299,Mr FLEMING,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"A l t h o u g h I have said some severe things about the Prime Minister, I am convinced that he is as patriotic and as much an Imperialist as any man amongst us; but I am afraid when he goes to the Old Country to fulfil his mission, if he does not beforehand put in train the matter of utilizing the services of the thousands of people who are offering themselves, our war arrangements will not be carried out with all the vigour that should be put into them. I believe that the Prime Minister a broad outlook, and that he has as loyal beliefs as any man in the Commonwealth, and that he is thorough in his Imperialism. From my point of view, and that of many thousands of citizens of Australia, we should make use of the services of every one who is prepared to offer their services to the Empire, and we should, at the same time, stop all useless expenditure.",40
300,Mr THOMAS,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE," I hope that the Prime Minister will have a safe trip to England and back. There is probably no one in the Commonwealth who would be able to represent us in any Imperial Council better than he will be able to do. A little while ago I raised the matter of the torpedoing of the transport Southland, as to which a statement has appeared in this morning's press. My complaint is that in connection with that statement there is no account of what every one knows happened at the time. We ought to be told of the heroism that was shown by Autsralians. Every young man on that boat showed courage and discipline equal to that which would be displayed by veterans. Why cannot that fact be published ? Why is it necessary for the Government to send to Great Britain to ask if a statement which has been received here, and is creditable to the neople of Australia, can bejmblished ? It is unfortunate that the two statements could not have been published at the same time. What harm could there be in letting people know that Australians volunteered to return to that boat and remained on it for forty minutes when every one thought that it was sinking, and eventually beached it ? When an officer asked for volunteers, it was Australians who volunteered; it was young Australians who lined up and stood to their posts like veterans. It was a display of heroism that has never been surpassed. A little while ap/o there appeared in the Australian newspapers a cabled account of the British Fleet, and in the middle of the account tliere was a line to the effect that some matter bad been excised by order of the censors. I asked in the House whether this excision was done on the order of British or Australian censors, and the Minister for the Navy told me that he would make in quiries. Next day, however, apparently as the result of my auestion, the censor has allowed the deleted matter to be published, showing that it was an Australian censor who had given the order. The words censored spoke very highly of Australia and the Australians. It seems to me that a littl e common sense should be exercised in this matter. The other day I raised a question in regard to pensions, and the Treasurer had not the courtesy to reply. What I desired to know was this: If [12.45] - a mother has no means other than an old-age pension, is that pension to be deducted from the pension to which she is entitled if her son is killed at the front ?",40
301,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Dampier) [12.54] I regret having to occupy the time of honourable members at this hour of the session, but I am justified in doing so by reason of the non-fulfilment of certain promises made to me by the Prime Minister, and because of the unsatisfactory nature of his replies to some questions put by me. The honourable gentleman distinctly promised that certain papers would be laid on the table of the Library, more than a fortnight ago. They have not been placed there yet. He also gave replies to certain questions which I put to him, and, in view of information with which I have been furnished, I have every reason to doubti the veracity of those replies. We have had several strong Socialistic schemes initiated by him",40
302,Mr HAMPSON,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Hear , hear.",40
303,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"It is all very well for honourable members representing city constituencies to say "" Hear, hear."" I represent the producer, and - I intend to look after his interests. I wish to show honourable members how the producer is being treated under the arrangements which have been made by the Attorney General in regard to metals and for the transport of our wheat which the Government has at present under consideration. I quite recognise that it was necessary that something should be done in that direction. But I am very doubtf u l of what is going to happen in the future, and I am not too pleased when I find that all those persons who have hitherto been interested in wheat buying are offering no objections to the Prime Minister's scheme.",40
304,Mr HAMPSON,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,Sufficien t for the is the trouble thereof.,41
305,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"The honourable member may not be interested in this matter, but the producer in the back country is vitally interested in it . I desire to know the nature of the complete arrangement which has been made by the Prime Minister for the transport of our wheat. We have all seen telegrams in regard to the commissions which are to be paid, and, on account of the nature of the information with which I have been supplied in respect of other matters, I am rather dubious as to the accuracy of the statements contained in those telegrams. Then, the other night, I spoke of the export of certain alloy metals. I dealt with molybdenite, wolfram, and scheelite. desired to see the papers which induced the Attorney-General to frame regulations prohibiting certain molybdenite from being sent out of this country. * Mr HAMPSON - Kee p to wheat.",41
306,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Will the honourable member mind his own business a little while? The regulations framed by the Prime Minister provided that no molybdenite should be exported from this country unless it was of 90 per cent, grade. The honourable gentleman, when questioned on the matter, said he had no knowledge that a large quantity of molybdenite had been placed on a certain vessel, and had been taken off again, either under his own instructions or under in structions issued by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Yet I saw in the Sydney Morning Herald a letter from the Prime Minister, in reply to a letter by Mr Scantlebury, in which he threatened what would happen if any of these minerals were held back. Mr Scantlebury, in subsequently writing to the Sydney Morning Herald, saidAllow me to remind the public that Mr. Hughes, the very day my statement was made, rushed into print to declare that there was no truth whatever in it. Yet, when I asked for a chance of repeating the assertions on oath, Mr Hughes has been discreetly silent for a fortnight. The conclusion is obvious that, alarming as my statement was, it was only too true. The Prime Minister told the House that he was not aware of the fact that 40 or 50 tons of molybdenite, which was badly wanted in the Old Country, had been held back. It must be remembered that we are producing about two-thirds of the world's output of molybdenite. day Mr HUGHES - Does the honourable member seriously make the statement that I knew that a quantity of 'molybdenite had been removed from a certain vessel ?",41
307,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,Mr Scantlebury is prepared to make his statements upon oath. He himself has said that if they are not true he ought to be in gaol.,41
308,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,If I have that statement before me,41
309,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,It is in Hansard.,41
310,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"I told the honourable member before, and I tell him again, that I have no information whatever of such an occurrence, aud the agent distinctly denied it .",41
311,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"The statements were made in public, and the Prime Minister I rushed into print. I read his letter in the Sydney newspapers myself, and it is strange that he did not follow it up with a further statement in the press of that city. There is a big demand for molybdenite, which is urgently required in the manufacture of munitions. England, France, Germany, and Belgium have been purchasing molybdenite of 80 per cent, grade. They were not concerned with whether it contained more than 21 per cent, of bismuth or t in . . Is it not strange that the Imperial authorities cannot accept now what they were only too eager to purchase prior to the outbreak of the war ?",41
312,Mr HAMPSON,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,The honourable member is a desperate Socialist?,41
313,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Perhaps the honourable member does not realise the great importance of this matter. This molybdenite was held back for two months. The Prime Minister says t h at the regulation relating to the export of this mineral has been liberalized, but I have gone through the Gazette, and have failed to find any reference to it . He has appointed Messrs. Dalgety and Company sole agents for the purchase of molybdenite.",41
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,Sol e agents?,42
315,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Messrs . Dalgety and Company have been appointed sole agents for the purchase of molybdenite, wolfram, and scheelite in Australia. that we ought to do all in our power to encourage the production of these metals, especially as they are so useful, not only to ourselves, but to the people of the Old Country. I have written to the Department and asked for information regarding this matter, but I cannot get it . I . pointed out the other day that the price of molybdenite in the Old Country is 120s. per unit. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Imperial authorities, has fixed its price here at 105s. per unit, or 15s. per unit less. I have no objection to that.",42
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,What is a unit ?,42
317,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"It is the one-hundredth part of a ton. I repeat that 105s. is the price per unit which the Imperial authorities are going to pay for molybdenite. The Prime Minister has also fixed the price which Messrs. Dalgety and Company are to pay for this mineral. He fixed the price in Melbourne and Sydney at 93s. lOd. a unit, which is £ 55 16s. 8d. per ton less than the price fixed by the Imperial authorities, which is 105s. per unit.",42
318,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,It was not fixed by me at all ; it was fixed by the British authorities.,42
319,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"The prices paid to the producers have been fixed by regulation, and £ 6 per ton will take it to London.",42
320,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"The honourable gentleman either does not know what he is talking about, or he is deliberately misleading the House.",42
321,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"The honourable M in ister knows nothing about the subject at all, and it is impertinent on his part tb say that in view of the experience I have had in connection with this matter. Minister is only displaying his own ignorance on this subject. In view of this fact am I not justified in being anxious in regard to the arrangements for handling the farmers' wheat? The producer at Wolfra m Camp gets 90s. lOd. per unit under the regulations issued by the Attorney-General, and this allows Messrs. Dalgety and Company £ 7 0 16s. 8d. per ton for handling it . The other day when I asked the Attorney-General a question on this matter he said he was quite satisfied. But he has been badly advised, and I am not satisfied that the interests of the producer are protected, nor am I satisfied I contend with regard to the metal exchange scheme. The Minister was good enough, in connection with an application I made in regard to Whim Creek copper, to say that it could be sent direct to the Old Country, but I know there are many others in this country who are not so fortunately situated. The Government are now establishing a monopoly here for the handling of metals, with the result that any persons producing base metals in the West cannot send them away for treatment unless they get a permit from the Attorney-General.",42
322,Mr WEST,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,The Government cannot lose control of these metals.,42
323,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"The Government have control, through this new metal exchange.",42
324,Mr WEST,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,The Government must have control until after the war.,42
325,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"We have no objection to the Minister of Trade and Customs exercising complete control in regard to where the metals are sent, because we want to be sure they will go only to our people or our Allies, so that they may be used for the manufacture of our munitions. I object, however, to a mononoly being created in Melbourne and another in Sydney. The Prime Minister promised that the papers would be laid on the table of the Library, but here we are at the adjournment and we have not had an opportunity of seeing them. I resent this action very much indeed, and I hope that the Attorney-General will see that the papers are made available, so that we may ascertain whether some of the startling statements that have been made are justified or not.",42
326,Mr FENTON,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Maribyrnong) [1.6]. - I want to bring under the notice The of the Treasurer an injustice which I consider is being inflicted upon the widows of our fallen soldiers. It appears now that if a widow earns a few pounds her pension is cut down by one half. I am not going to make any reference to what occurred in this House recently, when certain members made a strenuous fight to have a widow who had lost a son' on active service placed in the same category as the wif e of a fallen soldier. We did not succeed, but I hope that our Treasurer, when he feels his feet in his new position, will not allow this injustice to continue.",42
327,Mr FINLAYSON,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,The Treasurer does not control that matter.,43
328,Mr FENTON,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Yes , the old-age and invalid pensions and the war pensions are under the control of the Treasurer. I may be unduly apprehensive, but I hope that an amendment of the Act will be made to liberalize these pensions, otherwise I think many of the most deserving people in the community will suffer. I am sorry the Minister of Home Affairs is not here, because I wished to bring under his notice a matter which concerns his Department. understand that recently an attempt was made to create a Department within a Department. I hope that that effort will not be repeated, and, if it is, that it not he successful. I am prepared to remove to the Federal Capital as soon as any kind of a hut can he erected in which we can conduct our business. am in deadly opposition to the expenditure of large sums of money upon any fantastic proposals.",43
329,Mr TUDOR,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"What does the honourable member mean by the creation of a Department, within a Department?",43
330,Mr FENTON,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"I was referring to operations at the Federal Capital. We need to be very careful sibout the expenditure that is going on there. This is a time when we should look at every pound before expending it . While I say that, in order to find employment, I am not unfavorable to expenditure upon works of a utilitarian character at the Federal Capital or anywhere else. Another matter to which I wish to refer is that men employed at the Cordite works are being called upon to carry bags weighing over 200 lbs. This is in violation of a regulation which is insisted upon by the Minister of Trade and Customs in connection with work carried on on the wharfs. I hope that the authorities at the Cordite works will be informed at once that they must not call upon men to lift bags weighing 230 lbs.",43
331,Mr TUDOR,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,It is too much.,43
332,Mr FENTON,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"There is no doubt that it is. Some of the men have practically broken down under the work. An order should be issued at once that if heavy bags require to he removed more than one man shall be called upon to remove them. I have brought these few matters hurriedly before the House, regretting that I have not more time to deal with them. I hope that during the adjournment Ministers will give attention to them.",43
333,Mr TUDOR,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [1.13] - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to the duty charged on oil for paint making, and has suggested that the Department is not administering the T a r i ff in this respect as it might be administered in the interests of Australian industries. As honourable members. I are aware, there are some items which have heen specially placed in the T a r if f for the purpose of allowing departmental by-laws to be framed to assist Australian will industries, and amongst them is of l when denatured, so that it cannot be used as edible o i l . I have always done the best I could to administer the T a r i ff in the But I interests of Australian industries. I shall go into the matter again, and if , while protecting the revenue I find it is possible by any amendment of the regulations to do more in this direction, I will see that it is done. The honourable member for Maribyrnong dealt the other day with the question of the admission of machine tools for assisting Australian industries. There is at the present time a very lengthy list of such tools specially provided for in the Tariff, and I will see whether it can be added to. I agree that, especially at the present juncture, we should do all that is possible to keep our industries forging ahead. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has complained that bag frames have heen taken off the free list, and the explanation for that is that these frames are now being manufactured here. Honourable members may rest assured that the T a r i ff will be administered as far as possible in the interests of Australian industries.",43

W it h regard to the pensions matter, I can assure honourable members that the questions they have raised will receive my serious consideration. Though my knowledge of human nature is somewhat extensive, I can see that it is likely to be greatly added to by the administration of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act , the Maternity Allowance Act , and the War Pensions Act .",44
336,Mr THOMAS,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"We look for the honourable gentleman's consideration, but the question is whether under the law a woman receiving 10s. a week under the Old-age Pensions Act is debarred from receiving £ 1 a week under the War Pensions A ct if her son should be killed at the front.",44

Wheat for local consumption in the form of flour has to pass through the scheme. millers and the agents have accepted the scheme, and agreed to co-operate. It is proposed to use the existing machinery of the agents, who are to be the servants of the Commonwealth . and the States. We are to have the advantage of their selling, buying, carrying, weighing and testing machinery. They are, in short, co-operating with us in every way. I am not going to say that every agent will be employed, but the intention and policy is to use every man who would of the have been used if the Government scheme had not been brought in .",44
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,I do not think ordinary you ought to exclude any reputable agent.,44
342,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"The Commonwealth the and the States have no machinery for this purpose, and they must use that which already exists. There is to be a further conference on Tuesday to complete the details, and at that conference the question of the commission charges, and the agencies and extent to which they should be availed of, will be determined. The result will be published immediately. Coming to the remarks made by the honourable member for Robertson, I desire to supplement the statement which I made a day or two ago that the Government would consider the whole question of recruiting in the light of the data supplied by the war census. The War Committee, of course, use that data for the purpose of arriving at a recommendation as to what plan will be best likely to secure the maximum number of troops. As to the utilization of my honourable friend and others who are desirous of giving their services to the Empire in any capacityI take i the means in Australia",44
343,Mr FLEMING,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,O r anywhere else.,44
344,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"I can only say that I am heartily in favour of doing whatever is possible to enable those who wish to help their country at this juncture, to do so. The Government will consider how far that is possible. The honourable member for Barrier raised the question of the censorship. He will not expect me to express any opinion as to the policy of the British Government in regard to it , nor can he expect me to say anything at all about the censorship here. I am not to be understood as supporting his strictures upon the intelligence of the censors in The this country. That is a question upon which every man may exercise his own judgment. In the particular case referred to, no blame whatever can attach to the censors here. We have requested the Imperial Government to permit us to publish further details relating to the torpedoeing of the Southland. As soon as we get that permission they will be published, but not before. I come now to the remarks of the honourable member for Dampier. The honourable member, whether wittingl y or not I am unable to say, put before the House a distorted and quite untrue statement of the position regarding molybdenite and scheelite.",44
345,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,I ask that those words be withdrawn.,45
346,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"I withdraw them. But I have explained the actual position over and over again, so that only those who wish not to understand it can fail to do so. In this matter we are carrying out the direct instructions of the British Government. We have stopped, and will continue to Btop, molybdenite and wolfram going to any other country but England j but we have not stopped their going to England.",45
347,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,And none has been taken off a ship?,45
348,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"I say deliberately that not one ton-no t one hundredweight - of molybdenite, wolfram, or scheelite has been taken off any ship by my orders. The agents, Messrs. Dalgety and Company, have uader their own band stated that they have not taken off any. If they have done so without my authority they will have to put up with the consequences. I am unable to follow in detail what the honourable member says with regard to the charges, but I may state that the scale he gave is not in accordance with the charges imposed. Further, it is not true that Dalgety's have a monopoly of the buying. There is not one local agent who bought wolfram and molybdenite before the order, who I cannot buy it now. As a matter of fact, all the local buyers are now purchasing, and the schedule provides what the local agents' allowance shall be on the various fields. The scalo at the Wolfra m Camp in North Queensland provides for a comwe mission to the local agent of £2 per ton. In the face of that, it is vious that Dalgety's have not a monoPermission poly of .buying. It is not true eithor that ores are restricted, as stated by the honour the able member. The original standard i m posed by the British Government was, with molybdenite and wolfram, as set forth in the schedule:-9 0 per cent, molybdenite, 65 per cent, wolfram, and only J per week in October. cent, bismuth. But this has now been amended. On the 29th October last addressed a letter to Mr Speaker, represents the most important mining field so far as molybdenite and wolfram [278] are concerned, in which I gave him the following information:In reply to your letter of the 22nd inst. in relation to the purchase of wolfram and bismuth ore, the Attorney-General asks me to enclose a copy of a Gazette notice on the subject. Since thp date of that notice, arrangements have been made for the purchase in the same way of wolfram and molybdenite ores of a lower grade than those specified. Ores containing a greater percentage of bismuth than that specified will also be taken, and payment made for the value of the bismuth, less the cost of extraction. Mixed ores containing less than 50 per cent, of wolfram or molybdenite are not dealt with under this arrangement, and may be exported through other channels, Bubject to the usual permits from the Minister of Customs. Ore which contains a larger percentage of biBmuth than of wolfram would, of course, come under this head. As regards the complaint that Dalgety and Company Limited arc offering less than the local agents, you will see from the Gazette notice that there is nothing to prevent the producers from Belling to the local agents. As regards the ore mentioned in Mr Ure's letter, the analysis shows that it may continue to be dealt with independently of the arrangement with the Imperial Government, aa its percentage ofmolybdenite is so low. No objection will be made to its being disposed of in the English market; but permission cannot be given for its export to America.",45
349,Mr QKBGOHT,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,But when did you amend the regulation ?,45
350,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,It was not a regulation at all.,45
351,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Yes , No. 113.",45
352,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"It was done during my visit to Sydney ahout a month ago. will ascertain the date and let the honourable member know presently.. As soon as the British Government requosted us to requisition supplies and make arrangements for future output, we did so. But, as a result of representations made to us, pointed out that certain of the ores produced in Austi'alia could not be treated obeffectively to come under that standard. has now been granted to send ores of a lower grade, to be paid for on same basis. Ores containing a higher percentage of bismuth will also be taken, and the bismuth paid for, less the cost of its extraction. I learn that the date asked for by the honourable member was the first There was no regulation, and there has been none, but every I person has been invited by me in the press who in the most public way.",45
353,Mr GBEOOBY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,Did you say that thore was no regulation about these prices ?,45
354,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,There is a statutory provision under the War Precautions Act.,46
355,Mr GEBGOBY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,Is not that a regulation?,46
356,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"No , it is a statutory provision.",46
357,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,Has it not the force of law?,46
358,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Thes e pnces are fixed by the British Government. _ The position is as I have stated. I wish to say, for the benefit of the produoers of these low-grade ores, that we are now in a position to take any ore. If it is under 60 per cent, they can find' markets in England for themselves; if it is over SO per cent, we will take it, and whether it has a higher percentage of bismuth or not now does not matter.",46
359,Mr GBEOOBY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,That is wolfram?,46
360,Mr HUGHES,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Yes . I told the honourable member that from the first week in October it has been as I said, and I want him, if he wishes to help the miner, to make that fact aB public as he can.",46
361,Mr GBEOOBY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,May I ask the honourable member a question ?,46
362,Mr SPEAKER,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,Order ! The Prime Minister has replied.,46
363,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"I would like to say a few words by way of explanation, sir.",46
364,Mr SPEAKER,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"Order 1 The honourable member cannot speak now, as the debate is closed.",46
365,Mr GREGORY,OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE,"I know that, sir; hut may I not make an explanation?",46
