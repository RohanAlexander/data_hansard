6,Mr TIM FISCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This is the first opportunity for me to raise this matter since the publication of the Sydney Morning Herald of Thursday, 27 February. My attention been drawn to a cartoon appearing on page 14 of that paper which clearly refers to me and clearly shows the administration of poison in a circumstance that I find utterly unacceptable. I expect there to be robust debate in politics and in parliament. That is par for the course. I acknowledge that cartoons have form and role to play in this country, but thls one scrapes the bottom of the barrel. At stage have I opposed or done other than to recognise that there is some concept, to defined and dealt with properly, of natlve title. Indeed, after the original Mabo 1 decision of the High Court, I publicly recognised and accepted what the High Court had found. Yes, I have argued for extinguishment which validates pastoral leases, and matter which is to be dealt with elsewhere. This cartoon totally misrepresents my position in a very offensive way. This difficult debate, which the nation must have on these issues, would be better helped if it did not contain elements of poison.

7,Mr TIM FISCHER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill delivers on the government's commitment to maintain the export market development grants scheme and to provide full rate eligibility, for the first time, to the tourism industry. It simplifies the scheme, better targets its support to small and medium enterprises and retains a well funded program the budget black hole of the Labour The EMDG scheme has been asslstmg Australian exporters for over 22 years. During that time, the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 has been amended many times. As a result the act is now quite complex and difficult to use, and has been critihas cised as such by exporters. The bill before the House is a very much easier to read document than the act it will replace. As far as is possible it puts like matters with like, it flows logically from subject to subject, and it presents concepts and terminology in relatively simple language. It uses around only half the number of words of a particul-r the existing act. Two significant measures have been introno duced to direct more funds to small and medium enterprise. The minimum expenditure .be threshold has been lowered to $20,000 per grant to benefit more SMEs. In addition, applicants with income in the grant year in excess of $50 million will no longer be eligible to receive a grant for that year, thus freeing up available funds for those exporters this is a most in need of assistance. The government has also recognised the significant contribution made to ou.r exports by the tourism industry. We have mcreased the grant rate for all tourism providers to the full rate of 50 per cent, allowing free samples of services provided and access to approved joint ventures. As a result of the fiscal legacy of the previous Labour government, the cost of the EMDG scheme has also had to be addressed. The government has, therefore, decided to place a cap on annual funding. This is consistent with the government's wider goal of fiscal restraint. Most importantly, the mechanism for effecting the cap will provide for full payment of smaller grants at the time of determination. Claimants eligible for larger grants will receive a partial advance at the time of determination and a pro-rated balance at the end of the year. If demand for grants exceeds the $150 million available, larger grants will be reduced. To minimise the potential reduction to individual grants, the government has introduced a number of policy changes which wiJI simplify the scheme, address fraud and better target it at those SMEs in the early years of exporting. Eligibility to claim air fares continues for the first two grants, assisting businesses take that difficult first step of visiting export markets. Air fares incurred by an overseas representative wiJI continue to be claimable for all grant years within an overall expenditure cap for overseas representatives of $200,000 per grant year. The fundamental principles of this scheme have not been altered. The scheme will continue to provide assistance to small and medium Australian exporters and potential exporters through the partial reimbursement of selected promotional costs. Under this bill, the scheme retains its open access nature. In the interests of broad consultation with industry and getting the bill right, an exposure draft of the bill was widely circulated late last year for public comment. Over 160 submissions were received. I thank those who provided submissions. Many of the issues raised in those submissions have been included in the bill that is before the House today. This bill demonstrates the commitment of the government to assisting Australian SMEs enter and develop export markets. Not only have we retained a well funded EMDG scheme which encourages smaller firms into export; we have made substantial progress towards reducing the budget deficit and providing a better macro-economic environment for all Australian exporters. I commend the bill to the House. I also present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned. NA GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Tim Fischer, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
8,Mr TIM FISCHER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The government has introduced to this place a bill which will establish a revised and simplified export market development grants scheme. I refer to the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. This bill repeals the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974, and deals with matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of Export Market Development Grants Act 1997. As a consequence of this change, it is necessary to protect the rights of certain applicants and the government, and the ongoing integrity of the scheme. This bill preserves the status of approved body, approved joint venture and approved trading house applications, and various related guidelines; preserves first time claimant registration, and guidelines with respect to the grants entry test; preserves 'decision making principles' in respect of continuing business considerations under the scheme; prevents first time applicants from claiming expenses in respect of previously ineligible services; ensures the finalisation of pending claim assessments and grant payments; ensures that pending prosecutions may continue, and monies owing to Austrade may be pursued; and amends other acts to reflect the repeal of the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 and the enactment of the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997. I commend this bill to honourable members. I also present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned. AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL enable First Reading Bill presented by Mrs Moylan, and first time. Second Reading",14
9,Mrs MOYLAN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997 is being tabled today in advance of the Aged Care Bill 1997 to establish an administrative procedure to support the implementation of the income testing arrangements that were part of the aged care reforms announced the 1996 budget. The Aged Care Income Testing Bill will allow the departme-ts of Social Security and Veterans' AffaIrS to commence income testing residents in nursing homes and hostels so that they can be advised by my department in advance of 1 July 1997 about the level of charges they will face when changed. the Aged Care Bill is passed. This bill only enables an income assessment to be undertaken and advice to be provided residents of the outcome of that assessment. It does not enable charges to be increased, does it allow any reduction in the level Commonwealth subsidies paid under the Security National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954. The substantive income testing provisions which would enable increased charges and corresponding reductions in sub-idies will provided for in the Aged Care Btl- 19-7. anticipated that the Aged Care BIll will also be tabled during this sitting with a co-­ mencement date of 1 July 1997. The proVIintroduced sions in this income testing bill would thereprovisions fore cease to operate once the new aged care legislation is in force. The bill provides for an exchange of inforcan mation between the Department of Health and Family Services and the departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. Th- Depa-­ ment of Health and Family ServIces will services they need. provide resident information to the other two departments who will match it to their records to retrieve information for those residents to the determination of ordinary income 1997 for those residents. Information will be provided to the Department of Health and Family Services under the relevant parts of the acts read a administered by those departments. There are provisions in the bill to ensure that any personal information exchanged for purpose of income testing is not used for any other purpose. These provisions have been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commission. The income test to be applied by the departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs is the existing test carried out in determining entitlements to pensions and benefits. The determination of income for people in already in receipt of social security or veterans' affairs pensions or benefits will therefore be based on their existing available income information and they will not have to provide additional details. People will, however, be able to request a review of the determination if their circumstances have Special protections for war widows and widowers have been built into the bill so that to they will not pay any more than other people with an equivalent income. Nine per cent of nor current nursing home and hostel residents are of non-pensioners. The Department of Soci-l will undertake assessments for thIS group in order to ensure that they can be advised of their potential income tested charge as much in advance of 1 July as possible. The Department of Social Security - e will require three months prior to 1 July to It IS undertake these necessary assessments. The income testing provisions in the Aged Care Income Testing Bill have therefore been for passage in advance of the in the Aged Care Bill to provide this necessary lead time. When income testing is in operation after 1 July only those who afford to pay a little more and make a fair contribution will be asked to do so. Older people will not be asked to pay what they cannot afford for the resident aged care People who are not satisfied with decisions made about their income will have a right of appeal, first to the relevant department and then to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The reforms announced in the 1996 budget will see far reaching changes to residential aged care services in Australia. The establishment of the administrative procedures provided for in this bill is essential to the government's overall strategy of providing residents with detailed information on the reforms and with certainty about the impact on their individual situation. I present the explanatory memorandums. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. AIDC SALE BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Bruce Scott, for Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
10,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill will put in place the necessary framework to give effect to the government's decision to sell AIDC Ltd and wind up the Australian Industry Development Corporation. AIDC's origins were in 1970 when the Australian Industry Development Corporation was established as a statutory corporation by the Commonwealth. It was formed to facilitate and encourage the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries. Commercial operations commenced in 1971. The corporation established a reputation as a prominent development finance company in Australia, lending to and investing in a wide spectrum of Australian industries. Milestone transactions in its development in the 1980s included leading roles in the North West Shelf gas project financing for Woodside Petroleum Ltd and the Eraring Power Station project financing. More recent significant transactions include establishing a consortium of institutional investors to take a 10 per cent equity interest in Optus Communications Pty Ltd. The business activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation were one of the first Commonwealth government activities identified for privatisation. This led to the decision by the previous government to establish AIDC Ltd to undertake the business activities of the corporation and enable an initial offering of 18.5 per cent of the shares to the public. Although this approach provided for public participation in the ownership of the business, it did not provide a practical means through which the government was able to divest itself of the remainder of the company. As a consequence, it was necessary for the corporation to make a takeover offer for those shares in AIDC Ltd not owned by the corporation-that is, Commonwealth government owned shares-to facilitate the full disposal of the activity. The takeover offer was successfully completed in January 1996 and the shares in AIDC Ltd delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange in February 1996. Since its establishment as a company, AIDC has been changing the direction of the business activity of the company. While still focusing on the development or advancement of the infrastructure and resource sectors of the economy, it is pursuing to a far greater extent fee based merchant banking business. This government is firmly of the view that such business activities have no place continuing in the public sector. In addition to moving the company from government ownership, the sale for which this bill provides the framework will further contribute to the government's competitive neutrality objectives. Through arrangements between the corporation and AIDC Ltd, AIDC was provided with access to funding at competiti vely attracti ve rates through the Commonwealth government guarantee. The termination of access to this facility will place the AIDC business on the same competitive footing as the rest of the industry. The government's decision to sell AIDC Ltd is consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit which considered that government business activities whose objectives are to provide goods and services on a commercial basis should only be retained in public ownership if there is a clear public interest case to do so. With the emergence and development of financial markets in Australia, any public interest case to retain AIDC in public ownership has disappeared. In reaching its decision, the government consulted with the board of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and AIDC Ltd. The directors and management of AIDC are fully supportive of the government's policy of privati sing AIDe. The AIDC Sale Bill provides the necessary framework to give effect to the decision to sell AIDC Ltd. The bill provides for a flexible disposal strategy in recognition of the complexity of the legal and commercial arrangements that exist in AIDC Ltd and the need to take the appropriate measures in the sale process recognising the Commonwealth's position as guarantor of the corporation's borrowings. It enables the transfer, under ministerial direction, of assets of the corporation or any wholly owned entity of the corporation to the Commonwealth or any other body. Provision is made for the winding-up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation by proclamation, the timing of which is subject to written certification by the minister that he is satisfied that the corporation has no assets or liabilities. It is necessary to make this arrangement as the corporation will continue in existence after the sale of AIDC Ltd to satisfy the Commonwealth's guarantee obligations arising from the corporation's borrowing program. The corporation's 1996 annual report indicates that $946 million of the borrowings are due in five or more years, long after the sale of AIDC Ltd. Schedule 1 of the bill provides for a range of amendments to the Australian Industry Corporation Act 1970 to give effect to a restriction of the further functions of the corporation to the core functions. These include the facilitation and encouragement of the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries through the provision of financial resources and securing participation by Australian residents in the ownership and control of businesses. While it is the government's view that such objectives should be carried on in future by private entities, it is important to maintain these core functions of the corporation in relation to the existing obligations. Further changes are included to provide for the minister to give directions to the board of the corporation. Through this power the minister can require the corporation to manage the wind down of its liabilities, consistent with the government's decision to sell the business activities of the corporation and the ultimate objective of abolishing the corporation when it no longer has any assets or liabilities. A range of amendments to the act are proposed to provide for the variation to the composition of the corporation's board. It removes the requirement for the ex officio appointment of secretaries to departments as this is no longer appropriate given the ongoing functions of the corporation. With the sale of AIDC Ltd, as provided for by this bill, the close linkage between AIDC Ltd and the Australian Industry Development Corporation will no longer exist and, as a consequence, it is necessary to amend the existing legislation to ensure that the restrictions on the delegation of powers by the corporation to an officer or employee who remains in the corporation or to a fully-owned subsidiary of the corporation remain applicable in the context of the other changes proposed for the act. Section 24A of the existing act is repealed and replaced by a provision that permits the minister to give the corporation written direction to pay specified amounts to the Commonwealth at specified times. Under the existing provisions, payments to the Commonwealth were precluded from exceeding the corporation's profit in that year. Within the sale environment and the wind down in the corporation, it is important for the Commonwealth as the beneficial owner to capture the proceeds at its determination. A new part VI is inserted into the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970 to provide the flexible framework that will enable the sale to take place. The framework includes the regularisation of the ownership of AIDC Ltd, the introduction of the government's ability to transfer assets and liabilities between different elements of AIDC or to the Commonwealth, the ability of the Commonwealth to direct to it the payment of the proceeds of the sale or sales, and the abolition of any residual franking credits. The bill includes provisions relating to transfer of minority interests in AIDC Ltd. Although there was a successful takeover offer by the corporation for those AIDC Ltd shares not owned by the corporation, two parcels of shares in the company remain outside the corporation's ownership. This gives rise to the situation where, despite the corporation, and through it the Commonwealth, having beneficial ownership of 99.98 per cent of the company, it can be frustrated in its intentions to pursue the sale of the company. Obligations are generated under the Corporations Law for directors of the company to protect the interests of those minority shareholders. While this bill makes specific arrangements for the compulsory acquisition of minority interests, the threshold at which it can operate reflects provisions in Corporations Law. The bill provides for the Minister for Finance to declare that at a specified date, which must be before 1 July 1998, that the legal and beneficial interests in those shares vest in the corporation. The shareholders involved are protected in the bill by a requireremains ment on the corporation that reasonable compensation be paid for the shares, with recourse being provided to the Federal Court if agreement cannot be reached on the amount of compensation. As part of its business activities, AIDC Ltd has built up a range of significant investment holdings. Important amongst these is the 48.5 per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. This holding was able to be managed in a way that contributed not only to the development of Australian industry but also to the development of Australian resources necessary for our defence. With the sale of AIDC Ltd, the government is concerned to ensure that this significant ownership stake in ASC continues to be held in a way that contributes to Australia's defence industry objectives. As a result, this asset will be quarantined from sale, unless there is a compelling argument brought forward from the Department of Defence. For this reason, the bill makes provision for the Minister for Finance to direct the transfer of the assets in a way that allows for the transfer of particular assets, such as the interest in ASC, and assists in achieving the government's objective of a sale of the business of AIDC Ltd. Associated with the power to transfer assets, authority is also provided for the transfer of contractual rights and obligations and liabilities. Many of the liabilities of AIDC and its subsidiaries involve liabilities taken on by the Australian Industry Development Corporation and, therefore, include a guarantee of the payment by the Commonwealth of Australia. Provision is made in the bill for the continuation of that guarantee of payment when the liability is transferred to another person. Following the declaration of a sale day, AIDC Ltd and its subsidiaries will have no further recourse to raising new funds which are guaranteed by the Commonwealth. These changes will not permit the purchaser of AIDC assets, rights, obligations or liabilities to in any way change the nature of the existing obligations and retain the benefit of the Commonwealth guarantee. The guarantee will only continue to apply only while the liability in exactly the same form as existed at the time of sale. Provision is made for the Minister for Finance to direct that the proceeds from the sale or transfer of assets of AIDC bodies must be paid to the Commonwealth. This is to ensure that the Commonwealth obtains the full benefit of the sale of AIDC or any subsidiary bodies at the time of the sale rather than leaving it to the discretion of the corporation or an AIDC company. The bill sets out the stamp duty liabilities applying in the sale, specifying that it is not payable in relation to those transfers of assets or liabilities between AIDC bodies or between AIDC Ltd and the Commonwealth, which arise as a result of ministerial direction; such directions being provided for in this legislation. It also provides that stamp duty will not be payable in relation to the sale itself. The bill also provides in Division 7 for the cancellation of AIDC's franking credits, as their inclusion in the sale process could result in the Commonwealth achieving only partial return for the credits. New sections are introduced to provide that AIDC companies must provide information or other assistance as may be requested in writing by the minister to pursue the sale process. In providing this power, protection is provided to those giving information or assistance to ensure that such actions do not result in a contravention of the Corporations Law. Importantly, the bill provides for the preservation or other recognition of entitlements of AIDC staff. It preserves accrued long service leave entitlements and ensures that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act continues to apply in relation to injury or loss incurred before sale day. In these respects, the bill reflects the past practice of government in protecting accrued rights of employees in asset sale situations. The bill also makes consequential amendments to a number of other Commonwealth acts which will take effect on the winding up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. This bill will provide a framework for the sale of AIDC Ltd and the subsequent winding up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation in the most flexible and expeditious way in response to commercial interest that is expressed in the sale process. It will also protect the interests of AIDC employees and enable the effective disposition of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. I present explanatory memorandum.

11,Mr ROCHER,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"Curtin) (10.04 a.m.)These hearing services bills represent a significant first step in the overdue but much anticipated overhaul of Australia's hearing services industry. Despite the fact that this industry fits in excess of 203,000 hearing instruments annually and services more than five per cent of the population each year, it was largely ignored by the previous Labor administration. This legislation will foster a more open and competitive environment in the provision of hearing aids. It does so by delineating clearly the hitherto dual role of the Hearing Services Administration, HSA. Until now, the HSA has acted as both service provider and regulator, the result being that the hearing services industry has been monopolised by a government satellite. The HSA was the only winner under the current practice. Private audiologists and audiometrists and hearing impaired persons the clearly were the losers. For the first time, private providers will be able to compete with the HSA on a more level playing field. Most importantly, consumers will benefit because the legislation will see an increase in competition while providing safeguards to ensure that they are not exploited. Until now, the hearing impaired and deaf community have basically had only two Orders options when it came to the fitting and servicing of hearing instruments. After waiting in lengthy queues at one of the clinics of Australian Hearing Services, those who qualified for a hearing aid from the government were fitted with a fairly basic model, at no expense to themselves. Those who did not qualify for a free government supplied hearing aid could be fitted with an aid of their choice by a private audiologist or audiometrist of their selection. However, these clients were not entitled to any form of rebate, either from Medicare or from a private health fund, if they chose to consult a private practitioner. There appears to have been a glaring inequity in that patients could receive a rebate for the services they received from other health professionals-including physiotherapists, podiatrists and optometrists-yet a similar rebate did not apply to the field of audiology. Unfortunately, this inequity will not be corrected in the proposed legislation. However, if the coalition government is truly committed to promoting more comparative equality, if it is truly committed to a market driven health industry, this is something that must be resolved in the near future. These bills will see the introduction of a voucher system as central to the administration of the distribution of hearing instruments. The explanatory memoranda accompanying the bills reveal that the vouchers will entitle users to one or more hearing services. These include the assessment for, and the fitting of, hearing devices. The government also asserts that it will extend to the follow-up servicing of a client, which is an integral part of treating those with hearing loss. These vouchers will allow consumers to take a greater responsibility in the decision making process. An individual who meets the government's criteria may decide to use his or her voucher to purchase a fundamental style of hearing instrument that meets federal government basic specifications. Alternatively, the consumer may now opt for a more sophisticated form of hearing aid and pay the balance between the cost of the aid and the value of the voucher. In the past, many clients who received free hearing aids from the HSA discarded them because of their basic design and performance. Many then chose to pay for an upgraded device, leaving the old aid to sit and gather dust. Given that governments have only limited funds to dedicate to the health industry, that is not good economic practice in anyone's language. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the principal bill says: The Department will also enter into arrangements with suppliers of hearing aids ... to ensure that participants have access to suitable devices at a reasonable cost to government, and to ensure high standards are maintained. On first glance, this appears to be a reasonable inclusion. However, the legislation is dollar driven. It is predicated on the grounds of budget neutrality. Clause 8 of the explanatory memorandum states that the administrators of the voucher system will, as a matter of priority, 'take into consideration the limited resources available to provide services and programs and will thus strive to ensure the most effective use of funds'. There is a concern in the industry that the planned agreements between the government and manufacturers will restrict consumer choice and result in a form of vertical integration in the distribution of hearing aids. Ms Pam Gabriels, the Director of Western Hearing Services Pty Ltd, has said: It is important to ensure a full choice to the consumer of providers and products. We do not want to end up with a chain of manufacturers tied up with an existing retail outlet. She goes on: The bill discusses an arrangement between the department and manufacturers. We would like to ensure that an independent body evaluates all technology and we would like that to be written into the bill. Ms Gabriels's comments are echoed by Mr Marshall Smithers, the Vice President of the Hearing Aid Manufacturers and Distributors Association. Mr Smithers said that it is important that the new legislation does not restrict the access of hearing impaired persons to the full range of technology available from different manufacturers. Mr Smithers indicated that it is just as important that the amendments do not hinder the hearing impaired from making full use of the large number of small service providers in Australia. The fact is that this legislation will provide consumers with an improved level of choice. But it is equally true that projected funding levels are likely to be inadequate to sustain the new voucher system for long. Some industry experts have gone so far as to forecast that current funding will run out halfway through the year if the government is serious about meeting its commitment to its stated objectives. A likely outcome of this legislation is that the government will link up with the larger manufacturers and distributors in an effort to drive down the price of hearing devices and so spread the restricted funds further. Smaller but nevertheless worthy private providers could find it difficult to compete in such an environment. A lack of funds is also likely to periodically lead to an increase in the already long waiting queues. This is another reason why the government should appoint an autonomous body to scrutinise the performance of all hearing devices and not just those made available by the larger manufacturers. It is appropriate for the HSA to continue to provide special services for those living in remote and rural areas and this legislation accommodates the continuation of that practice. However, I am concerned that other groups have been singled out and excluded from the new voucher system in what is a transparent attempt to limit the dollars committed to this scheme. The hearing impaired and deaf community are, by the very nature of their affliction, at a disadvantage to those with full hearing capacity. To exempt young people between the ages of 18 and 21 from this scheme discriminates against a group which is already facing significant hurdles. A good number of those within this age bracket are full-time students while some are unemployed. In answering a question on notice on 3 December 1996, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) referred to these young hearing impaired people as an 'equity target group'. Arguably, these are the people who can least afford to pay for hearing aids, yet they are being excluded from the government's voucher system. The Deafness Council of Western Australia sees the exclusion of 18to 21-year-olds from this scheme as a major flaw in an otherwise welcome piece of legislation, so too does the Speech and Hearing Centre for deaf children in Western Australia, located within my own electorate. Ms Karen Vernard, the principal of the centre, said: I would like to register my protest against the change of age for eligibility of children from 18 to 21 . . . Most of our children are attending courses and studying up to 21 years of age and are not financially independent. The issue of inequity is also being levelled against the exclusion of some senior citizens from the voucher program. The legislation will see that anyone who is on a part or full age pension will have access to the vouchers while self-funded retirees are excluded. On the one hand, the government is encouraging ordinary Australians to provide for themselves in their retirement by promoting the benefits of superannuation schemes. On the other hand, these same people are being excluded from receiving the benefits and services made available to those who are reliant on the state in their twilight years. Private practitioners argue that many elderly clients on the pension are not only able but also willing to pay for their hearing aids. It has been suggested by some that either the provision of services be cut to part pensioners or co-payments by pensioners be introduced as a means of increasing the total funding of the scheme. Private audiologists and audiometrists are also concerned that the proposed voucher system does not extend to single mothers who support hearing impaired dependants but who do not rely on a pension. I am aware of a particular gentleman who will no longer be entitled to assistance from the government, despite the fact that he suffers from profound hearing loss. This man supports a family and has a mortgage. He meets his tax obligations. He does not wish to go on a pension but wants to remain a productive member of the work force. Because he is over the age of 18 and because he does not hold a pension or health benefits card, he will not qualify for help under the new voucher system. In short, many professionals question whether the government has successfully targeted the most needy equity groups in the hearing impaired community under the new program. Some audiologists also believe that the bill fails to take into account the extensive nature of rehabilitation. They observe that the assessment of hearing loss and the fitting of hearing aids alone do not equate to a total care package. Of equal importance is the ongoing care of a client after the appropriate hearing instrument has been fitted. Just as the technology behind hearing aids continues to improve, so too does that of rehabilitation. The services of the hearing impaired are becoming more comprehensive, more complex and more time consuming, but the cost of total care of hearing impaired persons, as opposed to just fitting the device, is not accommodated under the proposed voucher system. There has again been some suggestion that the government will monitor service top-ups provided by private practitioners in order to avoid the overservicing of clients. So much for a less intrusive government. The government has ensured that ample safeguards feature in the bill to protect consumers once the voucher system becomes operative. Clauses 17 and 18 set out very clearly the rules of conduct for private practitioners. The bill is equally as specific in outlining the penalties for non-compliance with these rules of conduct. Arrangements are in place to allow consumers to make a formal complaint about the standard of service they receive from service providers. These are all thoughtful and valuable inclusions. They should not preclude the need for the government to conduct any investigations into servicing levels. As one private practitioner has observed, the opening up of the industry to competition will mean that consumers play a big part in the success of individual clinics. Put simply, if service providers are good, they are likely to benefit from return business and the referral of their names from one client to another. If a private practitioner offers poor levels of service, they can expect a decline in business. There is no need for the government to be talking too much about investigating standards of service. All in all, the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and its associated legislation are worthy pieces. Its essence will see improved levels of competition in a service previously dominated by a government body. Without exception, the feedback my office has received from private practitioners has been in support of the bill. But the support has been qualified. Private audiologists and audiometrists look forward to being able to compete in a more market driven industry. But they are concerned about inequities that have been created by the government's criteria on eligibility. They are also concerned with the lack of information relating to the nature of the agreements the government will enter into with manufacturers. These understandable reservations deserve clarification by the government in the very near future.",19
12,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"To commence, I think it is appropriate to take the House through some of the actual provisions of the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997, which we are now debating. This bill establishes a voucher system for the provision of government funded hearing services from 1 July. The intention of that is to give adults with a hearing loss a choice of service provider. The outline of the bill talks about introducing managed competition within and between the private sector and the government provider of hearing services, with greater industry involvement in self-regulation and standards. Within the bill we find: a scheme for the accreditation of suitable service providers, including the current government provider, Australian Hearing Services; rules of conduct for service providers; and rules surrounding the nature, extent and use of the vouchers. Other arrangements with service providers are to be dealt with through contractual arrangements. Administration of the voucher system is likely to be delegated by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to the department. Under that delegation, the department will primarily issue the vouchers to eligible adults who qualify to be participants in the system, it will accredit appropriate bodies as providers of hearing services to those people who are issued with a voucher, and it will provide advice relating to hearing services. Currently government funded hearing services are provided through Australian Hearing Services. If we look further into the bill, and the notes on clauses, it talks about contracted service providers-that is, service providers who have been approved under the accreditation scheme and who have entered into a contract to provide hearing services to voucher holders. We see hearing services defined as the services and goods provided for hearing rehabilitation, assessment of hearing or hearing loss prevention. Goods will include hearing aids and related devices. The bill says it is envisaged that most hearing loss prevention will still be undertaken by Australian Hearing Services. On the issue of eligible persons, the bill does not include eligibility for Commonwealth seniors card holders. That removal was announced in the 1996-97 budget. I may have the opportunity to return to that issue later on in the debate but, if not, I indicate at this point that I think that the removal of eligibilimother ty for Commonwealth seniors health card holders is a very shabby provision indeed. I am most concerned about a bill which introduces this element of deregulation and encourages the private sector provision of health services because of my experience with a couple of what I would only describe as bogus hearing test companies and companies which have provided hearing services in Victoria and-I am led to believe-even interstate. I have had over 100 complaints from people in my electorate about the activities of two of these companies, which go by the names of Ear Care and Better Care, which have contacted people at their home through the use of telemarketers inviting them to come for free hearing tests, luring them with the promise of extravagant amounts of compensation from their former employers for industrial deafness, offering them hearing aids and the like to provide hearing services, but ultimately ripping them off, often for amounts like $250 or even $400 or, in more extreme cases, thousands of dollars. I have been approached not only by people who have been the victims of this scam but also by telemarketers involved in the operation who subsequently came to realise that they were involved with an improper organisation. These telemarketers were told to tell the people they rang that, if they suffered a hearing loss due to work force participation of even as little as one per cent, they were entitled to some form of compensation. In Victoria that is not the case. For better or worse, there is legislation in Victoria which establishes a seven per cent threshold before a person can make a claim for work related hearing loss. The telemarketers were told not to mention any costs or money and, if they were queried about scams, people were to be told, 'You do have to pay $250 but, if the claim is not proceeded with, you will get it refunded.' In fact, these people did not have their money refunded. One of the telemarketers, Ms Lorraine Crupi, was so convinced by the company's representations that she even organised for her own mother to come in and have a test. Her was told by the consultant that she had a strong case for compensation so she should pay over the $250 so they could proceed. Subsequently, she received a letter from the Ear Care solicitors seeking a further $150, which she sent off. Then she received a report back from the solicitors saying it would not be wise to proceed because her hearing loss was not substantial enough and they had therefore closed her file. There was no mention of any refund and the medical report that they referred to was dated 26 July, a date at which the solicitors had the report in their possession when they sent the letter to her saying that she had a good case for compensation. When she sought a refund, she received a further letter which put her on an absurd treadmill from which it was simply impossible for her ever to get a decision out of the company about refunding her money. At various times the telemarketers were told by their supervisors that they did not come over strongly enough and that if they did not get in more people the telemarketing operation would close. They were told that it was better to contact people with ethnic names from ethnic backgrounds. They were told, 'Australians know better.' The telemarketers were told that if they were queried about hearing loss scams they were to say, 'Oh, that involves other companies. We are a branch of WorkCover.' Indeed, some of the telemarketers thought that statement was true. They were told to say, 'This is an accredited part of WorkCover,' or 'We are authorised by the government to conduct these tests.' This second telemarketer also said to me that people were told to ring people from English speaking backgrounds. The supervisors said, 'Concentrate on ethnic names. Australians will not claim. They know how the system works.' Indeed, our system has no need of companies like Ear Care or Better Care and people can get hearing tests at their doctor's surgery or commLL:ly health centres without having to pay for them. If they have a legal right to compensation, they can pursue that through recognised lawyers. Once you come in for a test from one of these companies, you are seen by a consultant who is paid by commission. For example, they get $120 for every clai m that goes through. Those consultants do not have any  could become consultants for Ear Care. The commission hasis for payment mea;'5 that there is simply no incentive for then; t,) be honest even if they do have the capuLity to measure hearing loss. The consultants told people that compensation would be automatic, that any problems were only due to a government backlog. They were also told to tell people who were in the work force, some of whom were worried about making claims on their present employers, that their employers would never find out about their claims. That was nonsense. Nevertheless, that was what they were told to tell prospective customers. This is a disgraceful way of doing business. I want to indicate to the House a few more examples of how they have conducted themselves. A Mr and Mrs Cavaleri of Hope Street, Brunswick, told the company Better Care that their employers were no longer trading and that they had no documents to prove they had ever been employed there. But  assured both of them that they had cause to seek damages. He said it did not matter that their employers were no longer trading. But, once they had paid over $500, they were told by Better Care's solicitors, Behan and Speed, that, if they could not provide any proof of employment and if their employers were no longer trading, they would not be able to make a successful claim. A Mr Calvano of Denys Street, Fawkner, non- was told he had a 58 per cent hearing loss and would be able to claim compensation for sure. Once he paid over his $250, however, he was referred to a specialist who told him that his hearing loss was not work related, but due to the ageing process. A Mrs Rad of St Albans paid over $250 to Better Care at St Albans after being told she had a substantial hearing loss and would be able to claim $2,500 in compensation from her former employer. She raised the issue of proof of employment and was told by her consultant that, given her level of hearing loss, she would have no difficulty claiming compensation. But then Behan and Speed, the Better Care solicitors, told her there was no point in pursuing her case because she had not kept any records showin b that she had been employed at the relevant time. Of course, as the relevant time was many years ago, it is nut surprising that ,he did not keep any records. Nevertheless, Better Care and their solicitors refused to refund her $250. That is the kind of company of that Better Care has been. Ear Care in most respects have been even worse. They told people that they would have a successful claim. When those people handed over their money, they were later told that their hearing loss was not compensable. When Mrs Concetta Rocco asked Ear Care to discontinue her claim and refund her money, they refused to do that-they kept going anyway. It is not only the companies that have acted badly; it is the solicitors they have acting on their behalf. For example, a Mr Lindus of Coghlan Street, Niddrie, paid over $250 to Ear Care and then $150 to Anthony Raso and Associates. He received a letter from Anthony Raso and Associates before paying over that $150. It said: The evidence to date suggests you have a very strong case and very likely a successful claim. But, once he had paid over that money, he received a letter in June saying that his claim would be unsuccessful. It suggested that he no longer pursue his claim, and said that the company was closing its file. Mr Lindus pointed out to me that he was not tested for hearing loss between 13 and 28 June. One wonders on what basis the solicitors changed their assessment from likely eligibility to ineligibility. I have had a procession of cases of this kind where people were told before they paid over their money, 'Yes, you'll be able to make a successful claim.' But after they paid over their money they were told, 'No, you don't have any entitlement to make a claim.' I have spent a great deal of time seeking refunds on behalf of those people. I spent three hours one day with a Mr Trevor MCTaggart from Ear Care. I was able to from secure a couple of refunds. But I have got say that he is one of the biggest conmen have ever met. He says he is an ex-builders labourer and that he is on the workers' side. That is a lot of garbage. Exploiting retired people of Italian, Greek, Lebanese and bic-speaking backgrounds has nothing whatsoprofession's ever to do with being on the side of workers. It is a shameful way to earn a living. I have come across examples of letters solicitors. I have got one here which has the top of the letterhead 'Vernons Barristers and Solicitors'. It is addressed to a Mr of Wilkins in Airport West, telling him that are closing their file. On the bottom it signed 'Yours faithfully, Anthony Raso and Associates', an entirely different firm solicitors. What an appalling situation. This the kind of operation which these private sector operators have been running. In late 1995, I received advice from an impeccable source about the Ear Care operwho run Ear Care. ation. I went straight to the fraud squad. I did so because it indicated to me, beyond any shadow of a doubt, two things which I had strongly suspected based on the case histories of so many constituents that I had seen being taken down: first, that Ear Care were sending out letters routinely-not inadvertently; routinely-and as a matter of policy to people telling them that they were ready to proceed further with their claim, had the results of the tests and so on, and asking people for $250 or, in cases where they had already received $250 and were feeling greedy, asking for another $150 when they had the hearing test results and knew perfectly well that their client did not have sufficient hearing loss to make a valid legal claim. This is straight up and down fraud: making representations to someone to hand over money to you so that they can get compensation when you know perfectly well that they are never going to get any compensation. The second disgraceful thing is this: the two firms of solicitors who were supposed to be doing legal work for Ear Care-Anthony Raso and Associates and Vernons-were actually only handling a handful of cases. The vast majority of cases were being processed start to finish in Ear Care's head office to using massive quantities of Anthony Raso's I letterhead and Vernon's letterhead to deceive clients into thinking that their cases were being handled by lawyers so they would part with more money. This is, as MPs would Araknow, not only a breach of the legal monopoly on the provision of legal services but also gross professional misconduct on the part of those two law firms from which allowed Ear Care, no doubt for a fee, on to use their name. The whole operation was bogus. Ear Care's head office had a number phone lines in it. Staff were told, 'If lines they A, Band C ring, you are to answer ""Ear is Care""; if line D rings, you are to answer ""Vernon's""; if line E rings, you are to answer of ""Anthony Raso and Associates"".' The more I is learned about that scam the more incredulous I became. I even made inquiries to satisfy myself that Vernon's and Anthony Raso actually existed and were not a complete legal fiction-a figment of the imagination of those Those legal firms do exist but they should not. I have advised the Law Institute about their conduct. In my view, they should have been struck off by now. To the best of my knowledge, they have not been. It is little wonder that the legal profession does not enjoy a better reputation. The fraud squad and the Victorian WorkCover Authority eventually carried out raids on Ear Care and seized their files. At about the same time Ear Care went into external administration. It is pretty reasonable to assume that the raids were the cause of the company going out of business. I congratulate the WorkCover Authority for doing that. Late last year the Victorian government also initiated legislation amending the Accident Compensation Act, which inserted a new section of prohibited conduct concerning touting for claims. To the best of my knowledge, that legislation has also been useful stamping out this rort, and it too is welcome. These acts, however, have not achieved any refunds for the hundreds, and probably thousands, of Victorians ripped off by these companies. A group called the Public Interest Law Clearing House contacted me in 1995 about pursuing a class action on behalf of the victims of Ear Care. Through a great deal of hard effort and commitment on the part of Ms Caitlin English of the Public Interest Law Clearing House and Mr Michael Piu, who worked for me during 1996, dozens of claims for refund were lodged with the Small Claims Tribunal. With Ear Care going into bankruptcy, it seems that very few, if any, of these people will ever get their money back. I do not walk away for one moment from the role that I played in putting Ear Care out of business, because there is no doubt that, for every case we lodge with the Small Claims Tribunal, their telemarketers were luring another 10 people to hand over their money for the pot of gold on the other side of the rainbow. I am distressed that so many people have been so cold-bl60dedly ripped off and that those low life who ran Ear Care, Trevor MCTaggart, Mark Fisher and Andrew Newland, are still out there walking the streets. They should be charged, and the sooner the better. I am also concerned that these people will try to get themselves into the business of hearing services. They have been there before. They have set up new companies at the drop of a hat with names like National Hearing Services, not unlike the name of the Commonwealth's own service provider, and they have been in the business of supplying hearing aids and the like. Notwithstanding the provisions in this bill for accreditation and for ensuring that those engaged in providing hearing services are quality providers, I am concerned that we have people out there who may seek to abuse these new provisions. I want to express my concern about those issues to the House. I further understand that this problem is not confined to Victoria. For example, in June last year there was a report in the Sydney Morning in Herald referring to the New South Wales Law Society seeking to recover up to $30 million in fees paid by 20,000 people to Better Care, which is described as a Melbourne based company. It is most important that if this legislation is to proceed-the opposition has many concerns about its provisions-the minister can guarantee that the quality of hearing aids is going to remain state-of-the-art, that the clients are not going to be subjected to copayments and that the government is not going to further undermine Australian Hearing Services by moving to privatise it.

13,Dr THEOPHANOUS,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"It was interesting to hear the contribution from the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) because it simply highlights my concerns with the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997. I come forward to discuss these bills with some interest in the matter because during the last government I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health and I had direct ministerial responsibility for both the Australian Hearing Services and the Australian Government Health Service. I was involved in the administration of both of these areas. I know a lot about what has happened and I am gravely concerned about these bills. I am gravely concerned about these bills for many reasons. Let me begin with the Australian Government Health Service. When you read the four or five paragraphs in the second reading speech and the slight comment given in the budget speech last year on this matter, you wonder whether the government has even begun to think what this is all about. As for the actual functions of the Australian Government Health Service and the way it has operated, the government is proposing to effectively set up the Australian Government Health Service as a separate government business enterprise. If you are going to set up a separate government business enterprise that is going to employ doctors and carry out medical practice, one has to ask: is this some form of socialisation in medicine? Will this body be able to get work in all areas of medicine? Is that the idea? Will the Australian Government Health Service be able to compete against private doctors in all areas of medicine or will it be limited in some way about which we have not been told? The main task of the Australian Government Health Service at the moment, as the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said in the second reading speech, is to provide mainly health assessment services for Commonwealth clients. That is what it has been doing. Why should you then take this unit, which is operating quite efficiently at the moment, and tum it into a government enterprise? Is it the intention of the government to go from that point to the point in which this body will be able to offer a whole variety of health services and compete with private practitioners? I wonder what will happen with this. Will the doctors who are employed in it also be able to have individual Medicare arrangements? It is not clear at all what the government intends to do in this whole area. What we had was an efficient unit doing a specific job, and the government, in its whole privatisation push, has suddenly decided that it wants to make it into a government enterprise. If it does, the question will then be: will it remain a government enterprise? Obviously it will not because the intention is, firstly, to make it into a government enterprise and, secondly, to very quickly sell it to private enterprise. If that is the intention, it should have been stated in the bill, and the government should have been honest enough to have done so. If that is what the intention is, one wonders what will happen to the current specialised function of the Australian Government Health Service. It currently has a very good ability to assess people, especially immigration applicants. We have a specialist body, and the first step is to make it into a government enterprise and the next step is to try to sell it off. Obviously the conservatives will not maintain such a body for any significant period. So that whole expertise, useful expertise, in very speedily assessing people in the Commonwealth service, people who apply for positions in the Commonwealth service, migration applicants and other people who need to be assessed for whatever reason for the Commonwealth and even state government departments will be lost. This is another half-baked idea from the government, but I guess it is to be expected from a conservative government. One wonders where it will go from here? We certainly need more answers from the government and the minister about these issues when this debate concludes. I now tum to another aspect of the legislation which is much more disturbing in some respects: the changes to Australian Hearing Services administration and to hearing services generally. The first thing that needs to be said is that Australian Hearing Services is and has been recognised as the best hearing services organisation in the world-I repeat: in the world! During the time. I was involved in the AHS administration it received accolades internationally for its work. People came from a variety of countries to study the work of Australian Hearing Services. And why was that? Because in every area of its work it was outstanding, and it remains outstanding. One has to ask: if we have an outstanding public organisation that is doing its job, why change it and corporatise it? It is so that afterwards, when it suits the conservative government, they can flog it off. Of course, they say that is not their intention for the moment, but we know what their real intentions are whenever they corporatise an organisation in this way. I will come back to the rationalisation for this. The reality is Australian Hearing Services has been doing an outstanding job, firstly, in its provision of low cost hearing aids for the Australian population. It has one of the lowest costs in the world. Secondly, just as dramatically, Australian Hearing Services has been involved in joint ventures to produce a significant number of hearing aids in Australia and it has been involved in Australian research which has contributed to dealing with deafness on a world scale. We have this organisation with this reputation, and what is this government going to do? It is going to destroy it! That is what it is going to do. This is a shameful bill. It is part of the government's ideological obsession that anything in the public sector cannot be efficient, cannot be competitive and cannot be good-notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence that Australian Hearing Services is one of the best examples of a public body doing an excellent job in this country. Indeed, I used to say to people who commented that we could never have a public body or public organisation providing an efficient service that the AHS is an example of one doing just that. The AHS has been providing an efficient service through its many offices around Australia, and people are delighted with the service. They are so delighted that even people who were not eligible for the service were wanting to use their services. That is how good it was! Instead of the government bringing in these provisions, they should be bringing in the provisions that I suggested when I was parliamentary secretary. They included allowing people who are not eligible to use the services of AHS free of charge to pay to use the services. A lot of people wanted to pay for the services of AHS. That is how good it was and still is. Instead, the government want to, disgracefully, corporatise AHS with a view, of course, to selling it off down the track. What is the rationalisation for this? It is entirely ideological. It has to do with so called competition policy. It is very interesting to note that whenever it suits this government they are into competition policy. Whenever it does not suit themlike in the ownership of the Australian media, for example; one of the key issues facing this country-suddenly competition policy is no longer around. But, in this case, as I mentioned, we have this excellent organisation and suddenly the government have discovered competition policy as a way of dismantling this organisation. The member for Wills mentioned something very important: some of the private organisations that existed in the hearing aids area were behaving disgracefully and the AHS had some control in the contracts that were being given out. So some people in their greedy behaviour, which was outlined in great detail by the member for Wills, behaved very badly. What is this government going to do? It is going to open up this area to this kind of exploitation. It is not as if the AHS was not allowing private providers. But I point out that most of the hearing aids given by private providers were being imported, whereas the AHS is producing hearing aids in Australia. From any point of view-whether you are looking at it from the national interest point of view, from an efficiency point of view or from a justice point of view-this bill is a nonsense. In this context, the government is not only going to be involved in dismantling the one body, the good body, the AHS, but also going to have to create another body called the Office of Hearing Services. Why does it have to create this body? In order to bring in the private sector, it has to have a body that is going to supervise the AHS and the private operators. So you have a system that is working well at the moment being dismantled and you are going to have to now establish a further body. In the second reading speech is this ridiculous statement: It is anticipated that the new voucher arrangements and the changes in operations for Australian Hearing Services will be implemented without additional costs to the taxpayer. What a nonsense. What rubbish. How are they going to establish the new Office of Hearing Services without additional cost? Who is going to pay for this new office? Isn't it going to be paid for by the people getting their hearing aids or by the taxpayers? The claim that there are no additional costs is a nonsense. I have never seen such a half-baked proposal as this proposal in relation to Australian Hearing Services. In addition to this, as if this was not enough, what happens? The government comes in with a second whack. It is not only to corporatise the body but also going to reduce people's benefits. The AHS was distinguished by its ability to supply these services to the Australian people, those were in the eligible categories. What has government done? It has decided to cut 19to 21-year-olds. But, interestingly, when asked how much money is going to be saved by cutting out all of Australia's 19to year-olds, would you think millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars would be saved? No; half a million dollars is going to be saved by this measure-a paltry sum to take away this right of deaf people. When I was parliamentary secretary we had requests from people over 21 who wanted this service. I was actually looking at ways in which we could extend the service to people over 21 in need. What is the government doing now? It is going backwards. It is saying, 'If you're over 18, you're not going to get the service.' If it was a budget measure of a huge saving, that would have been something; but half a million dollars is paltry sum. If you tighten up a couple malpractices in medicine you save that sum within a week. But the next issue, Commonwealth senior health card holders, is even more disgraceful. People who have the senior health card are longer going to have access to the services AHS or to the other services of private viders on that basis-talk about attacking vulnerable sector of the community. Senior health card holders are people who have retired, who have made a contribution to this country and who may be having problems with their hearing. And the government is expired) saying, 'Bad luck. From now on you're going to have to pay full rates. You're not going get any subsidised hearing aids. You're not going to get any free hearing aids. You're going to get any free support from Australian Hearing Services or from this government.' What an appalling situation and what a mingy policy. It is a policy that is contrary to all principles of social justice. The health minister, Michael Wooldridge, and the former parliamentary secretary ought going to be ashamed of themselves for having agreed to this proposal. We are not talking about a group of people who are not in need; we are talking about a group of people who who are suffering from deafness. In relation to the understanding what it is like to give deaf off people the capacity to hear, I have seen children suddenly awake to the world when they have been provided with hearing aids. I 21have seen older people suddenly gain a new burst of life when they have been given the ability to hear. Instead, as I said, we have this mingy proposal which is going to save a little bit of money but be at the cost of people in genuine need. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as you have a hearing service in your electorate, you would know what I am talking about. This corporatisation is going to require a budget contribution from the AHS. This means that costs will go up because they will not have the capacity to provide the services at the lowest rates. Instead of the government making it harder for people to access hearing services by bringing in these half-baked proposals with a respect to the AHS, they should have been of focusing on the real issues. One issue that I raised when I was parliamentary secretary, about which the government has done nothing in 12 months, was the critical problem of the need to provide hearno ing aids for Aboriginal children. We discovof ered in one area that over 80 per cent of proAboriginal children were suffering from a hearing problems. The AHS was building a program to deal with this issue. What has happened to that program? The government, in its obsession to dismantle the AHS, has forgotten about those real issues. (Time",26
14,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"I wish to speak briefly to one aspect of the Hearing Services Administration Bill not 1997, the bill having generally been covered on this side of the House by contributions yesterday from the members for Dobell (Mr Lee) and Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and this morning from the members for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) and Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I wish to restrict myself to that part of the bill which reduces the eligibility of hearing services for young Australians from 21 to 18. The member for Dobell, the opposition spokesman on health matters, has indicated to the House that the opposition will move an amendment to oppose that part of the bill and to restore eligibility for young deaf Australians aged 19 to 21. I strongly support that amendment. I do so because I have an electorate interest in this matter. The Maylands Institute for the Blind is situated in my electorate. The Institute has housed with it an office to assist people who are both deaf and blind. The bill will have an adverse impact on some of those people. Secondly, Australian Hearing Services in the CBD of Perth is within my electorate. Thirdly, while it is not specific to my electorate, I have been approached by an organisation in Western Australia known as PUSH, Parents United to Support Hearing Impaired Children, which is chaired by a former member of the state parliament in Western Australia, the Hon. Barry MacKinnon. I will detail those representations to the House shortly. The bill was introduced and given its second reading in the House by the member for Pearce and Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). In the course of her second reading speech, she stated: Part 1 of schedule 2 of the bill gives effect to 1996-97 budget measures involving changes to program entitlements for hearing concessions. As a result of these measures, people who hold a Commonwealth 'seniors health care card' will no longer be eligible for the full range of free hearing services. Similarly, people over the age of 18 who are not pensioners or eligible for some other reason will no longer receive the full range of hearing services. People who become ineligible following these changes will still be able to obtain free maintenance services for their hearing aids for a further five years. The government regards both of these changes as fair, given the limited resources that it has available to it. The government regards as fair the removal of the entitlement to hearing services for people between the age of 18 to 21, given the limited resources available to it. The best one can ascertain from the budget papers and responses to questions by ministers opposite is that the cost of removing the eligibility for hearing services from young Australians aged 21 down to 18 is an annual cost of $500,000 and, as best as I can ascertain, over four years, $1.5 million. So to take away these hearing services from young deaf Australians aged 19 to 21 on a yearly basis is the cost of a Speaker's chair-the cost of a Speaker's chair to take away these services from young Australians aged 21, 20 and 19. What sort of civilised society is that supposed to reflect? What sort of pernicious attitude is that supposed to reflect? What sort of message does that give to Australians? The government, on the basis of a decision which it articulates as being fair because of limited resources available to it, will take away services to young deaf Australians because they cost the equivalent of a Speaker's chair in one financial year. Given that the Commonwealth budget goes to billions of dollars, and given that one of the classic philosophical threads of thought of the Liberal Party is said to be to seek to assist those less disadvantaged than the general community, one might have thought that in the hearts of the Minister for Family Services and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) they could find $500,000 from the billions of dollars of Commonwealth revenue available to the government. I would not have thought that the Minister for Family Services could have been so pernicious. It is not enough to force elderly Australians to sell their homes to enter nursing homes; it is doubly pernicious to say to young deaf Australians, 'For the cost of a Speaker's chair, we remove your eligibility for hearing services.' The Parents United to Support Hearing Impaired Children, Western Australia, have written to me in the following terms: Young people already have great difficulty in pursuing careers past secondary education for many reasons. These include, unrealistic expectations by institutions of deaf students capabilities in English; the cost of being able to be supported by note takers and the like in these institutions, the lack of any comprehensive scholarships to assist students in this position, the reticence shown by many employers to employ disabled people. It is our belief that all people are entitled to in access to employment and education. The present decision does not grant this. We would therefore urge you to reconsider this decision as it relates to dependent deaf students up to the age of 21, and in particular to those who are pursuing their studies or employment. That sentiment is echoed by ACROD, the National Industry Association for Disability Services, in ACROD's newsletter in September/October of last year. Under the heading 'Services for children are of particular concern', ACROD says, in respect of the government's decision to reduce eligibility to 18 years: ACROD does not agree with the decision to reduce the eligibility for AHS services from 21 to 18 years. It was pointed out that many young deaf people are still at school beyond the age of 18 due to their learning needs and they will be significantly disadvantaged. There are also concerns that a reduction in availability of services could lead to increasing numbers of young people choosing not to use their hearing aids. It is likely that a further unintended consequence could be an increase in the number of young people and their families choosing to apply for pensions once Child Disability Allowance ceases at age 16, thereby increasing the overall budget costs for the Government. ACROD says that, to knock young Australians off hearing services eligibility on the basis of a pernicious decision to save the cost of a Speaker's chair, the net effect may well be an additional burden on the government and the taxpayer. What sort of civilised society does that reflect? I urge members opposite to support the amendment to restore eligibility to young deaf Australians to the age of 21.",29
15,Ms ELLIS,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"It seems to me that this government just continues time and time again, bill after bill, to demonstrate its absolute obsession with divesting itself of the provision of services to our community and of being responsible to our community for that community's well-being. The changes that are planned and reflected in the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and cognate legislation are important changes to an area of service for particular people. I would just say at the equity outset of my speech that the amount of notice given to this parliament by the government in relation to these changes is just not acceptable-hence, this side's call for the bills to be referred to a Senate committee. Amongst other things, what these bills will do-as the previous speaker, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), has just highlighted very well-is, first of all, cut off the young age group of 18to 21-year-olds from access to Australian Hearing Services. I find it quite amusing, and quite pathetic at the same time, to think that it really depends on what we are considering when deciding when a young person is to be responsible for themselves. Under Austudy I think you now have to be 25, under something else you have to be another age, and under this you have to be 18. It seems to me that there is a very dollar driven philosophy behind deciding who is going to qualify for what and at what age. The other aspect is the cut-off from access to AHS of Commonwealth seniors card holders. That was a not that far back initiative that was very welcomed by those people. It is retrograde, in my mind, to now attempt to remove from those people access to these hearing services. The changes will also introduce a voucher system, which I have very serious concerns about. In other words, the cut-off of certain clients from access to AHS, Australian Hearing Services, is very definite in this bill and has set us down a road which I believe will lead to the ultimate privatisation of the complete service. Australian Hearing Services is a model public service provider. I have to declare a personal interest in this to the degree that my elderly mother, who is now 79, very reluctantly a few short years ago admitted that she did need assistance from some hearing service providers and is a qualified client of Australian Hearing Services. My observation of the levels of service, care and concern delivered to her in the dispensing of what I believe, on behalf of the taxpayers, is a very cost efficient service has been one of nothing but admiration for the way the service currently works. When the coalition went to the electorate a year ago, its promise--obviously, now we can say that it was apparently a non-core promise-to preserve all pension benefits has proven yet again to be a broken promise. Previous speakers have outlined and explained the work of Australian Hearing Services, and I will not go back over that ground. But we do need to look at some of the disadvantages that these bills, in changing this particular area of administration, will create. Currently, the average price to clients through the AHS is something like $400 lower than equivalent private sector providers. I am absolutely bamboozled to understand why it can be economically viable to change a system which is so efficient. The review by the Centre for International Economics has had something to say about this. I know that previous speakers probably have alluded to these comments, but I would like to go over them again. As I have said, the AHS' s cost per new adult client is lower than the fee paid in the private sector. The prices are kept well down and, in fact, I understand, below the OECD average. The report went on to explain the ability that the Australian Hearing Services have to be very efficient in an economic way due to the economies of scale. There is absolutely no doubt that the economies of scale proffered by the AHS are something that must be factored into the equation when we decide to consider such enormous changes. I find the economics of this whole thing very puzzling. I think we really need to consider these things very carefully. I understand at the moment that, rather than importing hearing aids, we have very highly skilled job and industry areas. I understand also that there is something like $200 million in foreign investment in sales and exports of high quality hearing aids and devices as well as the continuing growth and health of this particular industry. Why on earth are we going to put that at risk? If this legislation in any way undermines the ability that AHS has had to date to nurture that sort of industry, then I really query the government's judgment in deciding to go down this particular path. Through AHS we have a bulk buying facility. They can purchase batteries for hearing aids on a bulk purchase arrangement, therefore automatically creating savings in costs. There are costs efficiencies right through the system. I just do not understand why the government seems to think it is a good idea to throw all of that away. Why on earth are we risking this whole economic balance? We already have, in certain areas of public service providing services to the community, some successful systems in place in this country. Those systems are in most cases, and particularly the ones I am going to cite, the subject of admiration through the world. Australian Hearing Services is one, and a previous speaker this morning has already highlighted the fact that many people who do not qualify for AHS want to get into it because it works so well. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme, PBS, is another one. We know that not so many months ago the government were considering huge changes to the PBS. Thank heavens it seems that we have won on that one. But why on earth does this government continue to wish to change, to challenge, to decimate in some cases, these economically viable and economically successful schemes? I am a little bit puzzled as to why, other than because of a philosophical bent, it just seem to think that if it sell its off, if it gives the responsibility for the delivery of services to someone else, it is a whole lot easier. There is a lot more to be considered than that. We must bring to the attention of everyone in the community as much as we can this particular attack on a very proficient and efficient community service, Australian Hearing Services. There is no doubt that this attack has serious consequences for younger people and, as has been said, this is all for just half a million dollars a year. It seems to me to be absolutely ridiculous. I just do not understand why we are doing it. I want to repeat that the short time given for the parliament to consider this bill and therefore for the community to consider the bill is not acceptable; it is disgraceful. We need to think about whether or not the government decided to say, 'If we get this through, if we let it slip through quickly, maybe people will not notice what we are actually doing.' They noticed with the PBS, which has a lot more people dependent on it. Maybe with the smaller numbers of people using the AHS they are hoping it will get through uncontended. I want to finish off with a couple of almost philosophical statements, if I may. I take this opportunity, given that we are talking about a community service here, to remind this government that there is nothing to be gained by blindly going down a road of obsessive privatisation, of obsessive sell-off. You have really got to look very carefully at who the recipients are of the service we are talking about, why they need it, how successful it has been in the past and what justification there is for attacking it. I say to the government here in the parliament that at the end of the day you are here to govern for people; you are not here to do much else than that. If you do not have people as your concern, you should not be in the job. You are forgetting at the moment in the sorts of decisions we are seeing, particularly in relation to things like Australian Hearing Services, that very aspect of the job of government. I implore members opposite to think very seriously about what you are actually doing to a very successful community service that is highly admired around the world, a service to people who really do need that support. As I said a moment ago, I know from my own personal experience that it is not an easy thing, particularly for older people, to admit that they have to seek the services of something like a hearing service, and when they do come to that decision we have got to make sure as a community that we offer a very efficient, very professional and very caring service to them. Where taxpayers' money is concerned it must, of course, be economical and it must be rationalised so that we can justify what we are doing. I do not believe that the changes that are outlined in this bill in any way consider those points. All we are seeing is yet another attempt by the government to divest itself of its responsibility, and in doing so it is putting at risk an extremely efficient, highly admired service to our community.",31
16,Mrs MOYLAN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"in reply-The opposition speakers, and in particular the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), whom I listened to for some time yesterday, clearly failed to do their homework on this very important change to hearing services in the Australian Hearing Services Administration Bill. The member for Jagajaga does not seem to be aware that the government's policy announcements were announced in the last budget and are very clear in the budget papers. She completely confused the numbers of people who may be affected by the eligibility changes introduced as part of this bill. The opposition does not consider half a million dollars important-and I listened with interest as the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), spoke on this yesterday when he just swept away a saving of half a million dollars as though it was nothing. And it is no wonder that these people lost government because they are clearly not out there listening to the concerns of the Australian people about budget accountability and about proper management. I listened with interest to my colleague across the chamber, the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), when she said just now that we are accountable in this bill. We are accountable; we are accountable not only to those who require hearing services but we are also accountable to the whole Australian population. What we have tried to do here is to produce good policy, sound policy, in relation to hearing services, but at the same time be accountable in government to the whole Australian community. Half a million dollars saving is significant, and it is no wonder that this country was going broke when former ministers just shrug their shoulders about half a million dollars. Several of the opposition speakers appear not to have read the government's issues paper produced last September which spelt out quite clearly the government's intended direction. They do not seem to know that consumer groups were consulted and that they welcomed the introduction of a voucher system. They appear not to have read the government's position paper, released two weeks ago to industry and to the consumer groups, which clearly outlined the further detail of the system. And they have ignored very important benefits that these changes will bring to people with a hearing impairment. Many claims have been made in this debate but few hard facts have been laid on the table, except from this government. First, the Centre for International Economics did a very careful review of the hearing services industry, considered all views and recommended a voucher system much along the lines of the one being introduced. This fact has not been mentioned. The opposition have selectively quoted from this report and have quoted only those pieces that they think support their argument. The centre's report does say that Australian Hearing Services is doing a good job and that consumers are generally happy with what they are getting. But good government requires more than simply doing okay and more than managing to avoid complaints; it involves asking the hard questions such as, 'Is there a better way?' Consumers have said that there is a better way. That is really the bottom line. Hearing service professionals say that there is a better way. So we have got not only the recipients of the services and providers of the services saying to government, 'What we are doing is okay, but there is a better way to do this,' but the Centre for International Economics report said that there is a better way. So we have not only got the consumers and providers of the product saying that there is a better way but that report in its conclusion said that there is a better way. Second, opposition speakers claim that the voucher system spells the end of Australian Hearing Services, of its joint research venture into hearing aids, of Australian manufacture of hearing aids and of jobs in Queensland. The facts are as follows. Australian Hearing Services retains its existing exclusive responsibility for hearing services to children. Australian Hearing Services will continue to apply its expertise to people with very complex hearing needs. Australian Hearing Services will continue its joint venture arguments, its research into hearing aid development and other important audiological research responsibilities. Australian Hearing Services will continue to provide its excellent work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. We have made this clear in our budget acknowledgment, in our discussions with consumer groups and in our position paper on hearing service program reform. I made it clear in my second reading speech that Australian Hearing Services specialist assistance will continue for people in rural and remote areas, including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I cannot understand why the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) does not know that. The government has made it very clear that it expects the current contract between Australian Hearing Services and the internationally owned hearing aid manufacturer and assembler Bernafon to be honoured. Every pensioner will continue to receive free hearing services. Very few hearing aids are fully made in Australia; most are assembled from a mix of imported and local parts with limited local manufacture. Australian Hearing Services will compete with the private sector hearing service providers for adult customers under the voucher system. Its efficiency and customer satisfaction will be a clear advantage in the competition. I have no doubt that it will strive to lift its game even further, as will the private sector providers. Bernafon will have the opportunity to compete for contracts to supply hearing aids under the voucher system, in addition to its present arrangements with Australian Hearing Services. I expect it will put in a very competitive bid, as will all other manufacturers. Third, the opposition has not correctly described the current hearing services system or the voucher system that is being put into place. As I have said, they have failed to read the information that has been made available to them for some time. If they have read it, they clearly have not understood it because they failed to stop and think about the fact - that the high private sector prices being paid under the current system, which high prices opposition speakers criticise, were agreed and put into place while they were in government. This would imply that the then responsible minister allowed a contract rate to be set that is apparently so far above the internal cost to Australian Hearing Services. Not only that, but the opposition allowed private sector arrangements to be struck that required no competition and no tender process. When the opposition was in government, it made the major expansions in eligibility which have led to the government provider dominating the hearing services market. Private sector businesses rely on referrals from Australian Hearing Services for a significant part of their livelihood. Under the current system, people are told where they can go to for hearing services and whom they can see. The present system gives people a choice. There is no doubt that the Australian Hearing Services is an effective and efficient organisation. It does not want the opposition's model of protectionism. It does not need it. wants to compete. It wants to be in the marketplace and it wants to be freed of the contradictory responsibilities of managing contracts with private sector providers and at the same time competing with them. Fourth, the opposition does not appear to understand the basic principles of competitive neutrality. Opposition speakers suggest that Australian Hearing Services should retain its competitive advantages as a government statutory authority-staffed by public servants and exempt from the cost of taxes and charges-and then somehow compete with the private sector businesses. Many private businesses during the time. I have been in this place have complained of just that point-that there was one rule for government and another rule for the private sector-in an era when the opposition in government were proclaiming the virtues of a level playing field. Fifth, the opposition members are mistaken in the number of people that might be affected. One opposition speaker claimed that 30,000 older people will be drastically affected by the eligibility changes. I think the member for Jagajaga, if I am not mistaken, did mention the number. As at November 1996, 33,037 people had a Commonwealth seniors health care card, but not every older person has a hearing impairment. So far, only about 4,000 people who hold a Commonwealth seniors health care card have sought hearing services. Around 2,000 people in 1994-95, 1,100 in 1995-96 and 800 in 1996-97-these 4,000 people-have already had their needs met. They now need access to affordable maintenance and minor repairs of their hearing aid and access to replacement batteries. Even though they will no longer be eligible for other hearing services, the government has already promised that they will continue to be able to obtain these maintenance services for the next five years. We have made no secret of the fact that the savings produced from this particular change in eligibility are small. It is not zero, as claimed, but there was no effect on the appropriation level. The savings that were It made were left in the program to benefit those most in need. Mr Lee-Who wrote that one for you? Ms Macklin-Have you read the answer in the Senate?",33
17,Mrs MOYLAN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"It is quite clearly demonstrated that they have not read the detail of this proposal and that they have failed to get so many facts right. A similar confusion over numbers may exist over the changes in eligibility for children and young people, where the age cut-off for full service will change from age 21 to age 18. It is unlikely that a young person with hearing loss will not have already had this hearing loss detected well before the age of 18. It is unlikely that such a person will turn 18 without having had their hearing needs rechecked and adjustments made to their hearing or other device. We can be certain that young people aged 18 to 21 who have been receiving government funded hearing services for some years will need access to affordable maintenance and minor repairs of their hearing services and access to replacement batteries. Again, the government has already said that it will ensure access to these services for a period of five years. The opposition has claimed that the new system will not assist wage earning adultspeople who are not part or full pensioners. This is true. What has not been said is that the current system does not assist this group anyway. The opposition is just not telling the full story. The government has to target its effort to take into account people in the community who have the greatest need and ensure that there is adequate protection in place for them. It was fine for the opposition when it was in government to simply expand eligibility, but even the opposition did not assist this group. Despite the statement by the member for Calwell, who proudly stated that when he was responsible for hearing services he wanted to extend free services to people over 21, even the opposition did not attempt to do this. Perhaps it realised that it would lead to absolute government monopoly and drive private sector providers out of business altogether. The government is serious about the reduction of the deficit. The government has a responsibility to all Australians and it considered its budget outlays very carefully. Several opposition speakers described the estimated half a million dollar saving from the change in eligibility as small and not worthwhile. That is why they got the accounts of this country into such a very sad and sorry state. Since the opposition appears not to have done its basic research or to have read the available information on the new hearing services system, the opposition claims that the government is giving away the buying power that comes with having a monopoly government service provider. This is simply incorrect. The opposition seems to imply that the new scheme will result in paying the highest market rate for single hearing aids bought individually rather than the benefits of bulk purchase. It implied that there will be no centralised purchase and that every purchase of a hearing aid will be a single purchase. This picture better describes the current system of subcontracting by Australian Hearing Services to private providers, which was introduced by the opposition in government when Australian Hearing Services could not meet demand arising from changes in eligibility. The current system also pays private sector hearing service providers a fixed price for each hearing aid fitted, regardless of the actual price paid. The hearing aids that are being fitted often cost less than the price that the government is paying. We presently have a system where large numbers of hearing aids are purchased individually, but the taxpayer is paying more than the hearing aid cost. The new hearing aid service arrangements will put an end to this. The government has already issued an invitation to register interest for tenders for the supply of hearing aids to people in the voucher system, using the independent assistance of Purchasing Australia. It is taking every opportunity of the buying power that it has to ensure that the best and fairest price is paid for hearing aids. The initial invitation process will ensure that any necessary finetuning is done and creative options explored before it moves to a formal tender process. We expect that the final steps will involve the letting of common use contracts, which will allow every participating hearing service provider to purchase approved hearing aids at the most competitive price. Opposition speakers have spoken about disadvantage and hidden agendas and claimed that the new system is somehow going to cause great hardship amongst people who are hearing impaired. Under the current system you can go to only an Australian Hearing Services office. Australian Hearing Services might send you off to a private sector hearing service provider of its choice-not one of your choice, but one of its choice. You have no choice in the matter under the current system-the current system that was put in place by the opposition. Under the current system, you can go to only an Australian Hearing Services office. Either you go there or you go to a provider of their choice. Under the current system you will receive good quality service, including professional assessment of your hearing needs, an appropriate hearing aid and other assistance. As a customer, if you are not satisfied with the service you are getting, you cannot go anywhere else. There is no choice about that. I cannot see that there is any equity in that. You can complain. You may not be satisfied that your complaint is considered independently, but where do you take it? You cannot add on to the service you get in any way, even if you want to pay for extras. If you want something a little different to the standard-and there may be very good reasons why you would want that-you do not have that choice. You are not allowed to do that under the system. Under the new system you will have the ability to get the hearing services voucher which clearly spells out your entitlements, the ability to take this voucher to the hearing service provider in your nearest shopping centre or professional offices or to any other hearing services provider. You have the ability to have your hearing needs professionally assessed, where necessary, to have a quality hearing aid supplied and fitted, to have the services that are needed to help you get the best use from your hearing aid, and to have the access to affordable maintenance of your hearing aid and replacement batteries. The new system also gives you the ability to change hearing service providers if you are not satisfied with the service you are getting, the ability to complain about the decisions that are made in relation to you and your needs or the way in which you are professionally treated, and the ability to obtain hearing services you may want from the same provider at marginal extra cost. Several opposition speakers have claimed that the new system is the introduction of copayment by stealth. It needs to be remembered that this was the opposition that introduced the only hearing services charge, a $25 annual charge for hearing aid maintenance and replacement batteries. There are a number of other items that I could go on about, but I can see that we are running out of time. Aside from those issues, the opposition implied that the eligibility changes are new and are being rushed through the parliament. These changes were announced publicly last August in the government's 1996-97 budget. It said that these changes would be made from March 1997, just as it said that the new voucher system would be in place by 1 July 1997. It was always clear that these changes would mean that legislation would be amended and added to some time between August and March. The changes that are being made will separate the AGHS from the department and place it on its own as a fully government owned company. It will compete with other private sector health service providers and will have to win its business on the basis of price and, more particularly, on the basis of its capacity and ability to give service or, in other words, perform for the benefit of those who use the services. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mrs Moylan) proposed: That the bill be now read a third time.",35
18,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"For the record, the opposition remains strongly opposed to the measures in this bill. We will not force the House to a division on the third other reading. There is one other matter that we will force to a division later this morning or this afternoon. But for the record, I would like to once again repeat that the opposition remains strongly opposed to the measures the government is implementing with this bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA REFORM BILL 1997 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 5 February, on motion by Mrs Moylan: That the bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Schedule 1, items 1 and 2-by leave-taken together.",37
19,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"-This might be a convenient opportunity for the House to consider some issues that affect the entirety of the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill, given that these issues were raised during debate and in the summing up by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). I would be grateful if the minister could inform me and the House about the date on which some of the measures will take effect. I think there has been a bit of that. The minister claimed that, while there are 33,000 people who hold seniors health cards and who today are eligible for assistance under the eligible services provided by the Australian Hearing Service, 4,000 of those have already received assistance and will continue to have ongoing access to maintenance and other things. I would be grateful to know when the remaining 29,000 people who hold seniors health care cards will cease to be eligible to use AHS. I would be grateful if the minister could clarify the date on which those people cease to have access to AHS. I do not know if it is on royal assent or if it is on 1 March. I would appreciate it if the minister was able to confirm to the House the date on which the remaining 29,000 people with seniors health care cards will no longer have access to the Australian Hearing Service. Mrs Moylan-I will deal with them at the end.",38
20,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,I have a number of questions I would like to put to the minister. Mrs Moylan-I will sum up at the end.,38
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,Mr Truss)The honourable member for Dobell or the minister can speak any number of times in relation to this matter. It is a matter for the minister as to whether she chooses to respond now. Mrs Moylan-I will respond at the end.,38
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"There is a limitation on your time, but you are free to do that.",38
23,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"I want to add to the questions. I gather from the comments of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) that she does acknowledge the answer that was given in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee portfolio budget estimates where it was stated quite clearly that there will be no savings from Commonwealth seniors health card holders losing their eligibility as a result of this bill. Obviously, it has a relationship to the previous question asked by the member confusion about for Dobell (Mr Lee). It is clear from the answer given to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that the savings in relation to the age cut-off will be $1 Y2 million over four years. What I would like explained a little more than we have been able to understand from the information made available to us is that I understand the predominant savings are coming from the voucher system. It is not at all clear to me where those savings will actually arise. Is it not the case, as I suggested in my remarks yesterday, that it is going to come from people who need hearing aids actually having to pay more? The department's portfolio statement released at the time of the budget makes it clear that there will be $12Y2 million in savings as a result of the government's changes. The vast majority of those arise from what is described as increased competition. Increased competition to me generally means that the consumer is going to pay more and the government is going to pay less. What we need to know is actually how these savings have been arrived at and what they amount to. The second point is in relation to the reduction in the age cut-off for those aged 18 to 21. It needs to be pointed out that there is still a large number of young deaf people-I am now looking at an ACROD newsletter, which I am sure the minister is familiar with-still at school beyond the age of 18 due to their learning needs. From the point of view of ACROD, these people are going to be significantly disadvantaged as a result of these changes. We certainly do need to protect not just those who are in the current age group 18 to 21-the minister has indicated they will be protected-but also those in the future who may, as the minister said, have had their hearing problems identified. But there will be circumstances where people have not had their hearing problems identified, whether as a result of accident or other misfortune, and we really do need to make sure that these people, who in the main will be remaining dependent on their families, do get access to the services they have had to date from Australian Hearing Services.",38
24,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"I am waiting for the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to jump, but if the minister is not jumping to answer our questions then let me put another question to her. Minister, could you also advise us when the bill will affect those 19to 21-year-old Australians who have hearing disabilities who are currently eligible for services provided by AHS? When will they cease to be eligible to use AHS services? Is it 1 March, is it the date of royal assent or is it 1 July? We would be grateful if you could make it clear to us when this bill takes effect and affects those two groups-those holding senior health care cards and 19 to 21 year oIds. Now is your chance. Mrs Moylan-Have you finished the whole lot?",39
25,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,The minister cannot try to restrict the opposition's ability to jump up a further time after the minister has replied. We have asked a few questions and we would like some answers.,39
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,It is a matter for the minister as to whether she chooses to answer or not.,39
27,Mrs MOYLAN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"The eligibility for children and seniors takes effect on royal assent. The budget predicted this as being 1 March. The savings on children are $500,000 each full year, and the new voucher framework is cost neutral.",39
28,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"If I can just follow up the cost neutral suggestion of the minister, it says in the Senate response, which I am happy to table if the minister would like me to do so, that the voucher system will give savings of $3.7 million in the coming year, $3.5 million in the following year and $3.1 million in the following year. If you would like me to table that, you could answer the question. Leave not granted.",39
29,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"I will just read the line out so that everybody understands it. It says that the voucher system will save nothing in the current financial year; in 1997-98, it will save $3.794 million; in 1998-99, $3.554 million; and in 1999-2000, $3.134 million. That does not sound like cost neutral to me. I ask again: how have these savings been arrived at? They obviously have to come from somewhere and must mean that, to my way of thinking, either the consumer is going to pay more or services will be less. Mr Lee--There was a question asked there and we were hoping perhaps the minister might answer the question. Mrs Moylan-I think all of that has been quite clearly outlined. I have nothing further to say.",39
30,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"We certainly have got some more to say. This obviously makes it clear that consumers are going to pay more or services are going to be less. Otherwise, the government would not be getting such a saving. I think it is very important that we do make sure that those who have hearing problems understand that they are the ones who are going to have to bear the burden of this significant change.",39
31,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has told us that she won't be answering our questions, she has said enough, but I would like to ask the minister to reconsider. There is some confusion about the savings this measure will deliver. I thought you said a few minutes ago that there were no savings from the introduction of the voucher framework, yet we have here an answer to a question put by Senator Faulkner on 18 September. Your department said that there would be savings of $3.8 million in 1997-98, $3.6 million in 1998-99 and $3 million in 1999-2000. I find it hard to reconcile your answer of a few minutes ago and the answer your department gave to estimates last year. I would also like to put to the minister: if there are these sudden miraculous savings of $3V2 million a year that you had not expected to achieve, do you now need to proceed with the changes in the eligibility for Commonwealth seniors and for the reduction in age limits for young Australians, given that the savings there, as I said yesterday, are one Speaker's chair a year-about half a million dollars a year? Given that the minister claims there are no savings from the introduction of the voucher system and no savings from taking eligibility away from seniors health card holders and only half a million dollars in savings in taking away the eligibility rights young Australians with hearing disabilities, can't the government perhaps reconsider it? Given that the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald says that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) can get away with mistakes that total $5 billion, surely you can give ground of half a million dollars a year for deaf Australian kids. Items 1 and 2 agreed to. Item 3.",40
32,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"Silence was the minister's reply. We are up in the air; we do not know what the savings are from this measure. We do not know if the government really has logical arguments that seek to take away from 33,000 elderly Australians who have seniors health care cards their right to use AHS. Let me just explain to the people in the gallery that there are 33,000 Australians out there who have Commonwealth seniors health care cards. At the moment, if any of them are found to have a hearing disability, anyone of those 33,000 people can use the government Australian Hearing Services to get a state-of the-art hearing aid. In her answers earlier today, the minister said that the opposition is wrong in saying that 33,000 Australians are going to be affected by this measure because only 4,000 currently use hearing aids and it only really affects 4,000 people. Minister, you ignore the clear fact that 29,000 Australians with seniors health care cards might go to have their hearing assessed tomorrow and then find out that they have a need for a state-of-the-art hearing aid. Those 29,000 Australians who currently do not have a hearing aid are those that are about to lose their right to help from AHS as a result of your bill. Surely you will admit that 29,000 are going to be affected by your measure. Will you now at least concede that that is what you are doing? You are taking away from those 29,000 Australians with seniors health care cards their right to use Australian Hearing Services. Even though you get no savings at all from it, you are deterof mined to take away this eligibility from 29,000 Australians. Is that correct?",40
33,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"Jagajaga) (11.56 a.m.)My colleague the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has made a very important point. Of course, the process of growing old and, unfortunately, having hearing loss is not a static thing, as the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) tried to describe it in her previous remarks. She suggested that everything would be all right for the Commonwealth health care card holders because those 4,000 who currently need help from Australian Hearing Services would be okay. But, as my colleague just pointed out, we have more and people getting older and getting eligibility for the Commonwealth health card. Some of those who currently hold the Commonwealth health card are also, unfortunately, likely to lose some or all of their hearing in the future. So the idea that it is going to affect only 4,000 people is, as far as I can understand the process of ageing, just not correct. The idea that, therefore, the Commonwealth cannot measure what it expects to save from this change also seems to me to be incorrect. If, as my colleague said, you have 29,000 people who in the future could claim support from Australian Hearing Services but now no longer will be able to, that is a prospective saving for the government. At least protect the 33,000 card holders who currently have eligibility. I, and I am sure my colleague, would like to see these card holders protected in the future. If it is the case that there are no savings, as the answers to the Senate questions show, we would expect that to mean that all 33,000 are protected, not just the 4,000 who currently get services.",40
34,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"We again are disappointed that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) declines to seek the call to answer the questions which we have put here today. Basically, this is a deba-ing chamber. This is the House of RepresentatIves that debates changes to the law of Australia and, in consideration in detail, we have the right to put questions to you. We have t-e right to ask what are the consequen-es of thIS clause being passed by the parhament of Australia. If you either choose not to or are unable to answer our questions, what does it say about the quality of the legislation that this government is putting before the Australian parliament that you are not prepared to stand up and defend it in the House of Representatives? This is the clause that takes away from those 33,000 Australians with seniors health care cards the right to get help from Australian Hearing Services. Mrs Moylan-I've just explained that to you.",41
35,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"Why can't you answer the questions that we are putting to you across the table? Isn't it a fact that 29,000 of those Australians are going to lose access to AHS? If in fact it is the truth and you misled us when you said it was only 4,000, then have the guts to admit here today and we will move on to the next item. We are entitled to have answers from the minister. We are entitled to have an exchange as we consider clauses in detail. Mrs Moylan-You don't understand it.",41
36,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,The minister says we don't understand it. Prove it by taking the call and explaining to us where we are wrong.,41
37,Ms MACKLIN,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"I really want to reinforce this point, because we will all be going out into our electorates trying to explain, particularly to older people, whether they are eligible. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is saying that we have great difficulty understanding; that is why we are asking the question. Is it the case that 29,000 people are going to lose their eligibility? Is that the case? I take it by her silence that it is the case. I also noticed that when the Minister for Health and Family Services «Dr Wooldridge) put out a press release about this issue at the beginning of February this was one of the facts that he failed to mention in his press release. He did not mention the fact that these seniors were going to lose access to Australian Hearing Services. We now have the minister refusing to answer questions about the eligibility of 29,000 older Australians. I think we will just have to take it that it is the case that 29,000 people are going to lose their eligibility, unless the minister is able to tell us otherwise.",41
38,Mr LEE,HEARING SERVICES AND AGHS,"In an attempt to perhaps persuade the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to seek the call, the opposition had intended only to divide on schedule 1, item 5. We were only intending to have one division. But if the minister refuses to answer our questions then, frankly, the opposition will have to consider whether we divide on several issues rather than just the one. Minister, please seek the call and answer our questions. Question put: That item 3 be agreed to. The House divided. [12.05 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr W.E.

40,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,She's doing a great job. You pull your head in.,42
41,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"The Chief Government Whip told me to pull my head in. I do not know whether that is worthy of the Chief Government Whip. I seek your assistance, Mr Deputy Speaker. I ask you to ask the Chief Government Whip to withdraw that insult.",42
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Truss)There was so much noise in the chamber that I thought you did remarkably well to hear it. I certainly did not.,42
43,Mr LEE,PAIRS,Perhaps the Chief Government Whip could try to deny that he said it.,42

47,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point that we are trying to make here is that a number of opposition members have put questions to the Minister for Family Services. She has refused to answer them. Mr Griffin-She's taken the fifth.",42
48,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"She has perhaps taken the Fifth Amendment. We have put a number of questions to the minister. She has refused to answer them. We do not know how much money the government will be saving through these measures. We have a contradiction between the information given at the time of the budget and in Senate estimates and what the minister has said today. The minister will not clarify how much this government is actually saving by introducing the voucher system and by changing the conditions for eligi bili ty. The budget papers said that you would be saving $4 million a year, Minister. This bill and your statements this morning say that the introduction of the voucher system is budget neutral. Which is true: what you have said this morning and what is in this document or what you put out last August at the time of the budget and in the Senate estimates? They cannot both be correct. This particular clause takes away from young Australians aged between 19 and 21 who are deaf or have hearing disabilities the right to use AHS services. It saves a measly half a million dollars a year-one Speaker's chair a year, as we call it. On the very day that the Sydney Morning Herald exposes another $5 billion mistake in the forward estimates-a $5 billion mistake in the government's accounts-this minister says that it is worth cutting off access to hearing services for deaf young Australian kids so that they can save half a million dollars. We strongly oppose this change. We think that it is unfair and that it is totally at odds with all of the commitments given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) before the last election and totally at odds with the commitments given by the Liberal and National parties that people's entitlements and eligibilidollars, ty would be maintained. Minister, how can you justify cutting off the right of deaf young Australian kids to access hearing services to save this measly half a million dollars? Minister, don't you think it is a contradiction to expect young kids under the age of 21 who have hearing disabilities to rely on their parents to pay for these services when the government, in every other change it is making to social security and Austudy, is seeking to raise the age of independence? Unemployed people and university students up to the age 25 are expected to be looked after by their parents, and yet here is an example of where the government is seeking to lower the age. The only thing these changes-one age going up and this age going down-have in common is that both changes allow the government to save money. This paltry half million dollar saving will leave a lot of young Australian kids between the ages 19 and 21 with hearing disabilities unable to access AHS. The minister has refused to answer our questions. She has spoken to the officials in the advisers box dozens of times, but she is afraid to come to the dispatch box and answer our questions. Minister, you have a responsibility to this House to answer the questions that are put to you by members of the House of Representatives. You have demonstrated today that you are simply not up to the job.",43
49,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"I have a further question, which hopefully the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) can answer: how many young people in the age group concerned does the minister expect will be affected by this change? I see from the information made available to us that the government does expect half a million dollars per year to be saved, but it is important for to us know how many people the minister expects will be affected. The minister said in her remarks earlier that she did not think very many people would be affected because by the age of 18 most young people will have had their hearing problems identified. That is an important point and one that we acknowledge. But, obviously, if the government does expect to save half a million it does expect that a number of young people-we would like to know how many the government estimates will be affectedwill have to pay for their hearing services even though the vast majority of them, as my colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) said, will remain dependent on their parents. It is now the case that this government assumes that the majority of these people will not be independent young adults earning an income but still dependent on their parents up to the age of 25. It is very important to know how many young people with hearing difficulties the government thinks will be paying out quite large sums-large sums particularly for young people who have no other means of support.

(2) Clause 21, page 14 (after line 12), after subclause (1), insert: (1A) Subsection (1) does not prevent the nominated company from being a Commonwealth authority for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1922 if paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition of Commonwealth authority in subsection 7(1) of that Act applies to the company. (IS) Subsection (I A) is enacted for the avoidance of doubt. These amendments will make clear that we will use the provision of the Public Service Act in section 81 C which permits the Prime Minister to declare that present employees of the AGHS will transfer to the new corporate entity and cease to be officers employed under the Public Service Act. This has always been our intention and these amendments will remove any doubt.",44
51,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"If the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) could that easily read out the script from the department on the impact of the government's latest amendments, why could the minister not have sought advice from the officials and answered the questions that we put to her this morning and early this afternoon? A whole series of important questions was put to the minister about the alleged financial savings that are delivered by this bill. We are still in doubt as to whether the minister's measures will be budget neutral or will save $4 million a year. We have a contradiction between the information we were given in the budget papers last year, the information we were given in Senate estimates and the minister's answers today. We still do not know the extent to which these measures will save government funding. Under the guidelines of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on key elements of ministerial responsibility, under ministerial conduct it states: It is vital that ministers and parliamentary secretaries do not by their conduct undermine public confidence in them or the government. Minister, if you cannot answer, with the help of the officials and your own personal staff, simple questions that elicit matters of fact in debates in the consideration in detail stage, what is the point in trying to have any constructive debate in this chamber in which we try to seek information from you on the detail of your bill and on the consequences of this bill being carried? We accept the point that you are not meant to know everything about the bill. That is why there are officials in the advisers boxes. But, if we cannot get you to speak to the officials in the box and then come to the table and tell us the answers to the questions we put, what is the point of having a debate here in the House of Representatives? Do you expect it all to be carried out in the Senate? I think it demeans our chamber if we have to rely on the Senate as being the only place where the impact of individual clauses is considered. I put to the very large number of Liberal and National Party members on the backbench that the debates on the consideration in detail stage are one of the few occasions where members of the House of Representatives have a chance to get down to the detail of bills and to consider whether the executive is doing the right thing in moving these amendments. It is in times like this that we expect good ministers; ministers who are on top of their brief; ministers who consult with their officials about questions that are raised. It is a chance for them to show us that they are on top of their brief and that they know what the implications will be. It is an opportunity which, unfortunately and regrettably, this minister has passed up today. Amendments agreed to.",45

53,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"The opposition will not be forcing the House to another division on this measure. We had initially planned to have only one division on the measures in the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997. Because the minister was not prepared to answer questions that were put in the consideration in detail stage, we were forced to take the House to a second division in protest. Our basic OpposItIOn, for the record, remains that we think it is wrong for the government to be taking away the eligibility of those 33,000 senior health card holders to access AHS. We also think it is wrong that the government has taken away access to AHS from young Australian kids aged between 18 and 21 with hearing disabilities. For these reasons, we will be voting against the third reading on the voices, but we will not be forcing the House to a division. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time.

54,Mr GARETH EVANS,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"The opposition will not be opposing the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 and cognate bills in the House of Representatives. However, as I will spell out, we do have quite a number of concerns with them as they are currently drafted. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, moreover, has been examining the bills closely, and the opposition may well have specific amendments arising out of that scrutiny process when we get to the Senate. Labor, when in government, examined the issue of retirement savings accounts. At this stage we did not think any attractions they might have outweighed the concerns we had about them, and we did not accordingly go down that path. That said, that is not to say that we did not allow banks to enter the superannuation market. On the contrary, banks such as the Commonwealth Bank and the ANZ, through their life insurance subsidiaries, have become quite established in the superannuation sector. The coalition parties announced that they would, if elected, allow the establishment by financial institutions of these retirement savings accounts to compete against the traditional superannuation funds. This has been a long standing policy of theirs which predates the 1993 election. It was promised that RSAs would be designed to provide a simple, portable and flexible deposit style superannuation policy. The public rationale for it was to provide a super product to benefit those sectors of the superannuation BILL 1996 market such as low income earners who have transient work patterns and who are not necessarily treated optimally by some of the more traditional superannuation products. But that public rationale is not the whole BILL 1996 story. We all know-and the coalition knows better than we do-that the private rationale for the introduction of these accounts is as a pay-off to some very important financial backers of the coalition: namely, a number of the major banks. RSAs are the method of the banks and other related institutions getting a share of the superannuation market. A further attraction of this product is that it gets the funds onto their balance sheets without having to go through the existing avenue of life insurance subsidiaries. There are a number, as I have indicated, of claimed advantages of RSAs. Let us explore them and see just how advantageous they are. In the first place, the argument has been that RSAs could be used by employees to accumulate all super contributions. For example, in the situation where they might have two or more employers, RSAs would provide a level of simplicity, continuity and control, in effect, in regard to superannuation. There was a problem in that aspect of superannuation which involved the existence of multiple small superannuation accounts for the one individual. In government, however, Labor did recognise that problem as a problem, and we amended the law to allow for amalgamation and better tracing of accounts, and also to limit the unfair impact of fees eating into members balances-an issue I will come back to in a moment. Those reforms have lessened the need, we would argue, for RSAs, according to the criterion I have just mentioned. The second claimed advantage of RSAs is that, for older Australians nearing retirement, it is suggested they would act as a safe and secure alternative to traditional super products that are market linked and, therefore, involve a higher level of risk than do RSAs which are a capital guaranteed product-capital, in other words, cannot be diminished in RSAs by negative investment returns. It is true that capital guaranteed products can and do perform a useful role in the superannuation system. But RSAs are not the only such products. They have, in fact, eXIsted for many years; they are already there as an available alternative. That is another reason why we say that RSAs are not an indispensable new feature of the landscape. The third claim being made for RSAs, as I foreshadowed a moment ago, was that they would offer protection against super funds being eaten away by fees and charges, particularly in those circumstances where perhaps people are or have been caught up in mUltiple super accounts and in the application generally of the current system to low income earners and part-time, casual and intermittent participants in the work force. Predominantly it was these groups for which there was a reasonable concern about superannuation moneys being eaten away by fees and charges. However, again, the Labor government in 1994 introduced the protection of small accounts initiative. This prohibited superannuation funds from charging fees and charges on accounts where the balance was under $1,000. That has protected small funds from erosion, and further demonstrates that this particular claimed advantage of RSAs is not really necessary, or not really a big advantage at all or a unique contribution that RSAs and only RSAs can make. What the coalition has been careful to avoid telling members of the public in relation to the returns they will get on RSAs is that these are really, by their nature, low return products. The second reading speech offered by the minister on this parent bill continues the practice of not fully coming clean on this basic fact. It states, 'RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product.' Why doesn't the phrase 'low return' appear added to that particular list: simple, low cost, low risk-but low return, because they are a low return product. Why isn't the community being told that they will, in fact, lose if they put their savings into these vehicles over the long term by comparison to other available options? I will come back a little later on to spell out just how much of a financial disadvantage is involved in this respect. The fourth claimed advantage for RSAs is that they do reflect choice, they do provide choice; they, by their very nature and existence, mean that there will be more choice available to people-and that is a better thing. The reliance on that degree of rhetoric, the reliance on rhetoric to that effect, about more choice in the superannuation product market has been a real characteristic of the way that the RSA story has been told. The government talks about choice and claims to support choice, but in this case it is offering the choice for people to retire with less superannuation funds than they would otherwise have had-and, again, I will come back later on to spelling out just how much less is involved here. We in opposition do accept that consumer choice is an extremely important issue. But what is valuable about choice where it is made not by the employee but by the employer? To what extent can people actually benefit from having a choice if they are not given sufficient information to make an informed choice? Obviously, to make an informed choice, it is absolutely fundamental that individuals be in a position to fully understand, to comprehend, what their choices are and, in particular, what these choices will mean over the longer term. The government has so far completely avoided the responsibility for any kind of education campaign that would ensure that individuals are aware of all the implications of their choices. I said that there was a real question here as to whose choice it is in the ordinary industrial situation-the employer's or the employee's. One very strong concern we have with this legislation are provisions which allow an employer to open an account on behalf of an employee, removing the ability for the employee, we say, in practice, to effectively choose between traditional superannuation products and an RSA. The industrial reality is simply this: if an employer approaches a new employee and states that his preferred superannuation option is an RSA, the employee is unlikely in the real world to be in any kind of position to contest that. The power relationships in the workplace just do not work like that. That would be the situation, even where the employee had an existing superannuation fund of his or her own. We see that producing a rather ridiculous situation of the employer effectively being able to force the employee, again, to have multiple superannuation accounts. In an age of so-called relationship banking, it is quite possible that a business could reach some agreement with an RSA provider where, in exchange for, say, half a per cent reduction on their business loans, all employees of that employer take out an RSA from that particular provider. We say that that is an unacceptable possibility that should be rigorously guarded against. The possibility of third line forcing, as called, is particularly of concern to the opposition. While we recognise that the Trade Practices Act does prohibit this, the Australian Consumers Association has raised a number of relevant questions concerning the ability of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to intervene in a third line forcing dispute in the financial services sector. It is clear from what I have been saying that the only people who really gain an unfettered choice under this legislative package will be the employers. The other aspect of the choice question goes to the issue of disclosure. If you really were concerned about making choice a reality for super consumers, you would be requiring much more than is presently the case in these hills on disclosure. The bills currently require the RSA provider-the bank, in other words, in the usual case-to disclose to the employer all information relevant to the performance of an RSA, a retirement savings account. The RSA provider is only required to disclose this information once. So in the event of an employer opening these accounts for, say, 20 employees, it is apparent on the face of the legislation that the provider only has to provide one set, for a start, of disclosure documents. Once the disclosure to the employer has taken place, the employer may then open on behalf of an employee an RSA account. Once an account is opened in this way, the employee is given a 14-day cooling off period during which time the employee can choose to opt out of the RSA with no penalty fees. But, again, in the real world the question is whether this would be a realistic option, given industrial realities in the usual workplace situation and also given the reality of varying degrees of individuals' capacity to fully understand the complexities of these issues. I have just seen an amendment proposed to be moved in the consideration in detail stage of this debate which further emphasises the unreality of this 14-day cooling off period by removing the present requirement in the bill as originally tabled that the funds, during that 14-day period, be put in a trust account. That it is is no longer to be the case-a frank acknowledgment by the government, it seems, that the 14-day period is just a statutory formality and is not intended to offer any real occasion in practice for a reversal of the decision initially made. Going on from there, I make the point that it is extraordinary, in our judgment, that at no point is the RSA provider required to disclose information directly to the employee prior to the account being opened on his or her behalf. Nor is there any obligation even placed upon the employer, as I see the bill at the moment, to ensure that all relevant information is disclosed to the employee. Under any sort of equity and choice, it ought to be the employee's decision to open an RSA, not the employer's. But that is not the way the whole dynamics of this process envisaged in this legislation are going to work. Currently, in traditional superannuation products, employees do have to sign an application form before a superannuation account can be opened on their behalf. We say that is normal and sensible and should apply in the case of RSAs as well. So in addition to all those claimed advantages of RSAs-their provision of choice and so on-which we say are flawed advantages, we have another four or five specific concerns which I will now take this opportunity to spell out. The first of these additional concerns goes to the question of simplicity. An RSA is supposed to be simple. But if it is so simple, why do we have a primary bill of 154 pages, a consequential amendments bill of 83 pages, and a brand new superyisory levy set of provisions as well? There are also estimates, I understand, that there will be between 200 and 300 further regulatory provisions governing the operation of this legislation. Clearly, this new regime is going to be anything but simple. Of course, the level of complexity proposed will inevitably increase the cost of the provision of RSAs relative to that cost which was talked about before the election, making it very difficult, we think, for providers to really provide a cheap, flexible and portable product. If this is not confusing and complex enough, this legislation is, as I have just indicatment ed, going to be made even more complex by some further amendments to be moved later in the debate. It may well be that there will be further amendments still flowing from the report of the Senate select committee which is due on 6 March. Just by its very nature, I know there is an inherent degree of complexity associated with the creation of these financial instruments by legislation, but it all points to a picture very much at odds with the central claims being made about these new accounts: that they are all very simple, clean new products coming on the market which will be to everyone's unmitigated advantage. The second additional concern that I want to spell out goes to the question of prudential regulation. One of the biggest charades with the debate on RSAs has been the assertion that the current system is not a level playing field and that RSAs will make it so. In fact, we argue the contrary is the case. Currently, banks and other institutions are able to provide super products but these have to be delivered, in each case, through a trust structure. The reason that a trust structure is to be preferred is that the trustees have a duty to guard the interests of the fund members. Under the RSA structure, the directors of the RSA institution do not have any duties to the RSA members at all. Their duty continues to be to the shareholders. That is why we have consistently called for any RSA product that was going to be introduced to be prudentially regulated in a similar manner to traditional superannuation products. In 1993, the then Labor government led the world through the introduction of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision)-or SISAct. We say that this should be applicable to the kind of circumstances that are in issue here. That act established that a complying superannuation fund had to be governed by trustees. Those trustees have a common law trustee duty as well as a dual obligation under the SIS Act. If a trustee fails to act in the best interests of the beneficiary, that is to say, the member, the trustee is both personally and professionally liable. This test is double the current standard required from corporate directors under the Corporations Law. The general trustee duty impacts on the manageof investment portfolio strategies, the administration of moneys and the provision of services. The SIS Act also stipulates that there has to be equal employer and employee representation. That is a further safeguard to the prudent management of the funds by ensuring that members' representatives are, in fact, trustees. Once you move to a non-trust structure of the kind that is involved with these RSAs, you completely lose that kind of safeguard. Let me come to the actual financial impact on consumers of making the choice to embrace an RSA product-a point to which I have made reference a couple of times earlier. Let me now come back to it, as I said I would. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) and the financial services industry have readily admitted that the RSAs will be a low growth and low return product in comparison with those elsewhere on the market. It would have been nice if they had admitted that a little bit more clearly in the legislative introduction of this bill, as I said earlier. Nonetheless, that has been a characteristic of a lot of the statements about these, and necessarily so because the product is, as I said earlier, to be capital guaranteed. However, that means that employees really do have to be given sufficient information about the financial implications of their decisions so they can evaluate the long-term consequences of choosing an RSA product over a traditional superannuation product that is by comparison market linked. Certainly, it is absolutely crucial that workers who are considering an RSA-to the extent that they have any choice about it and that employers are not just doing it for them-understand the long-term costs of remaining in an RSA relative to having their super in a managed superannuation fund. The Australian Consumers Association recently prepared a very revealing table comparing three different individuals with different super arrangements. I will just spell out the central themes coming through that. The three individuals are called John, Sally and Tom. They all have the same income and working life. For the first five years of their working lives they all contribute to an RSA, one of these retirement savings accounts that are now going to be established. At the end of those five years, they have all $10,000 in super. The table then takes them down three diverging paths and compares the financial returns to each of them from those three paths. John stays in an RSA for all his ing an average real interest rate of one per cent. That real interest rate takes into account the difference between actual interest rates and inflation, whatever it is at the time. When he retires, his final real benerit is $164,400 the various assumptions that are spelt out in more detail on this document. The second individual, Sally, takes her super out of an RSA after five years and puts it in a managed super fund. She continues to contribute to that super fund for most of her working life and that earns a real interest rate of four per cent-a reasonable assumption in the real world. When Sally retires, her final real benefit is $225,200, compared with $164,400 for someone who just keeps their super in the RSAs. The only difference between the two of them on these assumptions is that she has had her super in a managed fund earning a higher real interest rate. They both made exactly the same contributions over that period, but Sally is $90,000 better off at retirement than John. The third path that is mapped is that of Tom, who, like Sally, on this assumption after fi ve years takes his super out of the RSA and deposits it in a managed fund earning a real interest rate of 6.5 per cent-a slightly higher risk, but there are plenty of funds around producing those kinds of returns. When Tom retires, his final benefit at that higher interest rate is $390,200. Just by earning that higher interest rate--even though he made exactly the same contributions, is exactly the same age and has exactly the same life cycle-he is almost $230,000 better off than John. They both made the same contributions, but John has kept his super in the low return RSA. Those very simple straightforward comparisons do indicate the very high cost of remaining in an RSA for any long period of time. It is absolutely vital that consumers fully understand that. There might be some reasons and convenience, particularly for transient people, multiple employers, part-timers, casuals and so on, notwithstanding the consequences I have just spelt out, for an RSA choice to be made, but people should understand the nature of that choice and the potential financial life, earn- sacrifice that is involved. The fourth additional concern that we have about all this goes to the question of insurance. One of the big success stories in superannuation has been the provision of death and on disability and total and permanent disability insurance protection through the super system. For many low income earners, the introduction of the superannuation guarantee arrangements was the first real opportunity for them to be able to access affordable insurance cover. Professionals have been able to buy their own policies for years in this respect-many people have-but, by and large, lower income earners have not. The super arrangements that they are now participating in with the industry funds, by and large, now have these additional benefits associated with them. There have been numerous examples of when this cover is absolutely essential for the well-being of a fund member or their family in the event of injury or death. We are very concerned that banks, building societies and credit unions which pick up the RSA option do not offer such insurance cover. Even if they do decide to offer such cover, our concern is that the cpst of it in this context may be excessive and a real disincentive to it being taken out. The remaining additional concern that we have about all this new legislative scheme is that it does involve a bias against the existing industry superannuation funds. The introduction of RSAs into the super product market has been promoted, as I have already said, as creating a level playing field. Financial institutions have been lobbying for a long time to gain access to super. It is a matter of concern that, while banks, building societies and credit unions will be now able to provide RSAs, there is no provision currently for public offer and industry funds to offer an RSA look-alike product. If there is to be a level playing field in the product market, public offer and industry funds have to be able to offer an RSA product and be able to market it as an RSA. This would mean that there is open competition and it would actively encourage real choice in this area. Why have they been excluded? We can only speculate, I think on very reasonable grounds, that it is because of the links of the industry funds with the award system and trade unions. There is a very clear ideological agenda that has sat behind everything the government has said and done when it comes to super-and I think we see an example of that here again in this context. They have also, perhaps it is reasonable to conclude, been excluded for commercial reasons-knowing that they would be very effective competitors to the banks and other institutions. Therefore, given the nourishment, solace, comfort, aid and assistance that is being given to the banks and other institutions by this legislation, it is a rather unattractive reality to have to confront that they may be subjected to competition in this respect. Let me finally say in the few minutes available to me that there has been an awful lot of politics at the expense of good policy in every aspect of this government's treatment of superannuation issues. It is evident in the superannuation surcharge issue, now the subject of legislation and so much controversy in the community. The government wanted to be seen to be doing something which would offer a bit of a slap over the wrist of higher income earners to better make its pitch to middle Australia that they were the preferred objects of the government's affection. Maybe there was a case in equity for doing something here. We have not contested that. But there sure as hell was not a case for doing it in this particular muddled, confused, hopelessly complex, administratively cumbrous way, made so by the government's further political insistence that what was involved here was not really a tax increase at all but simply something in the nature of a surcharge that was not really a tax at all. I think the Treasurer finally let the cat out super of the bag yesterday on the John Laws program by actually describing this as a tax, very interestingly. But what I am saying is that the politics of the choice to pretend that this was just some kind of surcharge, not a tax increase, and therefore in breach of election promises, led the government down a path of ridiculous administrative complexity which has made it an object of derision in the super industry as a result. The further concern about the policy aspects of this is that the impact of this particular provision on national saving, which is supposed to be the primary rationale of all these budgetary measures, is at best uncertain and more likely to be negative. For every dollar taken by the government from super, through imposts of this kind, the reality is that private saving falls by a dollar. Unless higher income earners increase their saving to compensate for the extra tax, the effect on national saving will be zero. Further administrative costs, which I have just been referring into the equation, and the impact on national saving may in fact be negative. The other crucial political issue in all of this has been this government's attitude towards the One Nation superannuation contributions, which we promised and which this government before the election indicated it would honour-that is, the additional government contribution of three per cent to wage and salary earners to be matched in tum by an employee contribution of three per cent, bringing the total level of required contributions to superannuation funds up from the present target of nine per cent to 15 per cent in a way which would make quite a spectacular difference to our national saving performance, which is the rationale, as we have constantly been told, behind the whole government strategy. To remove, as seems now to be very actively contemplated by the government, that three per cent contribution in the forthcoming budget, to wave it goodbye-as it seems will inevitably be the case-will mean, on the kinds of calculations we had available to us in government before the election, that a 35year-old man, for example, earning average weekly ordinary time earnings at the moment, without that extra co-contribution arrangement, without that promise being honoured, on retirement will be $104,000 worse off in terms of the superannuation funds available to be taken up. The general rhetoric has all been about the macro-effect of improving the national savings performance and the micro-effect of improving choice for individuals. The government has done neither. These RSAs are not going to help in any respect at all. (Time expired)",46
55,Dr NELSON,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"I find it rather ironic that the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) would appear, at least in the last five minutes of his address, to be more concerned about an initiative, the superannuation surcharge, which will require high income earners to make a greater contribution to the government's fiscal consolidation program dealing with the legacy left to us by the previous government of which he was a part, than he is about the retirement savings account initiative, which will principally be to benefit low income earning Australians. These three bills-the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill, the Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill and the Retirement Savings Accounts Supervisory Levy Bill-are very much an initiative which will add to the choice and the options available for low income and, particularly, itinerant working Australians. In commencing my address, I would particularly like to pay tribute to my predecessor, David Connolly, whose ideas and drive were able to bring this to fruition. I think his efforts in this area should be remembered. This legislation implements the budget decision last year to allow banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of RSAs. RSAs will be required to be capital guaranteed. Also, importantly, the accounts into which a member and/or an employer contributes on the member's behalf will be able to make contributions, will be fully portable, will be owned and controlled by the member and be subject to retirement income standards applying to other superannuation products, including preservation and disclosure. Superannuation products are usually issued under a trust structure that requires a trustee to be responsible for the actions of the trust and to comply with prudential and other regulations as are outlined in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The preferential tax rate of 15 per cent, which applies to complying superannuation funds, is generally a fairly powerful inducement for compliance. Non-complying funds are generally liable to the company tax rate as they are effectively company trusts. The trustee structure reflects the fact that superannuation funds hold money on behalf of contributors with net investment earnings being credited to the members' accounts. At the moment, financial institutions can offer superannuation products by establishing subsidiaries that have a trustee structure, thereby complying as a fund and receiving the tax concession. AMP, ANZ, GIO and others, for example, have established such subsidiaries. RSAs have been identified by us as an alternative to the trustee based superannuation structure. From our perspective, they address three principal problems that exist under the current superannuation arrangements. The first of these is lack of choice. Federal awards which have been allowing for compUlsory award superannuation have been paid into industry funds with equal employer-employee, usually union controlled, trustee representation. Workers have found that they simply have little choice on the fund into which an employer will make contributions on their behalf. Industry funds usually advantage employers-I think that needs to be recognised-as they only have to deal with a single fund which reduces their administration costs. Hopefully at some stage in the future superannuation will not be a matter included in industrial awards. If at some stage the government and the Australian Democrats are able to agree on amendments to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), then we might be able to achieve that. RSAs, once established, may make future amendments to be considered for that bill in this regard perhaps a little easier. The second issue that RSAs address is that of small balances. This is a major problem. I recognise what the member for Holt was saying about the protection of small sums, as commendably introduced and effected by the previous government. One thousand dollars is a lot of money, but if you have $2,000 or $3,000 in a superannuation fund-I do not know about anybody else-sometimes I wonder whether you would be better off hiding it under your bed, as a former Prime Minister once said. By the time the charges and various costs are levied on sums of $3,000 or $4,000, you can find over time that it is not growing much at all and, in some cases, depending on the performance of the fund, it can actually be going backwards. I would certainly suggest that having sums at or below $1,000 being exempt from charges is still inadequate. The superannuation guarantee charge has no way of protecting small balances in super funds. The funds are being eroded by fees and charges. You are forced to make a contribution-at least your employer is-and then you find there is less in it than you actually put into it. If charges are not enough in years of negative investment return, much of the balance can be wiped out. Although the Small Superannuation Accounts Act, which allowed the ATO to operate small assets with no fees, has helped, Australians still need and deserve the choice that RSAs are going to bring. The third issue that they address is the number of accounts. Given that now some 34 per cent of the work force is working part time and are increasingly mobile, many employees find that they end up with small amounts in multiple superannuation funds, each one eroding the balance with fees and charges, essentially feeding the industry and providing the employee with little if any retirement savings. Whilst RSAs deal with this problem and allow a permanent alternative payment, but portable, savings vehicle, without changing awards to allow the alternative payment into an RSA the problem may well persist. In this regard, I am interested to know whether the opposition and unions in particular will encourage changes to awards which recognise RSAs. Given the interest that unions have in award nominated funds, I will not hold my breath. To be fair, though, I think we might anticipate reluctance on the part of some employers to contribute to a range of RSAs rather than a single industry fund due to the associated administrative costs that might be incurred. RSAs will offer lower returns. I think people need to be honest about that. I do not think the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or anybody else has ever denied this would be the case. But, in making these points, you do not want to downplay unreasonably the importance of RSAs and you do not want to create a market expectation which the banks then find very easy to fulfil. The fact is that they will offer lower returns than conventional superannuation funds, which reflects the capital guaranteed nature of RSAs where the amount that is invested cannot be reduced due to negative investment returns. However, I think this is going to be more than offset by having multiple accounts containing small sums which are eroded by fees and charges. Although some, including the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia-which is not surprising-have called for a limit on what can be kept in an RSA, given that the lower rate of return would diminish the amount available for retirement, the government has instead chosen a requirement that RSA providers inform holders of their investment options when the limit is reached. In other words, let the contributor make a choice themselves-hopefully an informed one. Whilst the member for Holt and the Consumers Association quite rightly have made the point about reduced capital growth in an RSA, I have no doubt that ASFA will be out there vigorously reminding the RSA market and contributors of the greater benefits and returns that they would have in putting their funds into a typical superannuation fund. Given the nature of my electorate, many of my constituents will find RSAs attractive for another reason. Those are the people nearing retirement age who are understandably anxious to see that their savings are placed nice safe place where there is minimal erosion. The low risk capital guaranteed nature of RSAs presents an attractive alternative to the possibility of negative investment returns from a conventional superannuation fundanother reason for prescribing a limit to the balances on an RSA. However, such security should not be confused with a guarantee that the money cannot be lost. If for some reason the financial institution faces difficulties-as unlikely as that might be-and is forced into liquidation, the funds in an RSA cannot be guaranteed. One of the things that we will need to do as a government-and I think vigorously-is, coming back to the member for Holt's comments, to facilitate education in the community to an understanding of the difference between a capital guarantee and an absolute guarantee. This especially applies to those close to retirement seeking to park their superannuation savings. Capital guarantee means that the balance of the account cannot be reduced through negative interest or negative investment returns or any reduction in the value of assets in which the policy is invested. Of particular interest in the legislation to contributors is clause IS of the bill, which states that an RSA must provide one or more of the benefits that are listed in the clause. It states: The benefits ... are benefits for the holder of the RSA on or after one of, or the earlier of, the following: (a) the holder's retirement ... (b) the holder's attainment of an age not less than the age specified in the regulations; (3) The benefits ... on or after the holder's death, if: (a) the death occurred before: (i) the holder's retirement ... or (ii) the holder attained the age prescribed ... and (b) the benefits are provided to the holder's legal personal representative, to any or all of the holder's dependants, or to both. Where one or more of those benefits is provided, the RSA may also provide one or more of the following: firstly, benefits for the in a holder on termination of employment where the employer or an associate of the employer contributed to the RSA, which, of course is portability; and, secondly, benefits for the holder where the holder ceases work on account of ill health. Employees will also be able to transfer the money out of a RSA at any time-and that is another thing to which people are particularly attracted-although RSA providers may require notice of not more than 12 months to minimise liquidity risks. RSAs present a particularly attractive option for women who frequently have, for obvious reasons, interrupted working lives and need a flexible, low cost and easily accessible product. They are also attractive to small businesses which can open a RSA on behalf of employees. I come back to the comments of the member for Holt when he was talking about employers opening retirement savings accounts. I do not know how much time he spends talking to people in small business, but this is one of the extra burdens that people have who are in small businesses, employing only a small number of employees and struggling to stay afloat. To increase the ease with which an account may be opened on behalf of an employee into which compulsory superannuation contributions can be made has got to make it just a little bit easier for those people who are creating the wealth-which is then taxed, and which we then distribute to those in need. The member for Holt referred to RSA regulation. There are going to be two central components to regulation: firstly, prudential supervision for the institutional security of the RSA provider and, secondly, functional supervision for compliance with retirement income and other superannuation standards. Prudential supervision-you cannot duplicate what already exists-will naturally remain in the hands of the Reserve Bank; in the case of banks, it will be the Australian Financial Institutions Commission; and, in the case of building societies and credit unions, it will be the state supervisory authorities. Functional supervision for both RSAs and their providers will be the domain of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission which will regulate compliance and retirement income standards. The standards will ensure that not only are RSAs are maintained for genuine retirement purposes but contributors are well informed. Again, the government clearly has an interest in seeing that people are informed when they make a choice about whether they are going to put into a RSA or whether they are going to take it out. ASFA clearly have a commercial interest in seeing that people are well informed. Also, the ISC, as part of its responsibility, is going to see that the market is informed. I think the criticisms made in that regard by the member for Holt are a bit unrealistic. All of those financial institutions wishing to sell RSAs need to be approved by the ISC but the approval process creates presumption in favour of the applicants, and the applicants will be rejected by the ISC only when it can prove that the institution cannot meet retirement income standards. It remains to be seen if RSAs are the answer to Australia's bigger picture problem of an appalling savings record. They are not intended to be. Some people who have spoken favourably in the press about RSAs have said that it might contribute to our big savings record, and so on. When you consider the millions of dollars left unclaimed in superannuation funds and the benefits that RSAs will provide in giving people portability when they move from job to job and so on, I do not know whether that is necessarily going to be the case, despite what will be their undoubted popularity. Critics will argue that, if too much is saved in lower earning capital guaranteed accounts, they are missing out on capital growth needed for retirement. Provided contributors are educated of the desirability of transferring out into a superannuation fund once they have accumulated several thousand dollars, I think we should be all right. The real issues in national savings, apart from the significant contribution that public savings make, are beyond whatever impact RSAs may have, which, as I say, I do not think is likely to be all that significant. Selfevident also is what I expect will be an aggressive marketing campaign from the superannuation industry to encourage",52
56,Mr KERR,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,What about from the banks?,55
57,Dr NELSON,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"Of course the banks will be marketing the RSAs-we hope the banks will be marketing RSAs-because the people to whom RSAs are going to appeal, as I have said, are going to be low income people, people who are moving from one job to the next and people who have several thousand dollars in superannuation who, frankly, are disillusioned with the performance of many superannuation funds. And then you will have the superannuation industry aggressively marketing itself that, once you get to a certain level in particular, you are certainly better off in a superannuation fund. To go to the comments made by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), it could be argued that with RSAs the banks will take on smaller amounts, by definition, of retirement savings, and that will give them entry to a market providing a steady stream of capital that can be on-lent, and the cross-selling of products. As the market settles, you would expect that most contributors, whether it is at about $10,000 or shortly before that, would transfer out into a superannuation fund. But, if you think about it, the superannuation funds themselves are going to be saved quite a bit in not having to manage small amounts of money. Whilst contributors are understandably aggrieved at the charges and costs that erode small balances, one would think in this new competitive market the funds are .not actu-lly going to have the cost of managmg multIple small amounts. So let us just see over the next couple of years where the market settles. The member for Holt was referring to the Australian Consumers Association analysis of three workers-Tom, Sally and John. I agree with his comments, but he also needs to remember-and this is what this bill is all about-about Jill or John. Someone might have three part-time jobs-there are many people in Australia who are working this way who are struggling to survive-which change about eight times over a five-year perioLl. At the moment, many of those people under 'he superannuation guarantee provisions will have multiple small amounts in multiple small funds. We have to listen to these people, and what they want is one place in which those small amounts accumulate and which they can carry from one job to the next. That has te> he in the interests of working people. The member for Holt started with a most objectionable comment about the coalition introducing and supporting this initiative because of what he sees as some sort of financial relationship between the Liberal Party and banks. I have to tell the member for Holt and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when I attended a meeting with senior executives of a major bank in Melbourne sev-ral months ago the opening remarks of a servmg mem-er of the opposition Labor Party to the chIef executive of a major Australian bank were, 'Why didn't you give us more money during the election campaign?' Who, I ask, is preoccupied with the potential donations that may be made by financial institutions? The member for Holt raised the issue of death and disability cover. How far should governments go to look after people? Do we really have to spoon-feed people from the cradle to the grave? Whilst I recognise the benefits of death and life cover associated with superannuation funds, let us give people a choice. He also referred to the solace that this gives to banks. Let's just see what the Wallis inquiry delivers. The Wallis inquiry may not deliver that much solace to banks and we may find in a year or two that the insurance companies will be providing many of the banking services that banks currently provide; and with RSAs, of course, we - ill see banks providing some superannuatIOn services to especially low income people, who are really going to benefit most from this.",55
58,Mr KERR,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"I am intrigued that the government has commen?ed itself for bringing forward a measure which, whilst failing to address the deficiencies that it asserts exist within the current superannuation system, proposes a new mechanism of superannuation savings which is a guaranteed lemon. To be proud of putting onto the market something that should he labelled, as cigarettes are, 'Warning: this product is like,. to be dangerous to your wealth,' and then to say that the product ought to be welcomed. by the electorate as providing a greater chOIce, seems to me to be the greatest mark of selfdeception that one can imagine. Let us take some of the points that have been raised in this debate. There is the assertion that existing superannuation funds do not provide an adequate basis for small accounts because they get eroded. That might once have been an adequate criticism of the system but in 1994 the former government bro-ght forward a series of measures whi-h were designed so that small accounts-that IS, accounts under $1 ,OOO-would not be eroded by fees and charges. If the current government thinks that was an insufficiently high benchmark, as suggested by the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), then a more appropriate measure would have been to increase that level-not to put onto the market a product which will be aggressively marketed by the banks to those in the community who are probably least well versed on how to assess their own financial advantages. It will be aggressively marketed in the retail sector by the banks. They will be offering a product which, on the government's own admission, is substantially defective and which will produce fewer returns than they ought to be able to receive elsewhere in the industry. Let us look at some of the other points that are being advanced in relation to the benefits alleged in this product. It is said that these funds are a useful vehicle for the elderly to park their sums of money in before they retire. The elderly, by nature, are extremely cautious. When people are in their advanced years, they tend to act on a precautionary principle. I think anyone who has dealings with their elderly family knows how extremely frightened they are about volatility. The banks and the other financial institutions that will offer these products will promote their superficial attractions and advertise the availability of a capital guaranteed product. They will trade on what this government has said; that is, this is a simple, low cost, low risk product. The banks will feed off this rhetoric. The banks will go to those people, who could earn substantially greater rates of return in existing capital guaranteed products within the superannuation industry, and they will attract substantial numbers of accounts. It not just be the piddling amounts of $1 or $2 that we are talking about from the occasional person in the part-time industries, the banks will be out there ruthlessly marketing this scheme to the elderly, who naturally want a low risk product. They will be saying, 'We are part of the big institutional system. The banks that you have always relied on are safe. Put your money into our low risk, low cost product. Save your large nest egg in this manner. We'll look after you.' What they will not disclose is that, as well as being low it is low return-low and inadequate benefit. What I think we will find is that the same kind of issue will emerge here as emerges in a whole range of areas where we proceed on the basis of so-called greater choice. Knowing that the products will be marketed to people who are not in a position to exercise fine judgment about rates of returns and may not read prospectuses closely-the sorts of people who are going to be making these judgments will be people in and out of the part-time work force or the elderly, who are looking for a simple, safe product before their retirement-the banks will be out there aggressively selling these products. They will be aggressively selling low return, financially unsound products with this government's imprimatur. 'Yes, it is true,' you will say, 'that in so doing they must be provided with information enabling them to exercise certain choice.' If you provide people with a plethora of small print explanation, which will inevitably be the case, you do not necessarily promote wise decision making. The factors that will influence people to make these decisions will be the sorts of factors that will influence people in the marketplace generally. It is the glossy quick advertising: it is a simple, safe, low risk product. Banks provide it. It is something that seems pretty straightforward. It is part of the known universe to most people. They will be attracted to it, notwithstanding that there are existing better products available for themproducts which offer greater rates of return with no greater risk. I will pick up on a point that the member for Bradfield made. He said that we have to make a distinction between capital guaranteed will products and absolute guaranteed products, but that distinction is not being made by this government. What is actually being put forward as a sotto voce message is that these products are absolutely guaranteed and that they cannot fail. That is not the truth, and the member for Bradfield accurately put his finger on that point. People may well find themselves in a situation where a financial institution makes bad investments and they lose their lifetime savings. There they will be-having invested risk, in a product which has been marketed with this government's endorsement basically as a risk free investment-with no recourse. Much of this debate reminds me of the famous exchange between a judge and F.E. Smith, later Lord Chancellor of England. After a long exchange, the judge said, 'Well, I've heard what you have to say, but I am none the wiser.' F.E. Smith said, 'None wiser, Your Honour, but certainly better informed.' Regrettably, providing a lot of information to consumers who are not well positioned to understand that information leave them better informed but hardly better able to make a good choice, to exercise will wisdom. So here is the failure in this whole system. It is being marketed at a retail level to people lacking sophistication, people who are in the category of society who we know are most likely to plump for the safe decision, even it involves low rates of return. What alternatives could have been pursued by this government? They certainly could have allowed for the development of greater portability between existing schemes. That would have been one option. People could then take advantage of placing all of their resources in funds which would actually achieve higher rates of return with the same level of security that they propose now. would actually give people better life choices and better life chances for their investments. If they felt that the existing $1,000 level for small accounts was inadequate, they could have increased that. If they thought that there needs to be greater competition and choice and yet they still wanted to bring in a product, they could have given existing superannuation funds the opportunity to compete. But, no. What this really represents is an ideological attack on the provision of superanwe nuation through the systems that have been established in the past. It delivers to the banking system-which was a very financial contributor to the coalition side of politics the last election-a product which will, no doubt, increase their bottom line but will increase the bottom line of those who invest in such a scheme. Mr Miles-It is better than what they have.",56
59,Mr KERR,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"It is not better than what they have. There is the voice of a parliamentary secretary-the rhetoric that was seized on the banks. You can simply look at what the Australian Consumers Association has said. They make the point, clearly and decisively, that people who put their money into these the schemes are buying a lemon. It should be marked: 'This product is dangerous to your wealth'. This is a product which this government is marketing. The Parliamentary Secremay tary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), sitting at the table, says that people be better off. The banks will be retailing that message, but the truth is quite the opposite. The government has taken great pride in putting into the marketplace a product which if is markedly inferior to those which currently exist. At the same time, it is acting in a way which is undermining the credibility of the existing superannuation system and driving people out of it. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Whatever might have been the intentions of the government in proposing a surcharge on higher income earners, what we are seeing now-as the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr It Gareth Evans), so rightly pointed out-is a system which will carve away at the simplicity of the existing superannuation system, which will make it less attractive. In the view of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, it will lead to 75 per cent of all accountants advising their clients to reviewRSA that is, to move out of-superannuation. We already have a government that clearly, by the way in which it is dealing with it, seems to be driven not by an appreciation that need to put in place a simple, effective national system of superannuation-building on the strengths that the previous government left in place, improving that and maintaining at a commitment forward so that there will be increasing contributions, both by employers not and by employees, and sustaining it into the future. Instead, what the government is seeking to do is to undermine confidence in that existing system; to attack the legitimacy of the industry funds that exist; to bring a new second-rate player into the system through the banking institutions, which will offer an by inferior product; and to erode the commitments they made at the last election for the mutual contributions through employers and for the matching funds through government. This is a recipe leading to disaster. This is a recipe leading to a decline in national savings, to a want of confidence in the superannuation scheme generally. There is a failure to appreciate that what we need more than anything else in this area is a sense of consistency. People will then have confidence that the long-term structural investments they make for their future will not be changed, manipulated or destroyed by successive twists and turns of government policy. It is not the opposition that is speaking alone on these issues. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is making these points, so too is the Association of Superannuation Funds and writer after writer in the quality press. Today in the Canberra Times, national affairs reporter Mike Taylor said: The problem with the Government's proposed approach to superannuation is that it stands to be highly disruptive to the retirement plans and calculations of individuals ... Of course it is. What could be more calculated to destroy the fundamental confidence that Australians have when they ought to be looking for long-term self-interested planning for their retirement? To feel that the government will meddle from time to time in ways which increase complexity, reduce returns, destroy the effectiveness of the superannuation system and put new products onto the market which, under any measure, do not stand up to the test of whether they are adequate and cost effective for those who take them up. What we now face will be an extraordinarily complicated system. This bill is supposed to bring a simple product onto the market, but it does it under an act which is made up of many hundreds of provisions and which is complex in its detail. The government is also proposing many amendments, which it certainly has not given the opposition adequate time to evaluate. Some of those amendments, for example, go to the question of funds that are deposited by employers. Under existing law, if somebody makes a payment for your benefit at common law there is a constructive trust. If I make an investment on your behalf, the law requires that investment to be dealt with as a trust. With these amendments the government is seeking to abridge that legal obligation so that if an employer places money belonging to an employee in an RSA, it is saying, 'We'll ignore our trust responsibilities. We'll bring down regulations that will govern the relationship there, not trust relationships.' We haven't any idea what those regulations will be. If the regulations are inadequate, then the protections that would normally exist under common law or-if it was going into a superannuation fund as exists currentlyunder the trust deed, would be entirely unavailable. So we are being asked to sign a blank cheque in terms of how people can deal with other people's money. This is an extraordinary legal proposition. This government is asking us as a parliament to say that one person can deposit money belonging to another person into an account without any trust obligations and without detailing to this House what the alternative financial regulatory scheme will be. There is no doubt that this kind of tinkering is driven by ideology and by a desire to repay those who substantially supported the election of this government through financial donations during the last election. The disclosures under the electoral system make it plain that the coalition benefited substantially from donations from these financial institutions, and to a far greater degree than the current opposition. This is a repayment. The banks will be able to market, to those least well versed to make sound choices, a product which the government will describe as safe and simple, but which offers less adequate rates of return than available products. People will be drawn into these products. If they stay in these products, their lifetime investments will be substantially less valuable than for those who invest in better products which are currently available. The government is not trying to improve the schemes that exist. It is not allowing those who are superannuation trustees presently to offer similar products to compete. What the government is saying to the banks is, 'Go ahead, do what you used to do with the elderly. Offer no rate of return accounts, zero interest rate accounts, bad investment accounts, market them, take advantage of the gullibility of people who do not have the wisdom and the background to make an informed decision and who fear change. Go out and market them, milk them for all you can, but don't let anybody compete with you.' These products should have big health warnings on them, like cigarette packets, which say, 'These products are dangerous to your wealth.' For the government to be advancing them is a mark of the contempt in which it holds the Australian taxpayers.",58
60,Mr TUCKEY,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"O'Connor) (1.45 p.m.)The member for Denison (Mr Kerr) worked pretty hard on portraying his left-wing background when he spent most of his speech telling us that people cannot be trusted with their own money. The reality of his suggestion is that people are so foolish in this day and age, even though newspapers and the media are full of advice on financial management, that they are going to rush off and buy a lemon simply because the bank puts an advertisement in the paper. I have an entirely different view. I welcome the retirement savings legislation, which I have supported since it was first proposed by David Connolly in our party room some years ago. My reasons are simple. Firstly, it opens up further opportunities and greater diversity for people's retirement savings. As has been explained by other speakers, this has proved to be essential. The parliamentary record will show that, some five or six years ago, I was one of the first members of this House, if not the first, to bring to the attention of the parliament how at that stage the award type superannuation schemes were totally inadequate for people such as shearers and others in itinerant work. I detailed specific examples which were brought to my attention by my constituents. Those examples showed the problems that existed with most of those accounts. Because of the itinerant nature of the work and the fact life. that, during their working year, those people were forced to contribute to different award type superannuation schemes as they transferred from being a shearer to, for instance, a truck driver at certain seasons of the year, most of the net balances of their accounts at that point in time-years before the SGC became a reality-were less than the employer contribution and were disappearing before their eyes. On another occasion I had brought to my attention the case of a girl who had regular employment for nine months of the year in three different jobs. She had the same job for three months for each of those three months of the year, and she had three separate superannuation arrangements. The previous government's solution was to say, 'You can send the money to the Taxation Office.' I have never been able work out how that worked. People in that sort of environment need a capital guaranteed product. They need to know that the money that is contributed will stay there and will go through the simple process of accumulating, if nothing else, interest. Presumably in the competitive environment the banks will know that if they start applying any management fees to these accounts people will very smartly wake up, because the other fact of life is that they will have daily access to the balance in those accounts simply by making a phone call. They offer to the consumer a very good further option to the superannuation guarantee products that have been available so far. For people who have regular employment and who are not roped into one of the schemes conducted by various trade unions, we have set about giving them some rights over their money. They have the opportunity to change to another arrangement if they believe their interests would be better served. The second aspect of all this, and an area on which I have also been on the record over the years, is my grave concern that as a government we have been cranking up a situation of forcing people's savings into a very narrow investment area. This is not a criticism of funds managers. It is a fact of Managers of big funds do not set up branch offices to lend, for instance, $100,000 to a small business. In any direct sense, there are not a lot of them involved in home lending, although some have become involved. The reality is that they operate in the high, big volume end of the market. They deal on the stock exchange; they deal in the futures market; and they play the money markets around the world. They are investors at that end. There is nothing wrong with that, except that we have actually set out with the SGC to achieve a situation where many people are abandoning their old practices with the savings bank account, on which many of the older members of this House were raised, and have said, 'I do not need to have those sorts of savings any more because I have my superannuation guarantee money going somewhere.' The problem, therefore, is that that has represented an erosion of the funds entering the banking system to be on-lent to those who set out in our community to borrow money and build something, be it a business or a home or whatever. This particular proposal puts that situation back in some balance. It creates an opportunity for banks to compete for savings which they will on-lend to an entirely different market from what a superannuation fund manager would do. I think that is extremely important. I also think we should look at some of the investment practices involved by banks and, for instance, funds managers. I am also on the record here as pointing out my grave concerns as to how those who invest regularly in the share market make their profits. It is a pretty simple process; just keep cranking up the price of the shares you hold already. When you can deal on the market in billions and you hold, for example, a very large portfolio of BHP shares, if it is getting towards the end of the financial year and you are a bit dissatisfied with the returns you are going to declare, there is nothing to stop you going into the market and bidding up the price of BHP shares and revaluing everyone in your portfolio. All of a sudden you declare wonderful returns. I am afraid that incentive is there for operators in that marketplace, and it is best described as 'funny money'. There is a thing about the share market known as the price earnings ratio, that is, the price of the shares relative to their earnings. One would think that a price earnings ratio of 12, which equates to an eight per cent earning rate, would be as high as the market should ever go. Yet, of course, in America today we read of transactions where that price earnings ratio is as high as 20 and 30, meaning the sale has gone through at a three per cent earning ratio. This puts to bed a little the arguments put by the member for Denison. The reality is that he wanted to paint us a picture that if they put it in the bank, they could not earn money and, of course, if they put it in funds management, they could. There are a few people in this House who got letters from their superannuation companies a few years ago notifying them of a massive erosion in their superannuation reserves simply because those speculators in some of these marketplaces-which is what the big funds rely onhad got it wrong on the bond market and they had lost a packet. Again, it is occurring at that funny money end of the market, the derivatives. I find derivatives a rather remarkable situation. Take futures as an example. Futures were brought in originally for a very proper purpose. For example, in the wool industry when a wool grower had to meet certain financial commitments at a particular time of the year, about shearing time, he would sell a contract on the futures market to guarantee a certain price for his wool. He knew very well when he did that you that the market price at that time might be higher or lower than the price that he accepted when he took out his contract. That was not the point. The point of the contract was to have enough money at that time to meet his financial commitment, and he took the risk on the price. At the same time, out there in the real world was a manufacturer who had a contract to provide uniforms to the army who wanted to fix the price of the wool that was going into that product, and it suited him for that reason to buy that farmer's contract. That was a very proper activity. However, these people who handle these huge sums of money found that that was also a wonderful opportunity gamble, to pit their skills against the marketsituation! place. The other two people were not gambling, they were taking astute business sions. Of course, those are the markets that these big investors play to deliver these wonderful dividends that the member for Denison wants to tell us every pensioner is going to get, provided their current SGC goes into superanfact, nuation fund management. There is no guarbecause antee of that and there is quite recent evithey dence that it does not work that way. This is not about taking away from the super funds. If they are doing a good job there will be plenty of people wanting to that option. It is all about granting another option to people seeking alternatives for retirement income. It is a system that allows people in itinerant and part-time work to identify a fund that will at least stand still. It gives women a great opportunity when they leave the work force for family reasons but with plans to rejoin it at a later date know that when they rejoin, the management fees of the funds that they had previously contributed to have not caused their previous savings to be eroded. It gives them an opporare tunity to put their savings on hold and, consequently, they can come back into the workthe place some years later and start building that amount of money again. They are all good reasons. That is why parliament should support this proposal. As I have said, that is as far as the consumer goes. The member for Denison tells us that the consumer organisations do not like it. Unfortunately, like so many other things in our nation today, very often good people start off worthy organisations but there is always a political fringe that wants to infiltrate I am afraid that a lot of consumer organisamisfortune, tions today, just by their rhetoric, do not the consumers' interests at heart but see it a platform. I was astounded the other day to hear consumer advocate in America telling us that they would not buy our beef if we did not government meat inspectors, and then we discovered that he was a meat inspector. He had got himself to the top of this so-called to consumer organisation. What an outrageous The reality is that people are not silly. The decimarket today, through the media, provides massive amounts of financial advice on where the good deals are. It is almost part of the regular nightly news. People can get that information and they can make judgments, but for many people there has been no choice. In their only choice has been a bad choice they could not get the sort of funding needed due to their style of employment and their entire superannuation savings were eroded. This particular proposal reverses that. It take gives people an opportunity. But, more importantly, it directs some of our national their savings to the banking industry which, of course, is the lender to small business and is the lender to many people who cannot get the same accommodation from the superannuation funds management. That particular point must be understood. It might be that out of all this to we get a situation where there is less money for speculation and more money for genuine investment in factories, buildings, machinery and all the things that banks finance which so necessary for our economic growth.",60

62,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Would you agree that, while one mistake in the mid-year review figures them. might be regarded as a mere clerical 170 begin to look like carelesshave ness? Why did you and the Minister for as Finance try to sneak these corrections into the public domain, not tabling them in either a House, not giving them to the press in the hope that no-one would notice, rather than use honestly and openly explaining what went wrong and the significance of the errors? What are the implications of the further $1.2 billion blow-out in the general government deficit bottom line? Does it involve blow-outs in the non-budget sector for which the budget sector will at some stage have to pick up the tab? How do you now explain to the OECD and other international agencies who rely on the accuracy of these figures that the Australian government is not just a bunch of incompetent hicks, particularly after last year's Greenspan debacle?",62
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The international community knows that the Australian government is not a bunch of international hicks, because Labor was voted out on 2 March last year. They know it. They know you are no longer in government. We hear the shadow Treasurer ask these questions, but whether he knows it or not-I do not know, but let me explain it to him-his government never published a mid-year review, ever. Never published an underlying balance. Never. Never published general government aggregates of underlying balance. Never. Never published general government underlying balance for forward years, ever. Never been done before and he self-righteously stands up here and says, 'You know, Mr Speaker, those things that we never used to publish, they are so important now that these are the talking matter of the international community.'

65,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Point of order. My point of order goes to relevance. The question of relevance is that a specific series of questions were asked about how he came to make that mistake. What he is trying to do is to make an excuse about the fact that he had 170 errors in his one effort at getting this piece information out. He should answer the questions on that.,63
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer is using analogies with some relevance.,63
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was about the international effects of this, a matter which I answered immediately. I will come to more technical detail in a moment but, before I do so, Mr Speaker, just to indicate to you how unctuous the performance of the Leader of the Opposition is, the mid-year review published by the Labor Party last year it said this: The mid-year review of the budget indicates a surplus of $115 million compared with a projected surplus of $718 million. That was the biggest lie of Australian economic history.",63

Mr Reith-On the point of order: it beggars belief for the Leader of the Opposition to raise a point of relevance. They asked a question which was basically a speech. Under the standing orders and the interpretation of them by Speakers for 13 years, there is absolutely no question whatsoever that the Treasurer is entirely relevant within the standing orders.

Colston, Senator",65
97,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to to the Minister for Administrative Services. Can the minister inform the House whether there is any substance to the allegations against Senator Colston?,65
98,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The House would be aware that I called for a report on the allegations from my department. I received that report a little earlier today. The report informs me that it is not able to conclude that Senator Colston has breached his entitlements. There may be irregularities in the use of Comcar in Canberra and his use of hire cars under his charter entitlement but a more detailed examination is needed. This requires time, possible access to records external to the department and the senator's explanation of individual prima facie departures from the entitlement. I have therefore instructed my department to continue its examinations of the records. In the meantime, Senator Colston must be accorded a presumption of innocence. This government has made it absolutely clear, and I will repeat, that we will not give any comfort to anyone who we find has abused their entitlements, and we have no change from that position. I must also say that we are not going to be driven by media hype or the desire for vengeance from members of the relation to loans new Labor Party. Social Welfare",65
99,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in a study by the Ipswich Regional Family Resource Centre titled Australia's Working Class Poor released today, in five case studies of working class Australians in almost every case of those studied who were working these people would end up with more net disposable income if they gave up work and went onto the dole. In fact, the people with the highest net disposable incomes of those studied were a single mother with three children and a 46-year-old immigrant who has worked a total of only two years in his whole life. The worse case is a working Australian battler trying to buy his own home and whose net disposable income is minus $1,309 per annum.",65
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are not going to debate the issue. I want you to address your question.  is your government going to stop continuing down Labor's totally discredited economic rationalist path and start to do something about returning the incentive to work for ordinary Australians with a decent day's pay for a decent day's work?,66
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not had the opportunity of reading the report to which the honourable member for Oxley referred. I would, however, take the opportunity of saying one or two things about the concepts she canvassed in her question. The first thing I would say is that this government believes very strongly in the concept that our society is one built on the notion of mutual obligation. That is, we as a society have an obligation-those of us who are in work; those of us who are more fortunate-to provide a decent standard of living, a decent safety for those in the community who are less fortunate. That is an absolute principle of the Party. way in which my government will always approach social policy. I make no apology for that. I am very proud of the fact that the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia through the years have pioneered many contributions to the safety net that Australians now properly expect of whatever government is in power. That will remain one of the proudest boasts of the Liberal Party of Australia, which I am honoured to lead. The other side of the doctrine of mutual obligation is that those in the community who receive support from the rest of society reasonably can be asked, in appropriate and fair circumstances, to give something in return for that support that is provided. That, of course, was the principle that underlay the work for the dole concept that I announced a couple of weeks ago. One of the reasons we announced the work for the dole approach was, in a reasonable fashion-not an unreasonable fashion-to address the possibility that there may be some disincentives in the present system. We, of course, had other and more compelling reasons for announcing it. Those other and more compelling reasons went to our desire to ensure that people did not remain for long periods of time on unemployment benefits. We think it is destructive of the human spirit to be out of work indefinitely. We think it is destructive of the human spirit to grow up in an environment where your parents and perhaps your grandparents have been unemployed. We think it is desirable for the government of this country to approach, in a multi-faceted way, policies designed to ensure that people do not sink into a lifetime of unemployment, do not sink into an attitude of indifference towards work. There is no one simple answer to that. I would say to the member for Oxley and I would say to all of the people of Australia that there is no one simple answer to that. You do not achieve that by slashing the dole. Equally, you do not achieve it by adopting the attitude that it is wrong to ask people to do net, something in return for the dole, which is apparently the attitude of the Australian Labor The fact is that the only people in Australia who are now against the dole are the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. They are the only people. They don't believe in the doctrine of mutual obligation. They really don't. They had 13 years to demonstrate their commitment, and I will",66
102,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",66
103,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Ah!,66
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat.,66
105,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,66
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right!,66
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order goes to relevance. Is it relevant to discuss the question of mutual obligation-an exchange of benefits and work or training as an alternative-when that was precisely the theory which underlay Working Nation-precisely.,66
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,67
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition, by his conduct at question time today, really illustrates why George Campbell had this to say on the Four Corners program last Monday: I don't think the party knows or has a clear perception of what it stands for or, more importantly, what it wants to achieve in terms of the development of our society. That is George Campbell, who has been guaranteed a place in the Senate for the state of New South Wales next year in the interests of the Australian Labor Party----or is it New Labor or Old Labor or Forelock Tugging Labor? I don't know. I finally say to the member for Oxley: I invite her, when she is discussing these matters with her constituents, to tell the constituents of Oxley that the parties in Australia that stand for the doctrine of mutual obligation in Australian society are the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia. The Labor Party is root and branch opposed to it. Private Health Insurance",67
110,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Prime Minister. Does the government intend to deliver on the election promise to older Australians and to families to provide assistance for those who take out their own health insurance? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the benefits of the new government incentives in private health insurance?,67
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased to inform the House that the government has every intention of fulfilling the election commitment to deliver tax rebates to Australians who take out private health insurance. I want all of those Australian families who are looking forward to that tax rebate to understand in very clear terms that the Liberal and National parties of Australia stand unqualifiedly in favour of delivering tax assistance and tax incentives to those in the Australian community who take out private health insurance. In the process, I might remind those same Australian families that for 13 years the Labor Party refused to do anything about the problem of the haemorrhaging of Australia's private health insurance system. They refused to do anything about it, despite the warnings of Graham Richardson in 1993 that once you fell below 40 per cent you were really in trouble, that once you fell below 40 per cent you lost the critical mass that was required to keep the private health insurance system together. Despite all of that, Paul Keating and the now Leader of the Opposition were able to roll Graham Richardson and say, 'No, we will not allow you to introduce private health insurance incentives.' That is why last week the New South Wales Labor premier acknowledged the argument that the coalition has put when he said that the system is being swamped by the demands on it of people who dropped out of private health cover. I was also interested, in daily browsings through the Hansards of the parliaments of Australia, to come across a very interesting comment made in the Victorian parliament on 11 September 1996. The comment read as follows: One of the areas the federal government has had to address is the obviously increasing pressure on public hospitals. That pressure has risen for a number of reasons. One is our ageing population. The second reason is the number of people who have been leaving the private health system simply because they cannot afford it. Therefore the federal government has tried to introduce a system that will, firstly, reduce the flow of people leaving the health funds and, secondly, encourage people back into private health insurance. That is something that is long overdue. If it had been done by the previous federal Labor government, both Victoria and New South Wales would not be in the positions they are in today. The speaker then went on to say what a terrific idea it was for the federal government to introduce taxation rebate. I find it interesting that those were the words of the Victorian Premier-the same Victorian Premier who yesterday said that it was a silly idea. Let me simply say this to the Australian people: I thought the Victorian Premier was right on 11 September. I think the federal government is right. I want to say to the Victorian Premier and to everybody on that side of the House that, out there in the living rooms of Australia, the Australian families want the tax incentive that is worth $500 million on 1 July. The people who are going to deliver tax breaks to middle income Australian families for their private health insurance arrangements are the members of the Howard-Fischer government and I am proud to say that that commitment will be delivered without subtraction, in full, on time, on 1 July. Department of Finance",67
112,Mr DARGA VEL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. I ask him whether it was the savage staff cuts in his department which led to the spectacular blunders in the mid-year review? Is it true that the Department of Finance is to be savagely reduced again in this year's budget? Is it true that the minister is planning to cut staff by four to five per cent this year and four to five per cent the year after? Is it true the object is to reduce Finance to a rump of 60 staff, with the loss of corporate memory, skills and staff numbers? Won't we just see more of these massive accounting errors and the complete inability of Finance to oversight the spending of other departments?",68
113,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer to all four questions-or it might have been five-is no. Australian Defence Industries,68
114,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Mr Crean-What about the art gallery, Bruce?",68
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham.,68
116,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the minister advise the House whether there has been any change in the government's attitude towards the privatisation of Australian Defence Industries?,68
117,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. He has displayed a close interest in ADI for many years. Like the previous government, we have been watching with interest the performance of Australian Defence Industries and we have noticed, with cautious optimism, that they now appear to be doing well. Indeed, the board has advised the government that its business restructuring has now put it in a position where privatisation could be a viable option. I might say that the coalition had no plans for the privatisation of ADI at the time of the last election. The Prime Minister said as much when he visited Bendigo in February last year, as did the member for Bendigo. At that time, AD! was still in the process of rationalisation of its business operations, which it set in train in 1989. There is now widespread recognition within the industry of the improved operating performance of the company. Considerable interest has developed and they have done very well. The government is not averse to such a course, as neither was the previous government. No responsible government would categorically rule out for all time the privatisation of a public enterprise like this. Labor didn't nor will we. So we agree and, therefore, it is now clear that the company is successfully transforming itself into a viable commercial entity. Accordingly, we will be looking at the optimum time for its transition into private hands and I imagine that that will be in the next year or so. Unemployment",68
118,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. How does the Prime Minister justify his claim that 11 months-and now virtually 12 months-is not sufficient time for a new government to begin to reduce unemployment, given that the last new federal government elected in Australia, the Hawke government, took only eight months to establish a clear downward trend in the double-digit unemployment which he left behind?",68
119,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will continue to make the assertion that it is the greatest exercise in presumption in Australian politics for a group of people who ran the affairs of this country for 13 years, drove unemployment to a postDepression high of over 11 per cent in the early 1990s, left us with about 8lh per cent unemployed and a youth unemployment rate of close to 30 per cent, to then, with righteous indignation, bang the dispatch box and say, 'How shocking, how outrageous. You haven't fixed it in 12 months.' I don't think the Australian people are listening to you and, as George Campbell rightly said, 'You don't know what you stand for. You don't know where you're going.' You demonstrate day after day in this place how right the judgment of the Australian people was 12 months ago this coming weekend. Rural Industry",68
120,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, as you would be aware the agricultural sector has been under extreme pressure for a number of years with low commodity prices, a string of poor seasons, declining returns on investment and, of course, Labor governments. Is the minister aware that this has led to serious challenges for farmers and rural communities alike and in no place more so than within my electorate of Parkes? Could the minister please explain what measures have been taken within his portfolio to address the challenges faced in the western division of New South Wales?",69
121,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With pleasure. The western division of New South Waleswhich, of course, the member really does know very well, because he represents most of it--covers some 42 per cent of the area of New South Wales, and there are some 1,350 pastoral enterprises there. They have experienced enormous difficulties in recent times. There is a lot that can be done by getting interest rates down and by meeting needs such as funding for drought policy. The western division is actually a prime example of a region that has specific problems relating to factors there such as it being a specialist wool-growing area and having suffered many years of drought. This government is capable of and is responding to the needs of hard-hit regions of this sort. Last week in Cobar-the member himself was present-I signed a memorandum of understanding with the New South Wales government and local land-holders to be known as 'West 2000'. Under West 2000, we will be able to do a great deal to help a very hard-hit area recover, find its feet and return itself to prosperity. It involves expenditure of $12Y2 million of federal money. Combined with the state resources, it is a total of about $17Y2 million for business management, productivity improvement, training and skills enhancement, development of alternative industries, further rural counselling, assistance for re-establishment for those that find no future for themselves and want a dignified exit path, help for environmental values, particularly in relation to the encroachment of woody weeds and rabbit management, and help, too, in the area of natural resource management. But all members will be interested in another tragedy in the western division that is evident too widely across the broader Australian community, but particularly in rural areas, and that is the problem of youth suicide. Youth suicide rates in Australia are too high; by international standards they are alarmingly high. In conjunction with the minister for health, Michael Wooldridge, last Friday I launched a pilot rural youth suicide project as part of West 2000. The first of these pilot projects-there are, I think, to be five-will be set up in Bourke, which is in the honourable member for Parkes's electorate. In Bourke, which is assessed by the ABS as being one of the most disadvantaged communities in Australia, we have a young population suffering a real loss of hope in a depressed local economy. There are real problems. A profound sense of community wide grief appears to have arisen from the closure of local businesses and the loss of jobs and income, and there are real problems with high levels of local crime. The pilot project will identify the factors involved. It will then work to rebuild the all important community networks to try to tackle the loss of hope and the loss of esteem and the loss of identify that seems to be at the heart of these problems. I am sure that all members will recognise the proportions of the tragedy and the need for us to do everything we can as a community to understand the causes, to address the causes and, where possible, to come up with community based solutions. Motor Vehicle Industry",69
122,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister, and it goes to the current situation in the car industry and the Productivity Commission hearing in Melbourne. In particular, have you, Prime Minister, seen Toyota's comments, which I quote: Toyota's stark view is that none of the local manufacturers is likely to survive if the commission's majority recommendations on post2000 arrangements are implemented. Has he also seen today's editorial in Melbourne's Herald Sun which describes Labor's new car plan as: ... leaving the Howard Cabinet with little tive other than to adopt the same position ... Prime Minister, will the government now give a definitive answer to people in the industry about its future, and adopt our position ensuring, therefore, job security for at least 250,000 Australians whose employment is either directly or indirectly dependent on a healthy car industry?",70
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about a very important Australian industry. I want to take the opportunity of telling the House that, when the final report of the Productivity Commission is received by the government, it will be addressed against a number of considerations. The first of those considerations is the absolute determination of my government to preserve a viable Australian car manufacturing industry. The idea that Australia would lose a car manufacturing industry is quite unthinkable, and I would hope that all members of the House would have that strong view. We will be conscious of the impact of any decision we take on regional areas of Australia. I am well aware of the importance of the car industry to the South Australian economy. I am also aware of the importance of the motor manufacturing industry and the automotive industry generally to other parts of Australia. I am equally seized, and I think all members of the parliament are, of the importance in these decisions of balancing regional concerns against broad national goals, including the capacity of Australia to reap in full the benefits of the globalisation of the world economy. I notice with interest that the Australian Labor Party or the new Labor Party or whatever has adopted what is represented as a new policy on this issue. I would simply say say to people who might be interested in that new policy that they told you before the 1993 election they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank. They told you before the 1990 election that they would not sell Qantas. I say to any people out there who might have a flicker of interest in what the Leader of the Opposition said in Adelaide: don't believe them. They mislead you over the Commonalternawealth Bank, they are misleading you over the car industry. Flood Works Funds",70
124,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is the minister aware of allegations by the Member for Prospect that flood relief cheques for western Sydney have gone missing? Can the minister advise whether these allegations are correct and, if not, what the true situation is? Mrs Crosio-Didn't you listen to me last night?",70
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I hope the honourable member for Prospect is listening carefully for the answer.,70
126,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the last two adjournment debates the honourable member for Prospect has made accusations that two federal government cheques to the value of $1.15 million have somehow or other gone missing. The implication that the honourable member for Prospect has made is that these two cheques were in the possession of two members of the government-one being Senator Woods and the other being the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey. I wish to quote some of the things that the honourable member for Prospect said in regard to Senator Woods and her allegation that Senator Woods had somehow or other pocketed one of these two cheques that was valued up to $1.15 million. I will quote what the honourable member for Prospect said in both of her speeches. In one of them she said: Has it been in Senator Woods's top drawer in his office, or did the fraud squad discover it? She also said: Is it a contribution to a fighting fund for his legal expenses? This is a very serious accusation. In my years here in the House I cannot recall a member of this parliament making an accusation about another member of parliament taking a cheque from the federal government and somehow or other using it for another purpose. Mrs Crosio-Where was the money?",70
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Prospect!,71
128,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the information of the House and for the information of the honourable member for Prospect, Senator Woods has never had the cheque and has never even known of the existence of such a cheque. The allegations made by the honourable member for Prospect are totally and utterly false, untrue, unfair and totally and utterly outrageous. Senator Woods has never been in possession of that cheque or, indeed, had any knowledge of the existence of that cheque. Mr Lee-Who had the cheque?",71
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dobell! Mrs Crosio-Who had the cheques?,71
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Prospect should be listening.,71
131,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In regards to the Minister for Finance, in the time-honoured practice followed by the previous Labor government and other governments-indeed, by state governments as well-the local relevant government member was notified of the cheque. In this case the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey, was made aware of the cheque. He notified the local council responsible-that is, the Campbelltown City Council. He phoned them straight away and told them of the existence of the cheque and subsequently mailed the cheque to the Department of Land and Water Conservation. In both cases the accusations made by the honourable member for Prospect are totally false. Not only are they totally false but they are totally and utterly outrageous. Mrs Crosio-When were the cheques drawn?",71
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Prospect!,71
133,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I believe, and I am sure members on this side of the House would believe, that accusations that are as serious as this-accusations that are completely and utterly false and without any foundation to truth-should be followed by an apology from the honourable member for Prospect to both people involved. Sugar Industry",71
134,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. The minister would recall that his recent Trade outcome and objectives statement' includes as key priorities the need to reduce barriers to Australia's sugar exports to China, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the United States, which make up over 50 per cent of our sugar export destinations. The minister would, presumably, be aware that Australia's Uruguay Round obligation is to reduce sugar tariffs to $70 per tonne by the year 2000, already comfortably met by the current tariff of $55 per tonne, effective to July of this year. In light of Australia's aim in its November 1996 APEC individual action plan to further review Australia's sugar tariff and decide on that review this month, is the minister able to advise the House of the government's decision in respect of the sugar tariff?",71
135,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Perth raises matters which are currently before the government and undergoing due process by the federal government. The Queensland government has previously dealt with the report of the Vaughan committee-the committee which reviewed the sugar industryand reached a conclusion that they found themselves in support of the recommendations of the Vaughan committee report. The federal government, for its tum, is now part heard on these matters. In due course a comprehensive announcement will be made by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The sugar industry is one of our great export industries. I recognise that it is a very un level playing field but there is a clear way forward, which is emerging and which the industry has put forward as something they want with regard to the future of their industry. I conclude on a bright note: the sugar price is currently up. Y outb Suicide",71
136,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would like to address a question to the Minister for Family Services. Mr Griffin-She won't answer any of ours.,72
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bruce!,72
138,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would be happy to ask you anything, my friend, but I would not give you an answer though. Yesterday morning when the cleaners came to a building in this city a young man's body was found. He had taken his own life. Next to motor vehicle and motorcycle accidents, youth suicide is tragically the highest cause of death of young people in Australia, particularly of young men and Aboriginals. Unemployment, emotional distress, drugs and alcoholism are among the causes. I would like to ask the minister: is there a coordinated national policy to identify the causes of youth suicide? In particular, are there any steps now under way to develop a strategy both to provide some relief for those who feel that emotional pressure and to see whether there can be coordinated measures taken at a state and federal level to reduce that alarming statistic?",72
139,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank my colleague the right honourable member for New England for that question. I know that it has been of particular concern to him. He is one of the members who has an electorate in rural and regional Australia where this is a particularly difficult problem. It is a fact that last year people committed suicide each day. A total of 2,367 lives were lost in the year. This figure is around 16 per cent greater than the death toll from road accidents. In fact, it is rising. Yesterday I was privileged to participate in the Wesley Mission's life force memorial service at the Opera House. It was relevant that the Reverend Bob Dunlop gave two very clear messages on that occasion. The first message was that, if we can highlight this problem, if we can engage the community and make it understand just what a problem youth suicide is in this country, then we can indeed avert the incident of suicide. An active and alert community working in concert with government will go some the way towards resolving this terrible tragedy in our communities. The second message that of the Reverend Bob Dunlop gave was that we need to support those who are left behind, those whose lives have been shattered by this event. It is in recognition of this that very shortly after we came to government last year we announced that we would put in place a number of measures to try to combat these tragic figures. Our young people deserve support and understanding, so our government's national youth suicide prevention strategy will deliver programs across the community. As the right honourable member for New England quite rightly pointed out, there are very complex reasons why people take this terrible final step--and those reasons are many. It makes it very difficult, therefore, to propose a single measure that will prevent this tragedy occurring. In recognition of that, the program we have announced and the additional funding to the existing $13 million that has been available for the· prevention of youth suicide will go towards a number of programs that will help rural and regional youth. That will provide a lifeline service and a kids help line so that our young people can ring up to get support and help. We know from the many accounts at yesterday's service that young people have been saved by being able to ring patient and wise counsellors on those lifeline and help line services. We have also implemented a program for six parents. I found from talking to a number of parents at the ceremony yesterday that they were distressed that very few programs in the past recognised their lives were shattered and that they needed help and support. Our program also includes education and training so that we can identify early the symptoms of suicide and seek to prevent it from occurring in the first place. This will be particularly directed at general practitioners and in the development of hospital protocols so that the problem can be identified early and the community can come together to try to give support and help. We have also set up an indigenous foundation in recognition of this serious problem within our Aboriginal communities, which have a much higher youth suicide rate than we in the general community have. I believe it will be through these services and with the help and assistance of the community at large that we will be able to stem the growing number of suicides in this country and to give the support to our young people and to our communities, particularly our rural communities, that they so desperatewhich ly need. Staff: Senator Colston",72
140,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister been reminded by answers given and documents tabled in the Senate this week in relation to Senator Colston's staff position that he initially refused to upgrade it in May 1996, that the President of the Senate has agreed that she did not conceive in October last year that that upgrade would be approved and the Senate stuck with the bill but that, notwithstanding that, he formally signed his approval of the upgrade in a document marked for his urgent attention on 29 November? Assisted by this new material now on the public record, can the Prime Minister now remember the circumstances clearly enough to tell the House why he changed his position and approved the upgrade as a matter of urgency just a week before the first Senate vote on the Telstra bill?",73
141,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This matter has already been fully canvassed, and I have nothing to add to what has previously been said. Local Government Funding",73
142,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Can the minister advise the House how much money is provided through his department to local government for roads and bridges? Can the minister advise how much is targeted to councils in regional Australia? Can the minister advise how this is increasing employment in regional Australia and electorates like Leichhardt?",73
143,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. Indeed, I am pleased to be able to advise the House that, under the identified local roads funding component of financial assistance grants, very significant funds have been provided for local roads and bridges. In fact, for the 1996-97 financial year, there is an amount of $372 million, 75 per cent of which is to be spent on rural and regional roads and bridges. This is of course in addition to the amount of money spent under the Commonwealth roads programabout $803 million a year-90 per cent of is spent on regional and rural roads. So the amount of Commonwealth money for those roads is over a billion dollars. The money coming from the financial assistance grants, as I have explained to the House previously, increased in this financial year by four per cent. So the amount to local governments from the Commonwealth is very significant. That does not take into account, of course, the money from the local councils' own rate bases for the maintenance, upgrading and building of local roads and bridges. In the honourable member's electorate, the electorate of Leichhardt, which takes in an enormous area, I am advised that the figure this financial year is in the vicinity of four per cent. That does not include the additional amount-in the vicinity of $15 millionwhich is untied and paid to all the local councils in his electorate. The funds for that sort of infrastructure and its continued maintenance have a profound impact on job opportunities for local contractors, companies, apprentices and all the people in those communities. Local government in regional and remote Australia know that those funds are absolutely essential, and this government has made a commitment to continuing those. Banking",73
144,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer's call to the banks regarding bank fees on the John Laws program yesterday: ... you're all out there listening. I want you all to send into me now your best fee alternative and we'll see who won and we'll advertise them on the radio. Is the Treasurer aware that not one single bank responded to his announcement? Treasurer, is that because you have absolutely no influence with the banks over bank fees? Is it because the banks are not keen on advertising these basic banking products. Or is it both? Given that the situation with bank fees is getting worse, not better, why don't you direct that formal monitoring of bank fees and charges commences without delay?",73
145,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You try to help the banks with their advertising and they won't take up the offers. I give them these opportunities on the John Laws program for free advertising and they do not take advantage of them. That is their decision. We have always taken the view on this side of the House that those financial institutions that do a good job deserve recognition. That is why Aussie Home Loans, which came into the market and induced competition reduction of margins, has always been warmly recommended and congratulated by us, as are RAMS and some of the other business institutions. I think the final part of the question was about formal monitoring. The member asked about formal monitoring, which is something that always amuses me about the Labor Party. The Labor Party jump up and down and say, 'What we need in the banking industry is formal monitoring.' Did they do it in their first year of government; their second year of government; their third year of government; their fourth year of government; their fifth year of government; their sixth year of government; their seventh year of government; their eighth year of government; their ninth year of government; their 10th year of government; their 11 th year of government; their 12th year of government; their 13th year of government? When did they discover it? When they were voted out of office.",74
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the honourable member for Hinkler. Mr Beazley interjecting Mr Costello interjecting,74
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are moving on to the next question. The Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition are not helping. Thailand,74
148,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Has the just-concluded Australia-Thai economic ministerial commission provided any concrete benefits for Australia? Will any of these benefits flow through to the Australian business sector?,74
149,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My colleague Minister Alexander Downer and I met with  Foreign Affairs from Thailand, and His Excellency Dr Narongchai over the last three days in some very successful and constructive talks which have led to a number of key breakthroughs. I signed with Minister Dr Narongchai a memorandum of understanding with respect to intellectual property which provides for Australia and Thailand to set up exchanges of personnel, technical missions, workshops and training programs, including the promotion and implementation of the TRIPS agreement to provide a stronger framework of cooperation in respect of intellectual property arrangements. The MOU should assist in protecting and enforcing those intellectual property rights which are crucial in the development of trade and investment relationships and constitute an important element for business in any foreign investment decision. On the Australian side, we also raised access issues relating to products as diverse as skim milk powder, wine, citrusparticularly the countercyclical aspects of citrus-the countercyclical aspects of mango, fresh mango production and the ability to export that to Thailand and to the rest of Asia, lupins, beef, live cattle and the automotive sector. To Thailand's credit, it has had a very unique policy with regard to the automotive sector where it has focused more particularly on being a successful automotive component manufacturer, with some success, and that reflects its approach to the global car.",74
150,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the tariff?,74
151,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has interjected. With his opportunistic effort in Adelaide two days ago, he cannot even get it right. We know Simon Crean rolled Gareth Evans. The trouble with you, Simon, is that you do not know which team you are on: are you against Gareth, or Kim, or both? I am very happy to say to the Leader of the Opposition that Australia is about boosting the PMV sector and the automotive sector generally. This year will see BTR Nylex Albury, in liaison with and under the policies being pursued by the government and Minister Moore, commence construction of the gearbox for a new car which will be assembled and built in Korea for export to world. That is what this is all about. So the economic commission meetings with Thailand were very successful and covered a wide range of issues, including quarantine issues with some progress and success as well as a comprehensive discussion in respect of ASEM and other matters in which Thailand has declared very strongly its support. Equally, Australia is committed in principle to supporting application from Thailand in the future for membership of the Indian Ocean rim. I am very glad that the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs will be at that important meeting in Mauritius in a few days time as Australia builds a focus not just on APEC and not just on Asia but also on the Indian Ocean rim initiative, one which then Minister Gareth Evans nearly blew out of the water with his conference in Perth a couple of years ago and one which we have now rectified. So, all in all, the relationship between Australia and Thailand is an exceptionally good bilateral relationship. It will see trade, investment and tourism double between now and the year 2000. Partly in relation to your question and that of the member for Perth in respect of sugar, which I know is of deep interest, exports from the electorate of the member for Wide Bay will continue to expand from Evans Deakin, Maryborough, with regard to equipment being exported to Thailand in that area. The price of sugar in March rose 18 points. Premiums for white sugar have risen substantially over the last month due to Indonesian purchases of Thai white sugar. All in all, we are about building stronger trade links with our region and with Thailand especially. China: Refugees",75
152,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Minister, I refer you to media reports which claim that you, in using your discretionary powers, granted asylum to three Chinese women known as L, C and Z who applied for refugee status on the grounds of China's one child policy. Minister, could you confirm to the House whether you have the granted permanent residence to the three women in question? If you have, can you explain the apparent inconsistency between your decision and the government's successful submission to the High Court that China's one child policy cannot form grounds for the grant of refugee status? Do you accept that the impression that the government has effectively overridden the High Court decision requires you to clarify this matter without delay? What is the Australian government's position with respect to the potentially unlimited pipeline of applicants who may wish to apply for these kinds of decisions?",75
153,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question because it gives me an opportunity to elucidate, for his information, the system which has been operating in Australia over some period of time and to help ensure that he has a proper understanding of it. JUdging by his question to me today and his comments on radio, I would have expected a better knowledge of the system of law which is in operation from somebody who has had the training he has had. Mr Gareth Evans-We can do without the patronising. Mr O'Keefe interjecting",75
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Burke. Mr O'Keefe interjecting,75
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Burke.,75
156,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I accept that this is a serious question, and I hope that the honourable member's colleagues might have something by their own behaviour and comments to add. The simple fact is that in this matter the government and its decision makers, including the Refugee Review Tribunal, must apply the refugee convention. The High Court's recent decision concerning an important aspect of that convention-namely, what constitutes a particular social group--is of course welcome. The High Court clarified that matter in the context of a case involving China's one child policy. The court determined that merely because a person is the subject of a policy does not of itself make him or her a refugee. The government obviously welcomes this decision which clarifies the law. The member for Denison has regrettably confused this High Court decision with the minister's non-compellable discretion. He has shown no understanding of the difference between the refugee decision making and the exercise of ministerial discretion. He seems to be suggesting that I intend to use my discretion to override the principle established by the High Court. That is completely wrong. My discretion is only accessible after people have exercised all other application remedies, including decisions by the Refugee Review Tribunal. In exercising the discretion, I am able to look at the range of issues that are relevant to a particular case. I note that the former immigration minister, Senator Bolkus, exercised his discretion in 179 cases.",76
157,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How many?,76
158,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,in 179 cases. These decisions are made respecting the privacy of the individuals concerned. Mr Beddall-Answer the question.,76
159,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am answering the question. I, like previous ministers, do not intend to publicly discuss the circumstances of private individuals. If you are asking me do that, let us know because it is certainly contrary to the Privacy Act, which you have supported. Ms Macklin-He is not asking that.",76
160,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That was the question that was put. The act requires information about intervention decisions to be tabled in parliament without the names of people involved. That will be done as appropriate.,76
161,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When?,76
162,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It will be done at the same time and in the same time frames that former ministers have done it. The member for Denison's public comments have been misinformed and confused. I did offer himand I do so again-a briefing on the issues if he would like to get the facts right. In relation to these matters in particular, I have received 257 letters from members and senators.",76
163,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you have only acted on Brian's.,76
164,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a letter from the honourable member for Denison which says: I thank you very much for your letter of 17 December responding to my representations on behalf ofand I will not elaborate on whose behalfI am very pleased that you are able to exercise your power under section 4 I 7, and I thank you for your compassion and your good sense in the exercise of that judgment. I have had requests from the member for Grayndler, the member for Sydney",76
165,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. If the minister is seeking to imply that the representation had any connection with China's one child policy, I would ask the minister to correct that.",76
166,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,76
167,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, what I was intending to demonstrate very clearly is that a large number of members approached me to consider exercising my discretion in individual cases. The Leader of the Opposition has approached me on two occasions and I could take you through most members. In fact, the shorter list would be those who have not to approached me on the exercise of my discretion. Let me make this point: there are precise guidelines that were laid down by the former minister as to the way in which the discretion is to be exercised. They were tabled in the parliament and were available for all members to see. The further additional factors which might be taken into account by me and which I have elaborated from time to time include family relationships, length of time in Australia, issues relating to detention, age of the client, the health and psychological or significant risk to life, other issues that might arise affecting the applicant and questions relating to the level of integration into Australia. Where there is a combination of those factors, I take those factors into account. I make it clear that the decisions I make are individual decisions on the cases that are put to me, certainly not on the'· basis of any understandings or any deal that might be suggested by any individual. Gun Control: Funds",76
168,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer the minister to matters raised in today's Courier-Mail. Minister, is it true that an officer of your department who is responsible for the management of the Queensland government's gun compensation scheme is being investigated by the Queensland police for misappropriating funds along with a series of dubious financial arrangements which have resulted in court action against him?",77
169,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did see the article in this morning's Brisbane Courier-Mail. DAS Distribution, which is one of the business arms of my department, won the contract for the collection of all unauthorised firearms in Queensland, and it won that contract on behalf of the Queensland government. A number of allegations about the financial affairs of the person engaged to manage the project have been made to the Queensland police. The matter is being treated with the utmost seriousness and being investigated by the Queensland police. I am advised that, based on the results of the police investigations completed so far, the police are satisfied there are no matters which cause them concern. But I do not propose to comment any further on the substance of the un attributed allegations in this morning's Courier-Mail because they are in the hands of the Queensland police as well. Shipbuilding",77
170,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Is the minister aware that Australia's shipbuilding industry earned Australia over $5 billion in exports last year and employs, directly and indirectly, over 13,000 people? Has the minister seen comments by the Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders Association, Mr John Rothwell, that his Western Australian based Austel Ships would have to sack 300 workers because of the government's decision on the shipbuilding bounty? Has the minister seen comments made yesterday by the Western Australian Minister for Trade and Commerce, his National Party friend and colleague Hendy Cowan, that the Howard government's policy on the shipbuilding bounty was-and I quote directly-'bloody nonsense'? When will the minister persuade his colleagues to reverse the government's anti-export and anti-jobs shipbuilding policy?",77
171,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can understand why the member for Perth has finally got up a few questions this week-and I welcome that. Of course, he might apply his mind as to who they should be directed to, because this matter relates to the portfolio of the minister for industry in terms of the ships bounty. But I am happy to remind the member that this government extended the bounty involved; further, that we have been very diligent about pursuing market access for Australian high-tech, wave piercing ferries around the world. It is a matter of considerable credit to that industry, and to the efforts of previous ministers for trade, that Australia commands around some 30 per cent of the world market with regard to that ferry trade. In fact, we have sold additional ferries in the last 12 months to some markets which had not previously had the pleasure, privilege and bonus of Australian ferries. I am deeply conscious of the jobs created here in Australia by the shipbuilding industry of Australia. My colleague the minister for industry is likewise very much engaged by the contribution that industry makes. We will continue to pursue both trade and industry policy settings which will provide for a better framework for those industries, not the least of which has been the three interest rate reductions delivered in the course of the first 12 months of the coalition government. In conclusion, I just pose this question: what if Labor had been re-elected last time; where would interest rates have been then? A whole lot higher than they are now. Howard Ministry",77
172,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware that today is the last day that parliament sits before the anniversary on Sunday of the coalition's election win. Given that fact, can the Prime Minister inform the House of what action he and the government have taken to fulfil the election promise to make ministers more accountable to the parliament and, consequently, more answerable to the people?",78
173,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for that question. It allows me this opportunity in this, the last question time before the first anniversary-I hope of many--of the election of the coalition government on 2 March 1996. One of the first and best demonstrations of the accountability of the executive to parliament is for the executive en masse to turn up in parliament. Unlike another government I knew, and unlike another Prime Minister I knew, this government and this Prime Minister do not regard question time as a courtesy extended by the executive to the national parliament. We regard question time as the prime mechanism whereby the executive is accountable to the parliament. To demonstrate that, I inform the House that this government, during its first 12 months, will have answered 1,325 questions in parliament-and that is a 20-year record. You would have to go back to 1976 when the Fraser coalition government was in office to find a record of such accountability to the parliament. But it gets even better. The average length of question time has been 73 minutes. Mr Rocher- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister might be helped by the knowledge that, up till the end of question time yesterday, he had been asked 1,343 questions.",78
174,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you.,78
175,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I thank the honourable member for Curtin.,78
176,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I always knew that Rocher was a good mate of mine. Thanks, Allan. The average length of question time has been 73 minutes, and that is longer than any period since the 1960s. The average number of questions each day has been over 19again higher than at any time since the 1960s. I have attended every question time, except on two occasions when I have been absent representing the Australian government overseas. By contrast, another Prime Minister I used to know took a very part-time approach to his duties-and, as a consequence of that, he received a full-time response from the Australian people. Hinchinbrook Development",78
177,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. What was agreed in your meeting yesterday with Mr Keith Williams, Mr Borbidge and Senator Robert Hill regarding the Hinchinbrook development? Are media reports of a decision to support an independent company rather than Commonwealth officials to monitor the development in this world heritage area correct? Have you set aside or modified in any way conditions required in the deed of agreement? Why have you been prepared to give a single developer such special treatment?",78
178,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for FremantIe asks what was agreed and what is the policy of this government. The policy of this government is to create jobs in regional Australia. Your policy is to destroy them. The policy of this government, as demonstrated by the woodchip decision and the Hinchinbrook decision, is to achieve a balance between environment and development.",78

181,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Ooh!,79
182,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, which goes to relevance. Relevance is relevant to question time. This was a very specific series of questions relating to a meeting yesterday, the question of the appointment of an independent company, the question of whether they have set aside or modified the deeds of agreement and why they have been prepared to give a single developer such special treatment. If accountability in question time means anything, part of it is that you actually observe the standing orders and deal with them.",79
183,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have been listening very carefully to the Prime Minister:'s answer. The answer is in order.,79
184,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition's contributions to this question time have been welcomed on this side of the House. They remind me of why the member for Melbourne, on the Four Corners program last Monday night, had this to say: The biggest difficulty we have is that we essentially now represent two broad constituencies: the traditional working class base and a very sizeable middle class base. Mr Lee-Point of order, Mr SPEAKER Government members interJecting",79
185,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Mr Lee-My point of order is on relevance. I will be intrigued to know whether you believe this is relevant and in order, given the specific nature of the questions.",79
186,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister had strayed from the question but I am sure he is about to define the answer precisely.,79
187,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am. As our decision on the Port Hinchinbrook project demonstrates, we do not have any difficulty in reconciling the legitimate aspirations of working class Australians in regional areas of this country and the legitimate desire of all Australians to preserve environmental values. The truth in relation to Hinchinbrook is that the former minister, Senator Faulkner, slapped a proclamation, a declaration, on that area that destroyed jobs in North Queensland. That is what it did. It was not put on out of a concern for environmental values; it was put on out of an obsessive desire to serve a sectional interest. What we have been able to do is to establish the circumstances where you can care for the environment and generate jobs for Australians. That is my policy on Port Hinchinbrook and that will be my policy on all such issues. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Banking",79
188,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Can I add to an answer on bank fees, Mr Speaker. You will recall that I was asked about formal monitoring of bank fees. Let me add to that answer: the then Labor government would regularly announce that it would refer bank fees for monitoring. The last such announcement that it intended to commence monitoring of bank fees was made on 26 February 1996-four days before the election on 2 March. It was never done.",79
189,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"No, no. That is absolute rubbish.",79
190,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I table the press release of the then Treasurer announcing it would be done-that is, it had not been done-on 26 February 1996, four days before the federal election on 2 March. NA Form of Questions",79
191,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker. Are you aware that the member for Kooyong, with the assistance, I understand, of the Deputy Leader of the House, has prepared a guide for ministerial performance in question time which says in part that ministers should: . . . desist from promoting Dorothy Dixers that appear designed to make the person asking them look like a total dill. Does the document have your imprimatur? Are you aware whether the minister has counselled the Deputy Leader of the National Party following his appalling performance here yesterday when he made the member for Paterson look like a total dill?",79
192,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The question is: am I aware? The simple answer to that is no. Unofficial guidelines or instructions issued by the executive on either side of the House are just that-unofficial. They are not processed either through my office, by me or by my staff. Parliament House: Cleaning Services",80
193,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question to you, but I am afraid it is not as dramatic as the last one. I ask you to confirm whether Limro Cleaning Services, which is contracted by the Joint House Department to provide cleaning services to the parliament, has implemented a blanket policy not to authorise any leave without pay for any employee? Do you regard this as a reasonable policy for that company to adopt in relation to the people who clean this building; if not, will you review the contract with Limro with a view to terminating it as soon as possible?",80

In April 1996, I then moved on to Metford. I still own property in the seat of Dobell, but I have not been on the electoral role in Dobell since late 1995.

236,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Howard Government to ensure job security for at least 250,000 Australians whose employment is directly or indirectly dependent on a healthy car industry. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",82
237,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, I appreciate the emphasis with which you read out the letter I sent you asking for this matter of public importance to be brought on. There are at least 250,000 jobs associated one way or another with the car industry, either directly, to the tune of about 50,000 jobs, or indirectly, adding another 200,000 to that. There is no question at all that at the centre of Australian manufacturing industry lies the car industry-no question at all-at its very heart. Australian manufacturing industry relies in its totality upon a healthy car industry for its survival. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his answer to me in question time today suggested that people ought to have regard to other areas of Labor Party policy on the car industry. I suppose I could have invited him at that time-if they were going to take on board any particular undertakings that the Prime Minister was prepared to give to the car industry in the answer he gave-to have regard to the promises the Liberal Party made on child care, education, health and to the university students. We would not ask them to have regard to either our general policy or your general policy or promises as far as this is concerned. We would ask the Australian people to have regard to the experience of the car industry whilst we were in office. Despite the health of the car industry at the conclusion of our period of office and the fact that it looked forward, as we reviewed the progress of that car industry, to an environment which respected their massive achievements in the restructuring that they have undergone over the last decade to be honoured by governments subsequent to this, their progress in that regard has been remarkable. Over the course of the last decade the car industry has led the way in what has been quite a stunning turnaround in the performance of Australian manufacturing industry. Let me go through the total manufacturing sector and then I will go to the car industry to give an impression or understanding to people who may be listening to this debate of the absolutely vital significance the car industry is to us. Let me go first generally into manufacturing industry. In 1983-84 when we came into office, the value of manufactured exports to this nation was about $5 billion-about 20 per cent of total exports. By 1993-94 this had risen to about $20 billion30.8 per cent of exports-and in very rapid rises in 1995-96 to $25 billion-33 per cent of exports. That is an extraordinary rate of increase in manufactured industry export that time. It reflected the fact that the structural changes that we put in place changed the orientation of Australian manufacturing industry. It told them when we put those changes in place that what we expected from Australian manufacturing industry was world best practice in efficiency and export performary ance. Then, if we got that world best practice, they would be rewarded by the sort of support from government that they now enjoy. In part that is based on tariffs; in part it is based export facilitation. There are a number of other elements to it. That means that now the Australian car industry is sl.lpported bymechanisms effectively performs but is supported by-one of the lowest levels of government support any of its competitors-probably the lowest level of government support of any of its competitors. We also recognise that you reach a point when you have to take a decision this far and no further. If there is going to be any further movement we expect a reciprocal arrangeIndustry, ment. From this point on, nothing for nothing. From this point on, what do we expect from those with whom we compete and what do we expect in the international trading arrangements? Not one inch-until we see people prepared to go the miles that we have gone giving them access to our markets and in the process making a very substantial difference in the efficiency of our industry. This is a major test of the government's bona fides. It loves to clothe fence of the battlers, but the problem of this government is that it has absolutely no comprehension of what real public policy means in manufacturing industry and in the car industry in general-no understanding at One of the reasons why we are now condressed. cerned about what the government's approach to this will be is that in the course of the 12 months we have seen the most massive dismantling of sensibly based industry policy that this country has seen. There has been massive dismantling in 12 months this government's period of office. But the most amazing feature of that masgovernment sive dismantling is that it is not been accomCommission, in panied by an explanation as to why that should be so in industry terms. We have heard arguments from them about a budget situation which has largely been bogus in the argument that has been put forward about it. This country has one of lowest levels of public indebtedness. When this government came into office it had one of the best budgetpositions enjoyed by any government in the industrialised world-a budgetary position which contrasts, I might say, with a $25 bilIion deficit in today's dollar terms that we on confronted when we came into office. Nevertheless, we were able, with that $25 billion deficit, to put in place a series of support that encouraged the car industry and manufacturing industry generally to be of outward looking and internationally competitive-but also, in return, on a basis of mutual obligation, that relevant support mechanisms were put in place by the government to keep them going. Every single one of those support mechanisms has been demonised. The Minister for Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, bears responsibility for that. We have had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) stand up in this place time and again and say, 'Look, what we have done to syndicated R&D and what we have done to these arin rangements of business tax concessions represents our attack on the big end of town. While we are slugging the battlers for their prescriptions, their child care and destroying their kids' chances of an opportunity, don't worry about that because we are slugging the itself in a debig end of town.' The big end of town would be slugged if the big end of town was actually finding that massive tax evasion associated with those all. pass throughs on family trusts being adThat real big end of town element of it has a feather duster taken out to it. When last the big end of town decides to do a bit of investing in decent R&D the axe comes out there and slashes right through those proposia tions as industry policy gets dismantled flat over piecemeal without argument. Therefore, as we see the approach of this to the position of the Productivity given the song and dance that went into the creation of the Productivity Commission, given the amount of personal effort invested in the Productivity Commission by the Treasurer, we are entitled to suspect that if there has been that level of ignorance on industry policy to this point associated with the Productivity Commission we can expect a bit more ignorance unless we start to bell the cat, unless we start to put down a set of markers that make you start to understand that there are political costs to be borne. Talking about battlers and battlers' newspapers, the Herald-Sun editorial today makes some useful reading on that path. It says this in the course of its editorial: The Labor announcement emerged as a shrewd political manoeuvre, leaving the Howard Cabinet with little alternative other than to adopt the same position, and reject the Industry Commission's zero tariff proposal for the period beyond 2000, when the matter comes before ministers soon. Shrewd political manoeuvre-dead right. They have got it in one. What we are trying to do in this exercise is to box you, to put you in a position where you have no alternative but to make absolutely certain that you act in the way you should on the Productivity Commission as it comes forward, and act with a total rejection. You know very well that if you fail to do that massive damage is going to be done to the car industry, massive damage is going to be done to the manufacturing industry, and massive damage is also going to be done to the survival of the state of Victoria. That is a situation which would simply be completely unacceptable as far as we are concerned. What has been the response? I spoke a bit earlier about the general performance of the manufacturing industry while we were in office. What has been the response specifically of the car industry-this industry which is now under threat, as every single car manufacturer has pointed out, from the recommendations that have thus far come forward from the Productivity Commission? Let me just go through exports because what we attempted to do when we were in office was to ensure that there was a quality performance from the car industry and ensure that that quality performance was reflected in exports and therefore they would have a long term possibility of survival. They responded magnificently. The value of car exports in 1984 was $383 million. By 1988 they were up to $659 million-a 72 per cent increase over that period. By 1992 they were up to $1.25 billion-a 226 per cent increase. By 1995 they were up to $1.776 billion-a 363 per cent increase. That was a 363 per cent increase in the export performance of the car industry over the period of time that we were in office. There were hard adjustments taken by the car industry but what the car industry did in that period of time was change its structure. From being intensely focused on about four or five manufacturers at that point of time, it spread itself out to encourage what has been a massive development of a component industry associated with it. That component industry is performing not only domestically but internationally as well. Let me tell you something about that component industry as it performs internationally. When we made our announcements on our policy we were in a factory in which virtually 80 per cent of what it does is exported and you can go through virtually every area of the component industry and find that. But we have also found as we have gone around the country talking to people about the sorts of problems they confront that virtually every single one of those folk engaged in that component industry confronts new competition being brought into the region around it, sometimes on the basis of Australian investment we are producing here. It is brought into areas where, from their point of view, they are getting a better level of government support. I heard the Deputy Prime Minister arguing consistently against us that somehow or other this would create problems for us in APEC, that somehow or other we would have difficulties with that. So let me just go through what those component manufacturers and the car industry face in terms of import restrictions. I will go through each of the APEC countries: Vietnam, 60 to 200 per cent; Brunei, 40 to 200 per cent; South Korea, 25 to 100 per cent; India, 65 per cent; Singapore, 45 per cent; Malaysia, 5 to 200 per cent; Philippines, 30 per cent; Taiwan, 30 to 50 per cent; Thailand, 20 to 200 per cent; China, 110 to 150 per cent; Indonesia, 100 per cent; USA, cars 5 per cent, trucks 25 per cent; New Zealand, 25 per cent though we get access under CER. The point about all of that is this: APEC does not expect nothing for nothing in the positions that they put. They pointed out quite clearly under the Osaka action plan APEC economies will endeavour to ensure overall comparability of their trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, taking into account the general level of liberalisation and facilitation already achieved by each APEC economy. That is exactly the point. It is nothing for nothing from this point on as far as the car industry is concerned. We intend to see that a car industry in this nation survives. The proposals that we have put forward to extend that tariff support to at least 2005 will do that. The proposals will be put under review in 2003 when that review will have, as its focus, what are the others doing, what about regional Australia and what does regional Australia need? We will be making an Australian national decision on what is necessary for the car industry at that point of time in 2003. I will leave it to our spokesman on industry matters to talk more about the detail of the position and decisions we have taken. This proposition that we have put forward is what the companies themselves determine, what the industry and the workers in it know, and they are entitled to some honour for the changes they have made and the performance that I have already outlined that they have managed to put in. They are entitled to know that both major political parties in this nation stand behind them, stand behind the existence of a car industry. You have an opportunity to pick up that editorial now in the Herald-Sun newspaperpick it up and enshrine it. We invite you to a bipartisan position on this. If what we have done is boxed you so you come into it reluctantly, well so much the better. (Time expired)",82
238,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is quite a remarkable somersault by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I will quote a couple of things he had to say: 'Not one inch are we going to move', and 'Nothing for nothing'. A press release from the Leader of the Opposition of 14 July 1995 states: The tariff reduction program and consequent industry restructuring have given rise to more competitive exporters in important sectors, including the car industry and textiles, clothing and footwear. What a somersault! He talked about what they were going to do to APEC, reminding everyone that they were going to stand up to all the APEC people around the place and that nothing was going to give. In November 1996, just around the comer, Mr Beazley said: It is important for most APEC meetings to send a strong message to the WTO that APEC would not be backing away from its goals because unless the WTO ministerial meeting sends a strong message that economic liberalisation will continue, I believe we are in danger of seeing a return to a more protectionist world. As the countries of the Asia Pacific know only too well, it will be in nobody's interest. Quite clearly, the poor old Leader of the Opposition has been feeling the heat. All those who saw the Four Comers program earlier this week could not have been anything but very impressed. When I watched it I couldn't help thinking, 'What are they going to do? What is the instant reaction to this, because it is going to sting a bit.' The Old Labor and the New Labor and all those sorts of things have been talked about. I thought, 'They will pull a stunt somewhere for sure.' One thing about the current leadership of the Labor Party is that they are all part of the chardonnay set. They are far removed from the real workers of the world. The member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) is the leading chardonnay sipper in town. Other members here go to lunch in Rolls Royces. There had to be a stunt, and the chardonnay set of the leadership decided that it had to be for Old Labor. So they thought, 'We'll move on down to Adelaide, with things a bit tough down there, and we'll put on a little show.' It had all the hallmarks of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). He thought this one up. This is one of his little opportunist plays he puts together. He thought it up and did it in conjunction with the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). They put their minds together to produce this little plot for Adelaide. So off they went. Then we saw that part of the Four Corners program where they interviewed the member for Hotham and asked him about his leadership aspirations. He said, 'Well, it might be down the road a bit.' The Leader of the Opposition saw that and he thought, 'No open road for Crean,' and thought he had better go to the show as well. So he hopped on down to Adelaide, blustered away and put out this news statement about motor cars-totally contradicting his own personal positions of the last 10 years. He contradicted every statement. When Keating was Prime Minister, it was well known that he walked all over the member for Hotham. The Leader of the Opposition would not stand up for this sort of stuff, would he. But no, he went right along with it. Even in November 1996 he was still supporting the hard, dry line. We were very interested to see all those situations. I am surprised today to see the bluster going on. No doubt this was all driven by the fact that their effort in Adelaide yesterday got remarkably little press.",85
239,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Except in Adelaide.,86
240,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Page 6 in the Adelaide papers. It didn't get up because they don't believe you. They know full well that a leopard can't change its spots as quick as The Labor Party has been living by these standards for years, so no-one believes you. Having failed yesterday, they rushed us into the House this afternoon for an MPI led by the Leader of the Opposition and backed up by the conscience man-the guy who is looking to the leadership in the future. He is going to come in behind his leader and see if he can get a better run this time. I don'the will. It is important at the outset that the House understand the context in which the future of the motor car industry is being considered. Shortly after coming to government, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and I asked the Industry Commission to examine the motor vehicle industry. This is the usual process followed by the government when it is reviewing an industry, an approach supported by the Labor Party when in government. As part of the Industry Commission's process, the government appointed an associate commissioner with a background and experience in the industry to be part of the examining panel of that industry-something Labor never did. In line with its usual practice, the Industry Commission produced a draft report for public comment shortly before Christmas. The commission is now conducting further public hearings prior to producing a final report about the middle of this year. It is this final report that will be considered by cabinet and to which the government will formally reply. In other words, it would be premature for the government to announce its decision on the future of the motor vehicle industry until the final report of the Productivity Commission has been received. Could you imagine the outcry from the Labor Party if we jumped in and pre-empted the final report of the commission? The government has made two things very clear. The report of the Productivity Commission will be only one of the factors considered by the government before making its decision. We are committed to consulting widely with industry and others with an interest in the industry, including the trade unions and state governments. Secondly, both the Prime that. Minister (Mr Howard) and I have clearly stated that the government regards the retention of a strong and internationally competitive car industry as being very important and that it is the intention of the government to encourage the development and growth of a strong car industry. Clearly, the only reason the opposition has chosen now to enter the debate is desperation. think The workers have deserted the Labor Party and are showing no signs of returning. So what does Labor do? It pinches the substance of the minority report drafted by the commission which, by the way, only exists because this government-not the previous Labor government-permitted industry representatives to sit directly on the commission's panel. Labor pinches the minority draft report, rebadges it and tries to pass it off as its own policy, just as it has done consistently over the past six months as it attempts to redefine itself-just as the member for Hotham rebadged Australia Reconstructed as his grand vision for industry; just as he rebadged the metal trade union's 'Policy for industry development and more jobs' as his model for a MITI style industry department. Mr Crean-You can't even say it. You wouldn't know about it.",86

243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Order! The minister will resume his seat. I appreciate the intervention of the member for Hotham, but I would remind him that he has been warned once this afternoon. You interjected 15 times in the first five minutes of contribution. If you want to be here to make your second contribution, please save your breath for that.",87

245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I don't need assistance from members on my right, either.",87
246,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the Opposition has finally got off the pot. In the debate between the member for Hotham and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) on the future direction of Labor's economic policy, the Leader of the Opposition has come down on the side of the member for Hotham. It is a pity that he hadn't been so decisive in government. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham have plenty of courage and bounce now. It is a pity they didn't demonstrate that same fortitude in staring down former Prime Minister Keating. As the Prime Minister said at question time, 'Don't forget the Commonwealth Bank.' The Labor Party will promise the world in opposition; it won't deliver in government. What exactly was Labor's record? I can tell you it was appalling. In 1984, shortly after Labor came to office, car production in Australia stood at around 370,000 units. When they left office in 1996, production was just 314,000. In the interim, Nissan closed down production and Australia largely lost the capacity to produce small cars like the Ford Laser. In 1984, import penetration was around 20 per cent. In 1996, as a result of their policies in government, this exceeded 50 per cent. Under Labor, employment in the industry declined from around 70,000 to around 45,000, despite all the bluster of a couple of days ago. It is little wonder that the workers detest them. Labor had promised the automotive industry cost savings to be won from micro-economic reform, which would have offset the effects of declining tariffs but which never materialised. The Productivity Commission, in its December 1996 draft report on the automotive industry, noted that progress had been especially slow in labour market reform, government regulations and in the economic infrastructure supporting the industry, especially this the waterfront-that is one for everyone to remember-shipping and rail transport. I note the Leader of the Opposition favours a pause in tariffs and a review prior to resuming their reductions, while also insisting that we maintain our commitments under APEC. He might specify how these contradictory objectives could be achieved. They certainly contradict his comments as a minister. He might also indicate how certainty could he maintained for the purposes of planning investment in the industry. The government recognises that the car industry plays a very significant role in the Australian economy. It is a major employer. Nearly 50,000 Australians are directly employed in the industry. Many more rely on employment generated by the demand that the car industry creates. It is a major producer of value added exports. Exports have grown strongly in real terms in recent years. The car industry achieves exports worth around $2 billion, with scope for considerable growth if the industry is able to achieve improved access to regional markets. It is a major source of investment. Apart from the four major car producers, there are some 200 individual companies producing and supplying components within the industry. It is an important source of innovation and engineering expertise. Combined, the car industry generates nearly $250 million in business expenditure on R&D. The government has set in train a comprehensive process to review post-2000 arrangements for this industry. The Productivity Commission has its terms of reference. It has produced a draft report. It is -.:ontinuing its reference and will release its final report in May. It is worth noting that, in establishing Production Commission inquiry, the government ensured that the pragmatic considerations of industry are represented on the commission in the person of Ian Webber. This has undoubtedly strengthened the review process. It has brought a diversity of opinion to the commission and forced the commission to re-examine its traditional methods of analysis and argument. This is reflected by the fact that the commission's draft report contains both majority and minority recommendations on certain points. As I mentioned, the commission is just one source of advice to the government in the review process. When we came to office last year, I established the Automotive Manufacturing Council comprising representatives of the four car majors, component producers and car importers. That council has met on at least three or four occasions since the commencement of the review, both with myself and with the Minister for Trade, the Hon. Tim Fischer. It has a comprehensive work program addressing the long-term vision of the industry, productivity, innovation, the size and structure of the domestic market and export opportunities. The government is responsibly developing a vision and a strategy that will put the car industry on a competitive footing well into the next century. But we will let the process run its course. We will not be pre-empting the outcome of the review process. The Leader of the Opposition should specify the modifications he thinks are necessary to ensure the export trade facilitation scheme remains consistent with the World Trade Organisation. The Labor Party's proposals for the car industry must be seen as part of the opposition's record on industry policy as a whole. This is the party that tinkered with the sectional policies while ignoring the fundamentals of industry and the economy in general. This is the party that spent 13 years propping up their mates while the rest of industry struggled under high inflation, record high interest rates and record low business with investment. It is a party which failed to develop a vision for stable job growth. The Labor Party was the great job destroyer. It is this the party of high unemployment. Labor's recession caused the worse unemployment in 60 years. Only four years ago, under a Labor Party government, unemployment stood at the rate of 11.2 per cent, with youth unemployment over 26 per cent. Labor rhetoric, including the member for Hotham' s grand vision for industry, has always been full of lofty predictions about confronting unen ployment. The trulh is that, in the manufacturing sector, 200,000 jobs were lost in the last six years of the Labor government and no net growth in employment has been seen for II years. (Time expired)",87
247,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The future of the car industry remains at risk because of this government's inactivity: the 47,000 direct jobs, the 250,000 indirect jobs. the impact on the regions, the four car manufacturing companies, the 200 regional jobsand the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) leaves the chamber! The minister stumbles through his speech, revelations occurring to him as to what happens to be the car industry plan in this country as he stumbles out over the export facilitation scheme. It is a revelation! He did not know it existed before he read it. This is the person that has got charge of the car industry in this country. But it does not stop there: he has got charge of every industry in this country. He is the person that made a promise to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing, and he is presiding over the demise of manufacturing industry. He scurries from the chamber because he will not participate in the debate. The reality is this industry is in crisis because of the government's inaction, because of the conflicting signals coming from the government and because of the National Party, that really cannot make up its mind. It wants to reduce car tariffs, but it wants to keep sugar tariffs up. Don't you think there is an inconsistency? You don't! But this is the way you go round the country. This is the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), sitting on the front bench, and the Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, who has been lambasted all around this country by Hendy Cowan, by Bob Borbidge and by his state ministers who all say, Tim Fischer, where are you leading usT Total confusion. We have seen the confusion from Tim Fischer, but no more evident than over this stupid ideological position on tariffs. Cut them for manufacturing, but keep them up for rural resources. That is your position: inconsistent-and the reason you could never get a trade agreement through the international forums. We as a Labor government knew that if we were to get access for rural commodities we had to do the right thing in manufacturing. We did have to reduce our tariff level. But, if we were moving from a tariff protected industry, we had to support the export growth of industries. That was why we had the car plan: a plan that did reduce tariffs, but at the same time supported export growth. Hence, the export facilitation scheme. The nonappearing minister has just stumbled across what he never knew existed-the car plan to get exports up. What we have got is a split within the government. Mr MCArthur-You've sold out, Simon.",88
248,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have got the person who can't count numbers quickly enough in the House on their side-the Government Whip. But he can't count in terms of the policy position of his party. South Australian members of parliament are coming into this place, expressing mock outrage and concern for South Australia, saying that the government has to reject the Productivity Commission plan. But whenever they get the opportunity to vote for regions-vote for South Australia and vote for Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelongthey squib it. They had the opportunity the other day in the debate on the productivity bill, and they squibbed it. In contrast to this total confusion, this misunderstood position by the minister, Labor does have a plan. Labor announced that plan yesterday in Adelaide. What does that plan involve? It involves a freeze on the tariff on motor vehicles at 15 per cent, until at least the year 2005, whilst maintaining our commitment to APEC. The minister who is confused about the export facilitation scheme cannot work out either how we can keep this commitment to APEC. I would tell him why if he were only here-it is a bit hard talking to this empty box. But I am sure he is back in his room listening to every word, so I will explain it to him. The reality is Australia is well ahead of its trading partners in APEC. Its commitment to 15 per cent beats anyone hands down. We said, 'We will maintain that commitment but, before we go any further, we want you to do the same.' No unilateral disarmament here. We are not going out doing something for nothing. If the other countries do honour their commitments, then we will review that position past 2005. But, as it stands, we will be ahead of any of them-even up until the year 2005. That is how your so-called contradiction is explained. In addition, we will take a sensible step: we will say that, in the review that takes place, we will require a transparent measure of what other countries are doing so that we can see if they are improving. This was an amendment we moved in the House to the Productivity Commission bill. It is the rhetoric that some from South Australia go on with. But, when we moved the amendment, where were they? They voted it down, as they voted down the legislative requirement that when the Productivity Commission makes a decision it has got to have regard to the impact of its decision on regions. They come in here and talk about the importance of regional development. But, given the opportunity to vote for regions, they vote them down-they vote against them. We have also said that we want to keep the export facilitation scheme. We understand what it is-we put it in place. But the minister bumbles over it because it is a revelation to him today. We have also said we will continue the duty-free allowance, and we have said that we will reverse the stupid decisions that have seen research and development cut in this country. What has been the industry response to this plan? They have said that if this plan is introduced-understand this, because this is not just about protecting existing jobs; it is about growing the industry-if this plan is put in place, we will get 10,000 extra new jobs. We will treble exports. I thought this was a government that wanted to correct the balance of payments and create jobs-yet they will vote against this plan. This is a perfect plan to correct the balance of payments and address the current account, and it is great for jobs, yet you cannot see it. You do not know what is looking you in the face. That is why we want to expose you. We have also seen the response of the government. What is the response of the government to this position? The minister comes into this place, inanely rambling through. Do you know what his opening line was in response to the speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)? It referred to Four Corners on Monday night. Well should the member for Ryan remember Four Corners. It was on the Marion Wilkinson Four Corners program where he exposed, with the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), his plot to bring down the current Prime Minister when he was formerly a Leader of the Opposition. He was there crowing on Four Corners how he had plotted to bring down the leader of his party. When I was listening to the minister today-I have heard him before in debate on this matter-standing there, oblivious to what is going on in the world and saying, 'Oh, you know, those Labor boys, they're up to some silly stunt, we'll wait and see what the Productivity Commission does', it reminded me of that Beatles song, Fool on the hill. You would have to be from my generation to understand these lyrics. Someone 30 years or younger might not remember, but let me read it to them. Here is the Beatles song which describes the minister, and I think the Prime Minister, perfectly: Day after day alone on the hillMr Hollis-Sing it.",89
249,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I can't sing, but I will read the lyrics: the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still. But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool, and he never gives an answer. That is the minister completely. I have never heard him give an answer in this place yet. There is more. The third stanza of this great classic song says: Well on the way, his head in a cloud, the man of a thousand voices is talking perfectly loud. But nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make, and he never seems to notice. That is this government-fools on the hill. It is the hill overlooking the demise of Australian industry. The people who have responsibility because they were given a mandate to create jobs, grow exports and correct the current account are foolishly ignoring the signals and signs that industry is giving them; foolishly persisting with cuts to industry programs that have got us into export markets, that have seen us get into value adding activity; foolishly ignoring the impact of the car plan that Labor put in place, which has seen that growth in exports, competitively and efficiently; and foolishly ignoring the calls to put in place a new plan. Labor has that plan. In the interests of the industry, the government should embrace it. (Time expired)",90
250,Mr CHARLES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"La Trobe) (4.10 p.m.)We have heard the Laurel and Hardy act from the opposition over there to beat all. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) makes performers from the Flying Fruit Fly Circus look like absolute amateurs. Talk about a flip-flop. We are here to discuss an important and serious issue this afternoon-that is, tariffs in the car industry into the next millennium. There are a number of significant points that I would like to discuss in the brief time available: firstly, that tariffs make us lazy; secondly, that they create economic distortions; thirdly, that the automotive industry is critical to manufacturing in Australia; fourthly, that we need to seriously address micro-economic reform and offsets; and, lastly, that we need to adhere to our APEC obligations which we committed to at Bogor. Do tariffs make us lazy? Yes, they do. When you look back in history, if you think about the chemical industry in Australia, I am advised that most of our current chemical plants are undersized for what they might be if they were to be truly internationally competitive and able proficiently and efficiently to produce product in Australia and sell it competitively on world markets. Why are they undersized? Because they were built behind a huge tariff barrier which encouraged less efficient and less productive enterprise to be constructed. It is pretty hard to overcome that negative factor 20 or 30 years down the track, but they are trying. Secondly, is our automotive industry one of the highest protected industries not only in Australia but around the world? We decided that in order to make a good motor car and give Australians access to transportation cheaply and inexpensively, we would progressively build a tariff wall. What we built was a highly inefficient, structured industry that was overcommitted to a centralised wage system and with taxes paid by Australian consumers for imported motor cars, which meant that Australian domestic cars were reading more expensive. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) talks about there being crisis in the automotive industry. He amazes me. I did not know there was a crisis. thought the automotive industry was going from strength to strength today. We talk about economic distortion. Taxes create huge economic distortions. Look at wholesale sales tax and payroll tax. When the opposition was in government and brought in a surcharge for luxury automobiles, what happened with the surcharge? We did not collect more money. Fewer people could buy luxury motor cars and the tax return from that wholesale sales tax surcharge initiative went down. So Keating had to give up and withdraw the tax surcharge because he killed the goose that laid the golden egg. Tariffs are an impost on business inputs. That is an important point to make. I think that when the Labor Party was in government they actually understood this. The program of gradual reduction in import tariffs over a period of time was supported by this side of the House. I have congratulated the ALP in this place time and time again on gradually reducing the tariff wall. What I do not understand is the huge backflip we saw yesterday and today by the Leader of the Opposition, supported by the member for Hotham, in saying, 'Well, we can stop now. This is good enough. We will pause. We will quit the phased reduction of tariffs and see what happens to the industry.' I will tell you what will happen. We will just keep going on as in the bad old days. I am indebted to the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) for some important data with respect to the industry. Profits in passenger motor vehicle manufacturing for 1995 were $340 million. Profits in the component industry have been positive every year since 1989-90. Output per worker in the automotive industry has risen from $75,000 in 1991 to $116,000 today. Cars per employee has risen from 10.83 in 1991 to 15.96 in 1995, while output per worker in the component industry went from $125,300 in 1991 to $179,500 in 1995. I could go on, but time precludes me from all the statistics. The important thing to recognise is that we created an industry a that was dependent on the centralised wage system and on tariffs. Do honourable memI bers know what would happen? When the industry faced a little cost pressure because the CPI, the cost of living, was going up, it would go to the Tariff Board and say, 'We've the got to have an increase in tariffs. We want Australians to pay more taxes for motor cars that are imported from other countries,' and the Tariff Board would say, 'You're right; the CPI has gone up,' and would increase tariffs; then the union would go to the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and say, 'The industry has put up the cost of motor cars, so we will have to have a wage increase,' and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would say, 'You're right,' and put up wages; and then the industry would go back to the Tariff Board and say, 'The union just got a wage rise. We are going to have to have another increase in tariffs.' That went on and on, and we built behind that tariff wall one of the most inefficient, most defect prone and worse quality automotive manufacturing industries in the world. I will tell honourable members what reducing tariffs has done to the industry: it has put enormous pressure on them, their work force and their unions to revitalise their operations to try to become efficient, with capital expenditure and without it. They still have a long way to go to reach world's best practice. The Button car plan did one thing: it helped reduce the number of manufacturers and it helped reduce the number of models available. Some friends and I were talking only last night about all the options we used to have. We could have every colour in the rainbow and every option possible. We paid a fortune for those options and frequently people had to take their automobiles back time and again before they would work properly. We do not have those kinds of problems today, but in the Button car plan the Labor Party forgot about small cars, so we are now importing a huge number of small to medium sized cars made in other countries. We depend largely on larger motor cars-the sixcylinder variety. That is a shame but, nonetheless, the industry is performing, it is becoming more efficient and it is growing. So there is a lot to be said for a low or no tariff position. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when in opposition, said in one of his headland speeches: We are not advocating turning back the clock on tariffs. Higher tariffs are not the solution to the current account problem. They may look like a free lunch but ultimately, it's the consumers who pay through higher prices. Other industries also pay through inflated input costs. Later he makes the important point: I have consistently stated that tariff reform must proceed in step with other reforms to reduce business costs and boost competitiveness. I think that is an absolutely perfect position. I have said consistently that we need to continue with so-called micro-economic reform. We need lower utility costs, we need lower transport costs and we certainly needthe member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, knows I have said this time and again-lower costs on the wharves and lower costs in coastal shipping. Those high costs are such an impost on industry that I cannot describe to the House the detrimental effect they have. We need to deal with all of that. The member for Hotham, who spoke before me, said on 8 November 1990: ... we are winding back the protective wall that the tariff produces because the real problem with the tariff is that it only makes us look internally, domestically. The member for Hotham was right, so why is he now doing a backflip? He is doing a Flying Fruit Fly Circus act. I cannot understand why the ALP is taking a populist line rather than waiting for the Productivity Commission's, the Industry Commission's, report. I congratulate the minister for including Ian Webber in that commission, but why don't we wait for the report? In my view, in the absence of that we have to continue the tariff reduction regime on a predictable basis and at least say that we will reach the Bogor target of 2010. We have a responsibility to meet our obligations in our region. We said to APEC that by 2010 Australia will have no impediments to imports to our country. We need to work hard to create better markets for our products overseas, but we will not win this war until our industry is efficient and productive. (Time expired)",90

254,Mr MARTIN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: Schedule 1, Part 3, page 11 (line 2) to page l3 (line 18), omit the Part. I indicated yesterday in the debate on this particular bill when it was in this chamber before going to the Main Committee for further consideration that it was the intention of the opposition to move this amendment which has been circulated in my name. This amendment, as I indicated yesterday, goes to the issue of rent assistance for singles. Without delaying the House too long, I simply reiterate that the reason we are doing this is for consistency in respect of the approach that the opposition has taken with regard to this as a social security measure. We have also again indicated that we recognise this as being a broken promise, and the fact that it would affect only 340 people for the saving over four years of some $21,000 seems to us to be somewhat ridiculous. The amendment I have moved on behalf of the opposition is to omit that part. As I said, I am not going to delay the afternoon's proceedings in the parliament, because I have spoken with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) about this. I have indicated that the rest of the bill certainly meets with the satisfaction of the opposition. We have congratulated the government on taking necessary action to repair one or two areas where it was felt appropriate to do so. But, again, I just simply say to my friend the minister: keep an eye on the Department of Social Security. I start to worry when they do a few of these little things. They seem to mount up to a major thing at the end of the day. I would not like to see the role that the minister has played and his department has played in maintaining the very high standards for veterans in this community of ours eroded in any way. But we consider this amendment to be important. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Martin's) be agreed to. The House divided. [4.33 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr H.A.

(3) A reference in subsection (2) to another person includes a reference to the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or an authority of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory. (4) If this section applies, the Commission may give to the veteran a written notice requiring the veteran to pay for: (a) a rehabilitation program or any part of such a program that has been undertaken by the veteran under the Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme before the day on which the notice was given to the veteran; and (b) a rehabilitation program or any part of such a program undertaken at any time on or after the day on which the notice was given to the veteran; in relation to the disease, disability or condition.

As was stated this morning by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, these amendments. which have been circulated, have the support of the opposition. While endorsing our bill and its amendments. I would just take the opportunity to thank those who have spoken in the debate. However, before doing so, I just point out to the House that today we celebrate the 96th anniversary of the Australian Army, which I believe demonstrates our commitment to the defence forces of this nation. Commenting on the amendment relating to shared accommodation, I would point out to all members on both sides of the House that the proposal will not affect members of a couple or people with dependent children, and that it certainly will not affect people in residential care. I would also point out that our legislative amendments will provide sufficient flexibility for the Repatriation Commission to assess individual rental arrangements to ensure that people who have similar living expenses to those of a single person living alone are entitled to the same maximum rate of rent assistance. I would assure the other side of the House that, through this arrangement, no-one will be worse off in the sense that there could be people who, under the new arrangement, could well still be $30 per fortnight better off than a couple receiving rental assistance. We are moving towards more flexibility in terms of the arrangements. We acknowledge also that no two veterans are the same and no two circumstances are the same. That is why these legislative amendments will provide that flexibility for the Repatriation Commission to assess individual rental arrangements. I also point out that, by allowing that flexibility, it also acknowledges those veterans who live in rural and remote Australia and who quite often have a different circumstance in relation to accommodation because of the difficulty in obtaining it in some areas. I assure you that in some areas we are acknowledging that by allowing these legislative amendments. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Amendments agreed to.

256,Mrs SULLIVAN,PAIRS,"It is not my intention to delay the proceedings of the House this afternoon because I realise that we are approaching the adjournment and members want to leave. I wanted to put a couple of things on the record at this stage of the bill. It was H.G. Wells who said: In England we have come to rely upon a comfortable timelag of 50 years or a century intervening between the perception that something ought to be done and a serious attempt to do it. I am pleased to say that in Australia we are a little swifter, although perhaps we take a little longer than might otherwise be desirable. In 1987-88 I chaired an inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and tabled a report in this House in May 1988 entitled Getting to work: report of the inquiry into training or return to the workforce by social security pensioners. In the context of this bill, I would like to read into the record a number of the comments of that committee because they are supportive. A number of other recommendations of that report have been adopted over the years, but here we are now looking at something that was perceived by that inquiry eight years ago to be a significant problem for people on social security attempting to re-enter the work force. I shall read several extracts from the report. Under the heading 'Administrative arrangements', the report said: DSS has principal responsibility for providing information about benefits available, whilst CES is responsible for information about referral to education and training programs. This division of responsibility inhibits effective communication of all relevant information to those who need it. In the context of attempts that had been made under regional and local committees to bring together the sorts of services that this bill now enshrines under the new agency, the report made this comment: The Committees could consider establishing shopfront Back to Work Units. Social security recipients could be referred to these Units when their unemployment is likely to be long-term, and when it is envisaged that they will need resources additional to the average unemployment beneficiary. A centralised unit could provide a range of information and could develop an effective data base of educational training and employment opportunities, which is not currently available. Departments tend to specialise in information related primarily to the services provided by that particular Department. In view of the plethora of agencies providing services and assistance, there appears to be a great need for a single centre providing a simple but comprehensive guide to education and training options and support services. The committee went on to say: Examples of lack of information abound. For instance, in New South Wales Sole Parent phone-in for supporting parents. . . a huge number of the women did not know about Austudy. When we asked people at DSS why they were not telling women whose kids were coming tip to that age group that if their kids stayed at school they were entitled to Austudy, they said ""we cannot do everything"". But this is another government program. In the end, the committee said: Closer liaison between CES and DSS is essential in ensuring that beneficiaries have access to counselling and/or employment advice even when they are unable to travel to the relevant office. Throughout the inquiry, that committee received evidence on the obstacles that were put in the way of social security recipients who were trying to gain entry or re-entry into the work force by virtue of the variety of different offices that held information that was needed by the client group. From our visits to some of those offices, it was very much our experience that those agencies which were colocated did much better than those which were geographically separated. This bill provides more than a co-location; this is a combining of departmental services to effect the expediting of gainful employment by those who want it. As I said, it has not taken 50 years but it has taken nine. I am pleased that the Howard government has addressed this particular recommendation of that inquiry. Mr Ruddock-And in its first 12 months.",108
257,Mrs SULLIVAN,PAIRS,"Yes, in its first 12 months. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA BILL 1996 Cognate bills: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1996 NA SUPERVISORY LEVY BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.",109
258,Mr WILTON,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"Those in the House who have been paying attention to the debate on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill would know that the opposition is not seeking to oppose this bill. However, we do have several concerns which will be reflected in the amendments we are seeking to move. We trust that our concerns will also be addressed within the parameters of the processes of Senate scrutiny. I begin my submission by saying that Labor not only allowed banks to enter Australia's growing superannuation market but also oversaw perhaps one of its greatest success stories-the introduction of compulsory superannuation. The growth of industry schemes, as part of the union arranged superannuation arrangements, has also met with great success. Many workers in the country have reaped significant benefits from union based, industry based funds which have performed very well. That contrasts somewhat with the introduction of retirement savings accounts by the coalition, which is being driven, at least in part, by their suspicion and mistrust of the aforementioned industry based superannuation funds-primarily because of the involvement of trade unions and workers as trustees on the boards of these funds-and by the fact that they need to pay back the banks all those generous donations they made to the coalition prior to the last election. Of course, it is well known to us on this side that the ANZ was the largest net donor to the coalition of any corporation in the country. It is also the contention of the opposition that, given those on the other side constantly cry for the need to foster and promote competition, the government should let superannuation funds offer RSAs as well. Under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, equal representation on the board of trustees of superannuation funds of both employers and employees is guaranteed-that is to say, there is equal representational numbers of each party, and, quite rightly, a two-thirds majority of the board is required before any decision is taken and acted upon. This structure obviously ensures that the interests of everyone, both parties, are addressed and guaranteed. This has proved to be a remarkably effective and efficient system. I am aware of many industry superannuation funds which could serve as a model for cooperation between employers and, in particular, trade unions at any level. I could cite, for example, my recent conversation with Mr Graham Gathercole, who is the Managing Director of Gathercole's Abattoirs, in the electorate of Isaacs. He is a trustee of the Meat Industry Superannuation Fund. I have also been privileged to be a member of the Labour Union Cooperative Retirement Fund myself. They are two of the best performing funds around. Those two funds are fine examples of the cooperation of unionemployer trustee arrangements. One of the main differences between an RSA and a traditional superannuation fund is that, unlike superannuation funds, which do have a trustee structure and whose trustees can be charged under the Corporations Act for any misdemeanours they might commitbecause, obviously, they hold money on behalf of their members and are not profit making bodies-RSAs will have no such trustee structure. Hence, those safeguards have been swept aside and will just disappear. There is no doubt that banks simply see RSAs as a way to lock in long-term capital in a low interest type product. Of course, we all know now that RSAs will be capital guaranteed. But it is vitally important that investors in RSAs understand exactly what it means to be capital guaranteed. Firstly, the capital guarantee simply means that the amount invested cannot be reduced due to negative instrument returns or through the imposition of fees. The upshot of this is that with this level of security goes the acknowledgment from both the government and the banks that the rate of return on RSAs will be something around three per cent lower than that for superannuation funds. Indeed, in his submission to the House earlier today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans) cited Australian Consumers Association evidence of that three per cent figure. It is due to this low rate of return that there has been a push to set a maximum limit on RSAs of around $10,000, at which point investors would need to place any further funds in a traditional acrisk, count to attract higher returns. Secondly, the capital guarantee does not mean that, in the case of a bank collapsing facing some form of liquidity difficulties, investors may be safeguarded. The low return rates of RSAs are a concern vidual investors but because of the effect that they will have on the national saving pool on a retiree's ability to provide for themselves in their retirement. One turns to the elderly when one thinks the fact that the banks no doubt, with the government's compliance, will be marketing RSAs at retirees and the elderly, given retirees are looking at some form of safe place in which to invest their money with low risk. But what is not being marketed or I do not foresee will be marketed to these retirees is the fact that these RSAs will also have low rates of return. In fact, retirees the elderly could quite alternatively and simply deposit their money into other capital guaranteed funds which are similarly of low risk but which offer higher rates of return. I have cited the fact that the Australian Consumers Association has taken an interest in this area and has provided us with a further glaring example of the differences in performances between outcomes of RSAs and superannuation funds. In fact, the association compared three people-an example cited by the member for Holt-who have $10,000 to invest. One person leaves it in an RSA for the rest of their working life, attracts a real interest rate of one per cent and comes out at the end with a lump sum of around $164,000. The second person leaves his or her investment in a superannuation fund, earns a real return of some four per cent and gets a payout of $225,000. The third person gets a return of perhaps 6.5 per cent from their superannuation fund and ends up with $390,000. So, as you can see, there is a massive difference in their performances, one which will no doubt have a potentially significant impact on both national savings and the government's social security commitments. It must be drawn to the attention of potential investors again that, while these RSAs remight be low cost, while they might be low they are of low rate of return. That needs to be spelt out by the federal government and the banks. Choice is a great thing, but people or must be given and afforded the opportunity of digesting all the relevant information before they are able to make what is hopefully an not just to indiinformed choice. The government has been very keen to have and the whole arena of superannuation withdrawn from industrial awards, which generally prescribe which industry superannuation fund of employees and employers will contribute to. The government has argued that this limits choice and, hence, competition amongst that suppliers of superannuation and related product instruments. No doubt we will see further efforts and further examples to have what the Workplace Relations Act amended to exclude similar superannuation provisions. One interesting advantage that the current and proposed RSA system does have is that it does require far less time and effort administratively from employers than would a system which would see every employee having a different superannuation fund or RSA. Given the fact that the government has indeed made great play of reducing the amount of red tape on business, this is a point that they seem to have conveniently overlooked. How much choice there will be in reality, unless RSAs are functioning properly, is anyone's guess. How much choice there will be, unless the advantages and disadvantages of the system are fully explained, is again anyone's guess. These things need to be properly explained by the banks and by those offering RSAs. The government has not given any indication that it has thought through this task. RSA providers are not required to disclose information to employees before an RSA account is opened. What should be the employee's choice? Should they open an account? If so, with whom? These are the sorts of choices that ought to be made by the person whose money is being deposited and they ought to be made with the benefit of being afforded all proper information. How much choice will there really be in the workplace when a boss says to their new employee that he or she would prefer them to take out an RSA with a given bank? The choice may be to take an RSA with a particular bank or perhaps forgo their job-an unlikely example perhaps but far from impossible. Even a 14-day cooling-off period, as proposed under the legislation, in my view, would do little to address this potentially problematic scenario. I have said before on more than one occasion that RSAs are of low growth and a low return product. Something that really has never been acknowledged by the Treasurer is the fact that they are a low return product. Employees must understand the long-term cost of remaining within a retirement savings account as opposed to remaining in the long haul with a managed superannuation fund. I cite again that, according to data recently published by the Australian Consumers Association, rates of return average something around three per cent below those of managed superannuation funds, and it is indeed essential that prospective consumers of this superannuation instrument comprehend this. Furthermore, if the government really does believe in choice and competition, why will it not allow superannuation funds to operate RSAs? I contend that it is because the government has a fundamental loathing of superannuation funds which have union involvement. Or perhaps it is because this might result in a little bit too much competition for the banks. I have no doubt that the Wallis inquiry will recommend further mergers of banks, or at least not oppose further mergers of banks. Again, one wonders what the government's position would be on that particular matter, given that it would serve to decrease levels of competition-something that I would have thought the government was trying to foster. Another important distinction between RSAs and superannuation funds is that many funds are in the practice of offering death and disability insurance as part of their overall benefit package. For many low income earning Australians, this is a service they would not otherwise be able to avail themselves of. RSAs are unlikely to offer such services or, indeed, if they did, it would be at prohibitive cost. For low income earners, RSAs do not offer the same type of superannuation cover as do superannuation funds. Of course, the government will also argue that the introduction of RSAs will solve the problems associated with small accounts. These accounts have in the past been heavily eaten into by administrative fees and charges, often resulting in negative returns. However, the introduction in 1995 of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act, which provides the Australian Taxation Office the opportunity to operate small accounts in such a way as to ensure that both fees and charges do not exceed earnings, has done much to address this problem. To conclude, I outline the concerns of the opposition. There is no trustee structure within the RSA arrangements. The possibilities of informed choice are diminished concomitantly with a possible rise in coercion in terms of which fund an employee is directed at by his or her employer. As I have said before in my submission, we are also concerned about the low rates of return, and that bogie of the government, the ACTU, of course, shares these concerns but would support the amendments the opposition is seeking to make. The opposition is to vote in support of these bills but will be looking to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to investigate these possible amendments.",109
259,Mr HOCKEY,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"Over the past five to 10 years there has been much discussion of the so-called greying of Australia. In 1901, only four per cent of the population of Australia was 65 or over. By 1961, the proportion of the population aged over 65 had more than doubled to 8.5 per cent. Today it is estimated to be approximately 13 per cent. In my electorate of North Sydney, according to the 1991 census, the proportion of the population aged 65 or more was slightly greater than the national average. It is anticipated that the ageing of the Australian population will continue, experiencing marked growth at the tum of the century and particularly after 2011. By 2030, close to 20 per cent of the Australian population will be 65 or over. By 2051, it will be one-third. While our ageing trend appears dramatic, it has not proceeded to the same degree as many other industrialised countries, particularly those in northern Europe. For example, in 1985 Norway and Sweden already had a greater proportion of persons over 65 than Australia expects to reach at the tum of the century. This is due in large part to the fact that Australia has sustained fairly high levels of immigration since World War II. The population ageing which has characterised Australia's demographic outlook is in part due to increased longevity; however, it is more significantly due to the fact that the baby boom was followed by a dramatic decline in the birth rate. Coinciding with this increase in the populacifically, tion of older Australians is the tendency for the age of retirement to actually decrease. In the 30-year period between 1966 and 1996, the labour force participation of people aged 55 and older fell from 33 per cent to 22 per cent. The trend towards earlier retirement, coupled with increased life expectancy, has prompted some to refer to retirement as a separate or third age, one almost as long as the working or second age. Indeed, today the period of economic dependency on the age pension or one's own savings, as the case may be, is often lengthy; 20 to 30 years is not uncommon for those retiring at the age of 55. It is interesting to note that the concept of retirement of any sort is a 20th century concept. The concept of a lengthy period of retirement is very modem. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most individuals simply worked until they were physically unable to do so, at which time their families became the providers of support and care. Most people were self-employed in agriculture or small businesses. Furthermore, far fewer people lived to an advanced age. The Australian age pension can trace its origins to the early years of this century and, in large part, is a result of the depression of the 1890s. Australia, despite its youth, was well ahead of the United States and Canada in this regard as the US did not introduce such a system until the 1930s and Canada did not introduce it until the 1920s. The institution of retirement gradually evolved through this century, but it was not until the mid1970s that Australia experienced rapid rates of retirement. Coincidentally, this came at the same time as the end of full employment. Australia's demographic outlook and the trend towards early retirement require government policies that facilitate the way in which people can make greater provision for their retirement during their working lives. Recognising that superannuation policy is central to coping with an ageing population and is an important vehicle for national savings, this government has undertaken a number of important and significant initiatives to make superannuation a fairer and more flexible retirement system for all Australians. Spefirstly, the government is meeting its election commitment to introduce a rebate of 18 per cent from 1 July 1997 for individuals who make contributions on behalf of spouses with low incomes. Secondly, the government will increase the general age limit for superannuation contributions from 65 to 70. Thirdly, the government will allow employees with incomes between $450 and $900 a month to choose between superannuation guarantee contributions or the equivalent as wages or salary. For those families running a small business, the government is introducing its promised capital gains exemption on the sale of small businesses where the proceeds are used for retirement purposes. This exemption will operate in a manner consistent with the announcement in the budget to provide capital gains tax rollover relief for small businesses. Finally, the government intends to allow banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to pr-JVide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of retirement savings accounts, also known as RSAs, through the implementation of the Retirement Savings Account Bill 1996, which is what we are discussing today. Retirement savings accounts are a simple, low cost, low risk investment product especially suited to those with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant or casual workers, those wishing to amalgamate small amounts of superannuation and those nearing retirement who may wish to minimise risk. This bill forms part of a package of three bills that serve to implement the government's 1996 budget decision regarding retirement savings accounts-the RSAs. The government believes that retirement savings accounts play an important role in increasing choice in superannuation by giving employees greater scope to control the investment of their superannuation savings. Retirement savings accounts also play an important role in increasing competition by, firstly, raising the standard of service in the delivery in the superannuation industry; secondly, encouraging greater product innovation and diversity; and, thirdly, placing downward pressure on fees and charges. Existing legislation requires a trustee structure as a condition to receiving concessional tax treatment. This bill, however, allows specified prudentially supervised institutions-that is, banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies-to provide superannuation in the form of RSAs without a trust structure from 1 July 1997. Through the government's RSA reforms, these institutions will be able to provide superannuation directly off their balance sheet, facilitating more cost-efficient delivery of superannuation without compromising the security of member benefits. Of course, it is not the intent of the government that RSAs replace existing superannuation funds. Rather, it is intended that the availability of RSAs will expand the range of options for consumers. The provision of retirement savings accounts will benefit employees who have broken work patterns, as RSAs will offer a flexible product to accommodate small and irregular contributions. RSAs will benefit the approximately two million Australians, or around 22 per cent of the total work force, who are involved in part-time employment, many of whom work with a number of different employers. RSAs will benefit the approximately 15,000 North Sydney citizens who are employed on a part-time basis. RSAs will be of particular benefit to women who stop work or work on a part-time or part-year basis to have children and contribute to the raising of a family. Approximately one-third of working women in North Sydney are employed on a part-time basis. Part-time or casual workers often have a number of superannuation accounts with small balances that they make little or no effort to trace. The government believes that the retirement savings accounts may offer an attractive solution to this problem. I am very mindful of the time allowed for the debate. So I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA NA Motion (by Mr Ruddock)-by leaveagreed to: That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, and Retirement Savings Accounts Supervisory Levy Bill 1996 NA Motion (by Mr Ruddock) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Automotive Industry: Victoria",112
260,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The debate about the future of the auto industry which is going on in the Australian community and in this House today is very much a debate about regional economies and regional jobs. Yes, it is an issue to states such as South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. But, perhaps more importantly, it is an even more important issue in regions such as Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong and places such as Taree, Nowra, Albury and Orange, just to name a few. It is for that reason that I suggest to the House that the auto industry and the auto components industry play a significant role in building healthy regional economies and building good jobs-real jobs-in regional Australia. Last week the shadow ministry visited Ballarat. The shadow minister for industry and regional development, Mr Crean, and I also visited Bendigo. During the course of those visits we had cause to sit down and meet with the local communities-their mayors, their councillors, the editors of local papers, business leaders, community leaders, teachers, young people and union people. Their message was simple. From the point of view of the auto industry, it was about the need for a sense of security and the question of jobs, concern about the important role that the auto component industries play in their local towns, the prosperity they create and the need to ensure that, once and for all, the debate about the future of their industry is settled. Take the town of Ballarat, for example, where there are 1,500 jobs directly related to this industry. Similarly in Bendigo. Empire Rubber has today announced, in association with the announcement by the Labor Party yesterday going to the question of tariffs, further investment. I also called upon the coalition government to ensure that they adopt a bipartisan stance with respect to the Labor Party's announcements on industry policy and the future of the automotive industry. It effectively means that both political parties-all politicians-stand side by side on the need to ensure that this industry survives into the future. It is for that reason that the Labor Party has brought forward a proposition that tariffs in the automotive industry remain at 15 per cent until 2005. The problem is unfortunately that, while the auto components industry is so important to both Bendigo and Ballarat, neither of the local coalition Mps-the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid)-has yet spoken out on this issue in this parliament. Both members should adopt, I suggest, a bipartisan stance on this issue. They should fight for the retention of a reasonable industry policy, and embrace the Labor Party's position as enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) yesterday. Mr Ronaldson and Mr Reid, I suggest to the House, should not be meek. Like some of their coalition colleagues from South Australia, they should stand their ground and ensure that local jobs in their local regions are protected. They should tell the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that they too are opposed to the cut in tariffs, that they too support an auto industry tariff at 15 per cent until at least the year 2005. I was disappointed to notice that, since the coalition was elected in March last year, neither the member for Bendigo nor the member for Ballarat has spoken out in parliament on this important issue, even though this industry is important for both job creation and the sense of security of the people of Ballarat and Bendigo. Take Ballarat: unemployment has reached 8.3 per cent. Take Bendigo: unemployment is at 10.5 per cent. Take Victoria: 30,000 jobs are directly related to the future of the auto and the auto components industries. I would have thought that the representatives of the federal seats of Ballarat and Bendigo would have thought that the issue was so serious that they would have raised the issue in this parliament since being returned at the election held just on 12 months ago. But it seems that it is not important to either Mr Reid or Mr Ronaldson. You have got to understand that it extends even beyond Ballarat and Bendigo; it is an issue of the utmost importance to the state of Victoria. It affects places such as Altona, Bentleigh East, Brighton, Clayton, Dandenong, Epping, Fairfield, Oakleigh, Preston, Richmond, Reservoir and Thomastown, to name a few towns in Victoria. In my own electorate of Batman it affects 1,200 jobs. I ask the coalition to seriously consider putting aside petty politics and to face up to the question of securing the future of this industry. If it is good enough for the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria and the Premier to stand together on the future of the industry in Victoria, then it is good enough for the representatives of Ballarat and Bendigo to face up to their electoral responsibilities, and the question of job security which was seriously embraced in the Labor Party's announcement on industry policy in the automotive industry in Victoria. (Time expired) Shoal care Elders Program",114
261,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak with pride and enthusiasm on yet another initiative of the Gilmore electorate and the Shoalhaven community in particular. Like many electorates in rural and regional Australia, Gilmore suffers from high youth unemployment-in excess of 30 per cent. Since this government took office some 12 months ago, many initiatives have been instigated to assist young people to get work. I would like to introduce members to a new and exciting program being developed in my electorate that I am sure could be considered as the embryo of a major youth program across Australia: a Shoalhaven youth support organisation called Shoalcare-which manages a number of youth services, including the Shoalhaven Youth Refuge, the aunties and uncles program and a non-funded residential hostel and time-out house-has developed a program called 'bring back the elders', which is sponsored by Rotary International. The bring back the elders program is just that. It is unashamedly turning the clock back to when the more mature, experienced and motivated members of the tribe led, taught and encouraged their young to develop the skills, attitudes and momentum to contribute to the tribe's well-being. We may not live in tribes any more, but we do have many who could be described as modem day elders. They occur in every sphere, stratum and job within society. They may be acknowledged by virtue of their position or their fame or known only to the one person whose life they have positively altered. It is these life winners that the program uses to help our youth climb out of the mind numbing welfare dependency to which we have condemned many of them. The program is about us, the community, retrieving the responsibility we delegated by our neglect to government, to schools and to the streets. The bring back the elders proglam is designed to assist our elders contribute in a positive W<ly to the lives of the youth in our society. It is designed to put back hope into the lives of our kids and to put meaning into the lives of the elders who do care. The program is not welfare-it is the opposite. It is about giving youth a hand when they want to do better and are wiling to make every effort to try. It is a process of supporting with understanding, helping with knowledge, educating with experience, leading by example and living with respect. This process has worked for 200,000 years. It is only recently that we have delegated the responsibility for our youth to people who, although they may be well versed in theory, have yet to develop the essential qualities that are so important in being an elder. The understanding of wider community issues, life's pitfalls and benefits, leadership skills and the respect of others are not subjects learnt from a book or at a university; they are learnt by ordinary people as they live productive and fulfilling lives. It is a fact that in our modem society the experience gained by our older population is lost to the youth of today. The bring back the elders program is designed to utilise that wasted experience by providing the older people in our community with the opportunity to pass on their knowledge to receptive youth. The program works by attracting older, experienced, caring people who are willing to assist in projects created by and for our youth with enthusiastic encouragement, practical demonstrations, intellectual research and just by being someone to learn from. These projects will be developed with the assistance of service clubs and community groups under the guidance of program managers. The program works by the provision of training sites, development programs, seminars, access business networks, literacy and numeracy development and conferences. It is led by a panel of elders. The coordination of the program is by Shoalcare, with the support of service clubs and sponsorship by the private sector and the media. It must be remembered that to gain the assistance of these older people, it is vital that the programs they become involved with are seen to be having a positive outcome for the youth. The elders are not going to put a great deal of effort and time into what they perceive to be a lost cause. Each project and activity which develops under the program must contain strategies to ensure that each participating youth grows and can clearly be seen to have gained something through the program. To sum up, the essence of the program is for every child in Australia to be given the opportunity to work in an environment that builds self-esteem for themselves and respect for their elders. There is no reason why the government, the private sector and the community should not support programs like the bring back the elders program, which has the potential to significantly reduce unemployment in regional and rural Australia, particularly in the Shoalhaven. I fully support the program and I am confident that such excellent initiatives as this one in Gilmore will always have the support of the government. Postal Services",115
262,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this place for the second time this week to draw the attention of the House to the quality and calibre of people who live in the suburb of Carrum Downs in my electorate of Isaacs. Earlier this week I drew the attention of the House to the plight faced by residents of the GK Tucker Settlement run by the Brotherhood of St Laurence within Carrum Downs and the problems that they face with regard to potential nursing home charges. On this occasion I rise again to put to the House the need for a post office in Carrum Downs. Residents of this fast growing area were thrilled when a major shopping complex was opened in November 1994. For the first time it meant that residents of the Downs, as it is affectionately known, could have access to a range of shops that they had never before had access to, including a National Australia Bank and a Rainbow supermarket. What the centre did need to really crank up business in the area and to attract other potential traders and shop owners to the complex was a post office to serve the 14,000 residents of Carrum Downs, given that the nearest post office is some four kilometres away in Lathams Road in the nearby suburb of Seaford. Carrum Downs has a large population, which perhaps forms a cross-section of the Australian community, comprising young families, sole parents and many older residents, including some who live at the GK Tucker Settlement. They often have to struggle long distances to get to the aforementioned post office in Lathams Road, Seaford. Many of those people were signatories to a petition, which circulated with my support throughout Carrum Downs when, as the then candidate for Isaacs, I was pushing Australia Post to agree with centre management to the establishment of a post office at the Hall Road shopping centre. I have been in regular contact with shopping centre management since that time, in particular, Ms Christine Grayland, who has had many discussions with Australia Post since she wrote to them in December 1994. They responded in that same month, suggesting that a post office was unlikely. I am pleased to say that following regular intervention of people like myself and senior members of the Carrum Downs community, it would appear that a monetary offer has now been submitted hy Australia Post to centre management. Negotiations will now proceed between the parties for the establishment of a post office. Without seeking to intervene in any way in what are clearly private negotiations between the parties, I certainly urge the parties to come to a reasonable arrangement and financial settlement as quickly as possible, given that Carrum Downs residents have not been afforded the opportunity of access to a post office now since many of them moved to the Carrum Downs area up to 15 and more years ago. I know that the establishment of a post office will delight shop owners, no more so than news agent, Mr Trevor Waterfall, who was one of the catalysts for generating the aforementioned petition which was signed by 5,000 local residents. I again implore the parties to reach an expeditious and equitable settlement which will ensure that all residents of this rapid growth area are rightly serviced by a proper Australia Post retail outlet. Unemployment",116
263,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (5.43 p.m.)-Earlier this evening the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) rose to talk about industry tariffs. I would like to have a little chat to the member for Batman via the House. He came into the House and talked about the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and me in relation to the question of tariffs. This is the same man who has been coming into Ballarat and Bendigo and talking about high levels of unemployment and bad-mouthing both regions for the last six months. This is the man who has displayed the most appalling level of hypocrisy in relation to unemployment. The only claim to fame that the member for Batman has is that as President of the ACTU he oversaw the highest levels of unemployment in this country in the postDepression era. The member for Batman is not the shadow minister for employment. He is the man who has around his neck the noose of the unemployed in this country. For him to stand up here day after day and use these petty political stunts that he does in regional centres such asMr MCMullan-He got under your skin, didn'the?",117
264,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I will get onto you in a second-Bendigo and Ballarat is just nothing more than utter hypocrisy. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party in relation to unemployment in centres such as Ballarat and Bendigo is no more clearly evidenced than by the effort of Senator Carr in Senate estimates the other evening. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Are we adopting a new practice here where parliamentary secretaries or members of the executive make adjournment speeches?",117
265,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"You have no point of order. The only member standing seeking the call was the honourable member for Ballarat. I would extend the same courtesies to members of the opposition. Mr Leo MCLeay-Would you extend that courtesy to a minister, Mr Speaker, if a minister stood and sought to",117
266,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"If he was the only person standing, yes. Resume your seat.",117
267,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"What an appalling effort from our honourable friend the member for Watson to take up time. It will not work. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. There was no intention on my part to take up the time of the House. I had a valid point of order. This is the first time in the 18 years I have been a member of this parliament that I have seen a member of the executive allowed to take up the time of a backbencher. The normal practice in this House is that, if a member of the executive wishes to intervene in the adjournment debate, that member of the executive asks for the debate to be continued and deals with the matters that might have been brought up in the debate. Members of the executive do not have the right to take up the time allocated for private members, even though that might be what the government now intends to let them do.",117
268,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I thank the honourable member for Watson. Resume your seat.,117
269,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Batman talked about high levels of unemployment in places like Ballarat and Bendigoand there are-and that is the responsibility of the member for Batman, not this government. What did Senator Carr from the other place say in Senate estimates when talking about the pilot apprenticeship shops introduced by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who is at the table, to address high unemployment levels in regional centres such as Ballarat and Bendigo-a legacy of the former government? He said that none of these pilot programs were in areas of high unemployment, and he had the gall to attack a pilot apprenticeship shop going into Ballarat as part of our endeavour to solve the Labor Party's unemployment problem in regional Australia. In relation to the issue of tariffs, I point out that I was on the front page of the Australian, as indeed was the member for Bendigo, pre1993, when we single-handedly took on the then opposition policy on tariffs. We had it amended before the election. We said it must be tied to micro-economic reform. That is what has happened. I am very proud of my record in relation to tackling the tariff debate in my region. The member for Batman should be acutely aware that the government has made no decision whatsoever in relation to the Productivity Commission's inquiry. At the end of the day the government and no-one else will decide what happens post-2000. I do not appreciate the great job destroyer, the member for Batman, coming in here and talking about unemployment. (Time expired) Apprenticeship Program Karen Refugees",117
270,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who is at the table, might take the opportunity after 6 0' clock to answer some of the questions that Senator Carr raised. Whilst I acknowledge that there is high unemployment in Ballarat, the point that Senator Carr was making about the apprenticeship one-stop shops is that only four were nominated for Victoria. As I understand it, they are Ballarat, Bendigo, Wangaratta and Ringwood. The only press report I have seen about this scheme indicated that perhaps it was aimed at rural centres. Ringwood is not a rural centre. There are 18 throughout the nation and a number of them are in capital cities. The point that is being made inMr Ronaldson-Does Ballarat need one? Does Ballarat deserve one or not?",118
271,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I have acknowledged that, Michael. But the point is that areas like the one I represent, which has the highest unemployment of all regions in Victoria, have yet again missed out on another program. If these offices are being allocated on the basis of need and ensuring we get the most effective outcomes possible, I want to know why the north-east suburbs of Melbourne are missing out. Exactly the same thing happened with the pathways scheme for schools. If these programs are as good as they are claimed to be, why is it that the areas with the highest unemployment are missing out? I have been a little distracted from what I had originally wished to raise in tonight's adjournment debate. It is a serious matter, and I am very pleased to see that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) is in the House. He was the deputy leader, a very cooperative deputy leader, of a parliamentary delegation to Thailand and Singapore in late 1995. He will recall that we visited camps on the Thai-Burmese border of displaced people of the Karen ethnic group who had come across the border because of the difficulties in the hills and lands that they lived in in Burma. I was very saddened to read several reports in the media in the last couple of weeks about increased activity which has driven an additional 20,000 Karen refugees across the border into Thailand. What was even more distressing was a report from the Australian of 17 February which stated: On the nights of January 28 and 29, DKBAwhich is the Democratic Karen Buddhist Armyforces torched three camps inside Thai territory, leaving at least 4500 refugees homeless, one child and a Thai merchant dead. In the border town of Mae Sot, 480km north-west of Bangkok, near the 6830-strong Huay Kalak refugee camp which the DKBA partially destroyed, fears are growing of further attacks. I believe that this Huay Kalok camp, regrettably, is the camp that the delegation visited. When you have had the personal contact that the honourable member for Corangamite and I have had with these people, who are basically a peaceful people who would like to be able to return to their land in Burma and to live peacefully, these reports are very distressics ing. I note that when the Thai foreign minister was here over the last couple of days he and the Australian government agreed that there is a need, to achieve an effective outcome in Burma, to enter into proper dialogue and proper ventures with the Burmese government. Indeed, the delegation, when looking at the border region, were taken to a ThaiBurmese friendship bridge that was being put into facilitate trade across the border. That led us to understand the difficult position that the Thai government are in. We acknowledge the work the Thai government are doing with the Karen people. We know the difficulties they have in the use of their security forces to be able to protect people that are in these camps. But I hope that they will continue to try to do the right thing by the Karen people. I hope the international community-including Australia, which has provided aid to the camps-will continue to do this through the Burmese border consortium and the funding of such organisations as Medecins sans Frontieres. This is very important. It is very distressing when you see people being driven from their lands are in such danger. (Time expired) Immunisation",118
272,Mrs JOHNSTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to congratulate the federal Minister for Health and Family Services, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), on his seven-point immunisation initiative, which he announced in this place earlier in the week. It was equally encouraging to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) support the measures and I am delighted by this bipartisan support. I believe that there is no more important issue than our children's health. As a nation, we are fortunate to have the technology to protect our children against preventable diseases. Indeed, we should be doing everything in our power to use this to its optimum. Around 98 per cent of Australian parents support immunisation of their children. However, this is not translating into action. Statistshow that Australia has appalling levels of immunisation. It is no less than a national disgrace that the immunisation rate is approximately 53 per cent. The immunise Australia program aims to have 90 per cent of children up to two years of age fully immunised, and after that we envisage near universal coverage for children up to the age of six. I remember well the day I took my two young sons to be immunised. Those were the days when children could not attend kindergarten nor school without confirmation that they had been immunised. However, anecdotal and actual evidence suggests that over the last eight to 10 years this is no longer the case. It is indeed difficult to believe that in a country like Australia we have children dying from preventable diseases. As a nurse, I found it was rare to come across children with diseases such as diphtheria, polio and rubella. It was thought that these were things of the past. So it seems a sad irony that some years down the track these diseases have come back to haunt us through our own complacency and inaction. Parents who do not fully immunise their children not only put their own children at risk but also put other children in serious danger of contracting a preventable disease. The four children who died of whooping cough in New South Wales last year caught this disease from some older children who had not been immunised. It is indeed a tragedy that these deaths occurred. Much has been written in the press over the past few months about Australia's low level of immunisation. Because of its importance, I recently conducted a survey in my electorate of Canning asking people their views on immunisation. The survey was timed to coincide with the beginning of the school year and showed that many parents were concerned that their children were at risk of contracting preventable diseases. Ninety-seven per cent of those parents who answered the survey favoured immunisation for their children, and I am positive that they will welcome the measures announced by the government to boost immunisation levels. As many commentators have noted this week, the government will be using a range of carrots and sticks to guarantee that the levels are increased. These measures have been fully outlined by the minister for health in his ministerial statement on Tuesday and I do not intend to go into details here today. Suffice it to say that I commend the incentive to restructure the maternity allowance for parents so as to provide a bonus for ensuring that their child's immunisation coverage is complete. In this week's edition of the Bulletin there  St Jude Children's Research Hospital in the United States. This letter was obviously written before the minister's announcement. However, I thought it worthwhile to mention part of what Mr Doherty had to say. He said: It may be hard to deal with a child crying following a vaccination. It is infinitely more difficult to live with the knowledge that your child has died, or is debilitated in the long term, as a consequence of completely preventable infection. Legislation is clearly needed to ensure all Australian children are immunised. The honourable member for Chisholm has stated that he has no intention of going down in history as a health minister who sat idle on his hands while Australian children died of vaccine preventable illnesses. I congratulate the minister on having the political mettle and courage to introduce these measures and see them through. Question resolved in the affirmative.

(2) Do ASC investigators have express power of entry; if not, are individuals informed of this. (3) Can ASC investigators alter forms; if not, has his attention been drawn to a notice to require the production of books issued by the Victorian Regional Office of the ASC on 10 December 1992 concerning the affairs of Safety ROPS (Aust) Pty Ltd, where the name of the addressee purportedly was altered by an investigator. (4) Do ASC investigators have the same responsibilities and face the same penalties for tendering incomplete, altered or misleading information as do individuals. (5) Is the ASC able to use evidence which it is found was obtained by inappropriate means. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) that ASC investigators do inform individuals of their rights under the Corporations Law. (2) ASC investigators have the power to inspect company records at the company's registered office during normal business hours, and express power of entry when search warrants have been issued. (3) Where an ASC investigator has drafted a compulsory notice and signed it as a delegate of the ASC, he or she may make appropriate changes to the identity and the address of the person upon whom the notice is to be served. (4) ASC investigators are required to act and professionally at all times in the exercise of their powers and the discharge of their duties. However, section 246 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 provides that an ASC investigator acting in good faith in the performance of any delegated function or the exercise of any NA delegated power is not liable to an action or other proceeding for damages. (5) The ASC is subject to the same rules of evidence relating to unlawfully or improperly obtained evidence as any other person. Such evidence may be ruled inadmissible by a Court. Annual Budget Statements: Treasury Review (Question No. 983) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 November 1996: Further to his answers to questions Nos. 578 (Hansard, 18 November 1996, page 6997) and 633 (Hansard, 18 November 1996, page 6999), does his Department prepare estimates of the impact of major Budget measures on private savings; if so, are these estimates then considered in the formulation of the Government's national savings strategy. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No, the Department does not prepare estimates of the impact of individual Budget measures on private savings. As noted in Question No. 578, the effect on private saving of individual Budget measures cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy because of the difficulty of separating out the effect of other influences on private saving. ABC Television Reception: Perth (Question No. 997) Mr Filing asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: Has the Minister's attention been drawn to complaints concerning the poor quality of ABC television reception in the northern suburbs of Perth; if so, will the Minister initiate appropriate action to provide a satisfactory service. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for honestly Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes. The National Transmission Agency, which is responsible for the terrestrial transmission of all national broadcasting services, has recently become aware of complaints suggesting a general deterioration in the reception of ABC Television in certain parts of northern Perth, particularly affecting a small number of residents in Ocean Reef and Gwelup. An investigation conducted by an NT A officer, between 9 and 13 December 1996, has found that the NTA's facility which transmits ABC Television from Bickley is operating properly, and that the signal levels for both ABC and SBS television in the areas concerned are normal. The Agency has informed me that the perception that reception of ABC Television had deteriorated appears to stem from the poor siting and/or poor quality of domestic reception equipment in some households. In two cases, the source of a recent deterioration was, in fact, interference caused by domestic alarm systems installed in the houses of persons complaining about poor reception. Treasury: Expenditure on Hire Car Costs for Ministerial Travel (Question No. 1014) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 December 1996: What were the hire car costs to the Minister's Department for ministerial travel between I March and I September (a) 1995 and (b) 1996. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A search of the records indicates that there were no private hire car costs met by the department for ministerial travel. Costs associated with ministerial use of Commonwealth cars (COMCAR) for each financial year will continue to be published regularly by the Minister of Administrative Services. Bradman Museum Foundation (Question No. 1105) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (I) When did the Minister approve the $100,000 allocated to the Bradman Museum Foundation. (2) Did the Minister receive representations for the funds to be allocated; if so, (a) from whom and (b) when. (3) Does the purpose of the grant comply with the guidelines for the three programs from which it is sourced. (4) Are the three components of the grant the largest individual items in each of their respective programs. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Minister approved a grant of $100,000 to the Bradman Museum Foundation on 13 June 1996. (2) Yes (a) Representations about a possible contribution were received from the Prime Minister's office on behalf of the Bradman Museum Foundation. (b) Representations were made in April 1996. (3) Yes. (4) No. Treasury: Territories Expenditure (Question No. 1124) Mrs Johnston asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: Did the Minister's Department or instrumentalities under the Minister's control expend sums in 1995-96 in the respect of (a) the Australian Antarctic Territory, (b) the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, (c) the Territory of Christmas Island, (d) the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, (e) the Coral Sea Islands Territory, (f) the Territory of Heard Island and MCDonald Islands or (g) Norfolk Island; if so, what (a) sum was expended and (b) was the purpose of each expenditure. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: During the financial year 1995-96, the Australian Bureau of Statistics made payments of $2,500 and $7,700 to field assistants/interpreters employed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the Cocos Keeling Islands and Christmas Island respectively. The staff were employed to assist in the undertaking of a Household Expenditure Survey.",155
