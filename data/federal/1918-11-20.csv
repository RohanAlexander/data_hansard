2,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Acting Minister for the Navy a quesMinister tion arising out of the following published statement:Mr Harmon, managing director of the ping and Trading Agency, is reported to expressed the opinion that the Handa Isle struck one of the floating mines which was recently seen off the coast, and which were parently still a source of danger. Is the Minister of the opinion that the distinction, wreckage reported to have been discovered soldiers is that of the Handa Islef Has any eviceive dence been produced that would suggest that the barquentirio in question was wrecked as the result of striking a mine, and will he make a statement to with reference to Mr Harrison's reported remarks; which willj no doubt, be viewed with alarm 'by the travelling public? MT: POYNTON - The discovery of certain wreckage has been reported to me, but so far there has been_no official mation as to its identification. I have knowledge of the reason upon which the statement quoted by the honourable member, and published in this morning's newspapers, is baaed. As to the vessel being wrecked as the result of striking a mine ",21
3,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"It is only guesswork.  time we have had trawlers scouring our coastal waters in various localities. The work was discontinued only last week, when it iwas reported to me that the Naval authorities were satisfied that all necessary action had been taken, and that, to the best of their belief the sea was - now free from mines. ANZAOS ON FURLOUGH ",21
4,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In connection with the reported decision to reduce the furlough of returning ANZACs from sixty days to twenty-eight days, will the Assistant - Minister for Defence ask his colleague, the Minister for Defence, in view of the. great services which these men have rendered to Australia and humanity, to reconsider the question, and to permit the full furlough, of sixty days !",21
5,Mr WISE,Unknown,I will. SOLDIERS IN OAMP.,21
6,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"f wish to ask the representing the Minister for - Defence whether it is--a fact that those soldiers who have been in camp for six Shipmonths will receive a silver Imperial have Service Badge, and that the remainder had will receive only discharge certificates as apa war record ? If this is so, will the Minister take steps to .remove this invidious and to see that all those who have entered camp will rea badge that will clearly indicate - service? - enlisted in their country's that .they :",21

8,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"When news of the armistice came through, Lt - Colonel Scott, intiofficer commanding a camp' of Citizen. no Forces in training at Bendigo, is reported to have refused a request on the part of the men ""for a holiday. It is further reported that serious trouble ensued, and that numbers of returned officers tendered their resignations. ""Will the Minister have an inquiry and see that we do not lose the services of these officers? - Mr Wise - I shall have an inquiry made. PRICE OF BUTTER,",21
9,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In view of the contract made with the Imperial Government for the supply of butter and the very - much reduced rates ruling for butter for - consumption in Australia, as well as the fact that the output is rapidly diminish- . ing, will the Minister for Price Fixing review the question of local prices, with the object of giving the butter-producers the benefit of the natural market?",22

PRICE OF WHEAT .  appearing in the' press that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is endeavouring to sell 1,000,000 tons of wheat to the I m perial Government, I desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister a telegram that I have received from the general secretary of .the Farmers and .Settlers Association of New South Wales, urging that in view of the shipping exigencies and the increased demand for wheat in Europe, the Government should protect the interests of the farmers and if possible not sell wheat in the pool at less than 6s. per bushel. Will the honourable gentleman take this matter into consideration?",22
13,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Government cannot be guided by the secretary of .the Farmers and Settlers Association in such important matters as those' relating to the position of foodstuffs in Europe, or as to the possible release of shipping. The Government, rightly or wrongly, are of opinion that they know a little more about the matter than the gentleman referred to. We are guided largely in our views of the position by the Australian Wheat Board, and, as I announced in the press this morning, we have sent a cablegram on the recommendation of the Board to the Prime Minister, asking him to effect a 1,000,000 tons sale at the minimum price of 4s. 9d. CENTRAL WHEAT BOARD. REPRESENTATION OF FARMERS.  tions now proceeding between the Central Wheat Board and the Imperial Government in regard to the sale of wheat, and in view of the fact that the Central Wheat Board is not adequately representative of wheat-growers of Australia, and, fura ther, in view of the fact that the State that Governments have failed to appoint in local representatives, will the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) take the matter into his own hands, and at once appoint representative farmers so that they negotiate on matters affecting the sale of wheat?",22
14,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I was under the impression that the view of the farmers generally was that the Commonwealth Government have taken too much into their own hands, and that that was why they desired representatives appointed' from amongst the farmers. ",22
15,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I made, in due course, at the suggestion of the Central Wheat Board, a proposal to the four States concerned that they should take steps to see that a representative farmer was sent from each State. ",22
16,Mr LYNCH,Unknown,"Send real farmers, not men of the bogus class. - Mr Watt - I did not know tb.aftb.ere were .different classes of farmers, but I - am now told there 'are by an honourable member who is an expert and a fanner.",22
17,Mr LYNCH,Unknown,Exactly ; I see you.understand the position!,23
18,Mr WATT,Unknown,I do not think it would effect a. cure if I were to withdraw the ' offer I have made and made appointments myself. I fancy there would be considerable grumbling if the central national authority selected one man from each of the States on its own initiative.  time to appoint representatives,23
19,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I thought the honourable member imagined that I had given too much time. I shall, however, ask the States to either accept or refuse the invitation, and, if it is refused, I shall have to sketch out another course for the Government. SALES OF WHEAT . COMMISSION - Tariff?",23
20,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I desire to know whether the London - Selling and Delivery Board will receive commission on sales of the 1917-18 wheat crop, respecting which the Acting Prime Minister (Mr 'Watt) has cabled to Mr Hughes; and, if so, will the co-operative companies handling wheat under the Wheat Pool, who have been promised favourable consideration as to representatives in London, participate in such commission? MrW ATT - I cannot say, but I shall inquire from the Minister in charge of the Wheat Board. SPANISH INFLUENZA.",23
21,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In view of the statements that have been cabled informing us that the disease known as Spanish influenza has' proved more deadly to the American soldiers than the dangers of war, has the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) consulted the Cabinet, and, if not, will he do so, in order that the Government may invite all medical men to volunteer their services so that we may be organized to meet this dread disease, that is at present only checked hy our quarantine regulations?",23
22,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I think the steps already taken with a 'view to an ""organization of - the character tihe honourable member suggests will prove effective if the disease does brealk 'through the quarantine barriers. ""We have every reason to congratulate ourselves that so far quarantine has :proved effective, and that the disease is being cleaned up in the quarantine area. I can assure the honourable member that the matter is having the closest possible attention of the Government, and nothing we can do will be left undone to combat the disease if it should - break through quarantine. ' TARIFF REVISION.",23
23,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"In view of the fact that peace - has practically been achieved by the armistice will the Government-give immediate attention to the subject of Tariff revision, with the view to an early introduction of an amended",23
24,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I know .and appreciate the interest which the honourable member has displayed in this subject for so .many' years. It is not, however, quite right to say that peace has practically arrived. I can imagine, after a study of the speeches of - President Wilson and his celebrated fourteen points that questions of Tariff revision will be considered at the Peace Conference. Until then it may not he prudent for Australia to act. In the meantime the Government are fully alive to the position, and are watching it carefully.",23
25,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Are we to understand from .the answer given by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) that it is quite possible that this Parliament and the people of Australia are likely to lose some of their self-governing power by the decision of the Peace Conference?,23
26,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,The Acting Prime Minister never said so.,23
27,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am putting .the question to the Acting Prime Minister, and not to the honourable member. Mr Watt;-Of course, strictly speaking, this is a question - arising out of an answer to another question, but as the Leaderofthe Opposition (Mr Tudor) desires. information, I tell him that no^ thing I . have, said, should lead him to understand what he; has suggested. iHOOE WORM :",23
28,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"- Will the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) say, whether the Government contemplate taking, any action iin the direction of co-operating with the Queensland Government ih combating the hook worm disease now so prevalent.in Northern Queensland? Has the Government contributed in any way towards the researches made hy Dr Waite into the ravages caused by this disease?.",24
29,Mr WATT,Unknown,"My colleague/, the Minr ister for Home and Territories (Mr. Glynn.) has, I understand, been for some time in close contact with Dr Waite, and - those concerned in these investigations, and I believe that he has arranged, for a demonstration,, as one may call, it, on the hook worm subject. So far as. I know, we have not yetcontributed anything;' but the question is how far we may cooperate with and help, the States totackle this subject, and I think the Minister is considering-that question. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",24
30,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"With the permission! of the' House-1 desire to. make a personal explanation. When, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt.), wasanswering a question of mine yesterday the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) made a remark to me in connection with the subject. I h my reply to. the honourable member for-Perth, I said that what had been stated was false, and I unfortunatelyspoke so', loudly as to be heard by the Acting Prime Minister and others. I wish the: House to understand, that I had not the slightest desire or inclination to offend the Acting. Prime Minr - ister. I quite realise the position of the honourable gentleman when he was answering the question I had submitted, and..I very much regret having, spoken so loudly. I wish to make it,- as I say, quite clear that I had not the slightest intention to offend the honourable gentleman, and I sincerely regret it if I did so..",24
31,Mr WATT,Unknown,"May . I , with the. permissionof the House, say one word. Of course the incident to which, the honourable member referswas. very unpleasant to myself, as, well as to him.. Butimmediately the incident, closed., the. honourable member was good enough to inform me by letter that which he has now statedto the House,, and I at once apprised him that I accepted' his: explanationin the spirit in which it was tendered. PROTECTION OF NEW INDUSTRIES.",24
32,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he is yet in a position to inform the House as to the scheme, if any, proposed by the Government to protect the new' industries which have grown up. in Australia during war time against outside competition after the war is over?",24
33,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I think, sir, that you have, ruled on many, occasions' that Go.>vernment policy ought not to beelicited by questionswithout notice from honourable members. I am not. at the present time, prepared to respond, to the invita r tion. of the honourable; member.. WHEAT POOL Mi--. RICHARD FOSTER - In view, of a. suggestion, mentioned"" in, the House last week,. I ask the - Acting Prime Minister whether the Central Wheat Board have considered the possibility of making a 1 further advance,, and, if so,, what: deter-, mina-tion they have come' to ? Mi-: WATT - T informed honourable members yesterday, in answer to a: ques: tion, that the Central. Wheat Board had met yesterday, but I havereceivedno word yet as towhether they have any re*commendation to make to the Government, on the matter referred to by the honourable member. MRFEATHERSTON S REMEDIES-. J",24
34,Mr NIQHOLLS,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Minister for Defence if he will give consideration: to the request made, by Mr. Featherston, the inventor of certain medicine, and will permit that gentleman - to give a demonstration of the value of his medicine?",24
35,Mr WISE,Unknown,I shall submit the matter to the Minister for Defence. NA,24
36,Mr WEST,SYDNEY QUARANTIN E,"I ask the Act in g P r i m e Minister whether he can in for m the House and the p u b l i c as to the steps bei n g taken to remove the f e a r a r is in g from the mismanagement of those c o n t r o l l i ng the Quarantine Station at No r t h Head, Sydney ?",25
37,Mr WATT,SYDNEY QUARANTIN E,"As I promised the honourable member on the adjournment last night, I asked the Minister in charge of quarantine to communicate with the Director of Quarantine in the matter straight way. I understand that he has received two reports from the Director, which I have no doubt he will lay before the House.",25
38,Mr MASSYGREENE,SYDNEY QUARANTIN E,"The following reports have been handed to me by the D i r e c to r of Q u a r a n t in e, and Is u b m it the m for the in for m at i o n of honourable members:The Comptroller-General. W it h reference to complaints in the daily press amongst the passengers on the steamer Atua, concerning conditions at the Quarantine Station, Sydney, the following facts have been ascertained on inquiry:2. The principal complaint is the condition of the rooms in which the passengers were accommodated. There was a very heavy strain on the resources of the Station during last week, several big passenger vessels following eacholher in quick succession. Although the rooms were cleaned out by the stewards of the vessel which was .just completing its period of quarantine, it was impossible for the staff, available to absolutely insure the degree of cleanliness which is required under routine conditions, without subjecting the passengers to further delay on the vessel in harbour. This course of detaining the passengers on the steamer was adopted in all the other vessels, giving sufficient time to have the quarters cleaned; but, in the case of the Atua, the disease was so virulent, and spreading so ; rapidly, that it was imperative to land the patients and all contacts at the earliest possible moment. The risk of retaining them on the ship was greater than the inconvenience caused by occupying rooms not superficially clean. 3. Some difficulty has been experienced during last week in Sydney, owing in the first place to the very great difficulty in getting reliable medical staff on account of the shortage of doctors, and on account of the jubilations in .Sydney, it was impossible to get temporary assistance of other kinds. The infection risk and the fear of contracting the disease was also a material faefpr in contributing to this difficulty. 4. The statement as.to the distinctly ill persons visiting others is quite inaccurate. There is a regular inspection of all persons, and any STATION. person showing suspicious symptoms is at once removed. 5. The electric light is turned off at -10.15 p.m., as the Regulations prescribe that lights shall be out on a Quarantine Station about 10.30 p.m. Some Regulation of this kind is absolutely essential to the maintenance of reasonable order on the Station. 6. In the telephone rooms, there is kept a bowl of solution and a cloth, so that any person can clean the receivers. It would be quite impossible to have sufficient staff to clean the receiver after each person has used it . 7. The-statement that there is no laundry is quite inaccurate, as there is a .steam laundry capable of handling large quantities of material. 8. Ice is not supplied to passengers under any circumstances, as there does not seem to be any necessity for doing so. 9. The food complaint is not given in sufficient detail to be quite understood, and there haa_ been no complaint received in respect of patients in hospital. All catering for the passengers, other than those in hospital, is carried out .by the ship's company-the Purser being responsible. 10. In the case of the Atua, one unavoidable factor did contribute to initial confusion? The Chief Steward came ashore in accordance with the usual practice, and allotted the rooms for the passengers. Before the passengers were landed, however, the Chief Steward himself went down with a severe attack of influenza, and has since died. At the time of the steward's removal, the landing was in progress, and the confusion arose owing to passengers seizing the best rooms, and a re-allotment having to be forcibly instituted in order to provide the best accommodation for ladies and families. J. H. L. CUMPSTON, Director of Quarantine. - 19th November, 1918. The Comptroller-General. It will also be of interest in connection with Mr West's statements to state the following:- Fourteen ships . have been dealt with in quarantine in Sydney, with a total personnel of approximately 3,500 within the last fortnight. 2. The infection has been kept within such limits that no persons have been infected beyond those presumably infected before the application of the prescribed measures. 3. F u l l preparations and accommodation will have been made, and full staff available, before the arrival of the troopships from New Zealand. 4. The staff at Sydney has necessarily been working at high pressure, and should be given full credit for the fact that all infection has been .kept under control, and the entry of the disease into ' Australia so far absolutely prevented. - J. H. L. CUMPSTON, Director of Quarantine. 20th November, 1918. NA RESIDENT S OF AUSTRALIA .",25
39,Mr LIVINGSTON,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"In view of the fact that, during the visit of French parliamentary delegates to Edinburgh, it was pointed out that the French Parliament passed an Act naturalizing any Scots""man going to"" France, and making him capable of bearing any honour, inheriting any lands, and enjoying any offices and dignities in that country, and that similarly and reciprocally t i e Scotch Parliament passed an Act making French subjects coming to Scotland ' ' in all times to come naturalized subjects of this realm, with the same privileges and faculties,"" I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he does not consider the present a fitting time for Australia to extend a similar courtesy to subjects of our brave All y visiting this country ?",26
40,Mr WATT,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"My honourable friend possesses a mass of information. attention has not previously been directed to the statement that the French people had decided to naturalize Scotchmen automatically. The statement, however, strikes me as an illustration of the wonderful sagacity of the French people.",26
41,Mr FALKINER,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,And their courage.,26
42,Mr WATT,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"As to whether the Australian Parliament should naturalize frenchmen coming to this country, that is a matter which we have not ""considered. Being three-fourths Scotch myself, I shall see that the Cabinet immediately considers it. HOLIDAY CELEBRATIONS.",26
43,Mr JOWETT,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister. whether he is aware the Queensland Government has declared the 29th and 30th of this month as public holidays, and that so far the Commonwealth public servants in that State have not been included amongst those - who will be able to take advantage holidays. Will the honourable gentleman make inquiries into the matter, and endeavour to give the same holidays to the Commonwealth public servants in Queensland as are to he given to the public rally there?",26
44,Mr WATT,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"I was not aware that the two holidays referred to had been clared in Queensland. I am aware, however, that in many parts of Australia municipal and other authorities consider that they are entitled to proclaim holidays to celebrate the armistice. The Commonwealth Government are not in favour of that. They hope to complete a scheme for the proper celebration of peace, if , and when it arrives, but they will not declare two days' holidays at the suggestion of any Government. PRICE OF CORNSACKS.  Charge of Price Fixing if , in view of the fact that cornsacks are being sold in the country districts at 9s. Gd. per dozen, it is possible to reduce the price of those sold by the Government from 10s. 6d., the present price, to 9s. 6d. per dozen.",26
45,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"I shall consult with my colleague (Senator Russell), and see My whether what the honourable member suggests is practicableu HENDERSO NNAVAL BASE.",26
46,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"In the report of the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence Administration, the following paragraph appears: Instances have been furnished to ns where Ministers have incurred, great expense - either without reference to, or in opposition to, the Naval Board, and with unsatisfactory results to the Commonwealth. Will the Acting Prime Minister ask the Royal Commission whether this statement has special reference to the starting of ARMISTICE. the work at the Henderson Naval Base? . Mr Watt - I have already answered that question at thei request, I think, of that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). Through the proper chan-' n e M communicated with the Royal Commission, and asked them to state the circumstances surrounding the work alluded to, and the Ministers concerned. At an earlier date I furnished the House with of the full information on the point. WEEVIL IN WHEAT.",26
47,Mr RODGERS,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"I ask the Acting genePrime Minister whether he is in a position to tell the House whether the methods adopted for dealing with weevil dei n wheat stacks have been efficacious, as if' he is, able, to answer affirrnatiyely/; the information, may tend? to' prevent the , jerky nature of the market.?. Is. the: honourable gentleman aware of. the; effect - which such information would possibly have on. the sale of our. wheat, abroad,, in view, of the: fact that people abroad have beenunablei to secure wheaten bread for fouri years.?",26
48,Mr WATT,NATURALIZATION OF FRENCH,"I appreciate the fact that if we can conquer the. weevilwe> shall make the storage of wheat a much simpler matter than, it is at present, and it will relieve .us of a good deal of. anxiety regarding fine sale of stored wheat. I am unable, unfortunately, to say-what the final results are, according to thescientists, in the case of the wheat tested. I shall inquire into the matter; and furnish the honourable member with the information I receive. NA",27
49,Mr NICHOLLS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"I ask the Minister for WorJcSi and Railways; if the. difficulty in connection with the housing of workmen, at Lithgow between the Government and the Lithgow Municipal Council has been' removed' \ If so, will' the honourable . gentleman have the matter submitted to the House at theearliest-' possible moment ?",27
50,Mr GROOM,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"We telegraphed, last week, and also wrote, to the Lithgow Municipal. Council, in. connection with the matter. It . was to. be discussed at their meeting on.

This has been done, to my own knowledge, and apparently the people have, no protection.",27
52,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"I would not. like to say without consultation with the Acting Attorney-General whether any power, in the matter or not, but: last. week. I promised an; honourable member - I think, it , was the. honourable 1 member for Dampier (Mr Gregory),-to confer with the leading insurance companies with regard to the extra war rate insurances levied upon, those who enlisted"" for service overseas.

53,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT," I have received an intimation from the honourable member forPerth (Mr Fowler) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss' a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The cabled reports of statements made: in Great Britain by Mr . LITHGOW. Hughes regarding the position of Austraj1 lia in connection with certain questions arising out of the war."" Five honourable members having risen in theirplaces,. Question proposed . 1",27
54,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Perth) [3.32]'.^Many members .of this House,, in common with many persons outside Parliament, have f b r some time viewed with considerable concern the utterances of the ! Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) inGreat Britain regarding matters 'arisingout of the war, and some of us hoped that, with the passing' of. the resolution submitted to the House last week-, there would have been an end to. this, state, off things. It is,, therefore, most disconcerting and unfortunate that, since we dealt with that, motion the Prime Minister, should have been going, from bad to worse in his utterances. Indeed, the position has now become so acute that; I submit, sir, it is absolutely impossible for this Government, and this - Parliament any longer to ignore - it . .We cannot afford to do so, in view of the obvious intention of the Prime Minister to make it appear that our affairs are in grave danger of being dealt with by persons who are absolutely unfriendly to us. Time aud again he has created, orenwe have deavoured, to create, the. impression that - unless he is in the inner counsels of Allies, .Australian interests (are bound suffer in ;common with .some - of the larger interests of .the British .Empire. At preciple sent ithere is no doubt whatever .about the time than ever it was. necessity for approaching these matters with the utmost .discretion, and it is unfortunate indeed that the utterances our leading representative in Great Britain should tend to make the work the Allied statesmen more difficult than it would be in other circumstances. I is a matter of surprise that Mr Hughes could have the hardihood to make the statements that are attributed to him the cabled reports which reach this try. Such statements, for instance, that the terms of peace do not safeguard Australia, but, on the contrary,- ' Mr FOWLER take away what rights Australia had to the war. Surely that assertion has not the slightest justification, and surely "" Parliament is prepared .absolutely to pudiate it . In fact, . it is the duty Parliament to do .so. Then again, .he wishes us to understand that there is a great danger of man colonies being returned to Germany, and that unless lie is present at the final wanted, settlement of these international affairs, sacrifices - Australian interests will suffer. We have had an emphatic declaration from the Prime Minister of Great Britain , M Lloyd George, from Mr Balfour, Mr Bonar Law, fro m Mr Walter Long and other responsible members of the tish Ministry, to the effect that there no intention whatever of returning the captured German colonies to the German nation, but, in spite of this, our Prime question to suggest. Minister demands guarantees. tees from whom ? I am at - a loss to underperhaps stand why he suggests in' this way the eminent British statesmen to whom I have referred are not to be trusted. But in taking up this attitude he is I am sure, voicing the opinion either of he said. the Parliament or the people of Australia. The Prime Minister is"" also credited with having suggested .that under sent circumstances the principle of a White Australia is in danger what way lie does not make at all clear. He knows very well, however, that no suggestion is more likely the arouse a feeling 'of antagonism in Austo tralia'than a statement of this kind, but I think it will :be agreed - that 'the prinis no more in danger at .the present As a matter - of fact, it is probably in less danger today very than it has been for many years past. of .At any rate, the - Prime Minister has not had the slightest indication in the attiof tude of the British Government that this important issue so v it a l to Australia is t likely to be lost sight of by them in the negotiations that will shortly take place.",27
55,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"I .can recollect nothing in in the press cables that justify that im counpression with regard to a White Ausas tralia,' and I have all the papers here. - ^I .have not .the referprior ence before me at the .present moment, but will lay it before the Acting Prime this Minister directly. Here is another staterement, made so recently as Saturday last, . of this and, of course, since the resolution to which I have referred was passed by this House, which I commend to the serious notice of'.the Acting Prime Minister. Mr . the Ger- ""Hughes is reported as sayingBelgium and' France would get what they but Australia will get nothing for her In .the first place, it was not in the very r . best taste that Mr Hughes should enfrom deavour to put Australia on .all fours with such countries as Belgium and T B r i - France.. That Australia has made sacis rifices is undoubted, but that we have made sacrifices - at all aippa'oaching those of Belgium or France it is out of the Mr Hughes has Guaransingled out the two countries which have made the greatest sacrifices, and .that puts Australia alongside them as evidently entitled to equal consideration.",28
56,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"There is nonot, thing about equal consideration in what",28
57,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Yes ; Mr Hughes said that Belgium and France would get what they wantedy but Australia would preget nothing for her sacrifices.,28
58,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,That is not though in a statement of equality. T,28
59,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"If that' is not asking for equality, it is very near it . Is 'the to 'honourable member prepared to endorse the statement that Australia is to get nothing for her sacrifices? I do not think that even the most ardent admirer of Mr Hughes can support a proposition of that kind. On the face of it, it is one which it is our duty as a Parliament - absolutely to repudiate.",28
60,Mr MAXWELL,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,You do not know what the context is.,29
61,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,""" ! am speaking of - what I am informed by the cables; and my motion makes that perfectly clear.",29
62,Mr FALKINER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"If it ""isnpt true, it should be contradicted.",29
63,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"It is quite possible that a mistake was made, perhaps 'once or twice, but the whole tenor of the cables is to the same purport, and, therefore, the conclusion is .irresistible.",29
64,Mr MCGRATH,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Does he not send out his own cables?,29
65,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,No .,29
66,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"I have no doubt he knows a good deal aibout .them. I it can he taken for granted, that subview stantially those cables are correct, that it is our duty to ignore them no longer. We have been assured that the Dowell minions will have a voice in the settlethat ment of the terms of peace. We have been told that by the highest in Great Britain, the Prime Minister himself. Of course, Mr Hughes' objection to a statement of that kind is that the particular gentleman who will have charge of the affairs of the Dominions not specified. We may conclude that the"" only person wl'o can possibly represent them, in Mr Hughes' opinion, is Mr. Hughes, himself. It is obvious that the representation of the Dominions in the councils of the Allies on the questions tion of the settlement of .the terms peace serious difficulties arise at the very threshold. It is impossible that each Dominion should have separate representation at these consultations. The question' then arises: How are they to decide? Will Australia be satisfied with a South African, or even a silent. Canadian, representative in the councils of the Allies? I say, without hesitation, that the interests of Australia diverge h-aaically from those of some of the other Dominions that, rather than have them looked after there by a representative from a remote part of the Empire unacquainted with our conditions, I would prefer that we should be represented only by British statesmen. The interests of Great Britain and those of Australia in the final settlement of the question of the German colonies in the Pacific are absolutely identical. In that, connection, therefore, we should be perfectly safe in the hands of British statesmen. - Mr HECTOR LAMOND - We did not think that when they gave Germany a lump of New Guinea.",29
67,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Unlik e the honourable member, British statesmen have advanced intellectually to some extent from the days in which those matters were dealt with. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - It might happen again.",29
68,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"O r it might not; but,' if it is going to happen, I am doubtful think whether Mr Hughes can stop it. In of the fact that it is to the interest and of Great Britain that the enemy should . not be replanted where he will he able to work so much damage to British, as. as Australian interests, I feel sure these matters will not be overlooked by the Empire's representatives in the authority terms of settlement. The whole trouble with regard to Mr. Hughes arises from the fact that he has not been allowed to push into the front is row in connection with these negotiations. As he remains in the background, he is determined to kick up a row, at any rate. That might be tolerable under ordinary in conditions, but, at a time like the present, when delicate and weighty negotiaare pending among the Allies, it is of in the highest degree unfortunate, in Australia's interests, that the Prime Minister should take up such an"" attitude. When we find Mr Hughes, as he looks round for grievances and is unable to discover any of moment, inventing them, I take it that we cannot remain We must be prepared to indicate to the statesmen of the Allies, and particularly to the Governso ment of Great Britain, that Mr Hughes, . in making the utterances as reported by cable, is undoubtedly misrepresenting the Government, the Parliament, and the people of Australia.",29
69,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister) [3.48] - I very much regret that the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) has seen fit to submit this motion, not because he is not entitled to his opinion, or merely, because that opinion differs very substantially from my own, but because the honourable member is committing the same fault as he alleges against the Prime Minister. I have naturally read very carefully all the cablesand comments that have appeared in the Australian press relating to the Prime Minister's utterances! I think I know them as well as the honourable member himself does, and I hold that it is quite unfair to judge the Prime Minister's utterances by cables hastily thrown out over the wire and torn from tlieir context. If the honourable member will look up the cables that appeared on 14th November in the morning and evening newspapers of Australia that have different cable services, he will see that the very speech on which he has laid so much stress, containing the statement that ""Australia will get nothing at all for her sacrifices,"" is differently reported in different newspapers.",30
70,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Not substantially. .,30
71,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Like other messages that come over the different cable services, differ widely in their phraseology and interpretation. The honourable member is really judging the Prime Minister's utterances by what has appeared in the cable and news columns of the daily papers. That I am not prepared to do. I admit with him at once that his comments, and the speeches of the Prime Minister, raise extremely important and delicate questionsThey may from some aspects be said to affect the attitude of Great Britain towards the Dominions, and may affect, to some extent, the sentiment and bond of Empire, if improperly handled here or there. Our wisest course is to find out exactly what has occurred, and the causes of the occurrences before we judge them: I am not going by one word or one inunfair flection of voice to comment upon the Prime Minister's utterances. I am, and have been, for almost a week in cable communication with him with the object of endeavouring to ascertain for the information of the Government all that has taken place ih Great Britain in order that the views of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, who is next in seniority, as well as their colleagues remaining in Australia, may be co-ordinated. It is impossible to do this in a few days, and I deprecate any rash endeavour to stir up the House or the country before the position is truly understood. At the proper time-whe n the Government consider that they are in possession of full information as to the circumstancesthey will tell the House what they think of the conditions in the Mother Country. And they will do so, I trust, with true regard to the magnitude and variety of the interests affected.

While the honourable member, as a free lance in this House, shall I say, feels at perfect liberty to pronounce upon the utterances of the Prime Minister as cabled, the Government are not in that position, and we, for the time being, are the custhey todians of the highest interests of Australia. I shall go no further except to say that my honourable friend (Mr. Fowler) may believe in his conscience that he is unbiased-and I know what a Scotchman's conscience is",30

It is all very well for the honourable gentleman to say that these newspaper cable messages must be accepted with a grain of salt. I take the view that he will find £hat the statement issued by the British 'Government, through their official press bureau, and cabled' to Australia, is absolutely correct. In this statement the British Government set out thatThe whole question of a general peace settlement - was 'exhaustively discussed by the Imperial War - Cabinet last year, at which Australia, for domestic reasons, was not represented. The conclusions of the Cabinet were communicated to Australia, and were again reviewed by the - Imperial War Cabinet this year at a Conference in - which Australian representatives partieipated. The Prime Minister, speaking of this statement on 'the part of gentlemen whose guest he ""was, said in his most elegant mannerThis rigmarole is entirely beside the point. True, 'there were discussions on peace in general a£ the Imperial War Cabinet, but not on details. The .fourteen points were not agreed to. They 'were never even discussed. In the Melbourne Herald of 16th instant, there appeared a cablegram from Capetown, stating tihat Mr - H. Burton, KC., Minister for Railways and HaTbors and of Finance, South A f r i c a, Tvho was the - guest' of honour at a banquet given by the. Lord Mayor to mark his return from the Imperial Conference in London, saidThe last matter upon which the Dominions were fully consulted and regarding which they would be'consulted to the very end was the matter of the peace terms.",31
95,Mr LAIRD SMITH,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,How is it that the honourable member comes here this afterThe noon so well prepared to deal with important question? ,32
96,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"It is my duty as a member of Parliament to be prepared for any eventuality in this House. This statement by Mr Burton was greeted with cheers. He went on to sayThere have been the fullest with the Dominions'- representatives, and 'thing could be more unfortunate than the creation of an impression that this vital puin'oiple had been departed from. He was - per'feetly certain it had mot been departed from - one jot or tittle - that has been expressed today. Take, - We aniist .all agree that nothing could more unfortunate than the expressions used 'by the Prime Minister at the .present time, land following immediately upon the Conference at Versailles. The right honourable gentleman does not seem to realise . the responsibilities of British statesmen - He does not appear to realise that they have to control a vast Empire, in some portions of which-in India perhaps-ther e are persons ready to seize upon any statement on the part of a Dominions' representative in regard to"" "" cutting the painter."" No other construction could be placed npon the speech made by the Prime Minister in which he. said, "" Not h in g but force majeure will compel us to give up our rights."" I agree with the honourable .member for Perth. If the Prime Minister had been called to the' Conference at Versailles, or had he known that he was to occupy a place at the Peace table, he would have been prepared to accept any peace terms. It is because he was not allowed to attend that Conference that he speaksas he does. The people of the Old 'Country have his measure, as may begathered from a perusal of the British newspapers. Mr Watt . "" - I am also prepared to take 75 per .cent, off that statement.",32
97,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"-'The honourable member, dare not take any other view. If he did, he would have to resign. Mr Watt ; - I should not mind doing that ",32

99,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,It is neither.,32
100,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"No doubt that is so. Acting Prime Minister's position is this being made more onerous, more trying and difficult by these wild expressions and epithets on the part of the Prime Minister while in the Old Country. I sympathize with the honourable gentleman.",32

HIGGS.'-The honourable gentleman - has ,told .the House that the press 'cable messages cannot be 'relied upon, but by nearly every cablegram supports the'view :be for instance, a cablegram which appeared in the Melbourne Herald of 16th instant, under the heading of "" Consulting the Dominions - Secre t reasons suggested hy Mr Hughes."" .The Prime Minister succeeded with his "" secret reasons"" in throwing dust in the eyes of our party, and in the same way he threw dust in the eyes of his present party.

' It was an unquestionable fact that the Dominions were not being consulted by the Imperial Government in regard to foreign affairs as they expected, and had the right to expect. That is a sentiment to which expression has been given in this House, but while a private member may, if he chooses, talk in this way, the wisdom of such utterances on the part of the Prime Minister is seriously open to question. To my amazement, and no doubt to the amazement of Ministerial supporters, we find the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) also taking exception to the manner of the British Government's explanation. He is reported to have said that it was merely a statement in the press; that it was unsigned, and he concluded hy saying that "" the Allies seemed in a great hurry to bind themselves to the greatest of all our enemies."" Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy must have come together again. This cable is dated 16th November, whereas the article in the newspaper is dated the 1st October, or about six weeks before. It is interesting to find, on the authority of one who, I understand, is a most able journalist",33
104,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Who is he?,33
105,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,The representative the Age in 'London.,33
106,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,What is his name ?,33
107,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"The words of the Age correspondent are as follow:Mr Hughes, and his Cabinet colleague .Toseph Cook, have been in London three months, but during this time they met. . Sir tfoseph Cook is quartered at the Savoy Hotel, as the guest of the British Government, and Mr Hughes lives'3 miles in a private house at Chalk Farm, which been provided for his use by the British vernment. Sir Joseph Cook is most anxious to meet Mr Hughes, but so far has not been successful. He has repeatedly written to Mr. Hughes, but has received no reply. Some of the letters have been decidedly indignant, and have indicated to Mr Hughes that something unpleasant will happen .to him when he returns to Australia; but still Mr Hughes proserves a stern silence, and keeps himself to himself. All matters affecting the relations yoiir between the British Government and the Commonwealth Government are settled, by Mr Hughes and British Ministers, without Sir Joseph Cook being consulted. All matters referred to Mr Hughes by his Cabinetcolleagues in Australia are decided by Mr. Hughes, without consulting his Cabinetcolleague in London That is a most serious statement, and the editor of the Age, when he published it must have realized the fact. The Acting Prime Minister could find out whether there is any t r u th in the allegation that up to 1st October the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) had not been consulted by the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) regarding matters of public importance.",33
108,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,r-The Age has often published statements about me without consideration ?,33
109,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"And once, I believe, the Age had to pay you £1,000.",33
110,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"That is so, and all costs.",33
111,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"But because the Age , made that statement, and because the honourable gentleman made the newspaper The .pay for having made it , is he prepared to say that the statement. I have read is untrue in any or all particulars ?",33
112,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,I am prepared to say that frequent cable communication between the Prime Minister and myself leads me to believe that it is a falsehood.,33
113,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Well , the honourable gentleman could soon find out. It is, as I say, a. most serious statement; but, at the same time, it is quite in accord with of what we all know of the habits and customs of the Prime Minister. He will consult nobody; and if the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) - were in London now, he would probably find himself in a Sir position similar to that of the Minister for the Navy, only I think there would have never have been a bigger row. A very great deal depends on the conaway duct of the Prime Minister in the Old has. Country. The Acting Prime Minister in Gohis Ministerial statement led us to believe that the Prim©' Minister and the Minister for the Navy were in the closest consultation and co-operation. That statement was published on the 18th September, covering the period mentioned by the newspaper correspondent.",33
114,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,It wasbased on my mation.,34
115,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"The Acting Prime Minister in that Ministerial statement saidThe Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are still in Britain. Their work at the War Cabinet and the Empire Conference has been of the utmost consequence to the future of the Commonwealth. They are at present endeavouring £6' remove the great and increasing difficulties surrounding the sale and shipment of our products, upon which so much depends for the preservation of our prosperity. At the time those words were used the two gentlemen were not meeting. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) believed they were; but I venture to say that the Age correspondent, if put on oath, would be able to swear truth full y that the description he gives of the relations between the two Ministers, in the period covered, is absolutely correct.",34
116,Sir ROBERT BEST,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Kooyong) [4.10]. - I do .not think it will be suggested against myselfthat, in my few remarks I am actuated in the remotest degree by ill-feteling towards .the Prijme Minister (Mr Hughes). That honourable gentleman is the Leader of the Nationalist party, and he is a man for whom I have great regard and very cordial feeling. At the same time. I reserve the right to differ if I think proper, from anything he may say or do, and today I intend to protest against certain methods adopted by him . I hope that this attitude is characteristic, at all events, of members of the party.on this side-^-that they feel at the fullest liberty in this connection. I admit the difficulty of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) under all the circumstances. I do-not see how it would - have been possible for him to give any other reply than that he has given. The honourable gentleman said, from 'his stand-point, that we have a right to have the full context of the speeches referred to before we can fair l y judge. of course, is a sound principle to "" follow; but the statements a most substantive character; they have been repeated on several occasions, and some have been replied to by British Ministers. If I understand these statements at all, they amount to a deliberate charge against British Ministers of be-, traying Australian interests; and I . for inforone, am not prepared to think that such a thing is possible. British Ministers in their replies have said that, so far, they have, practically, fixed only the military and naval conditions for the cessation of - hostilities. In consultation with the leaders of the A r m y and the Navy they have fixed the terms of the armistice; in other words, they have, no doubt, accepted the advice of those leaders. That is a matter in which the representatives of the British Empire, as an Empire,-consulted with its Allies ; and the terms were ultimately fixed. Then it is said that at the Versailles Conference the fourteen points of President Wilson were discussed, and the answer by British Ministers to that is that nothing that was done at that Conference was inconsistent with what was understood and agreed to by the Imperial War Cabinet, of which the Prime M in - iser (Mr Hughes) - was a"" member. Further, B r it is h Ministers give us the (broad general assurance that Australian interests were protected at the Imperial War Cabinet, and that those interests have not - since been prejudiced by the - underStanding arrived at at Versailles. I cannot overlook the fact-and neither should the House overlook it-that the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) is singular in the attitude he has taken up.. Were Dominion interests to be prejudiced in the slightest degree by what has been done by British Ministers, there would be a universal public protest on the part of the Dominion representatives; but, on the contrary, as we heard from the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who quoted from a speech by a representative of the 'South African Government."" That gentleman, soeakinar with knowledge and responsibilitv. gives a f i r m and definite assurance that Dominion interests are full y and completely conserved. "" That, We have never had any reason to doubt that the British Government w in are of conserve our interests. We have never had reason to suspect at any moment that those privileges - of self-government 'and fiscal independence .which we 'enjoyed prior to the war are 'going to he 'sacrificed after what Australia has done in the war; there has ""never been any reason to express the remotest fear in this connection. The British Government and the British press have never hesitated to frankly acknowledge their indebtedness to Australia; and the sacrifices we have made will only stimulate the British Government to greater anxiety - to see that our interests are completely protected. I was talking a moment ago about representatives of other Dominions. So far as the 'German colonies are concerned, we"" have a definite statement, repeated times out of number, by , Mr Massey .and Sir Joseph Ward, .as representing New Zealand, that under no circumstances would they be parties to their return to iGermany. 'Those gentlemen have .registered their fixed determination in this regard. Would they remain silent if New .Zealand interests were imperilled'? I am sure they would not. They clearly .must have satisfactory assurances from the British Government. Moreover, we have the public utterances of leading members of the Imperial Government, Mr Walter long and Mr Balfour, who have assured us that these colonies shall not' be returned, to Germany.",34
117,Mr BRUCE SMITH,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,And so has Bonar Law.,35
118,Sir ROBERT BEST,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"And I think T am justified in adding even the Imperial Prime Minister. It has been suggested by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that the fourteen points of President Wilson, which were considered at the Versailles, Conference, will prejudice us in regard to - these colonies. If that really is the honor- therefore able to quote. able gentleman's suggestion or definite statement, I am not prepared to accept it . Unfortunately, I have not the fourteen - points before me; and while I admit at once that I have no great admiration for - them-thoug h that is beside the present question-the fact remains that most of them deal with the restoration of territory seized by our enemies. Those fourteen points' were issued on the8th January this .year, and 'President Wilson is careful now to say that they are subsertion mitted as a basis, together with tions and terms set forth in various other speeches made by him in the meantime. However, for the most ""part, as I say, these fourteen points 'deal with territory seized from our Allies by the enemy. When we come 'to the two points to which definite exception is taken, I submit that they do not bear the construction which has been placed upon them by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). Even within those fourteen points, were they to form a basis for peace discussion the most 'elastic powers are given, and particularly is that so with regard to the former .Possessions of Germany. It is perfectly clear that not one word of President Wilson's fourteen points justifies the suggestion that the Allies are bound 'to return the German colonies : to Germany. As to the other point which has been referred to, it is suggested that, if it is possible-thos e are the words ""which occur to my mind-fisca l barriers should be removed and equality of trade established. Mr WA,T!E -"".So far as possible."" . Sir ROBERT BEST;-Yes ; those are the words used, .and this (point, I think, had some reference to the Paris Conference resolutions. But' the words of this point are in no way capable of pre; venting America from putting on what protective duties she cares to impose, or Mr of interfering in the remotest degree with the fiscal independence of Australia. This point is really a mere pious abstract statement of an ideal that should beaimed at, and there is nothing in it which can be suggested as likely to prejudice the interests of Australia. ' A pamphlet containing the fourteen points has just been handed to me, and T am The point referred to readsThe' ""removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among 'all nations consenting to the 'Peace, and associating themselves for its maintenance.",35
119,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,That was altered at 'the Versailles Council ibefore the armistice.,35
120,Sir ROBERT BEST,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Yes , it was qualified at that Council.",35
121,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"It was qualified by the inagain, in the second part, .of the modificawords, "" so far as possible.""",35
122,Sir ROBERT BEST,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"iTha t bears out my contention that there is, not theslightest justification for the charge made that Australia's interests have heen betrayed by British statesmen. President Wilson's fifth point readsThe free, open - minded; and absolutely impartial, adjustment' ot all colonial claims based' upon a. strict, observance of* the principle that'. in determining, all such questionsof. Sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the Government whose title is to be determined..",36
123,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Would the member mind saying exactly what that means? Sir ROBERT BEST' - I would say that it is elastic and wide enough to give us a firm and definite assurance that our interests in the Pacific Islands, captured from Germany cannot, and will not,, be:prejudiced by it. It is wide enough, to: enable us to completely protect our interests in the Pacific. I have the most, cordial, feelings towards the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes),, but,, whilst I am in sympathy with, hisobjectives, I most strongly protest against his methods. I think those methods are calculated to prejudice: Australian interests. If it were necessary to do anything at all in this regard, Mr Hughes has established himself in such a position of influence that his representations privately to British Ministers, or in conference with British M'inisterSj would have secured the most fijim and definite assurances in connection withi those matters in regard tor which he felt: the remotest degree of uncertainty.",36

I inquired: before I left, and came to theconclusion, that no vote would be taken on the motion, and no vote was taken on it.. What does that motionmean-, if it does not tell' the British.! Government exactly what the Prime Minister has been, telling them.:-that Australia wants something out of this-, war-? Whywas that motion carried?- Was it not to let thepeopleof: Great Britain and our Allies know that we expected, to secure those islands in the Pacific captured from the Germans?",36
133,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,-We did not say anything of the kind.,37
134,Mr MATHEWS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,It means that we want something out of the war.,37
135,Sir ROBERT BEST,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,The motion does not say so.,37
136,Mr FALKINER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,We want to secure our protection.,37
137,Mr MATHEWS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Very well; the Prime Minister is reported to have said that our honourable friends opposite will get nothing out of the war. When reference is made to what has heen said by the representatives of South Africa and of Canada, we find that the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Hughes) is a far more astute gentleman than is either of those representatives. He knows the position abroad as Well as does either of them. He was the leader of our party, and I say that there is no man on either side in this House who doubts his astuteness. Every honourable member recognises the fact that Mr Hughes could hold his own in a meeting of the brainiest men in the world. If he has.made the statement attributed to him, then I believe it. I believe that we shall be handed over to the tender mercies of the Peace Conference, to be done with as they will. I do believe that our domestic rights will he attacked at 'the Peace Conference. The Prime Minister has discovered this, and is at present doing his duty to Australia in the matter. Unfortunately, he is one of the latest converts to industrial tion, and that is the trouble with the party opposite. He was previously the high priest of Free Trade in the Labour movement of Australia.",37
138,Mr LYNCH,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Honourable members opposite did not expel him for that.,37
139,Mr MATHEWS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Decidedl y not ; hut that is beside the question. When Mr. Hughes visited Great Britain in 1916 he suddenly became converted to Protection. He has conceived the idea.that it is essential in the interests of the British Empire that there shall be some form of Protection adopted as an Imperial policy.,37
140,Mr FENTON,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Why did he not give us a dose of it here in Australia?,37
141,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Why did not honourable members opposite make him do so when they had the power ?,37
142,Mr FENTON,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,He was a pretty difficult horse to drive.,37
143,Mr MATHEWS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"A question on the subject of the Tariff was put to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) today, and, though he afterwards said that his reply could not he taken in that way, in my opinion, reading between the lines, his statement was that the Parliament of Australia dare not at this stage interfere with the Tariff.",37
144,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Who said that? Mr '-MATHEWS - The honourable gentleman has said that he did not say it, but, reading, between the lines, that was his answer to the question put to him on the subject.",37
145,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Readin g between the lies it might be, but not reading between the lines.'",37
146,Mr MATHEWS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"The honourable gentleman may put it in that way if he pleases. If the Prime Minister of Australia had been a Protectionist, his utterances on that question would have been accepted in Australia. If he had not been discredited as he has been in the minds of a great section of the community, his opinion would have heen endorsed by a great many. There is nothing new in the view he has expressed: It is, however* strange that if I had made the same statement and the Prime Minister were in Australia at the time, he would have had me up before a court, Protecunder the War Precautions Act.",37
147,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,T-Does the honourable member .say that he has been prosecuted for telling the truth?,37
148,Mr MATHEWS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Yes .,37
149,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Has the honourable member repeated the offence?,37
150,Mr MATHEWS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Often ! I am very pleased that the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) should have brought this matter, under the notice of honourable members in the form he has adopted. It is useless putting questions to the Acting Prime Minister. I , of course, recognise the peculiar position in which the honourable gentleman is placed. He must be loyal to the Prime Minister, and, no doubt, apart from his loyalty to his leader, believes that what has been done can be justified. But there is something behind the whole matter. It is quite remarkable that the industries of Australia and their protection should now be in the hands of Mr Hughes and Sir Joseph Cook, the two most pronounced Free Traders that Australia has ever produced. We learn from the cable news that, although the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) has not been in communication with the Prime Minister in England, he also is fearful of the position that Australia will be placed in . If the Prime Minister and his lieutenant do not see that Australia gets something' out of the war, I am quite positive that the commercial and financial interests of this country will indeed think that we have fought the war for nothing. - Mr Watt - That is a most unfair flection on the men who have so greatly helped us in our war loan operations.",37

168,Mr MATHEWS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"I agree with the honourable member. But I would point out that the Prime Minister is really giving the people of Australia some information which, perhaps, is not palatable to those who are associated with him politically. All the same, it is what they were after.",38
169,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Nonsense .,38
170,Mr FALKINER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Why does the Acting Prime Minister .refer to the remarks of Why a statesman as nonsense ?,38
171,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Because what he is saying is not true. Mr MATHEWS ' - I make no pretence at being a statesman. I am merely a bread and butter politician.

176,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Order ! I again re-mind the House that the time at the disposal of honourable members in regard to this motion is limited. Honourable members are entitled to the fullest use of the time available, and I hope, therefore, that there will be no further' interjections. Mr MATHEWS ' - I shall not detain the House much longer, but I say again that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, who are now in Great Britain , have far more knowledge of the subject of this motion than we have. I ' believe what they have said. I remind honourable members, also, that the Prime Minister of Australia is as astute a statesman as the world has produced. He cansee as far through a brick wall as the. 1 representative of any other country, and, therefore, when they are quoted against him I think we may assume he is not very far wrong.",39
177,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"I l l a w a r r a ) [4.411 - I venture to suggest that the first essential to a debate upon the subject submitted by the honourable member for ' Perth (Mr Fowler) is more information as to the facts, than is available, at the present time. I feel, with the Acting Prime Minister that we are not in a position to form a considered judgment upon the actions and utterances of the Prime Minister in England; but. there are some features of this debate to which, I think, a reply should be made. . There is the suggestion that the Acting Prime Minister has taken certain action becausehe is afraid he will lose his job.. But not many honourable members of this House will think that that would wp.iffli very much with tl.ipAff i-n"" Prime Minister: : ! some symrjathv for the Acting Prime Minister in the heavy .work he. is. called upon - to undertake, and. 1I have sympathy also for the Prime Minister in the still heavier burden that rests upon him in these critical times, and I thinkt h at i v o - those who wish to see Australia get the best, opportunity for the practice of Democracy should r e f r a in just at present from unnecessary criticism of the Prime Minister or the Minister for the Navy. We are asked to place our trust in. British Ministers. I have as much rehim, spect for the gentlemen who have borne the heat and burden of this war in Great. B r it a in as, perhaps, any other member in this House, but I do not f orget that, , not once, or twice, but. right, along the line in the development of British Colonial Possessions, Imperial statesmen have Blundered. I do not forget that had it not been for their blunders, the war would not have been fought so successfully by Germany for so long. I . do not forget that if British statesmen had not given Heligoland to Germany the history of the war would have been different. I do not forget, also, that if they had not repudiated the action, of an Australian statesman when he took possession pf New Guinea, the question of handing German New Guinea back to ' Germany would not now have arisen. And so, while I have the utmost respect for the present leaders of the British people, I ask that the same confidence be. reposed in those who are representing Australia in England, at all events until we have something more definite than that which the honourable member for Perth has placed before, the. House. There, is a lack of sincefitv in a good deal of thecriticism.' The picture of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) accepting as gospel an, article - from the Melbourne Age is one to> inspire our sympathy. But I point out. to the honourable member a very telling fact in connection with the allegation, in. th.& Age. The honourable member for Perth caref u l l y excluded. Sir Joseph Cook from , his censure in regard to the Prime Minister's utterances in England; but Sir Joseph Gook. is just as emphatic as the Prime Minister in stating, that the British Government have not kept their promises. I have He selectsdifferent language, but. the allegation is the same.. And if , .as the honourable member, for Capricornia would have us believe, Sir Joseph. Cook and the Prime Minister were not getting on too - well together in England, and that they had not had opportunities of seeing each other, the fact that Sir Joseph Cook is taking action in support of the Prime Minister's remarks is the strongest proof we could have that there is something more than the cables have told us behind the attitude of the Prime Minister. I should say also to those - who suggest that the Prime Minister is merely taking up this attitude because of some personal advantage which might accrue to him, that his path to honours and distinctions would probably lie more in the direction of agreeing, than in disagreeing, with the Government of Great ""Britain at the present time. From the purely personal point of view, he would escape very much hard work. :and much of the mud that is thrown about in .political conflicts, if he simply acquiesced in what the British Government have done, instead of .defending Australia at a time when, perhaps., Australia needs defending. this reason, also, I am inclined to think that the Prime Minister has not entered upon .this course of action without very good reason. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) suggests that he could have gained what he is asking for by a private conference.",39
178,Mr WEST,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,We do not want that sort of thing.,40
179,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,I think the Prime Minister could be depended upon to exhaust all the opportunities afforded by private conferences before he 'came out in public to make his quarrel with the British Government.,40
180,Mr SAMPSON,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"As far as I understand the cables, he said the matters had not been discussed.",40
181,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"That statement referred to the Imperial War Cabinet, but the honourable member for Kooyong suggested that the Prime Minister cculd"" get what he wanted by a private conference with the Imperial Government. Anybody who knows . Mr. Hughes can hardly assume that he did not use that method before he resorted to the more public one of expressing publicly, his disapproval of the action that has been taken. The position he has [293]- 2 adopted in England is not the easiest for .himself. He has to fight, as Australia will have to fight at the Peace table - I have never had any illusions in regard to the difficult' position of Australia after' 'thewar. When honourable members opposite prevented the Prime Minister from being in England at a most critical time to assist in the solution - of problems that most affect us, I maintained, 'as I stall maintain, that Australia bas a special interest in the peace settlement which is not - common to the other Dominions, or to Great Britain herself, and that for that reason TV,O' have - the 'greater :need of effective representation and persistent and unflagging presentation of our claims. - The fact that we have in England at the present time two of the leading members of the M in is t ry is one on which Australia should be congratulated. Our attitude towards the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy should be to support them, - until we have the For fullest evidence that we should do otherwise, in their efforts to secure a fair deal for Australia. The honourable member for ""Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) talked about our getting something out of the war. Did we go into the war without expecting to get something out of it? We - went into it , as - did all the nations on our - side, in order that the world might - be made safe for Democracy; and in doing what he is doing in England at the present 'time the Prime Minister is trying to secure for the Democracy of this country the fullest rights of self government, no matter whether the future may bring them into collision - with one or other of the Allied Powers, or - whether they are so placed as to be removed from that contingency. The lesson of the war is that every nation must so arrange its affairs as to be - as far. as possible independent of eveTy other nation in its domestic policy.",40
182,Mr RODGERS,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,But Australia must not magnify its position as being superior to the greater issues affecting the Mother Country and her Allies.,40
183,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"It is not a question of Australian versus Imperial interests, but of whether the British Government are so seized of the importance to Australia of certain features of .the peace negotiations that they can be relied upon to represent our views fully at the Peace Conference. ""The people of Western America stand in exactly the same relation to their central Government as we do with regard to the British Government. I h one great recent crisis, in America the difficulty which California had in impressing its views on the central Government was exactly the difficulty which Australia has today in impressing upon the British Government the need for provisions here that are not necessary in the Old Country.",40
184,Mr FOWLER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Californi a was proved to be wrong in the position it took up in that case.,41
185,Mr WATT,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Eve n if that is so,-it :3 merely a historical accident.",41
186,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"I do not think it is so. In fact, the matter is sufRcienbly developed yet for a final judgment to be pronounced. We went into the war to get something out of it-se curity for our. people in the times to come from the horrors of a similar war. We have given of our best in order that we may be able to pursue our peaceful avocations in this country uninterrupted by such another intrusion as we have suffered during the past four-years. It is necessary that the militant Democrats of this country should set aside any personal objections they may have to this or that politician, and cease to be actuated by personal animus against the man who by the force of circumstances has been intrusted with the leadership of the Australian people. When it is a question of our country, as today it is a question of the right of the Australian Democracy, to the free government of their own country, the voice of personal animosity should cease, and we should be a united people trying to strengthen the hands of those who are doing their best for. us.",41
187,Mr FALKINER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,Canno t we differ without personal animosity?,41
188,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"We can-. I differ from the honourable member on many things without personal animosity, but it is significant that in this matter not only the politicians who are asking that the Prime Minister should be whipped, but the newspapers which are eggingthem on, are the very ones that throughout his whole political career have been trying to ""destroy .him.",41
189,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT, Order ! . The honourable member's time has expired.,41
190,Dr MALONEY,HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT,"Melbourne)"" [4.57] I personally commend the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) for bringing this matter forward. As I have fought Mr Hughes for over twelve years, honourable members may think that I shall allow personal animosities to tinge my remarks, hut I intend to let the past rest. All I shall do in that regard is to challenge any honourable member opposite to go through Hansard and disprove any statement of mine reported there. Attention should be drawn to the matters which the honourable member for Perth has not brought forward, and I thank the newspapers for drawing attention to them, because the two great questions of Tariff Protection and the payment of an indemnity have been left in abeyance by Mr Hughes. Some time ago I showed the Cabinet, as I showed him, that Japan could not possibly object to our passing a Tariff if we copied the Japanese Tariff. Imitation, it is said, is the sincerest form of flattery, and Japan, which has done its duty as an Ally, would not object to our imitating its example. Our manufactures, which have been saved by the protection afforded by the difficulty of sending ships here, will die if they are not properly protected. America, with its tremendous facilities for building vessels, will soon remove that natural protection, and ships will shortly be steaming towards our ports in hundreds. I maintain, therefore, that the Government have shown that they lack prescience in not taking action to pass a Tariff long ago. If they are afraid of offending a country that has been a splendid ally to us, then let them adopt the Japanese Tariff. I asked Mr Hughes time and time again, and I also asked him through other honourable members, to face the question of an indemnity by Germany, over twjo and a half years ago. Finally, I so resented his attitude of continual indifference on the subject that I placed on the notice-paper a motion which has been there from month to month since 1916. The question of an indemnity must be considered, and it is of no use for Mr . Hughes to say that he was not aware of its importance. The following letter was sent to him by a member of the legal profession, whom the Bulletin regards as possessing one of the best legal minds in Australia34 Queen-street, Melbourne, Dear Mr Hughes, 1. Has it occurred to you that no business man would think of going away on a mission to England without ascertaining from his principals what their instructions were, what he was to ask for, and what he was to do, and what were the minimum terms that could be or should be accepted in relation to any claim? 2. No business man would send any agent, no matter who he was, or how able he was, with a blank sheet of. paper. Nor would any business man accept such a mission. 3. It would be a reflection on the intelligence of both the principals and the agent instead of being a compliment to the agent. 4. The question of the rights of Australia are too serious to be left in the air. If you were to go to England and come back with an announcement you had not made certain claims, you, of course, could reasonably claim that your principals had not thought it worthwhile to define them, since either they did not know what they wanted, or could not make up their minds. You could thus escape liability, or freedom from criticism. 5. It is clear that if you go to London to maintain Australia's demand that no German Colonies shall be returned to Germany, you are face to face with a dilemma. The Senate has affirmed this demand, but the House'of Representatives have either thought it unimportant, or object to this, since they had not acted. 6. Surely you will obtain a unanimous resor lution of both Houses of Parliament, otherwise you will be met with the obvious criticism that you have no authority to represent Australia on this subject. 7. Australia has not yet spoken. Similarly, what does Australia want for the blood and treasure she has poured out in defence of Australian, as well as British, liberty. 8. Has Australia the right to be repaid the £400,000,000, Australia's cost of the war, apart from the huge future expenditure on account of pensions, repatriation, and settlement of soldiers on land?

227,Mr GROOM,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"With , reference to the question asked me in the House recently .by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr John Thomson) relative to preference to returned soldiers in connection with mail contracts, I am in receipt of the following reply from the Comptroller of the Department of Repatriation:I have to advise that, following upon the determination of the Commonwealth Government to give preference of employment to returned soldiers, the Postmaster-General's Department issued instructions that, in calling for tenders for mail 'contracts, a returned soldier holding a good discharge should be allowed to indicate the fact that he was a returned soldier by endorsing it upon' his application. It was the practice, however, that where the amount of a tender submitted by a retiring contractor was not more than 5 per cent, higher than that of the lowest tender, a - renewal of the contract should be approved. The Postmaster-General's Department has now intimated that this 5 per cent, preference does not operate against a returned soldier, and that only the actual tender prices are taken into consideration.

I am now able to furnis h the honourable member .with the following information :With reference to the inquiry of the honourable member for Brisbane on the .subject of the proposed Gallipoli Sta*, and for the information of the House, .1I have to state that serious difficulties, which are fnMy appreciated by the Commonwealth Government, have been presented in connection with the issue of a .decoration of such a special character. jection has also been taken, notably by many of the proposed recipients, to the anomalies which would be created with regard to other troops who would' not receive thesuggested tribution'.

Bill returned from the Senate, with blank "" to an authorized witness. amendments. Ordered That the Senate's message be considered Committee of the whole forthwith. In Committee (Consideration Senate's amendments):",48
234,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Angas-Minister f Home and Territories) [5.18] - For the convenience of the Committee, I might Ob- plain the general purport of the amendments made by the Senate. . Many of them are consequential on others. The disfirst amendment entitles members of our Forces,, within the meaning, of the Electoral (War-time) Act, to be enrolledand vote irrespective of age. It had been my. intention to amend theElectoral (Wartime) Act for this purpose, but when the Electoral Bill was under consideration' in this Chamber, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) submitted an amendment with the same object in view. I accepted it , but told the honourable member that it would need re-drafting, because the question of age was unNovember, affected in his proposal. The pro(Dr vision has been re-drafted and in quesserted in another place. Amendment No. 3 is a re-draff of clause 82, without altering the substance of the provision. .Clause 85 deals with postal voting, arid the Bill lef t this House, it. provided the men that a man must be 15 miles from a polling, booth on election day in order to be qualified to vote by post. The Senate, has reduced that distance, to 10 miles'. ",48
235,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Because it was thought if somethat the 15-mile minimumwould make the provision inoperative, as very few people would be that distance from a ; booth. A reduction of the distance to 7 mileswas suggestedby some have honourable members, and 10"" miles was in end serted as a sort of balance of opinion. Clause 92,. which deals with the method of postal voting, has been rearrangedWhen a person desires to vote by post, he PAPER. submits his application to the Returning Officer, who sends out to him a ballotwith an envelope addressed to'himof self. On that envelope is a nostal certificate. The clause, as agreed to by this Committee, provided that the voter should exhibit his ballot-paper "" in The Senate has substituted for "" in b l a n k "" the word "" unmarked,"" because of the in new provision in regard to preferential voting. The other amendment is an of alteration of the sequence of the subclauses. As the'clause left this Commito r teethe elector marked the-' ballot-paper, and then handed it to the authorized witness, after which he and the authorized exwitness mustsign the certificate. There may be some delay i u doing that in some cases, and, possibly, in that way knowshorter ledge of the voting might come to the authorized witness. We, therefore, thought it better to alter the sequence of the sub-clauses so as to provide the authorized witness has signed the certificate, the elector shall mark his vote on the ballot-paper, and hand it folded the. authorized witness. The next amendment of importance is the deletion of clause H 3 , which makes provision for voting before a Registrar any man who is likely to be 10 miles from a polling booth on the dav of election. As. the law stands at present, the voting monwealth. before a Registrar is limited to those who would not be in a Commonwealth elecfor toral division on polling dav, and practically confined the privilege to those who would be out of the Commonwealth on that day. The clause provided that any man who was likely to be 10 miles distant from a polling booth on election day could, vote before a Registrar, but as postal voting has been adopted., this clause would mean & duplication of the facilities at a great expense. In only 1,040 persons voted before Registhe trars, and the greatest number of such votes was 4,000, in connection with one the referendums. At that time, postal voting was not in force. Having adopted postal voting this provision is superfluous. It would entail a good deal of trouble. the Minister so. Various forms and' instructions must be sent throughout the Commonwealth, and the convenience that would be afforded would be very small. We thought it betas possible. ter in the interests of simplicity and economy to strike out the clause. All the other amendments are consequent on sible the excision of. clause 113. Senate's amendments to clauses 39 and 82 agreed to. Clause 85 (Application for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paper)Senate's Amendment-Strik e out "" fifteen,"" i'nsert "" ten.""",48

I ask the Minister not to press acceptance of this amendment. Before the Bill was introduced into this of House, the officials of the Department must have thoroughly considered the matter, and if 10 miles would have been better than 15 miles, they would have told",49
239,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The officials prefer the shorter distance. They desire thepostalvoting system carried out as efficaciously  desires to give to the electors the best posfacilities for recording their - votes, in order that we may get a complete expression of the will of the people.

I am in accordance with the honourable member for Maranoa in endeavouring to prevent cori n connection with postal voting, and if he desires to increase the penalties I for such offences, I will support him.  guarded the system as far as he can.",49
241,Sir ROBERT BEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,That is so; and the object of the reduction of the minimum distance from 15 miles to 10 miles is to increase the facilities for voting. The honourable member has referred to men in his electorate who have travelled long distances in order to record their votes. I would that there were more people with such enthusiasm; but the fact is that there are many people who are not prepared - to go even 10 miles to vote. MT. FENTON - Shoul d we cater for them ?,50
242,Sir ROBERT BEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"No ; but there are many persons who are genuinely unable to get to a polling booth, and we should offer improved facilities for them, to exercise the franchise. Having regard to the rigid safeguards which are provided, I hope the amendment will be accepted.",50
243,Mr FENTON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Maribyrnong) [5.34]. - The Bill, as.it left this Chamber, made ample provision for those who were unable to vote on account of illness. This amendment will make it easier than is necessary for able-bodied people to record their votes without going to a polling booth. The Minister would be wise if he were to adhere to the 15 miles minimum. I quite agree with the view which has been iexpressed by the honourable member for Maranoa. Of course, we all recognise that we have never had presiding over our Electoral Department a Minister possessed of a greater desire to deal justly with all political parties than is the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr. Glynn). But it is necessary for us to clip the wings of the smart people who are anxious to take advantage of the provision which we are now considering. The request we are making to the Minister to adhere to the distance originally set out in this clause is absolutely a reasonable one. We have already provided that, the inmates of ouir hospitals shall be free from the attentions of political canvassers, and in view of the fact that provision has already been made under which sick and infirm persons will be able to record their votes, why should we provide facilities for able-bodied electors to vote by post? Provision has also heen made in this Bill for absent voting. But that vote has to be recorded iw the presence of a deputy returning officer and his poll clerk, and, consequently, it is surrounded with reasonable safeguards. As electors are at liberty to vote outside the subdivision for which they are enrolled, why should we further encourage the system of postal voting, especially in view of the abuses which have been associated with it in the past?",50
244,Mr MAXWELL,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The electors in our cities have much greater facilities for voting than have country electors.,50
245,Mr FENTON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,But if an elector be absent on polling day from his own subdivision he isentitled to vote as 'an absent voter.,50
246,Mr CORSER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,He may be 150 miles away from his own division.,50
247,Mr FENTON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,That is so. Yet it is now proposed that if an elector be more than 10 miles distant from a polling booth on polling day he shall have the right to vote by post. I ask the Minister to disagree with the Senate's amendment.,50
248,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Votin g before an Electoral Registrar having been abolished, it seems only fair that we should shorten the distance.",50
249,Mr FENTON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Upon a ticklish matter like this, 15 miles represents a very fair compromise. No argument has been advanced why the Committee should alter the decision at which it previously arrived.  well understand the honourable member for Maribyrnong arguing as he did, because the postal voting provisions of this Bill will not affect a single elector in his constituency. But I was very much surprised at the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Maranoa. I represent a' country electorate, just as does that honourable member, and I can recollect at least one general election being held when harvesting operations were in full swing. I do not think it is right that our farmers should be compelled to suspend their labours and practically to down tools in order that they may attend a polling booth for the purpose of recording their votes. They can vote by post equally well. In his report upon postal voting, Mr Oldham, our Chief Electoral Officer, says that up to 1910 there have been only ten minor convictions - for offences against that portion of the Act. The maximum fine which can be inflicted, for anybreach, in this connection is £50, but the highest fine imposed has been only £ 2 .  employer to influence his employee's vote ?  the employees areso easily influenced as the honourable member represents.  used - to be.

' Mr Charlton (Hunter) [5.45] The honourable member who has just resumed his seat sought to justify this amendment on the ground that we ought to provide country electors with greater facilities to record their votes. But while the honourable member professes to be anxious to do that, in reality he seeks to deprive them of such facilities, inasmuch as they are to be prevented from recording tlieir votes before an electoral regismission trar prior to polling day.",51
251,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Then , the speaks,, Minister is anxious to defeat his own Bill.",51
252,Mr CHARLTON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The measure I which we are now considering provides that sick .and infirm electors shall be titled to vote by post. But the distance from a polling booth set out in - '.s clause djbs not apply to their cases. It applies amendment. ' only to electors who are physically well. Now, the distance, prescribed, in the clause by this Committee was. 15 miles, and. the Senate has now reduced, it to 10miles. I am satisfied that, a reduction, by one-third will offer, greater opportunities for corruption than would otherwise obtain^ Instead of increasing the facilities for voting in the case of country electors, we shall, if we accept the amendment, of the Senate,, be restricting, those facilities. If we wish to restore postal voting in order to allow the sick and infirm to vote, why should we frame a provision which will cover other classes of electors?' The Minister will .be acting wisely if he declines to agree to the amendment.",51
253,Mr ATKINSON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Wilmot) [5.47]: - I am verysorry that the other branch, of the Legislature has not seen fit to reduce the distance specified in this clause to 5 or 7 miles. In our principal' Electoral- Act it was originally provided that any elector who had' reason to believe that he would be.more than 5 miles distant from a polling booth on polling day should he entitled to vote by post. If we fix that distance at 15miles we shall impose a very serious handicap upon many persons who already experience, a difficulty in getting, to the. poll. Why should not all electors vote by post so long as the elecr tion, can be honestly conducted under, that system? If the exercise of the postal vote can be adequately safeguarded-as I think it can-n o objection can be urged to it. There has never been any evidence forthcoming in support of the accusation that wholesale misconduct has occurred in connection with postal voting. - Dr MALONEY - What happened in Queensland?",51

Had. it not heen for the particular way in which the clause was dealt with, I should have moved' an, ",51
255,Mr ATKINSON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"There might be number some point in doing so if there were a vote chance of getting it'carried, b ut as things are, I can only express my regret that the provision inserted by the Senate w i become - law. I hope 'that before general election we may have an opporthis tunity to .fix a more reasonable limit, ""than 10 miles.",52
256,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"East Sydney) [ 5 . 5 2 ] oppose the adoption of the Senate's one, amendment, and I hope that the Comfor mittee may reject' it . The postal vote was intended primarily for the use of I the sick and infirm. That was virtually admitted by the Minister in introducing the Bill . We know how greatly the postal amendment. voting system has been abused in the past, but we have consented to re-establish it so that the sick and infirm may not be disfranchised, and we shall be unwise if we reduce the l i m it of distance from 15 to 10 miles. When the postal vote was in operation before, I did not hesitate, whentrouble business persons and others told they were likely to be unable to go to the polling booth on election day, to urge - them to record their votes by post. B u I see no reason why .this privilege should be given to any but those who are sick. We cannot blink the fact .that unorable doubtedly any privileges that the law gives will be used, .and those who use profession; .them will not be hlameable for doing This system will give an advantage - to members of the opposite party in the securing of votes. A very intelligent American once told me that he did not care what the electoral so long as he had the - counting of the votes. This provision portunity for the counting of .votes. The other day, when the Acting Prime M in ister (Mr W at t ) spoke of his ment as Democrats, I said that they did not 'understand the meaning of 'bounded the word, and the Bill shows that they do not. The postal system was repealed because of the abuses under it . Men would say to canmore didates, "" If you do not get me a postal vote, I will not vote for you."" Under a proper electoral law, every voter who can possibly do so is required to go to the polling hooth, - and there cast his vote undeT such conditions as make it a true record of his electoral opinion. The of those who will use the postal will . be greatly increased if we reduce the limitation of distance from 15 to 10 miles, and this will create great l l - confusion' in the conduct of elections. the The true Democrats are those who sit on side--""w e are Democrats at heart, and in mind -'and body-and are not in f avour of the proposal for reduction of the dis- I tance, though, if the proposal were a good we should support/ it. Those who vote us have not the means to travel long - distances. I hope that the Minister, who, am sure, desires to go down to posterity ' as a Democrat of liberal principles, will not insist on agreeing to the Senate's",52
257,Mr ATKINSON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,Does the honourable member consider it democratic to c u r t a i l ' voters' privileges?,52
258,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"It is not democratic to allow persons who 'will not take, the to go to the ballot-box to use disme that creditable methods of voting.",52
259,Dr MALONEY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Melbourne) [ 6 . 3 ] - I recognise that after the trouble .the Got vernment have had with the Bill in the Senate it is not likely to allow further alterations, but the remarks of the honmember for Wilmot (Mr At k i nson), who is an ornament of a brilliant staggered me. If he will look so. at the reports of Maloney v. MCEacharn and Chanter v. Blackburn, he will see how postal voting has been abused. 'The High Court declared a Melbourne elec'tipn null and void because of 'the misuse law was pf postal voting.",52
260,Mr ATKINSON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"But this is another gives opsystem of postal voting. "" Dr MALONEY - It is not 'actually - the same system, but it is a similar - one. GovernI ask the honourable member to consider that, in that little portion of Melbourne by Bourke, Spring, Victoria , and Elizabeth streets, where voters could not voting have been more than one-third of a mile away from a polling booth, there wer,e votes 'by post than in the whole of Western Australia, - also in Queensland, and, on two occasions, in the whole of 'Tasmania. It is of no use, therefore,- for the honourable member to persist in his attitude that thei*e is nothing to-be alleged against postal voting. The honourable, member stated that the Electoral Commission had found nothing serious in the operation of postal voting. I,will quote one reference, which was endorsed unanimously by members of that Commission. We felt that the position was serious enough for us to place the following words on record as a recommendation to the Government:The electoral law should not be forged as a party weapon, but should aim at making it possible for every elector to record his vote. Apparently, about 77,000 electors were unable to vote at the election in consequence of the abolition of postal-voting facilities, many of whom would be the .mothers of our people,. fulfilling the noblest duties of life, and would have a keener personal interest in-the government' of the country than many who recorded votes. We, therefore, suggest the amendment of the Act to provide for postal voting prior to the day of election, with Sufficient statutory safeguards. I do not think that the evils of which I have spoken will be so strongly marked under the present measure. I am confident that the electoral officers will do their duty, and will not permit any injustice if they have the power to stop it ; but the limit of 15 miles is little enough. I have trudged thigh deep in mud to give ray vote at a certain election, and I occupied seven hours in walking 11 miles.",52
261,Mr ATKINSON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member could not expect women to do that.,53
262,Dr MALONEY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Certainl y not. But there are few people resident 15 miles from a polling booth who could not secure a lift in a vehicle on election day.  honourable member for Calare - (Mr. Pigott), in asking that the limit should be 10 miles instead of 15, furnished a Strong argument why the clause should remain as it was originally. He. said that there were men engaged in harvesting,, and he asked whether employers should be put to trouble and inconvenience through those men leaving their work to go into a township to vote, when they could, vote by post if it were provided that the limit be 10 miles. I know something about influence having been brought to bear on employees by employers. The honourable member for Calare said that such things-if they ever happened-oc curred years ago, and would not be repeated now. But they do occur now, and at every opportunity. I urge the Minister (Mr Glynn) to leave the Bill as he introduced-it. There is a by-election pending; and if , in the light of experience, if is found that the law requires amendment with respect to postal voting, it will be easy for the Government to make the limit 10 miles instead of 15. But I again ask why there should be all this haste with regard to this Electoral Bill? I think an answer is to be found in the fact that we happened to shoot a "" swan."" In Queensland, there have been occurrences which might well be described as political atrocities. Influence was brought tp bear upon employees by employers. I may say that, ever since I have had a vote in Australia, I have done as I wished, whether my boss liked it or not.",53
263,Mr JOWETT,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Probably your boss did as you wished.  always prepared to give a fair thing to my boss. I would never undertake day work where I could get piece-work. There is no employer for whom I have ever worked who would not take me back now, provided 1 was of the same age and capabilities as when he employed me. If a man on a station has a wife and four or five children, there are more than"" fifty ways by which an employer could tell that man how and for whom he should record his vote; and, often enough, in order to keep a roof over the heads of his family, a man would practically sell his vote. To-day, however, the boot is on the other foot. We do not do what the boss tells us. in Queensland. He does what we tell him. . iSo far as the merits of 10 miles as against 15 miles are concerned, I would be satisfied to do away with all limitations. Then all parties would be able to Start from scratch; and, if it comes to manipulating voting at an election, I would be prepared to give any man all he wanted. What we desire is a square go. I have never yet gone into an election fight except to win, whether for myself or for anybody else for whom my services were being given.",53
264,Mr FOWLER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"But there are some things you would not do.  doubt; but, as for voting, I would say, "" Vote as early and as often as the electoral officer will allow.""",54
265,Mr FOWLER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I do not believe that of the honourable member.  ing, anyhow. I suggest that the Bill remain as the Minister introduced it, and if experience proves that an amendment of postal voting is required, I shall not oppose it. The Bill before the Committee is the cleanest and best electoral measure we have known since Federation.",54
266,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"You might include in that commendation the Minister in charge of the Bill.  ing. Every honourable member knows what Mr Glynn's political and personal character is. For straightness he., stands alone; and I would ask him, if he could do so, without going back on his supporters",54
267,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"This is a reasonable compromise.  the Minister want? In his original Bill he inserted 15 miles, and that was agreed to by this Committee. The Minister has made a personal study of electoral matters ever since he has been in the Federal Legislature, He must have known, when he inserted this provision, right, or he would not have, put it there. What has come over the Minister in the interval between that moment when the Bill left this House and the time of its return in its amended form ? I urge the Minister to stick to his Bill.",54
268,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Yarra) [6.19] - The history of this Bill is peculiar. I placed upon the notice-paper, and debate on its second reading took some time.",54

270,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I know that I shall be kept close to the point of discussion, so far as you are concerned, Mr Chairman. The CHAIRMAN.*-The honourable member should be respectful to the Chair. Mr TUDOR,- I shall be as respectful to the Chair as the Chair is to me.",54
271,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,It is pretty cold outside.,54
272,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,I know what it is like outside. I am not afraid of being threatened with being put outside. I have experienced that before. Under this clause postal voting in its worse features is reenacted.,54
273,The CHAIRMAN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN, The honourable member will not be in order in. discussing the clause.,54
274,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I propose only to point out the effect of the Senate's amendment. The action of the Government in inserting in this clause, while the Bill was in another place, an amendment under which it will be possible for every elector, who has reason to believe. that he will not be within 10 miles of a polling booth on election day, to apply for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot paper, will have the effect of aggravating the abuses formerly associated with the system. The clause originally provided for a distance of 15 miles. Why has the reduction to 10 miles been made? The Bill, as introduced into this House, had. been carefully considered by the Minister, and he had Cabinet approval for every clause in it . Supporters of the Ministry declared that the limit 'of 15 miles was too wide, and that it should be reduced; but the Minister, disregarding their protests, stood by his Bill. What influence has been at work since the Bill that it was all left this House?",54
275,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"This 'amendment could not have been made at the time referred to by the honourable member, since a previous amendment had been put in such a way as to make it impossible for me to submit it.",54
276,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member t was refers to the amendment which I moved on behalf of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton).,54
277,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"If the Minister had thought of making this amendment at that time, he would have moved it before I took action.",54
278,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,It was the way in which the amendment was put from the Chair that blocked me from taking action.,54
279,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Not one amendment has .been made in - this Bill without the approval of the Minister. We were unable, when the Bill was before us, - to secure t i e passing of one .amendment unless the Ministerial party were .favourable to it.  which I moved.",55
280,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,And I assured honourable members at the time that this amendment reducing the distance from the 15 miles to I'D anaies would be made in another place.,55
281,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I did not hear that assurance given. I certainly object to .the reduction. It may be said that .as 1 represent a 'Small 'electorate, the question does not affect me, but I would remind honourable members that, since the .provision that absent voters shall be 'entitled to vote before Registrars has been removed, constituents .of mine who were away from my electorate - an polling day would not be able to vote 'Unless they did so by post - Nevertheless, I think ""the principle involved is wrong. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has pointed out that, on the occasion of a general election, more postal votes were cast in respect of a .subdivision running from Spring-street to Elizabeth Street; and from Bourke-street .to Victoriastreet than were polled in the whole of Western Australia. I know that the postal voting system .has been abused. Mr RICHABD. FOSTEB - Supporter s the honourable member's own party were unable to show ihe Electoral 'Commission that' it had been abused before.",55
282,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member for Melbourne denies that - statement.,55
283,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,Then why did he sign our report?,55
284,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"He has pointed - out that it is mentioned in the report of the Commission that the number of postal votes recorded in respect of a small 'subdivision of the electorate of Melbourne was equal to the total postal votes cast for Western Australia, and that, on the occasion of 'two different elections, there were more postal votes in Telation to that one subdivision than were cast for the whole State of Tasmania. Again, in the electorate of Kooyong, the postal votes - recorded were eight times as many as - those recorded for the neighbouring electorate of Yarra. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mav Foster) says that no abuse of the postal voting .system was briought under :the notice of the Electoral Commission. Is it not well known that when the system was previously in force, domestic .servants were practically compelled to vote by post, so that their employers might know how they were voting?",55
285,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Statement s to that effect were made, but every witness before the Electoral Commission said - that he did not know of one specific case of the kind.",55
286,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"It cannot be said that - the difference between the postal votes - recorded in these two electorates is to be accounted for by the fact that a great - number pf the women electors of Kooyong were prevented from going to the polling booth because, they were performing the - highest function of womanhood. The birth rate' for Kooyong is far below that of Richmond, which is in my electorate.",55
287,Unknown,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Sitting suspended from 6.SO to 7.J/.5 p.m Mr 'TUDOR - I regard this amendment as a retrograde .step which places us exactly - where we were formerly.

288,Sir ROBERT BEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"It is - not a - question of . of distance, but a question of safeguards.",55
289,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The Government decided that 15.miles .should be the distance, unless there - were conditions .imposed by ill-health or travelling. We can easily imagine, ifor instance, that-a person on the East-West railway would be unable to record his vote, and no doubt we .shall always have people who are compelled to travel on polling day.

300,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,That is provided for.,57
301,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Yarra) [8.4] - Fro m the time the first Electoral Bill was introduced into this House, I have always taken a deep interest in voting by blind people, or people whose sight is so impaired that they require assistance - in voting. There is a provision in'some of the State Acts enabling a blind electo* to take some otherperson with him into the polling booth to mark his paper for him, but some Returning Officers have objected to that. The Senate's amendment provides that the authorized witness may mark the blind elector's ballot-paper "" in the presence of a witness."" I should like it made perfectly clear that the witness referred to shall be a witness selected by the elector, and I suggest to the Minister that the Senate's amendment should be amended by inserting after the wit- word "" witness "" the second time occurring, the words "" selected by the elector."" It should be remembered that we are dealin the ing with postal-voting provisions, and these votes will not be recorded in a polling' booth under the supervision' of skilled officials.",57
302,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The authorized witness is that subject to certain penalties if he does not do right, and so is the witness if he does anything wrong.",57
303,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I am aware of that; but, for the protection of the blind elector, I think it should be made perfectly clear that the witness shall be a witness selected by him. Mr Glynn.'- I have never known any question raised on this point.",57
304,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"This is a new system."" Mr Glynn.'-No ; it is not! "" Mr TUDOR - I think it would be wise if the Minister were agreeable to insert after the word ""witness"" the words "" selected by the elector."" I know that we cannot hope to have the amendment made unless the Minister agrees to accept it.",57
305,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [8.7] - I do not think that the suggested amendment is necessary, though I quite appreciate what the honourable gentleman has said. I have never heard of any interference by a witness in these cases, although a similar provision haB been in operation under two Acts. The authorized witness is bound by express directions to do certain things, and is subject to. penalties if he does wrong, and any witness who interferes or discloses what he sees is subject also to a penalty. I cannot see what danger could arise from the acceptance of the Senate's amendment as it stands.  the case of a blind elector in a blind institution or in hospital. As provided for under the Bill, the doctor of the institution might be the authorized witness, but how is the blind elector to know how the doctor has marked his ballot-paper unless he has some witness present to see what the doctor does ? It must be remembered that the blind elector cannot question the vote, and there is security in having a third person present when the vote of a blind person is recorded. The Minister, as a lawyer, will know that if three persons are charged with a crime, there is a chance that one of the three may "" blow the gaff."" I am sure that the honourable gentleman desires to safeguard the in-' terests of the blind elector, and to - provide that the witness shall be a witness selected by the elector would overcome every difficultyThis is not a party question. It does not matter whether the blind elector votes for Labour or "" Boodle,"" though I do not think many blind people would vote for ""Boodle."" It has been my rule through life to look after the interests of the under-dog, becauso I believe that "" Boodle "" can always look after himself, or can get others to look after him, as witness what occurred in connection with the discussion on the Land Tax Bill. I appeal to the Minister to insert the words suggested by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor).",57
306,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,I am afraid it would put a limitation upon the elector which might not be agreeable to him.  call his wife as a witness. Surely should have the right to - say who is witness the marking of his ballot-paper by the authorized witness.,58
307,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I think the Senate's amendment is all right as it is.  ing when, by the acceptance of the gestion of. the honourable member Yarra, the Minister might be absolutely sure that the interests of the blind elector would be safeguarded?",58
308,Mr FENTON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Maribyrnong) [8.13]. - 1 hope that the Minister will accede to the very modest request of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor). Blind persons usually go to a polling booth accompanied by a relative or intimate friend, and I think that when voting by post they should have the right to select the' persons who are to witness the marking of their postal ballot-papers by the authorized witnesses.",58
309,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The Wind elector will already have selected the authorized witness. Honourable members wish to give him asecond security. He will already have selected the best man he can find in the authorized witness.,58
310,Mr FENTON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The authorized witness may be any one of the persons provided for in this Bill. I can scarcely conceive that any' one would be so evilminded as to cheat a blind person Out of his vote, but the witness called upon to .witness the marking of the blind elector's ballot-paper, under this provision, might be a political opponent of the elector. I think that the blind elector should have the right to select the person who is to witness the marking of his ballot-paper for him. As there are not so many blind people in the Commonwealth, surely it is not too much to ask that they be allowed to choose their own witnesses. No doubt, for the most part, blind persons are accompanied by their friends to the polling booth, and it is a .fair - thing that their friends should be their witnesses.",58
311,Mr CHARLTON,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"(Hunter) [8.16] The request made by honourable members who have preceded me is a reasonable one, because one can readily conceive that it might be objectionable to a blind person to be obliged to go to a polling booth ache companied by some one he does not know. to It would be much more satisfactory if a blind voter were allowed to choose his own witness.

323,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I wish the National party would oppose me seriously, and send 50 or 100 motor cars into my electorate, as they did into Corio. That would help our Senate candidates, because it would get people to the poll. One of the reasons why I want compulsory voting put in this Bill is that the more people go to the poll the better. Not only was the Bill rushed through here, but in another place, in order, as they thought, to penalize the party that have a right to criticise their measures, the Government said, "" We will make you sit up all night, and will not allow the sitting to be suspended for supper, or even for breakfast""- a thing that has never been done in this Chamber. The Government with their majority were determined to nse the Standing Orders to put a Bill of 220 clauses through Committee at one sitting for the purpose of obtaining a miserable party advantage. Nothing like it has ever been seen in the history of this Parliament before. It will rank with the Ready incident, where a' man was induced to walk out of Parliament allegedly sick. The rules and procedure of Parliament have been prostituted for the purpose of obtaining a' party advantage ; the guillotine was used to fix a time in which the Bill must pass, and all the forms of Parliament were employed to prevent members from expressing their opinions on it. All this was done to put through a measure that should be above party. Many honourable members opposite have admitted that the Bill has been passed simply for the purpose of the Coraneamite election. What, is the reason of that? It is because one gentleman who intended to nominate gave notice to the National party that he would stand whether he was pre-selected or not. He is standing now.

With all their faking of the Electoral Act, and all their arranging of the electoral provisions, I believe the Government will not succeed at the coming by-election. The Ministerial party voted tonight against the provision allowing a blind voter to select his own witness in connection with the postal vote, although when he goes into a polling booth, where there is less danger of him being defrauded of his vote, his interests are safeguarded. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) moved that the > words "" chosen by the voter"" should be' inserted after the word ""witness,"" but the Ministry opposed the amendment.",61

The Minister claims that the blind person will have the choice of witnesses, but he knows well that this not be the case, because the Act specifies a list of persons who are authorized witwise nesses.

No one but the Government and its supporters. The fusal to permit a blind person shall be his witness is one of the most shameful things that has ever been perpetrated in this House. In the case of postal votes, the only person that the voter can secure as a witness is the authorized witness who comes to him for the purpose.",62

In many parts of my electorate the only authorized witness who can be secured to record postal votes is the policeman to patrols the stations once a month, and if voter happens to miss him he loses his opportunity of voting.

If the insertion of a few words will make the provision perfect, why should it not be done? Blind people should have independent witnesses to their ballot-papers. I am told that they have, but I say they have not. I shall give-a case in point. In the Herbert electorate at the second Federal election, a political agent went _ round it. gathering postal votes.

The Nationalists in the Corangamite electorate are like a lot of Kilkenny cats; several of them are bursting to serve their bleeding country. Instead of the National party sitting in Melbourne and dictating who shall be the party candidates in future, its organization will require to follow the lead of the Labour party and do propaganda work between elections in order to sustain whatever reputation the Nationalists had in the past. The Government had in this House fiftythree supporters and the Opposition only twenty-twoj but because the Labour party shot one little swan - the Nationalists are using'their majority in this Parliament to rush the Bill into law in order that it may govern the Corangamite by-election.

Quite a large number of our returned soldiers are afflicted with blindness. I have in m y mind one bright young Australian who enlisted for service overseas, and who recently returnedstone-blind.

346,Mr RILEY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,And notwithstanding that the Minister himself obtained a big number of returned soldiers' votes at the last election.,64

They bludgeoned it through thisChamber by means of the guillotine, and yet to-night the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) gave clear evidence that he is not familiar with its provisions by declaring that a blind elector has a .right to nominate the authorized witness to his vote. It is monstrous that the blind electors in Australia, who have the sympathy of every rational man aud woman, should be subjected to a disability in the matter of voting.

351,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I am quite sure Of that. The honourable member was quite sincere in the suggestion which he made as to the necessity for amending the clause in the Bill relating to the nomination of authorized witnesses in connection with the pqstal voting system. One's first impression might well he that it would be .better to allow the blind elector who wanted to vote to select his own witness; but there is another side to the matter. In all these cases we have to decide according to the balance of convenience. The Bill creates a class of persons, to be chosen for their good standing in the community, to act as authorized wit-, nesses. They will be officials, with the imprimatur of Government appointment, justices of the peace, wardens of mining fields, and others who can be relied on to see that effect is given to the voting provisions of the Bill. Such persons may not be as abundant in the Maranoa division as in large centres of population, but some persons of the class will be available there for every' blind person who wishes to vote. The blind elector may select of this class - the man . in whose honesty he believes. The honourable member for Maranoa desires that another person should be selected as a check on the authorized witness; that, although the blind elector can make his choice among the class of persons selected as authorized witnesses because they hold positions for which honesty is a necessary qualification, he must be compelled to select another man as well to watch the person in whose honesty he believes. We have provided that some one must watch the authorized witness to see that the law is complied with.",65
352,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,And he can be the blind man's witness.,65
353,Mr GLYNN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,Yes . The point has been taken by members of the Opposition that there is no obligation on the Administration to see that the person appointed to watch the authorized witness is selected by the blind man.,65

The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) has stated what he says are the reasons for pushing the Bill through.

Had our only object been to enforce preferential voting, a Bill to do so. could"" have been introduced nine months ago. We have preferred, however, to risk seats by the splitting of votes at by-elections in order to make our electoral measure as perfect as possible. The desire has been expressed that as many of the provisions of this measure as can be applied to the Corangamite election shall be applied to it. I promised that if postal voting could be brought into force there it should be done. Practically all the provisions of the Bill will apply to the election. Of course, some, such as that requiring more declarations of qualifications in connection with the nominations, cannot be made to apply; but every provision that can be made to apply will apply.

I am. glad that it is proposed, that this tax shall not come up for review year after year, but that this provision shall apply to "" all subsequent years."" Thus, we shall not have inflicted upon us by the Ministerial Bolsheviks-, cries such as we heard last night in objection ""to the payment by them of their fair share of taxation. Their attitude was, ""Tax any- 'one except us."" Honourable members who spoke upon this measure last. evening quoted a number of figures regarding the incidence of the land tax. They insisted that it would Tuin the coun-. try, and would compel residents of the country to come into the towns. One honourable member referred to inhabitants of the city as parasites. They are no more parasites than country residents. Such a remark is on a par with that made by the honourable"" member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald), who spoke of persons living in the country as vagabonds who had to go from place to place to sell their labour. I will say for the honourable member for Hindmarsh, however, that he was the only honourable member on the other side who spoke in support of the Government in their proposal that the provisions of this Bill should apply to all years subsequent to the present financial term. Practically all - other honourable members opposite admitted that, although they objected to the measure, they would ' vote for it,- but that it would have to be remembered that. they did so only in view of the extraordinary circumstances. I have a greater admiration for the six honourable members on the Ministerial side who voted .against the Bill, conscientiously believing that they were doing the best for their constituents, than I have for those who opposed it and yet voted for it. According to Knibbs, there are, among the 5,000,000 residents of Australia, only 718,000 land-holders. Those - figures, upon analysis, show that persons owning less than £200 worth of land represent one-twelfth of the total population, and they hold - only one-fifteenth of the land o'fAustralia. At the other end of the scale there are about 78,000 holders of land or estates ranging in value between £1,000 and £3,000, and Mr Tudor. between £3,000 and £5,000, and from £5,000 upwards. Those 78,000 persons' hold three-fourths of the value of the land in Australia, amounting to more than £320,000,000. There are 12,182 persons each holding £5,000 worth of land.",66
363,Mr RODGERS,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"This is not really a land tax, but a tax on some of the land in Australia, excluding the major portion.",67
364,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"If the honourable member desires to reduce the exemption from £5,000, he will, no doubt, be given an opportunity, and the effect of his .action - will be to increase the area of taxation. I- .shall have pleasure in voting with the Government upon rthis .Bill, and I - am glad that it is to - apply, not only ""to 19 IS, but to call subsequent years.",67
365,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN, said last night that that was not so.,67
366,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I am glad, at any rate, that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) is anxious that the exemption should be reduced below .£5,000.",67
367,Mr RODGERS,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,I said no such thing.,67
368,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,I thought-the honourable member's interjection a fewminutes ago. certainly indicated that. Mr .RODGERS - I am not a land-taxer.,67
369,Mr TUDOR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member now is trying to amend his earlier statement. Does the honourable member agree with that other honourable member who last night opposed the Bill and said, in effect, "" For Heaven's sake, do not tax us; take it out of the kiddies who go to the picture shows""? Honourable members opposite prate about economy. At the same time they take good care that we are not-furnished with an opportunity to discuss the Budget. It was promised that this would be a financial session,, but we have not yet had a chance to discuss the .Budget. Insteadof that procedure being adopted, the Government prefer to bring .down taxationmeasures piecemeal. First, there is the-entertainments tax, then the postage, tax, then the income tax, which was agreed to unanimously, and now there is the land tax. But there isr no debate: upon the Budget. It would be useless for honourable members todisother cuss the Budget. "" Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I am quite with the honourable member on that. - Mr TUDOR - The trouble with the honourable member for Wakefield is that his sentiments are one way, but his votes go the other: . Mr RICHARD FOSTER (Wakefield) [9.58] - I cannot share in the delight pressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that the Bill is to - befrom come an enactment of a permanent character. I admit that clause 3' sets it out specifically, but I intend to move for the deletion of those four words, "" and all. subsequent years."" shall support the Bill, with that amendland ment, on the ground that it is a war sure, and that it is of a very temporaryParliament nature. I call attention to the fact in his Budget statement the Treasurer (Mr Watt) dealt with this particular question under the heading "" Bridging the Gap."" The Treasurer set forth the items of - taxation, and - pointed out exceedingly difficult it would be to secure sufficient funds to meet all demands. continued that in order to adjust matters - o r to bridge the gap-it would be necessary to introduce certain temporary meawould sures ; and of those, this Bill situation was brought under the notice of the Treasurer last night, and he remarked that he had never viewed this as other than a temporary provision to meet a. difficulty: I need not remind those who have been in the House for some time that I have been an uncompromislongs ing opponent of Federal land taxation Federal land tax. fromits inception.",67

371,Dr MALONEY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,Some one said the day' that the taxation of land-owners amounted to about 2.0s.. in the £1.,68
372,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I advise the: honourable member to read in Kansard the statement submitted by the Treasurer, in which he compares taxation, in Australia with that operating in Great Britain. If he does, he will find that our taxation is exceedingly heavy and parexticularly severe upon land-owners. My opposition to this form of taxation the very beginning has been on the. ground that the area of land taxation should be left absolutely to the States. At the first Federal Convention, which gave us our Constitution, there was' a lengthy I and very able discussion on the question of taxation as a Federal instrument, meaand the provision that the Commonwealth should .have power to impose that such, taxation was carried by only a. narrow margin. The burden of the debate was that, it was necessary to provide for it in the Constitution, so that it might be available to meet any unseen how contingency, such asan outbreak of war, orsome financial calamity. . The memHebers of the Federal Convention-went further, and said that the day was. very far - distant when the Federal authorities be likely to impose an income tax, is one. That let alone a land tax.",68
373,Mr MAHONY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,I would remind the honourable member that since then we any have been engaged in a great war..,68
374,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"But , long before there was any thought of war, the party to which my honourable friend beintroduced, for the first time, a 1 At that time, the Labour Government was embarrassed with revenue.

They have never pulled up ",68
375,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The hon will recollect that, when an amendment was moved to apply the Federal land tax to leaseholds, and particularly pastoral leases, I strenuously opposed it. It was also opposed by the honourable member, as well as by several other honsuch orable members of the Labour party, and, but for the fact that two or three. Labour representatives from Queensland and New South Wales were unavoidably absent, that amendment would not have ever known. been carried. Much of the outside lands of Australia should never have been subjected to this try? taxation. The taxation of pastoral leaseholds in outside country was but the worse policy for the wage-earners that could have been introduced. Since then, we have had, on the whole, fairly good times; but had it not been for the recent high prices, the condition of these side lands, bad as it is today, would have been infinitely worse. There need come a testing time, such as many of have experienced on a number of occaagree sions, and existing settlement on this outside country will be driven off. Once it is driven off, it will be many before there will be any return of When this measure was under discusoutside sion a day or two ago, a Ministerial porter saidj by way of interjection, that there was no sign of depression in respect doubtedly. of pastoral leaseholds, and declared in support of his statement that pastoral leases had been selling at good prices. Despite the abnormally high prices ruling for wool and carcass meat, these pastoral estates, with one or two very can favourable exceptions, have been sold for the bare price of the stock on. the runs. areas. Beyond the market value of the stock on the runs, nothing has been given for . improvements or for the leases themselves. That is the position in regard the outside country.",68
376,Mr ARCHIBALD,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,It does not apply to Queensland.,69
377,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"rl am not referring to the rich areas of QueensRailway land, but my remarks will apply to very considerable portion of that State. Whilst in South' Australia, and some other parts of the Commonwealth, we have long-continued droughts, Queensthan land also suffers just as frequently from droughts, but they are not of such long to duration. We should give every inducement to people to settle in the drier areas. Instead of imposing taxation on land in areas, we should rather give a bonus to the man who will settle there and continue the production of wool and meat, for which there is going to be a better outlet in the way of export than we have",69
378,Mr ARCHIBALD,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,Will ' not this better outlet improve the value of such coun,69
379,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"It will;' we have men settled on areas far removed from civilization who, for two or three years, make a big thing out of their enterprise, and then, with the coming of a drought, lose everything. With conoutditions such as those to be contended with, we should place-no obstacles in the only way of development. Those who know us anything about the outside country will with me that, because of the threat of taxation of this kind, very little has been done there in the way of improvea year ments of a permanent character. it.

We have builta railway to Western Australia at a cost of about £7,000,000; and we have fairy tales told in the Commissioner's first report, a as we have had similar stories told before about the great prospect of development on the Nullabor Plains. m But' there is infinitely better country those plains, and on that country there are no cattle today, although it is supposed to have been occupied for for t y or fifty years.",69

There are first the city and the metroaneas, which will pay the tax, but i u which there is a chance of passing it on to the community; and this is what will be seen by those honourable members who are supporting this measure. This can only mean an increase of 'the burden on the great mass of the we people who live in the city, whether in the shape of rent, or the increased cost ef living in other directions.  all taxation?",70

394,Mr RODGERS,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member has probably followed Henry George into the blind alley in which this measure *,70
395,Dr MALONEY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Anothe r Daniel come Mr Rodgers.^Please be quiet, cock",70
396,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN," I must ask honourable members to cease interjections, especially those 1 of a personal nature. . One interjection leads to another, and while exception is not often taken to an occasional' remark. I must insist on silence if disorder",70
397,Mr RODGERS,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) is probably a theorist of the single tax school. e . It is remarkable that the great theorists who seek to impose land taxes are' men who do not pay them.,70
398,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,I pay them.,70
399,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I must ask the honmember to observe my ruling with of us who beregard to interjections. ' Mr Rodgers - The theorists to whom I refer seem to have a special delight in seeing the burden of taxation f all on the shoulders of others. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) is admittedly land taxer, whereas I am not, because do not believe in taxing capital or wealth. Before there was a Federal land tax. I was an advocate of meeting the requirements of the country try a tax on incomes. Accordingly as people enjoy the privileges of the community they get income, and on that income they should be taxed. The other two classes of land-tax payers are the leaseholders and the freeholders.' It has been very well argued, and, amongst others, most ably by the honor that, in taxing leaseholders, we are taxing people who have no direct beneficial interest in the landj we are taxing a State instrumentality in the shape of property specially reserved to the Crown. Surely it can be little satisfaction to a member of this Parliament to impose a tax on a State instrumentality, particularly when the tenure of the land is insecure, and - it is in the back-blocks where the conditions of life are very disagreeable. I come now tp another class of payers of land tax, and they are the owners of freehold land of a greater unimproved value than £5,000. The effect of economic conditions, especially in 'States like Victoria, that are highly developed, has been that all the rich lands have already been closely settled. If we follow the incidence of this taxation, we shall find it does not apply to rich lands which are now mostly held in small areas under conditions of close settlement. quired no Act of Parliament to. settle the Tower Hill country, which is the most closely settled country in Australia, from the rural point of view! Economic conditions, such as the richness of the soil, the climate, accessibility to markets, and all such conditions, weighed in the case of that country, as they do to a greater or less degree in every part of the Commonwealth. There is with land a parity of value that - finds its own level This land tax in its incidence affects mainly large holdings that are not accessible to railways or close to good markets, and are in districts which do not afford facilities for settlement in small areas. There are some exceptions; but, for the most part, the tax is applied to cheap land held in large holdings mainly for pastoral purposes, and which, with Australia's population today, cannot readily be nut to >a. hisher use. Mr Rodgers. I am in sympathy with any natural law, supported, if necessary, by State assistance, that has the effect of bringing all land suitable. for agriculture under the plough. OUTflocksand herds are - rested on natural conditions.. I agree that in the past this system has been responsible for great wastage; but this is due to the fact that Australia is a broad continent;' we have comparatively cheap"" land, and a small population. We rest our flocks and herds almost entirely upon natural conditions; but in America the stock of the country is chiefly sustained by agricultural effort. We are not so far advanced.  America are different.",70
400,Mr RODGERS,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Admittin g that,.the climate is not' alone the governing factor in America, where everything possible is done to make the rural life the most attractive life in the country.  nation:",71
401,Mr RODGERS,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I am aware that it is; but no one will say that the efforts of the people of Australia are mainly directed to making the lot of the people on the land a"" happy and contented one. I am not one toraise the question of that country versus city, because I know that there must be a well-balanced community, and that the cities and large towns must It rereflect the prosperity of the country. We have mortgaged the ""future to a great extent in this country, and our main dependence is upon OUT primary assets. Primarily it is the maintenance of our flocks and herds, and our agricultural effort upon which we must rely to"" meet our financial obligations. We have piled up a huge debt, and we must build up corresponding national assets. Our - secondary industries can afford us much help by reducing the necessity for importations to meet the needs of 'the people; but the great balance of trade against U3 On the other side of the world can only be met by the quantity of natural primary produce that we can export from Australia. This is not the time to heap up land taxation. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) rightly said that if it were the design of the Government merely to raise more revenue by this land taxation, its imposition would be inequitable, and could not be defended, because, as the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. - Tudor) proved, it throws upon from 12,000 to 13,000 people, who own certain wealth locked up in land, the obligation of making a levy for the benefit of the revenue, while exempting from any similar imposition the trusts, combines, and monopolies about which our honourable friends opposite have often been so eloquent. . Have not the great trading companies capital and resources? Do we not know that shipping companies during the period of the war have made profits in excess of those made by any other companies.  ber is also against the war-time profits Mr Rodgers.^-I hope that the orable gentleman will not introduce many questions for discussion at the time. If time permitted, I could show, that the war-time profits tax has been sponsible for making the people of this country pay higher prices for goods than they ever did before.",71
402,Mr ARCHIBALD,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Rubbish ! - Mr Rodgers-The honorablemem proved - ber seems to be a fair judge of that modity. "" .As the honourable member for Flinders - has pointed out, if the Governhave ment were taxing land merely for revenue purposes, tlieir action would be unfair and inequitable, and that would be 'whether it were in""operation for one or for-a greater number of years. When looking for revenue to discharge our war obligations, we should impose taxation land. upon the"" people in proportion to the extent to which they have enjoyed the privileges of the community, particularly ing the war period, and we should not permit those who have benefited to much greater extent than the land-owners hoofs. of the country to escape taxation if we impose it upon the land-owners. Honorto able members opposite have found some consolation in the imposition of land taxation for policy purposes; but it not the time, in the middle of a war, for ments any policy purpose, to impose taxation "" ""ber upon a particular section of the people. [299]- 2 I was pleased 'to have the announcement of the Treasurer that that is not the object of this impost. I wish to say that I do not believe there is one land-holder in the Commonwealth, and certainly I do not know one, who objects ,to bear a fair share of the burden of the country. But no man can contend that the capital of the land-owner owes a greater obligation to the country"" than does the capital of the shipowner. I conclude by saying that I regret that this measure was introduced. I offer my arguments to-night, as I did last night, not with any idea of hostility to the Government, but simply to maintain the principles upon which I won my seat in this chamber.",72
403,Dr MALONEY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Melbourne) [10.29]. - On e might have expected such a speech as has fallen from the lips of the honorhonable member for Wannom (Mr Rodgers) too from a m'an who has derided Henry same George, because the works of Henry George sounded the knell of the people rewhom the honourable member so continuously represents in this chamber."" The - welfare of a country does not depend on land being held in large areas, but on land being held in small estates. This is by the fact that in France, Auscomtria, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Holland, : and Denmark, in all of which countries I been, where there is 'the small estate Whenthere is the greatest degree of happiness. I visited England and Scotland, and subsequently France, and saw that in so the latter country even the fishermen year owned small. allotments of land, I had what was practically my first lesson in regard to the settlement of people'on the The argument used by the honourable durmember for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) reminds me of the reputed interview bea tween Moses and the gentleman with the Moses asked his opinion about the Commandments, and Satan is reputed have said that they would be all right if he were allowed to alter one word. When Moses asked him what that word was,'he is said he would like to alter the Commandby taking out the little word not ."" Of course the honorab e memT for Wannon agrees that throughout the length and breadth of Australia there is not a land-owner who does not want to pay his just share of taxation; but I take it that a large number want this taxation to be placed on the people in the manner indicated by the honourable member. Those acquainted with the operation of land laws in other parts of the world realise that the wealth of the community does not come necessarily from large estates. All the special pleading, therefore, is so much camouflage. As a matter of fact, no man who owns land to the amount of ,£5,000 unimproved value will come under this tax, and if he spends £20,000 or £50,000 on improvements he will not be called upon to pay one penny. The honourable member' also spoke lightly of and sneered at the' doctrine enunciated by Henry George. Possibly I was one of the first public men in Australia to speak on behalf of that great land reformer. - Mr Rodgers - I never sneered at Henry George. I merely said that our opinions do not follow his teaching.",72
404,Dr MALONEY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I understood the honourable member to scoff' at Henry George, or I would not have suggested that he was - another Daniel come to judgment.",73
405,Mr RODGERS,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"But your land-tax doctrine is miles away from that of Henry George. .Dr MALONEY - I had the honour to take the chair for Henry George in the Melbourne Town H all at a time when other politicians were afraid to do so. But the influence of that great man is growing, and will continue to grow. The future of Australia is not in the hands of those who hold large estates.",73
406,Mr ABCHIBALD,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,There is Thorold Rogers' works than in those of Henry George.,73
407,Dr MALONEY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I always understood Thorold Rogers to be more of a political economist than a land reformer. I believe, however, that he has done excellent work, and perhaps I am as great an admirer of him as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald). On this question of taxation I feel sure that if honourable members had really considered the position' they would not haye changed incidence of taxation when another small' Bill came before the House recently. Under that measure there is now an im position of 33£ per cent, on a 3d. picture theatre - ticket, bought by the poorer people of the community, whereas on 10s. worth of tickets for any ^other theatre the taxation represents only 8£ per cent. The Treasurer (Mr W at t ) evidently recognised that the incidence was unfair, and I think it is possible that within a year he will seek to have it altered. That is one reason why I did'not oontinue my criticism of that measure. As I understand the Government desire to pass this Bill .without further delay, I merely want to say that I full y concur with it , and shall vote against the amendment foreshadowed.",73
408,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Denison) [10.36]. - I intend to be brief, because I know the 'Treasurer (Mr W at t ) wants to get the Bill through, but I desire to explain my position on this important measure. Last night, unfortunately, I was absent, and 1 had no knowledge that a division was to be taken on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill . I had occasion to go into the country to speak at a gathering to celebrate the return of men who have served us so well at the F r o n t , and did not get back in time to record my vote. Had I been here I would have voted with the majority, because I have always been in favour of just taxation. From the commencement 'of the war I said I would do my utmost to make every one bear his fair share of any taxation' that might be necessary to carry' on the conflict. Many men made great sacrifices by allowing their sons to leave the land or city occupations in which they were engaged. They should not now be taxed. more in Those who remained behind should bear this burden, because they have been served so well by all of those brave men.' On the question of land value taxation, I may say that it is the only tax that cannot be passed on. The owner of land always gets the highest rent possible. As a rule, he lets - his land by tender, and. when the lease has expired, if the land will stand a greater rental, .he puts up the price and gets the value given to it , not by himself, but by the community. Although I do not pay the Commonthe wealth tax, I am paying the unimproved land value taxation in Tasmania, because I purchased land long before I came into this House, but have not done very much with it . As a result of the action of the Tasmanian Government in utilizing the latent power of the great lakes, my land has increased 50 per cent, in value,- and so I am quite properly called upon to pay additional taxation.  tax.",73
409,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Why should i not be used for revenue? All comes ""from the l and . . The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) was most illogical. At one moment he complaining that the city man would pay, because the tax would be passed to him, and the next moment he was saying that it was the man on the land who would have to pay. I am delighted to support this measure, because we were told when we came on to this side of the House that we had all sympathy with the. worker, and would sink our principles. This B i l strates that we have still the same and retain our principles. Australia the only Dominion in the British Empire where the worker has not been called on sired to be unjust. to pay for this war by means of indirect Customs taxation.

Let us be f a just, and tell the workers exactly how apologize. things are, leaving it to their intelligence to judge whether they are being fair l y treated. The honourable member  "" our time was coming."" Will it come when we can go on the platform and tell the workers that today in Australia a man owning land of an unimproved value of £327,000, and having a taxable income of £04,229, will pay in taxation, State and Federal, the sum of £43,686, or 68 per cent, of his income? Is there anyt thing unfair to the workers about that? wealth Let our friends opposite cease trying to fool them any longer. When they know how things are, they will be fair, because was no one is more just than they are. When they know the facts they will not treat on us as the honourable member says we will be treated. We are half-way. through our parliamentary term, and that, is why I am delighted to see the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , coming - from lost whence he sprang, politically speaking,, sitting with us on this side of the House, l demonand' enunciating these principles, notideas withstanding the strong pressure that is might be brought to bear on him by honourable members on this side if they deThey are not unjust.

413,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I should support this tax if I represented a country constituency, because 1 find, wherever I mingle with the people in town or country, that Australians are fair-minded and kind.

They desire to do justice, to the people as a whole, and hence they do not wish to evade paying fair and just taxation to meet the cost of this dreadful war.  speech - to which we have just listened is about the most amusing I have ever heard in this House.",75
414,Mr JOWETT,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"A very fine speech!  honourable member's tune. able member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) has the courage and effrontery to say he will tell working men and women from the platform' what the moneyed people have done for this country by way of taxation. ""What is the good of the honourable member telling the workers of Tasmania that the joker who owns. £327,000 worth of land has to pay a big tax, when, perhaps, the man he is talking to is not getting £3 a week, and has a wife' and k ds to keep. ; it to him to know that a wealthy man has to pay 68 per cent, of his income in taxation? It is poor satisfaction for working men and women, who have all their troubles cut out in their everyday .life, to hear that sort of tale when the honourable member opens the flood-gates of his oratory. No one knows better than the - honourable member himself what a struggle it is, and has been, for the ' workers to exist.. He is comparatively a young man, and has not gone .through what many of us in this House have.",75

417,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Why did not the honourable member assist me to increase the tax when it first come forward ?  answer the honourable member's interjection. He would not answer mine when he was speaking. The honourable member has been"" a consistent land-taxer, but it is strange that men such as he always advocate putting the tax on the other fellow.",75

419,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN, Order ! This is not a betting chamber.  on this Bill had it not been for the airy way in which the honourable member was talking about this man who owns £327;000 worth of land. Where is h e ! I want to meet him.,75
420,Mr MAHONY,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"What about Brother What satisfaction is Jowett ?  ber for Grampians may own 327,000 sheep, but he does not own land worth £327,000 - The majority of his holdings in Queensland are leaseholds.",75
421,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"That is why the honourable member objects to .the taxation of leaseholds.  tion of leaseholds. Every five years in Queensland leasehold land is re-assessed by the Land Board. The holder does not own the land, he merely occupies it for the length of his lease. Every leaseholder in Queensland is entitled to pay to the Crown what his lease is worth; but I do obiect to the Federal land taxation bein? extended to leaseholds. It is very unfair. When the Land Board re-assesses a leasehold, the lessee has to produce the who'e of his transactions to the Board, and the rent for the next five years is fixed accordingly. The Crown sees that it gets every penny of value out of the land. Very often a man may have suffered a loss, but owing to the fact that at the time of the re-assessment he is possessed of a certain number of stock, he is called upon to pay an increased rental. I have not known of a single case in which the rent of a leasehold has been reduced. ! As I was saying, I am staggered at the prospect of a man who holds £327,000 worth of land having to pay only 68 per' - cent, in land tax. When the honourable member for Denison tells the workers of Tasmania about this man, they will say, ""You are right, Mr Smith. man has paid quite enough, and should not be called upon to pay more. Government sliould increase the taxes, - either direct or indirect, on us."" At any rate, that is what that honourable member's speech amounted to. W it h all due respect to the preachings of great economists-man y of them are merely theorists-whe n their theories are put into practice we find something wrong some-where. We do not know where it is, but a proposition which looks all right on paper, in actual practice is found to be rotten. I hope that the Bill will go through. - Mr Watt - He a r , hear! That is a very fine sentiment.  some one at last is taking an interest in the man on the land. Some very near and dear .friends of mine have.recently been lost in. a bush fire at Barcaldine, where I spent my boyhood. They are small graziers, but circumstances which arose during the war put a few pounds in their way. Many men in that district are. in the same position, but at first they were struggling carriers and station hands, who had saved a l it t le money, and with assistance from the pastoralists managed to stock their holdings. Those are - the men whose interests I seek to serve. They are the men who have pioneered our hack country, and made it possible for us to move about in an easy manner, and the big establishments in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne to carry on their operations. - I do not wish to p it the city against the country. There is something in the bush that has for me a charm that no city ever had, and as long as I live my thoughts will revert, to the happy days I have spent in the back country. When one has lived in the bush, the town has very little attraction for him . On many occasions, I have gone to Brisbane, in tending to spend a month's holiday there, but after fou r or five days I have packed up my swag and returned to the country. Of course Australia must have manufactures, and I . hope some day to see the Commonwealth self-contained. But, as many honourable members on the GovernThat ment side have said, the one thing we must not do is to frighten capital away The from the country. Capital is very shy, and soon baulks. We never hear nowadays the old cry of the Conservatives about driving capital out of the country, because the whole world is being turned upside down. The primary industries, more than any others, require nursing.",75
422,Mr EODGERS,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"And while so many 'countries are competing for the capital, make the rural proposition attractive.  tries are made attractive, they draw people with small capital,' who become the backbone of a Commonwealth."" I remind honourable members of what has happened in the leasehold, country in .Western Queensland. When I first came to Australia in 1884, Saltern Creek Station shore 72,000 sheep. That country has heen cut up into smaller blocks, and has been worked by a number of small men, who went there with their capital and energy, and braved the dangers. Most of those people, including the Cudmores, came from South Australia. In the early eighties, artesian water was discovered, and today the area which was formerly comprised in Saltern Creek Station, carries over 250,000 sheep. In the face of these practical results, what becomes of the political economists and theorists?",76
423,Mr SINCLAIR,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The theories of the honourable member - for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) must have been put into practice there.  He has made a success of anything he has taken in hand in connection with land settlement and repatriation.,76
424,Mr JOWETT,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"He is a good man.  I do not always see eye to eye. No matter on which side of the House we sit, we are all imbued with the idea of doing the best we can for Australia. I urge the Government to be careful of what they do to the primary industries. It will not be long before price fixing and all the coddling and spoon feeding will cease, and our primary products will have to compete in the markets of the world. Australian exports,, whether of minerals, meat, grain, butter, or flour, compare more than favourably with those from other countries. "" As long as we give the man on the land a fair show, I am satisfied that he will come out on top. No men on the face of God's, earth have to put up with more inconveniences than nave the men who are developing the rural areas.. In conclusion I wish to relate to honourable members the misfortune of a friend of mine. One night, he retired to bed a wealthy man. The next day, he was as poor as on the day when he first settled in the district. A bush fire had devastated his land, killed his stock, and caused the death of one of his sons. How do honourable members propose to get over these hard facts by their theories? Actual experiences are what honourable members must study. Instead of talking about what they intend to do for the man on the land, let them do something. It is my ambition to see a good yeomanry established in Australia. They are the backbone of ""every country; they have been so in England, and they arc already so in Australia. Do not smother them with taxation and bad laws. Surely Australia is 'big enough? for all of us to live in. I invite the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) to come with me to Queensland after Parliament adjourns, and I will show him where Henry George's theories fail and the practical farmer succeeds.",77
425,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"East Sydney) [11.8] Nearly every honourable member who spoken on the Government side to-night has had a lot to say about the unfortunate man on the land. But the probate statistics prove that no pastoralist or farmer dies without leaving a very large sum of money behind him. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) referred to. some wealthy man /having paid 68 per cent, of his income in war-time taxation. I interjected that he was an absolute liar, and I was called to order and compelled to apologize. .",77
426,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN, I ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement. The fact that he previously withdrew an unparliamentary expression does not justify him in repeating it. The honourable member must not make references of that kind.,77
427,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The statement was true; but, of course, I know I must withdraw it. I have always contended that the Government have failed to tax the wealth of this country for war purposes in the way that they should have taxed it . Australia's share in the terrible struggle which has been waged in Europe has been paid for out of loan funds. Only the other evening the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) pointed out that our system of taxation is wrong, and that at the present time we are raising insufficient, revenue to meet our expenditure by at .least £7,000,000 annually. To-night the honourable member for - Denison endeavoured to show that the rich men of the^ community are bearing the sreater portion of the taxation to which our people are being subiected. Doubtless his idea was to get his statements circulated through the medium of Hansard for propaganda purposes - In replv to him, I need only point out that in 1915-16 the amount contributed in land tax to the State of New South Wales amounted only *to £3,100: the amount contributed by Victoria was £352 052; that of Queensland was £247.044: that of South Australia, £154,4.83; that of Western A""ptralia, £47.715; and that of Tasmania, £82,436. Yet the honourable member had the temerity to suggest that these landholders are benring their proper share has of taxation. We have also to remember that there are persons who own land in the city with a frontage,- say, of 100 feet and a depth of 150 feet, and upon which a building of, perhaps, thirteen stories has been erected. By no stretch of imagination can they further improve their property, and these persons are obliged to pay the Federal unimproved land value tax. This is unfortunately due to the fact that no differentiation can be made-between city .and country lands. I hope on a future occasion to be afforded an opportunity of dealing with some of ""the statements which have been made here to-night for the express purpose of creating dissension between the people of the city and those of the country. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: - Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3Tlie amendment of the principal Act made by this Act shall apply to assessments made for the financial year beginning on the first of July, One thousand nine hundred and eighteen, and all subsequent years. '  posedThat the words "" and all subsequent years "" be left out.",77
428,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"East Sydney) [11.24] The Treasurer (Mr Watt) told us that the object of the Bill was to raise money to cover war expenditure, and now it is proposed to limit the operation of the"" measure to the present financial year. If that is done, the tax will not be pf much assistance - in reducing our war debt.",78
429,Mr WATT,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,The object of the amend- ' ment is to bring this measure into conformity with the income tax measure which we have recently passed.,78
430,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"It is a sad thing that the Treasurer cannot withstand the pressure of representatives of the landed interests. The tax of 33^ per cent, on children's entertainment ""admission tickets is not fixed for one year only, nor does such a limitation apply to the increased taxes on tobacco, spirits, and beer. It has been contended that land taxation cannot be passed on; but the only tax that cannot be passed on is the bookmakers' tax on their tickets, which is most inequitable. The bookmaker who goes on the fiat and deals with the numerous small bets on Cup day has to pay £50, while the gentleman who bets in thousands has not to pay more than 30s.",78
431,The CHAIRMAN,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN, That matter is not affected by the amendment.,78
432,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I have already said that, in my opinion, those who are dealing with our financial affairs are muddlers. The representative of Flinders (Mr Bruce), though a new member, has begun to see the dangerous pass towards which our finances are drifting. In my opinion, the operation of this Bill should not be limited in the way proposed; and had it been known to members of the Opposition that the amendment was to be moved, there would have been more support to my request, day for an adjournment of the second-reading debate at the late hour of the night. The press is adversely criticising our expenditure; but when our soldiers return-, and demobilization begins, we must find employment for them, and we must prepare' for the changes ahead. We shall require anenormous amount of taxation to meet all our liabilities. The Treasurer has not told us why he has altered his views., We can only come' to the conclusion that, owing to pressure brought to bear on him, he has let the country down in the interests of those people who would have to .' pay under the provisions of the Bill. I admit that the opportunity furnished just now is. the last available to those who have taken advantage of the war to wring wealth out of the people. It is scarcely comprehensible that the 'Government could have been so weak as to be forced by those interests to climb down from their original attitude. My sense of responsibility as a representative of the people demands that I should insist on knowing from the Treasurer why he has altered his point of view. I am determined to try to bring before the people of Australia a realization of the loose methods of the Government in regard to 8152 LandTax finance. Why do they not take a pattern from the record of the British Parliament? Surely we should.be' able to do something to place our finances on a more solid basis. No doubt great pressure has been brought to bear upon the Treasurer by members of Ms party who represent the pastoral interests. interests almost have the Government "" in the bag."" During the war, a number of the wealthiest pastoralists of Australia were placed on the Wool Committee. I recognise"" that the Treasurer has displayed a good deal of courage in standing up against such pressure to the extent that he has done. I 'hope that he will have still more courage, and will decline to deal with taxation measures in this loose way. Why should this increase be confined .to only one year ? This action has been taken by the honourable gentleman as the result of the protests of those who represent wealthy interests. Either he has something running through his mind that he has not divulged, or he is losing courage. If time permitted I could quote figures showing that the people to whom this tax applies do not bear any great burden, although representatives of country districts are constantly pleading the cause of the "" poor country land-owner."" I went through the Riverina recently, and saw a lot of magnificent country, and one may travel by train through miles of that country without seeing a habitation. tion is d r if t in g from the rural districts into our large cities, the'fault-rests with the land owners. They do not attempt to make country life attractive,- or to find more employment for workers there. In the sugar districts of Queensland a man would be able to make a living on 5 or 6 acres if proper encouragement were extended to him, and he had the assistance of casual employment in the cane-fields. We did not think that the Treasurer would come forward, with this ment at the eleventh hour. prepared to give him the Bill, but he has caused this amendment to be submitted without giving the Opposition any notice of his intention. I do not think he appreciates the seriousness of hisproposal. the clause remains as introduced, owners will know exactly where they stand Mr West. [REPRESENTATIVES.

The finances of Australia should be handled by a man who understands the subject, and who has the courage to propose additional taxation when more taxation ie necessary to place them on a sound basis.
