2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: National Flag To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: (1) The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. (2) We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, not changed or replaced without first being voted upon by the people of Australia and passed by a majority of votes in a majority of States. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Carlton (from 34 citizens), Mr Hawker (from 81 citizens), Mr Jull (from 45 citizens) and Mr Riggall (from 747 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:1. We the undersigned wish to signify our strong opposition to any change in the design or colour of the Australian National Flag. 2. We believe that the current flag has served Australia well and will continue to do so in the future and represents a true manifestation of the Nation's history. by Mrs Bailey (from 86 citizens), Mr Howe (from 205 citizens) and Mr Sharp (from four citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and MemberS of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House our strongest support for the existing National Flag. The Australian National Flag is the most important symbol of the Australian nation and our national unity, and has evoked deep feelings of honour and respect for many generations of Australians. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian National Flag and to ensure that its design is not changed without the support of a referendum carried by the majority of Australians in the majority of States. by Mr Cobb (from 134 citizens) and Mr Nehl (from 61 citizens). Japanese Plutonium Freighter To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia is draws to the attention of the House that the Japanese plutonium freighter Akatsuki-maru will be sailing from the Cape of Good Hope across the Southern ocean to the south of Australia and through the Tasman Sea on its route to Japan. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: a) put Australia's welfare first; and b) demand that the Japanese government forbid this freighter to approach Australian shores. by Mr Gibson (from 260 citizens) and Mr Melham (from 81 citizens). Woodchipping To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of this House that we are concerned at the threats caused by logging to the integrity and continued existence of what remains of the forests of south eastern Australia. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Prime Minister and his Government (1) to phase out woodchipping for export; (2) NOT to renew a long-term export licence to Harris Daishowa; (3) to ensure that sensitive environmental areas, and specifically the proposed national park and . wilderness areas of Coolangubra, Cathcari, Egan Peaks and the Tantawangalo catchment, are protected and excluded from the proposed woodchip licence; and (4) to promote ecologically sound and sustainable forestry practices including: re-afforestation and plantation of native hardwoods and already cleared land to reduce pressure on native forests; and minimisation of wasteful uses of forest products. by Mr Barry Jones (from 767 citizens) and Mr Simmons (from 336 citizens). Nationalisation of Health Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House that the majority of Australians have no desire for the health services to be nationalised. ' Your petitioners therefore request the House to ensure that the health service is not nationalised without first being voted and approved by the people of Australia in a referendum. by Mr Beale (from 18 citizens). Five Dollar Note To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that we, the undersigned, wish to lodge a protest over the introduction of the new PLASTIC $5.00 NOTE which is totally unacceptable to the public. We find it to be too small in size, too light of weight and of a composition that makes it very hard to handle as they stick together and will not lay flat once they have been folded or bent and remain in a crinkled state. As the plastic $10.00 note was found to be unsuccessful we protest the right of Government to changing the $5 to this highly inferior note. The paper $5 note was a far superior currency and should have been maintained. Your petitioners therefore request the House to withdraw the plastic ,$5 note from c,irculation and replace it with a paper $5 note similar to the previous one. by Mr Braithwaite (from 6,039 citizens). Film Distribution To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of concerned cinema patrons in New South Wales draws to the attention of the House a NO SHARE rule practised by the big three film distributors in New Sou'th Wales, (United International Pictures Pty. Ltd., Village Roadshow Corporation Ltd, and Hoyts Fox Columbia Tri Star Pty. Ud.) which restricts our local cinemas to about half of the films which they would nonnally screen for us, and restrict our freedom to choose the films we wish to see and the time and place where we can see them. Roadshow has proposed a PER CAPITA PRICING system which if enforced will cause huge increases in the price of cinema tickets. Your petitioner therefore requests the House to conduct an inquiry into or have the Trade Practices Commission investigate these practices and if necessary amend the Trade Practices Act to make these practices illegal. by Mr Carlton (from 3,252 citizens). Antarctic Huskies draws To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that, with respect to Australia's Antarctic huskies: (1) There is no legal requirement to deport the huskies from Antarctica prior to 1994. (2) In 1991 the Minister for the Environment gave an undertaking in the Parliament to make, export proposals public before any decisions were taken. This has not been done. (3) The Minister has made arrangements to export the huskies to the USA. By doing so, the Minister is disposing of one of the few remaining icons of Australia's Antarctic heritage. (4) The Minister has not given sufficient consideration to finding suitable alternatives in Australia and has ignored suitable facilities in Victoria. Your petitioners call upon the House to urge the Government not to export the Antarctic huskies to the USA. As in duty bound your petitioners will ever pray. by Mr Carlton (from 116 citizens). Child-care Services To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives: We, the residents of the State of Queensland, draw to the attention of Ministers and Honourable Members of the House, the need for amendment to the wholesale Sales Tax laws to exempt all services for children, particularly equipment and facilities for child care, from the operation of this or any other tax. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will urgently consider such an amendment to reduce the cost of child care services for all families, by removing wholesale sales taxes and ensuring no other taxes are imposed on children's services. by Mr Gibson (from 455 citizens). Health Services and Facilities: Intellectually Disabled People To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: the Petition of the Residents of South Australia draws to the attention of the house that severely intellectually disabled people are in dire need of appropriate full-time care and accommodation currently not available in the community. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will call on the Minister of Health to remove any discrimination against intellectually disabled people by providing comparable services and facilities which are available to all other South Australians. by Mr Howe (from 59 citizens). Education: Commonwealth Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens call upon the Commonwealth to: Keep the Disadvantaged Schools Program - and Country Education project as Commonwealth Special Purpose Programs. Increase funding by at least the Consumer Price Index annually. Ensure that funding for schools be made available to schools, not diverted to pay Ministry employees. Ensure guidelines are followed and the State Committee permitted to meet. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Howe (from 56 citizens). East Timor To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: 1. The massacre of East Timorese citizens by members of the Indonesian military in Dili on 12 November in 1991 is only the latest, albeit most public, assault on the human rights of the East Timorese people since the Indonesian invasion and occupation of 1975. 2. The East Timorese people have not had the opportunity to decide for themselves the future course of their country. 3. Australian military equipment has been sent to Indonesia in clear contradiction of Australian government guidelines which prohibit exports to 'governments which seriously violate their citizen's rights'. Your petitioners therefore urge your Honourable House and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to: 1. Urge the United Nations Secretary General to send an independent international team to Indonesia and East Timor to investigate the massacre and on-going human rights abuses in East Timor and to establish a UN presence there to monitor the situation. 2. Support the promotion by the Australian government of United Nations sponsored talks on the future of East Timor. Such talks to involve Indonesia, Portugal and representatives of the East Timorese people, including the resistance and the Church, and to be without pre-conditions. 3. Stop all Australia military transfers, whether as aid or commercial sales, to Indonesia. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Howe (from 25 citizens). East Timor To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: 1. The massacre of East Timorese citizens by members of the Indonesian military in Dili on 12 November in 1991 is only the latest, albeit most public, assault on the human rights of the East Timorese people since the Indonesian invasion and occupation of 1975. 2. The East Timorese people have not had the opportunity to decide for themselves the future course of their country. Further evidence has recently emerged proving that Indonesia used tactics of intimidation and deception to orchestrate demonstrations of support for the Indonesian takeover in 1975. 3. Australian military equipment has been sent to Indonesia in clear contradiction of Australian Government guidelines which prohibit exports to ""governments which seriously violate their citizen's rights"". Your petitioners, assembled in Northcote, Victoria, on 6 April 1992, therefore urge your Honourable House and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to: 1. Support the promotion by the Australian Government, particularly during the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia later this month, of United Nations sponsored talks on the future of East Timor. Such talks should involve Indonesia, Portugal and representatives of the East Timorese people, including the resistance and the Church, and to be without preconditions. 2. Stop all Australian military transfers, whether as aid or commercial sales, to Indonesia. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Howe (from 15 citizens). Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, this petition from concerned parents and consumers respectfully requests that the Broadcasting Services Bill which will control Television and Pay Television, will: prohibit all considerably violent programs, prohibit indecent and obscene programs, (to protect the young and impressionable), prohibit blasphemous programs which denigrate religious faith or belief, establish strict, legally enforceable Standards for programs and hours, ensure that ""nothing is included that will offend against good taste or decency"", ensure that films are judged not as a whole, but each in its several parts, that the Bill underpins and supports pro-social media in spirit and intent, reject industry Codes that will sell-out Australia's defenceless children, exempt all classification criteria and hours from s149(d), ensure genuine consumer consultation, so that parents can have access to Program criteria information, and input into decision-making for their home environment. Because children are defenceless and helpless, because they have no vote, no power, and no advocate other than you. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Howe (from 17 citizens). SBS Television: Biased Reports To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House: That the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS Television) continues to air bias reports against the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and against members of these communities. That SBS continues to air Serbian programs but fails to give equal air time to programs from the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Your Petitioners therefore request the House to: Take appropriate action to investigate the bias and ensure that, as a publicly funded station, SBS treats all communities equally, fairly and without bias. by Mr Langmore (from 154 citizens). Traffic: James Cook University To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland draws. to the attention of the House the rapid increase and congestion of traffic to University Drive, Angus Smith Drive, Charles Barton Bridge and N-than Street due to the continued growth of the James Cook University, the continued development of the suburbs of Annandale and Douglas and the continuing traffic flow from the Army's Lavarack Barracks located on University Drive. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will urgently accelerate the roadworks program to: 1. Build a new traffic bridge across the Ross River upstream from the Charles Barton Bridge joining Angus Smith Drive and Ross River Road; 2. Extend Angus Smith Drive to the new bridge; 3. Widen the present two lane Charles Barton Bridge to link up with the wider roadway of Nathan Street. by Mr Lindsay (from 836 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Asia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation intends to transmit television programs into Asia. apart from an initial grant from the Government it is intended to finance this venture by the introduction of corporate sponsorship. the Government intends to alter existing broadcasting legislation to allow this to be done. this course of action would set a precedent which, in our view, would introduce pressures of corporate funding into the ABC and endanger the independence of our national broadcaster in its vital role as Australia's main disseminator of news and information at a time of unprecedented concentration of media ownership in this country. Your petitioners therefore ask the House either to ensure that the proposed Asian service be wholly funded by Government OR that the proposed Asian service not commence until Government funds are available. by Mr Mack (from 1,180 citizens). Refugees: Port Hedland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the undersigned citizens humbly and earnestly pray, that due to the uncertain situation existing in much of south East Asia including Cambodia and the need for a public review of Australia's procedures and criteria for granting asylum, it would be unjust and premature to repatriate those presently held in detention in Port Hedland and other places, who have been denied refugee status. We ask that they be given the alternate status ""Domestic Protection (Temporary) Entry Permit"" on humanitarian grounds. That those who are granted such a status be allowed to move freely about the Country, accept work and do skills training. Your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Mack (from 26 citizens). Pathology Collection Centre: Bellingen To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the residents of the Bellingen area draws to the attention of the House our strongest support for the maintaining of the Pathology Collection Centre in Bellingen. The Centre provides a needed service and its closure would disadvantage many patients who otherwise would need to travel a considerable distance for this service. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to grant the appropriate licence necessary to ensure that it can continue to provide its services. by Mr Nehl (from 558 citizens). Migraine Drug, Sumitriptal!__ To the Honourable the Speak-d Members of the House of Representativ-asSembled in Parliament: The petition o-the undersigned citizens of Ballarat draws/(o the attention of the House that hundreds of - migraine sufferers have been denied easy access to a new effective and safe migraine treatment known as Sumitriptan. This treatment, which has been approved by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, has been rejected for inclusion on the Phannaceutical Benefits Scheme. The tablets cost about $30 each and consequently will be out of reach for most sufferers resulting in migraine sufferers enduring unnecessary pain and inactivity. The drug is widely used overseas, approved in at least 23 countries and has an 80 per cent success rate. Your petitioners therefore request the House to take urgent steps to ensure that Sumitriptan is listed on the PBS. by Mr Ronaldson (from 425 citizens). Government Funding of Abortions To .the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia who are believers in the Lord Jesus Christ is made to draw to your attention that abortion as carried out in Australia and funded by of the Government is directly against God's own Word set out in the pages of the Holy Scriptures. (1) God is the Giver and Sustainer of life (Acts 17 v. 25, 28) and only He has the right to take life away (Job 1 v.21) (2) Everything the Creator does is perfect: life with all the potential required for nonnal development is present from conception (psalm 139 v. 13,14) (3) The killing of a living foetus is murder (Exodus 20 v. 13) by what ever names it may be excused. ""Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil"" (Isaiah 5 v. 20) (4) Your responsibility as representing God in government is ""for the punishment of evildoers"" (1 Peter 2 v. 14) (5) To allow evil to go unchecked is against the welfare of our nation (Proverbs 14 v. 34) and will lead to its rejection by God (Romans 1 v. 18-32) No government can afford to ignore moral issues. The God to whom Parliamentary prayer is ad. dressed is One who ""lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness"" (Psalm 45 v. 7). God will not overlook the legitimisation of sin. Can we afford to incur the wrath of God? (Romans 1 v. 18) Your petitioners therefore as duty - d pray and ask the Honourable Ho-at;1ISa matt.er of righteousness - genCf, Medicare funding of abortion be discontinued immediately. by Mr Scholes (from 225 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia showeth: The need for the Government to recognise that our Flag represents History, Heritage and Culture and should not be changed without a full referendum of the people. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives call upon the Government to retain our existing Australian Flag and to give Australians the opportunity to express that wish through a referendum. Your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Sharp (from 20 citizens). Eastern and Southern Africa 18 million people in eastern and southern Africa are at serious risk of starvation, and as many as 130 million in the region may be affected-the worse famine for 50 years. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House (1) increase Australian developmental aid to Africa as a matter. of urgent priority in the Australian overseas aid program, since Africa is the continent where poverty is increasing faster than anywhere else on earth; (2) move to have the Australian Government use its good offices with regard to internationar forums especially the World Bank, and the International Monetary Food, to ensure access to debt relief for African nations, who in fact .have already repaid their debts many times over; . (3) work to include in Australia's aid to African countries with similar climatic conditions to ours, advances made in dry-land farming techniques, a field in which AuStralia has special skills and experience. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Sinclair (from 744 citizens). Relief Care: Kingaroy To the Honourable The Speaker and· Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain carers and friends of carers for disabled, aged and frail people, resident of Kingaroy and District in the State of Queensland draws to attention of the House: The urgent need of Relief Care of all kind for carers Your Petitioners, therefore, Humbly Pray that the House of Representatives will serve the needs of the carers for disabled, aged and frail people by setting up a Relief Centre, which will provide all type of Relief Care needed by the Carers: Emergency Relief Care in case of sickness, surgery or unavailability of the Carer, . Short term Home Relief Care to give the Carer some time off for shopping, resting, etc. . . Short term Residential Relief Care in case of emergency or to give the Carer some time for Him/Herself or for the family, Other type of Relief Care or/and Support for the Carer and the family. by Mr Truss (from 243 citizens). Petitions received. NA Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee Report  a.m.)-On behalf-of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the Committee's report entitled Ships of shame: inquiry into ship safety, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.  Committee undertook this inquiry to identify the threat international ship operations pose to Australia's marine and coastal environment and how best to reduce the risks involved. However, the Committee encountered problems, on an international scale, which threaten the lives of seafarers as well as Australia's marine environment. This report is about a minority of ships: bad ships; ships that endanger the lives of those who serve in them; ships that are the source of major risk to the marine environment and marine facilities of the nations they visit; ships on which seafarers are abused and exploited by officers and management alike; ships that well deserve to be known as 'ships of shame', The Committee recognises that the majority of shipowners and operators are responsible. However, it takes only one substandard vessel to create damage on the scale of that caused by the Exxon Valdez or by the recent grounding of the tanker Aegean Sea off the Spanish coast. Australia must be spared from such damage. In the course of the inquiry, the Committee was told of the operation of unseaworthy ships; untrained, underpaid, sexually abused and .exploited crews; false ship and crew certificates; careless insurance practices; foreign governments not meeting their international maritime obligations. The Committee was astonished by the level of agreement within the shipping industry and its clients on the nature and details of ship safety problems. The existence of widespread agreement within the. industry indicates there was a level of tacit condonation of current substandard operating procedures. MarinerS, their organisations and missions to seamen were almost alone in speaking out against substandard ships and their substandard practices. On many occasions, witnesses told the Committee that they felt powerless to do anything to improve ship safety standards or halt the abuse of crews. Significantly, on most occasions commercial and employment considerations prevented action by individuals. The Committee believes that ship safety problems will persist until the beneficiaries substandard shipping practices are brought to account. These beneficiaries include governments which accept ship registration fees and pay lip service to the international maritime obligations; ship survey groups, or classification societies, who readily accept vessels already rejected by more reputable societies; classification societies that issue ship certificates which do not accord with a vessel's true condition; substandard ship owners, operators and managers; crewing and training agencies; and, lastly, charterers, importers and exporters. The Committee's recommendations cover both national and international issues. To achieve a tighter focus on the beneficiaries of the system, the Committee has made several recommendations to improve the availability of ship information to ship charterers. The establishment of easily accessible national and international ship information databanks by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the International Maritime Organisation will remove the cloak of commercial confidentiality which has restricted the availability information in the past. Additionally, the Committee has recommended that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority publish monthly reports of port state control inspecand tions of vessels which have been found to have defects. The Committee was also concerned that Australia adopt a tougher stance towards substandard ships which visit Australian ports. The Committee has accordingly recommended that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority be provided with sufficient funds to improve the level and effectiveness of port state control inspections. More frequent, consistent and stringent port state control inspections will raise the expectation of substandard ship operators that their ships will be detected and detained. The Committee welcomes the IS-nation Asia-Pacific regional port state control inspection system proposal which is being coordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. It is recommended that vessels should be required to provide proof of adequate protection and indemnity insurance of cover and compliance with International Labour Organisation Convention 147 on employment conditions before being permitted to enter Australian ports. The Committee has also recommended that the Australian Government strengthen representation and level of activity at the International Maritime Organisation. The end of this inquiry should see the beginning of a wider appreciation of the dangers and abuses of substandard shipping and a more concerted effort by the international shipping industry to end substandard shipping practices. To assist the international shipping industry to raise the profile of ship safety problems, the Committee will initiate action to bring together interested parties, on both a national and international level, to consider the report, its recommendations and associated matters. In conclusion, I thank my fellow Subcommittee members-the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr of Campbell) and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis)-for their interest and assistance during the inquiry and in the preparation of the Committee's report. I would like also to thank the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) for their valuable participation during the inquiry. My appreciation goes to all who made submissions to the Committee and responded to the Committee's numerous requests for information. I particularly thank those international organisations for their participation and support. Finally, I also thank officers of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the Department of Transport and Communications, Mr Christopher Paterson, Mr Les  the Committee, for their valuable assistance. I commend the report to the House.",10
3,Mr ANDERSON,COMMITTEES,"I am happy to join the honourable member for  report. As a member of his Subcommittee, I thank him for his leadership during that inquiry. I am sure I speak on behalf of all other members of the Subcommittee when I say that. The preface of Ships of shame sets out very clearly what the report is about. For the benefit of the House, I will read the first paragraph into the Hansard: This report is about a minority of ships, bad ships, ships that endanger the lives of those who serve on them. Ships that are the source of major risks to marine environment and marine facilities of the nations they visit. Ships on which seafarers are abused and exploited by officers and management alike. Ships that well deserve to be known as 'ships of shame'. It is important to remember that we are talking about a minority of ships. It does not excuse in any way at all the behaviour of some shipowners, but it would be a great shame to tar everyone with the same brush. It would undennine the credibility of this report if that were to happen, and that would be a great shame. The Committee took evidence from both ship operators and ship charterers, who made it plain that they maintain very high standards and that they see that their best interests lie in that practice. Evidence relating, for example, to oil tankers suggested that, despite the unfortunate Kirki incident-which, of course, was a catalyst for this inquiry-little threat can really be seen to be posed at this stage to our coastline environment or to the lives of crews by oil tankers as they are currently operating. Evidently the major oil companies are largely responsible for this. We heard evidence that suggested they go to considerable lengths to try to avoid the massive cost and extremely bad public relations outcomes of oil spillage disasters, so they are careful to check the ships that they charter. Liner shipping also essentially appears to set reasonable standards. The major problem seems to be in the area of the dry bulk carriers. They are the ships that take the hardest hammering and that deteriorate most in mechanical tenns as they age, as they are subjected to the massive stresses and strains of huge bulk loads. On page 28 of the report, under the heading 'Economic and commercial considerations', we refer to the world economic situation: Witnesses and submissions to the inquiry suggested that the current downtUrn in the world economy, while not being the cause of ship safety problems, is certainly sustaining conditions which enable those problems to persist. The current global economic downturn, in combination with excess tonnage and operation of substandard ships by irresponsible owners, has the forced some freight rates down to a level where ship operating costs are under considerable pressure. In response to commercial pressure, substandard ship owners/managers are accepting lower freight rates, leaving responsible owners/managers who are unable to operate at the lower freight rates with a declining market share. This is particularly evident in the bulk trades. The acceptance by charterers of the low freight rates available through the operation of substandard shipping exacerbates thiS situation. So these low financial returns, which unfortunately tend not to justify new shipbuilding, have resulted in an ageing of the world fleet. Luckily, that now looks to be stabilising and may well turn around in the next few years. The Committee heard evidence that in some instances cost pressures do not allow for routine maintenance to be carried out properly. Where maintenance is not carried out, it may be a case of the captain and the crew not being provided with the necessary resources, rather than poor on-board procedures. Just as commercial realities have helped to create these problems, ultimately they may do much to help right them. The Committee heard evidence which suggested that the ever higher cost of insurance for older ships in particular and, indeed, eventually the possible denial of insurance at all for totally substandard ships may well prove a vital and useful force for change. The human element is extremely important in this. I note the commendable concern shown by the Committee in general for the people who crew these ships and who are often subject to dreadful conditions. We heard some horror stories; there is no doubt about that. I, for one, find the heartless and even blatant racism of some owners and operators quite extraordinary. We should keep some balance. We should be careful that we do not go overboard in trying to set unrealistically high standards based on our expectations in this country. I say this because I believe there is a role for older, albeit well maintained, ships operated by smaller, more modest operators. It would give them a chance to break into the trade; it would give exporters in this country the chance to get in at a slightly lower rate than some of the bigger, more professional operators are able to offer. Australia should not attempt to impose unrealistic standards of crew pay and conditions on ships and ship crews visiting from abroad. Although we might regard the levels of pay and conditions applying to Third World crews as unacceptable, to the members of those crews they may represent the chance to find gainful employment and to escape a poverty trap. That chance would be denied them if we were to insist on the sorts of standards which we regard as totally acceptable in this country. We must do all we can to set higher standards where necessary, but we must also keep in mind the need to be realistic. Australia is a trading nation, dependent on trade for 25 per cent of its national income, compared to just 7 per cent for America. Australia is a trading nation which is in deep trouble, with plenty of poverty problems at home. We should not pretend that we can afford to push up costs by insistence on totally unrealistic practices. Finally, I note that an article in the Australian Financial Review of 15 December 1992 says that Australia should open up its coastal trade to more competition. It urges both the Government and the coalition to take this issue more seriously. Cabotage is, in my view, a separate issue. That is the only point I want to make on the question of cabotage, ship safety was the concern of this Committee of inquiry. I commend the report and its recommendations, I which in my view, if sensibly and honestly applied, will do much to right many wrongs.",17
4,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.  That the House take note of the report.,18
5,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report",18
6,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the Committee's report entitled A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights, together with evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
7,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMITTEES,"The tabling of this report is a significant event for the Australian Parliament. It is the first comprehensive report on human rights to the Parliament and, as such, recognises the growing importance and acceptance of human rights as a central issue in both domestic and international politics. There has been a good deal of rhetoric on this subject and, as always, there could be a danger of overkill. Human rights principles and their promotion are a measure of our civilisation. Human rights are central to the purposes of government. They provide a rule of law that is just and fair, rather than arbitrary or tisan, and one that substitutes for the raw and violent use of power institutions that will peacefully reconcile conflicts. The Human Rights Subcommittee was established in May 1991 as a permanent subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Its first reference, received in May 1991, was to inquire into and report on Australia's international efforts to promote and protect human rights. In November 1991, the first annual report on human rights was received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and this became the basis of the inquiry. The inquiry generated wide interest, and the Subcommittee has quickly become the focus of attention for many groups in Australia which are concerned, often because of ethnic ties, with the many human rights abuses in the world. While this was not intended to be the central work of the Subcommittee-and in many ways it is not equipped to deal with the volume of material that is provided to itit is probably an inevitable extension of its work which recognises an earnestly felt need in the community. The inquiry received 89 submissions. Public hearings were held in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, between December 1991 and June 1992. Central to the inquiry has been an examination of the ways in which Federal governments have incorporated human rights principles into policy and practice at an intergood national level, such as in foreign policy, defence cooperation and overseas aid. The Subcommittee looked at the international structures established by the United Nations to promote human rights. It examined Australia's relations with these organisations, and also our ratification of, and compliance with, international human rights treaties. The inquiry was told that Australia had failed in significant areas by placing reservations on a number of articles in import-t human rights covenants and conventions.' These articles related to the passing of legislation outlawing racial vilification, the separation of adults and juveniles in gaols, and those articles which allow individuals to make complaints to the various human rights committees. If we are to par- speak with any authority on human rights, these omissions should be rectified. The Subcommittee recommends that this be done without delay. The most critical and controversial question that arose in the inquiry was whether there should be a linkage between aid or trade and investment and the human rights records of recipient countries. Australia has taken the view so far that this issue should be decided on a case by case basis because the circumstances are complicated and the results of such linkages hard to govern. The Committee is very aware of the international trend, since the end of the Cold War, of increasing linkages between human rights and aid. However, many of the countries which are making the link do so from a position of strength and have been able to make a substantial impact. The Committee would support such linkages in principle and indeed, where international action can be achieved, Australia should support it. However, we are not a large power easily able to make an impact through the threat of or actual withdrawal of aid or the imposition of trade sanctions. Furthermore, it is not always straightforward to gain regional support for the human rights principles we wish to promote in a particular recipient country. It would seem imperative for us to seek to build regional consensus on what constitutes governance and to do this either informally, as at present through dialogue and representation, or more formally through a regional forum. The Committee recommends that the Government explore the possibility of establishing such a regional forum. In the meantime, the Committee supported the view of many submissions that the aid program could make a contribution to better observance of human rights through a proactive policy within the aid program. Many of the suggestions were innovative and practical. The first public hearing of the Human Rights Subcommittee was held on 2 December 1991 and considered the tragic situation of the massacre which had occurred in Dili on 12 November 1991. This hearing was an unusual one and was created by unusual circumstances. The intention was not to conduct a definitive inquiry into what happened in East Timor but to place factual information about the events of 12 November 1991 on the public record. Another eyewitness account was given to the Committee by Major-General Chamlong Srimaung, the leader of the pro-democracy forces in Thailand. He was arrested by the military government during the demonstrations in May 1992. He spoke to the Committee about those demonstrations and about the November 1991 shooting of civilians by the army. All other hearings were conducted in response to the very great volume of submissions received by the Committee. We were overwhelmed by the extent and range of the problems described to us. We simply did not have the resources in the secretariat, or the time, to deal with all of them. The Committee is very aware of the delicacy and sensitivity of the issue of human rights. We had to hold a number of hearings in camera because the evidence being given would have put people at risk. This brought home to honourable members that human rights is still a matter of life and death for many people around the world. I would like to thank the members of the Committee for all the time and effort spent on the inquiry. Also, the Committee members extend their appreciation to the staff of the secretariat-Denise Picker for her work in the organisation of public and private hearings, Margaret Brown for her assistance in the preparation of the report, and in particular Margaret Swieringa, the Secretary of the Subcommittee, whose work in compiling this report has been invaluable. I commend the report to the House.",18
8,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"As has been said already, the tabling of this report is a significant event for the Australian Parliament. Few topics generate as much interest as human rights and there are few issues of more sensitivity, especially between nations. One always has to step very carefully and be aware that what one may see as a genuine interest and a concern about human rights in various countries others, especially in the country concerned, might see as an interference in the domestic affairs of the particular country. No country likes to have its treatment of its people examined and likes it even less when it is criticised because of that treatment. The question of interference in the internal affairs of another country is always an interesting and a complex one. Increasingly, strict adherence to article 2(2) of the UN Charter is being put to the test. As racism is increasingly being seen as a crime against humanity, so also I believe are violations of human rights. Violations of human rights whenever they occur are a crime against humanity, and violations of human rights must be condemned wherever they occur. We cannot be selective in our condemnation of violations of human rights. A country must be judged in the international community by how it treats its minorities and its dissidents. I hope that this report entitled A review of Australia s efforts to promote and protect human rights is only the first of a yearly report within the system. The emphasis of the Subcommittee is on the record of the Australian Government and its activities to promote and to protect human rights. If Australia is to take it on itself to comment on the human rights records of others, it does its cause no good by not having its own house in order. Perhaps there should be a closer examination of Australia's ratification of, and compliance with, international human rights treaties. The inquiry' was told in no uncertain terms that Australia had failed in significant areas by placing reservations on a number of articles in important human rights conventions and covenants. The articles relate to the passing of legislation outlawing racial vilification, the separation of adults and juveniles in gaols, and those articles which allow individuals to make complaints to the various human rights committees. The failure to ratify these articles has detracted from our position on human rights. It reflects weakness in our record and may inhibit the full exercise of rights within Australia. If we are to speak with any authority on human rights, these omissions should be rectified. The Committee recommends that this be done without delay. Successive Australian governments have failed to ratify fully the human rights treaties to which we are party, often because of an extraordinarily slow process-in some - ases, taking 20. years-of consultation within the States. It is time this Federal Government exercised its power. We need to restore or enhance our international credibility and speak with single national voice on these human rights issues. The States are holding us back and the Committee. damaging Australia's credibility on human rights. It is time this Parliament exercised leadership on this issue and, where necessary, exercised its power to override the States. would perhaps be more realistic if the many people in Australia who are constantly demanago. ding action by Australia in various parts the world put some of their energy into that making sure that Australia ratified all convento tions on human rights. This was a very hard-working committee. I commend the Chairman, Senator Schacht, and the other Committee members on both sides of the House, and the staff: Denise Picker, Margaret Brown, and especially the secretary; Margaret Swieringa. We had a huge number of submissions and, as work spread, so did the volume of submissions we received increase. Often it was almost overwhelming when we saw the Defence number of submissions that were coming It does seem that the abuse of human rights in the world is a growth area, and it is a sad reflection that we have made so much progress in so many parts of the world, but that the one area where we have not made usage progress is in the protection of those basic democratic human· rights that we all so ferdetermine vently aspire to.",20

11,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Mfairs, Defence and Trade, I present the Committee's report entitled Stockholding and a sustainability in the Australian Defence Force, together with the evidence received by Ordered that the report be printed.",21
12,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"The inquiry into Australian Defence Force stockholding It policies had its genesis in concerns expressed by the Chief of the Defence Force four years The Committee shared the concerns of of the Chief of the Defence Force on matters are fundamental to Australia's capability defend itself. The Chief of the Defence Force referred to problem areas with readiness, particularly with respect to the capacity of our logistic system to support the operational elements at higher levels of readiness. He also referred to the question of stockholdings. The Committee therefore welcomed the timely reference to inquire into word of our stockholding policies. As the inquiry progressed, it became evident to the Committee that the Australian Force does not have a stockholding in. policy. The Committee had access to an abundance of evidence that showed that over very a 30-year period Defence has been unable to develop a stockholding policy that adequately addressed defence capabilities, activity levels, rates of war materiel and sustainability. Notwithstanding the inability of Defence to activity levels and usage rates, the Committee believes that stockholding and sustainability policies should be put in place without further delay. The lack of accurate activity level and usage rates for broadly defined contingencies should not prevent judgments being applied to these policies. The data can be refined and the policies amended as more accurate information becomes available. The Committee believes that the .Chief of the Defence Force, as the arbiter on judgments relating to military preparedness, should resolve any disputes on stockholding policy issues. Defence planning and activity is concentrated on preparing for low level and escalated low level contingencies. The Committee noted that there is disagreement within Defence on precisely what low level contingencies need to be. prepared for. Defence's preoccupation with preparations relating only to ill defined low level threats precludes any consideration of preparations for higher levels of threat. Indeed, the emergence of a higher level threat than that planned for would find the Australian Defence Force without the necessary capabilities or state of preparedness. The Committee strongly believes that Australian Defence Force preparedness must provide for the equipment and reserve stocks needed to meet the highest level of credible threat. Moreover, advantage should be taken of the present low level threat situation to prepare to meet higher levels of threat. The evidence presented to the inquiry on outfitting forces for United Nations commitments raised doubts about the adequacy of existing Australian Defence Force capabilities. It was clear to the Committee that the relatively small and short term United Nations commitments of recent years have impacted adversely on Australian Defence Force preparedness. The Committee believes that it is likely that Australia will be asked to increase the level of forces committed to United Nations activities-indeed, this belief has been borne out only this week. If Australian defence forces are to be increasingly involved in United Nations commitments, planning based on the levels of credible threat-along with resource constraints-will create a national security risk factor which the Committee believes is unacceptable. The Committee therefore recommends that separate provision be made for a range of United Nations commitments which would be acceptable to and agreed by the Government and that funding be provided as an extension of the Defence budget. Another issue of concern to the Committee relates to the procurement of significant items, such as missiles, from overseas suppliers. The Committee believes that the Australian Defence Force should not rely upon the ready availability of such items, either at short notice or even within a warning time for higher level threat. The Committee therefore recommends that, in regard to long lead time items, Defence examine alternative supply arrangements, such as new sources of supply, indigenous production and the maintenance of strategic reserves. The Committee believes that the implementation of this recommendation would also minimise the risks associllted with placing too much reliance on government-to-government agreements which provide no guarantees of availability. The Committee is concerned that the ADF priorities should be in competition with those of other users and, in a worse case situation, the provision of items may not be agreed by the supplier nation. I record my appreciation to my fellow subcommittee members and the Committee secretariat staff-Gillian Gould, Marina Ellis, Elizabeth Robertson and Margaret Brown.",21
13,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMITTEES,"I take pleasure in joining the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in commenting on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Stockholding and sustainability in the Australian Defence Force. In so doing, I would li)ce to read from the foreword by the honourable member for Herbert, because I think it encapsulates what we were talking about and what we were investigating in this inquiry. The foreword reads: Stockholding matters cannot of course bel considered in isolation. They have to be related to preparedness, which in tum has to be linked to the capabilities that, in accordance with strategic guidance, must be possessed by the Australian Defence Force. This inquiry therefore goes to the heart of Australia's capability to mount effective operations, not only within our direct area of strategic interest but also as part of our alliance responsibilities. It is particularly timely as Australia faces a more uncertain strategic environment following the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and the consequent effects in our region. I think that encapsulates the importance of this report. As a member of the Committee, at many times I found the material presented and the way in which it was presented baffling. One of the difficulties we encountered-and this is something which really needs to be addressed-was the reluctance on the part of some Defence personnel to be as open and as straightforward with the Committee as would make the Committee's task and its report so much better. I think there is a reluctance on the part of some Defence personnel to tie into the work of the Parliament's committees. The Parliament's committees are not going to go away. In my view, they are one of the most valuable aspects of membership of this Parliament. All members of the bureaucracy, whether they be in the defence forces or within the Commonwealth bureaucracy generally, need to appreciate that their appearances before committees of the Parliament are very important and that the evidence they give should be clear, straightforward and unequivocal. Unfortunately, there were some occasions when there was great difficulty in eliciting the sort of information we needed to get. Another section of the report reads: There is disagreement within Defence on what low level contingencies need to be prepared for. In a situation where specific threats are not evident, ADF preparations including capability criteria should provide for reserve stock and equipment needs to meet the most extreme credible threat scenario. The Committee endorses the concern expressed by CDF about the capacity of our logistics system to support the operational elements which are required at the higher states of readiness. The equipment problems evidenced in outfitting small forces for UN commitments add to that concern. The honourable member for Herbert has already referred. to that. Another paragraph reads: In the absence of knowledge on what low level contingency may arise, preparedness needs to address the higher end of the threat spectrum. The indications are that present ADF policies and resource levels will result in a core force of nated units equipped and maintained at the expense of lower readiness state units. United Nations commitments are making heavy demands on ADF resources, are highlighting deficiencies in current planning and resource levels and are impacting on ADF capacity to meet even low level contingencies. I and the other members of the Committee were very concerned about the absence of a coherent policy in this area. The evidence presented indicated that a whole lot more work needs to be done. I believe that the recommendations of the report will be very useful, both to the Government and the defence forces, in achieving those policies. There is one other matter I would like to draw to the attention of the House. Through evidence presented to the Committee on the United Nations commitments, the Committee's attention was drawn to the situation of Australian troops participating in United Nations operations in the western Sahara. The Australian contingent was dispatched to join the UN operation in September 1991, whereupon the weapons and the radios of the communicators were impounded by Moroccan authorities. In the view of the Committee, it is intolerable that the Government should allow members of the ADF to remain as part of the UN force without weapons for their personal protection. The Committee believes that, if there is an element of risk, the soldiers should be armed; if there is no element of risk, it would be more appropriate to send civilian technicians. Ifldeed, the Committee strongly believes that no unit of the Australian Defence Force should be committed to a United Nations operation without finn guarantees that equipment will remain with the unit. In the event of a situation such as that in Morocco occurring, the Australian contingent should be withdrawn. The Committee was extremely concerned about this particular aspect. In conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Committee and the staffGillian Gould, Marina Ellis, and all the others-who did such a tremendous job in assisting the Committee's work.

15,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"-'-On behalf of the Standing Coinmittee on Community Affairs, I present a report on the prescription and supply of drugs entitled Prescribed health: part 3-pharmacy and medicinal supply, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",24
16,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"This, the Committee's third report on its inquiry into the prescription and supply of drugs, marks the end of an extensive examination of the way pharmaceutical products are made available to Australian consumers. It completes a detailed review of the roles and responsibilities of all major professionals who play a role in ensuring the quality use of medicines. The Committee, in the course of its investigations, has collected over 1,700 pages of evidence at public hearings and 2,500 pages of written submissions. The Committee, in its three reports, has made 89 recommendations and has comprehensively dealt with all factors involved in the distribution and consumption of medicines at a national level. This is the first inquiry conducted by the Federal Parliament which has looked at the pharmaceutical environment in its entirety. Since the commencement of this inquiry there have been many developments influencing the prescription and supply of drugs in Australia. The conduct of the first part of the inquiry coincided with a major overhaul of the drug evaluation system and intense scrutiny of the regulatory framework governing access to drugs through. the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Committee's first report complemented and extended other inquiries which were specifically looking at the role of the pharmaceutical industry and the therapeutic goods administration. The second report, tabled in October this year, dealt with prescribing. It was brought down at a time when changes to the structure of general practice were being announced by the Government. The report attempted to take account of these changes and developments and to integrate these Report initiatives into a structure for improving the quality use of drugs. It focused strongly on the notion of the health team and stressed that doctors have a pivotal role in guiding the work of this health team and ensuring that medicinal products are used effectively. This third report, dealing specifically with the role of pharmacists in the health care team and the contribution they can make to improving medicinal use in the community, completes the Committee's inquiry. The report is being tabled at a time when the pharmacy profession is itself conducting a major examination of its present and future role. The Committee's report responds to the pharmacy professions concerns about its restrictive role, imposed through the PBS remuneration system. There is a need to· develop ways of demonstrating to government, other health professionals and the community that other services provided by pharmacists are of financial and general health benefit to the whole community. The report commences with a brief historical overview of drug dispensing and describes the changing nature of pharmacy and its different representative organisations. Any professional change in direction must be underscored and reinforced by professional training, at both the undergraduate and postgraduate continuing education levels. The Committee recommends' that a more comprehensive four-year undergraduate course be introduced to replace the existing three year course plus the preregistration training year. The Committee further recommends that some joint pharmacy-medical training occur to provide a degree of cpmmon experience between the professions. In examining the area of continuing education, the Committee recommends that pharmacists be required to undertake professional continuing education in order to be registered. This should assist in keeping the professional knowledge base of all pharmacists current. Such continuing education should be regulated through the Association of Pharmacy Registering Authorities, with courses developed by the Australian College of Pharmacy Practice. The report also examines in greater detail the role of hospital and community pharmacy and the necessity for close cooperation and joint management of patients moving between the two settings. Recommendations are also made to acknowledge the role of community doctors in the pharmacist-doctor relationship. As in the first two reports, the Committee has included a separate chapter dealing with consumer issues and makes specific reference to patient medication records and how they are to be used. The report concludes by looking at the future role of pharmacy, including proposed new role diversification in community pharmacy. Specific reference is made to consultant pharmacists, community liaison pharmacists and pharmacist involvement in drug reviews in nursing homes and hostels. The Committee makes observations about the lack of a national peak body to represent the interests of all pharmacists and recommends that a project be funded to determine the value of pharmacy services to the community and government. Finally, the report provides a brief statement to consolidate the whole inquiry and stresses the need for a more comprehensive examination of the overall cost of drug misuse. This would involve a major exercise to gather data on costs, benefits and effectiveness of drug therapy and would help to bring existing data together in a cohesive way and supplement much of the information which already exists. Government decision making would benefit as a result of this. In conclusion, I thank the secretariatBjarne Nordin, James Catchpole and secretarial support from Lynette Sebo-and I thank the members of the Committee for their diligence in this long inquiry, especially the, honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), the honourable member for Corinella(Mr Broadbent), the honourable member for . I Thursday, 17 December 1992 Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker).",24
17,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES,"I support the comments made by the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). This is the third and final report on the prescription and supply of drugs and deals mostly with the role of pharmacists in their supply of these drugs. It is clear that the role of pharmacists in the community is changing. Their original role was to dispense medicines, to create the medicines and to mix up the potions. That is no longer appropriate for chemists and pharmacists as this is now being done on a basic manufacture basis, and in many cases their role has· degenerated into that of typist to put the little label on bottles and hand them over the counter, along with the teddy bears and the shampoo and the toothpaste. There is a greater role for pharmacists, and that role is now emerging with the great increase of medicines that are available to the community, which is making it extremely difficult for doctors to keep up with and find out what is going on in the huge range of pharmaceuticals they are presented with. The pharmacists are in the best position to have a look at this, to understand what is available, to advise the physicians, and to check what the patients are taking. One of the other problems, as I mentioned in my last tabling speech, is that we have patients and clients who are taking medicines and who are simply . not sure what they are taking. There is multipharmacy going on and there needs to be some way of looking at this problem. One of the possibilities is that pharmacists be given access to computers, and it is through those computers that they will be checking up on what their clients are taking. As I mentioned last time, this has problems of its own with regard to privacy. There is concern in the pharmacy profession that their expertise is not being used and that there should be a much closer relationship between doctors and pharmacists. The pharmacists are in many cases the referral base for the doctor; people come to the pharmacy and it will be suggested by the pharmacist that they should go to their doctor. We need to intermingle these two roles so that the doctor sees the pharmacist as part of a health care team and can liaise with that pharmacist on the appropriate medicines, and the pharmacist, when she or he has any concerns, can liaise back to the doctor. Pharmacists are in a role where they can give advice to the people who come into their shops because they are in a basic shopfront situation. In this regard, the Committee has been concerned about the level of communications training for pharmacists. One of the strong recommendations of the report is that there be a specific emphasis on communications in the pharmacy course. This is now the case with the training of physicians, as recommended by us in an earlier report. All three reports have covered from the very beginning the whole gamut of what happens in the medicine field in the prescription and supply of drugs. We have highlighted some of the problems, and the end result is that it comes back to the pharmacist. It is the pharmacist who hands the final prescription across the counter, and there is going to have to be much more emphasis put on this role. The Committee is aware that the pharmacists are very eager to take on this role and to take over fully those sorts of responsibilities. Finally, I would like to commend the secretariat on the excellent job it has done. members have provided notes when people have not had them and have shown tremendous dedication in producing the three excellent reports. I also acknowledge the work of the Chairman, the honourable member for Scullin, in preparing these three reports. I commend the report to the House.",25

21,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,I seek leave to table a statement in relation to this report and then to make some remarks. Leave granted.,26
22,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"I thank the House and commend to those with a particular interest in electoral matters the statement just tabled. Time constraints in preparing a report on the preparations for the next election have meant that the Committee has not been in a position to go through the full range of issues in as much detail as it would wish under normal circumstances. The Committee has been mindful of the desirability, - though, of ensuring that a report be provided to the Parliament before the Christmas period, and has worked very assiduously in providing both the interim report, tabled a little while ago, and the report before honourable members today. Since the report was finalised by the Committee, the Government has provided a response to the Committee's report on the 1990 elections. The Committee has not been Its in a position to review that response. I have had a brief view of the Government's response and am pleased to note that many of the recommendations from the Committee in relation to the 1990 elections have been supported by the Government. There are a number of aspects of this current report to which I wish to. draw particular attention. I refer to paragraph 2.5.7 which deals with the provision of rolls. I do so because it.has not been addressed directly in a recommendation but is nonetheless an issue regarded by the members of the Committee as one of some importance. Paragraph 2.5.7 notes that the AEC suggested that the availability of floppy disks for electoral rolls would lessen the need for three hard copies to be provided to honourable members, as specified in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Committee does not support this view and believes that the existing entitlement of three hard copies should be maintained. I am sure all members of the Committee and all honourable members in this place would want me to reassert that position to ensure that current entitlement of a· minimum of three hard copies to each honourable member is maintained. Similarly, recommendation 10 of the Committee's report deals with the provision of divisional maps, a requirement under the Act at present. Regrettably, both at Commonwealth and State levels there has been a propensity of late to produce electoral maps that do not identify street names. Recommendation 10 deals with that matter and points out the need for divisional maps to identify streets clearly. Queuing was the major problem identified in the 1990 report that affected many people in Australia wishing to vote and was the subject of many complaints from members and senators. The Committee has noted the ABC's decision to change its staffmg formula. That should go some way to alleviating the problem, and certainly should rectify many of the difficulties encountered by voters·at the 1990 election. The ABC also proposes to adopt a variation in the queuing procedures. For my part, I am not convinced that the changed arrangements for queuing will actually reduce the time taken to vote, but certainly the changed formula will have that effect. The Committee also has noted the need for electoral staff to take heed·of the special needs particular people on election day, notably the aged, those with young children and those with other conditions that may require some particular consideration to be given to them. The Committee makes some commentS about the recent High Court decision and they are particularly important. Recommendation 4 recommends that the Minister seek an opinion as soon as possible on a number of issues. I particularly want to draw attention paragraph 3.1.17 where the Committee identifies the need to seek advice in relation to those people holding an office where expenses are offered and those where there is no remuneration at all. I think the High Court decision does place in jeopardy members and senators serving on a number of government and semi-government boards. That matter needs to be clarified. Recommendation 5 relates to the matter of uniform procedures being followed by the States and the Commonwealth on re-employment rights of public servants who stand as candidates in a Federal election. They are important issues which the Parliament needs to address in response to the High Court's decision, and the Committee has recommended that appropriate legal advice be sought. Finally, I want to thank the staff of the Committee, particularly Judy Middlebrook and Frances Coates, for their hard work in ensuring that in this torrid year we have been able to deliver three reports.",26
23,Mr MILES,COMMITTEES,"l rise to make a few comments on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, entitled Ready or not: refining the process/or election '93. In Australia we have a very high standard in running our elections, and that should be the case. Nevertheless, there are always improvements which can be made in the public administration of the country and particularly in the area of elections. I support the comments just made by the Chairman of the Committee and I want to mention a few matters in the report for the information of members and senators who may be listening. This report covers areas such as queuing which, as the Chairman indicated, caused of problems in certain parts of Australia. I think one of the reasons for that last time was that the Commission encouraged people to come out early. It was a nice day, people did come out early, and that caused problems at certain stages. In other places, including my electorate, there were no difficulties in that way at all and things ran very smoothly. There is also a recommendation in the report regarding dual polling places. They can cause conto fusion, and I suggest to honourable members who. are interested that they have a look at that recommendation. With regard to uniformity of re-employment of public servants in the different States, that is a matter of equity between people in different parts of Australia. The Committee recommends that people working in the public sector and wanting to stand for the Federal Parliament should be treated in a similar manner, no matter which State they live in. People who get this report also get a copy of the recent decision of the High Court in the case of Sykes v. Cleary. That decision is an important piece of information which many people in Australia may not easily be able to get otherwise, but in this report they have ready access to it. It is a very important decision which affects many people who may want to stand for the forthcoming Federal election. I think there is an obligation for people who may be standing for Parliament not just to read through that but also to read it fairly literally and to be careful as to exactly what they do in that regard. There is also a recommendation in this report that scrutineers be given full and reasonable access to the counting of the votes on election night. We all assume that will happen. Again I emphasise how important it is that that be allowed by electoral officers, whoever they might be and wherever they might be throughout the country. Often only a matter of a couple of minutes makes the difference between people feeling that they have had an opportunity to scrutineer what they want to see and feeling that they have not. I see very little reason for there being any difficulty in this area, but it is an area which there evidently has been difficulty in some polling booths. There have been officials who have not been as cooperative as they should have been. We are talking about . a very important process in the country. It is fundamental to the democratic process that the public have confidence that everything is fair and above board, and it is one of the roles of scrutineers to ensure that that is the case. As our interim report indicated, this report also provides for the provisional distribution of preferences on the night. That is a major step forward. I think it is going t9 give us a more accurate picture than we have ever had before in Australia, and I look forward to seeing how this works and whether it comes up with the goods on the night. Obviously, with close elections it will not always enable us to know what the government will be, but I believe the information we will receive on the night will be the best Australia has ever received. The responsibility is with the AEC to ens.ure the smooth operation of polling and of the total election procedures on the day. I am sure that that will be possible as from the next election, and I look forward to everything running smoothly on the day. Lastly, I too would like to thank Judy Middlebrook and Frances Coates for their assistance in helping prepare the report, and also the AEC officers for their assistance.",27

Ordered that the report be printed.",28
27,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMITTEES,"This unanimous report on the law enforcement access network, which is more generally known as LEAN, is the first report of the Committee into fraud on the Commonwealth, which matter was referred to the Committee on 30 March this year by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). The report addresses No. 9 of the terms of reference of the inquiry and looks at information exchange and fraud control and the privacy implications of such exchange. It focuses on an examination of the LEAN system, which provides a useful example of how some of those issues arise in practice. The Committee decided to report first on these matters so that concerns on LEAN could be taken into account when decisions are made on the implementation of the system. LEAN will provide a computer facility to give government agencies with law enforcement and revenue protection responsibilities access to several databases containing company records publicly available Australia-wide and land ownership data for law enforcement and protection of revenue purposes. The project is being developed and implemented by the Federal Justice Office of the Attorney General's Department to assist in preventing and detecting fraud. Primarily, LEAN will be a facility for accessing and searching the database on the system in one-off searches. However, the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Defence propose to use the facility for data matching purposes. The Department of Social Security, while not seeking access to the LEAN system on line, proposes to use it as a source of land data which will be copied onto the DSS computers and matched against DSS client records. The cost to the Attorney-General's Department of implementing the project will be about $29m over three years, plus about $90,000 to each agency linking into the system. In October 1991, the Attorney-General announced that the Commonwealth would be proceeding with the LEAN project as one means of protecting the community from those who break the law and attempt to rip off the taxpayers through welfare cheating, tax evasion and other fraudulent means. While the Committee supports the Commonwealth's objective and acknowledges the complexities of the task of implementing the LEAN facilities, the results of the Committee's work have revealed some major shortcomings in the way in which the project is being developed. Firstly, the cost-b-nefit ratio for the project is about 1:2 over a period of some five years. This is not substantial in monetary terms where the benefits derive lai:gely from the Australian Tax Office's data matching activities. Secondly, negotiations with the State and Territory governments on the provision of the basic land ownership records for the system have not been finalised. No contracts have been signed. Since companies data is already available publicly on line there would seem little point in proceeding with the development of the system if most of the States and Territories do not agree to provide the land data. Thirdly, privacy issues have been a major concern surrounding the project and a number of key issues such as the rights of the public to know what data is held about themselves, avenues for amending errors to that data, the application of principles of the Commonwealth Privacy Act and data matching arrangements remain unresolved. Fourthly, while the Attorney-General's Department has been successful in keeping the system participants informed on the project, there has been no direct avenue for public input into the system. The efforts to which the Committee had to go on several occasions to get basic information about LEAN have heightened its concern that the LEAN facility is not· being developed as openly as it ought to be. Fifthly, the basic document guiding the operation of the system-the memorandum of understanding-remains incomplete, with administrative arrangements unresolved. Sixthly, the project is now six months behind schedule and is not expected to be operational until mid-1993. Finally, the recent decision by the Attorney-General's Department to cancel the contract of its prime contractor for the Department's legal office information system has added to the Committee's concerns. This raises questions about the Department's general capacity to manage information techn-logy projects. In view of the decision that the LEAN facility should go ahead, the Committee has made some major recommendations on the way in which the project should be managed in the future. The key recommendations are that legislation be put in place within the next two years to govern the operation of the system and that the Attorney-General's Department should adopt a more open and public approach in developing and operating the LEAN facility. The Committee regards these matters very seriously and considers that the Attorney General's Department should take immediate steps to address the matters of concern raised in the report. The Committee notes that the preferred tenderer for the project was announced by the Attorney-General's Department last week. The Committee would have expected, however, that these issues should be raised and resolved before a contract was let for this work. The Committee is continuing its work on the fraud inquiry and has sought further updates on the memorandum of understanding. It will include other remarks in its final report on the fraud inquiry in 1993. (TIme expired) Motion (by Mr Elliott) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",28

Ordered that the report be printed.",30
30,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"Almost 70 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in cities or towns, yet many perceive urban Aboriginals not to be real Aboriginals. Such inaccurate and negative attitudes disadAboriginal vantage these people and subject strong assimilatory expectations. The denial of their Aboriginality does not countenance the continuous change that occurs within the culture of various societies, particularly through periods of great social upheaval, as experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people during the last 200 years. The Committee believes that there is a need to raise public awareness of contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander society and culture. The indigenous people also have a strong desire for renewal and self determination. Urban indigenous people seek recognition of their existence, their past and their aspirations, both for themselves and for their children. Urban indigenous people seek a recognition of their Aboriginality, that is to say, their separate identity, which has been shaped by the last 200 years as much as by the thousands of years before that. Most wish to take their place in Australia as equals, not as second-class citizens who must deny their identity in order to assimilate into the broader society. A major focus of the inquiry into the needs urban dwelling indigenous people was the delivery of services. Many mainstream services are avoided by urban Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders because of cultural inappropriateness or insensitivity. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living outside major cities frequently lack equitable access to local government services. Despite Report marked improvements in some council areas, other councils have been slow to end discriminatory practices, resulting in Aboriginal people lacking the basic services are taken for granted by the rest of the Improving the relationship between Aboriginal people and local government was of a key focus of the inquiry. Recommendations have been made to raise Aboriginal awareness of, and participation in, local government. Improvements to local government include the appointment of Aboriginal liaison officers, the formation of liaison committees, and the establishment of networks to support and Torres Strait Islander counselthem to lors and liaison officers. The Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has recommended the setting up of a task force to determine sound rating practices concerning Aboriginal community land. Greater participation and representation in local government matters is essential. Given the deep-rooted nature of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander educational disadvantage, change in education must be a slow process. While substantial improvements have been made in recent years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are still disadvantaged in comparison with the wider community. There has been a comparative neglect of early childhood education, and the Committee has recommended measures to overcome this. There are still far too few indigenous teachers housing. in classrooms. The Committee recommends that a special scheme be introduced to increase the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander early childhood teachers and school teachers. While the introduction of optional Aboriginal study courses in schools has made some progress, the Committee recommends that such courses be made mandatory in schools and in all teacher training courses. Strategies to combat Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment disadvantages have had limited success. Statistical targets are being met in the Australian Public Service, but less progress has been made in State and Territory public services. The least satisfactory areas of progress are in local government and the private sector. The Committee has recommended realistic targets for local governments. The Committee considers that the problem of Aboriginal employment in the private sector is so intractable at present that an affirmative action program is necessary to require all firms employing over 100 employees to report on steps being taken to promote the employment of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Where the community development employment project scheme has been extended to major urban areas, the organisation of the scheme should be based on projects rather than on the community. Training should be specifically related to the labour market. Lack of housing, overcrowding and the poor standard of housing were problems raised as major issues at virtually every place the Committee visited. The availability and adequacy of housing is a central determinant of the overall living standards, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people still being significantly disadvantaged. Despite a $1.3 billion expenditure on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing since 1968, disproportionately large numbers of indigenous people are homeless or in rented accommodation, and only 25 per cent of families own or are buying their houses. We have made substantial recommendations in relation to improving the provision of Cultural identity and awareness of indigenous people is a key to re-establishing their pride and dignity and their capacity to participate in society as equals with nonAboriginals. The Committee recommends funding for the establishment of cultural centres in urban areas.

31,Mr RIGGALL,COMMITTEES,"MCMillan) (10.45a.m.)The coalition members of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs are very pleased with the manner in which the report Mainly urban: report of the inquiry into the needs of urban dwelling Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has been handled, with one minor upset about a minority report which I will deal with at a later date. I also put on record our thanks to the Chairman, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who chaired the meetings. very well. What started off as somewhat difficult and controversial subjects ended up gaining general support. I also thank the. staff for the extremely long and hard hours that they put in and for the very comprehensive report that was tabled-which, perhaps, was overshadowed to a small degree by the report on deaths in custody. However, I believe this report makes a very significant contribution. The Committee is determined to see that all the barriers to improving the quality of life of urban Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are removed. For too long, indigenous Australians have lagged behind other Australians. Very few people would have understood that perhaps 70 per cent of the Aboriginal population is urban orientated. That is a figure that I think most Australians would find amazing. Also, the majority of the 99 Aboriginals who died in custody lived in urban communities. Twenty-four were from major urban communities and 35 were from minor urban communiti-. Perhaps this figure alone would stress· the pressures that are on the Aboriginal people living in our major towns and cities. It is also important to point out that the community is not homogenous. The needs of Aboriginals in Amhem Land are not the same as the needs of those in Redfern, Fitzroy, Moree or Port Hedland. Aboriginals living more or less traditional lifestyles in remote areas do not face the stresses of the modern Aboriginal community which is living in the urban environment. There is some evidence of a fairly strong shift to living in those areas from the communIty. I think that that trend will continue in years to come. It is very gratifying to see that the educational situation for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders is improving and that so many Aboriginals have taken on university study for a degree. Along with the Chamnan, I fully support the recommendation for training with schools. I believe there should be some system whereby people taken from a community are actually pledged to go back to that community and into community schools for a number of years. Some of the programs of education are twofold. The LINK program and others which have been incorporated by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), I believe, will have a great impact on the Australian comm-ty in general so that we can bring some dignity to these people. I turn briefly to the minority report. It pity that we had to have a dissenting report, but it was important that the point of view be put forward. One is very sympathetic to the point of view that Aboriginal people have not, by and large, been employed in the private sector. I have made the statement that I have never been sold an ice-cream by or bought a pair of shoes from an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. I think this is indicative of their serious under-representation in the private sector. Bringing in a recommendation along the lines of affIrmative action is, quite frankly, impractical. To impose legal requirements with onerous reporting duties on firms employing over 100 employees is simply unworkable. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander",31

34,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I present the report of the Committee entitled Report on the Close Corporations Act 1989. Ordered that the report be printed. .",32
35,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"This report examines the Close Corporations Act 1989 and the general question of the appropriate form of incorporation for small business in Australia. The Close Corporations Act proposed to·introduce a new form of incorporation for private businesses with simple operating structure. In recognition of its essentially private nature and simple structure, the close corporation would be simpler to establish and operate than a business incorporated under the Corporations Law. For example, it would not be is a required to lodge annual accounts with the Australian Securities Commission. Evidence received by the Committee, while supporting the general objective of providing a simplified form of incorporation for small business, gave only limited support to the close corporation. Criticisms of the proposal included: that the restriction on its powers would render it unsuitable for small business; that limited liability could be lost relatively easily; that the structure and reporting requirements of the close corporation remain complex; and that there is no simple process for converting a close corporation into a proprietary company. The Committee acknowledges the force of the criticisms of the close corporation. Thus the Committee favours the introduction of a new corporate form, the private company, through a new chapter in the Corporations Law. It would adopt the best features of the proposed close corporation whilst eliminating those which were the subject of extensive criticism. There was general agreement on the desirable features of a form of incorporation on small business: establishment should be simple and cheap; reporting obligations should be kept to a minimum; the internal administration should be uncomplicated and a simple process for dispute resolution between members should be available; the corporate form should offer the normal benefits of incorporation and be readily understood, both by its owners and third parties; transition to a more complex corporate structure should be simple, to accommodate the growth of the business; and the structure should be tax effective. Much of the evidence favoured reform and simplification of the - xisting exempt propdetary company, adopting some of the aspects of the close corporation. The Committee believes that there is a place for both a simple corporate form for small business and the retention, for the time being, of the existing exempt proprietary company for more complex corporate structures. The availability of the exempt proprietary company should be reviewed after a suitable time has elapsed to assess the use being made of the two forms. The proposed private company would be limited to a maximum of 10 members, and it is proposed that it not be able to act as a or a holding company or to raise funds from the public. The members of a private company would attract limited liability in the same form as any other incorporated body; reporting requirements would be further reduced; provision would be made for the investor who did not wish to be involved in management; and transition between the various corporate forms would be a simple process. I conclude with an important dissenting report on one point, which is my dissenting report. The one point of difference which I have with the other members of the Committee is that, in order to facilitate the simple transition between the proprietary form of company and the new private company, the Committee has proposed that the 'proposal in the original close corporation that would allow a sole trader to incorporate be changed so that there will be a minimum number of two participants in any private company. I think that this excludes the advantage of incorporation to many sole traders. It undercuts the benefit of the private company vehicle very substantially, and it will force traders either to forgo the advantages of such incorporation or to resort to artifice in order to find some other person to be involved in the business, simply for the purpose of gaining this corporate protection. For those reasons I have tabled a short dissenting report on that point. I move: That the House take note of the report.",32

37,Mr SCHOLES,RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. trust The purpose of this Bill is to prevent what most people consider was a fiasco in the change to the design of the Australian $5 note some time ago by introducing a broader decision making process for such changes than has taken place in the past. The type and design of notes issued have traditionally been relatively conservative. However, in recent times, there has been some experimentation with new types of notes which, in theory at least, have a far greater durability-although one would suggest that the durability is not as great as was first thought, because of the number of them that have been defaced. The Bill does not in any way reflect on the fact that the monarch has been put on the $5 note. Rather, it reflects on the lack of judgment and historical perspective of the Reserve Bank board, which is elected for its judgment in financial matters and not for its judgment on art and design. This lack of judgment caused the problems at the time of the introduction of the $5 note. The Bill changes the present arrangements only to the extent that a design is required to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament and that that design be subject to disallowance by the Parliament if the Parliament considers that it is not appropriate. The major reason for the change to the $5 note was not to design a new note but to remove the picture of Caroline Chisholm from it. It was found that there were no mechanisms whatsoever for any input into the design of the new note other than from members of the Reserve Bank board. I find that quite extraordinary. The currency is one of the major symbols of the nation. This Bill has nothing to do with the monarch, and it has nothing to do with whether the design of the current $5 note is good or bad. I think fairly broad consensus is that most people dislike the note. They are very concerned about the design-they think the note is terrible. We are concerned with the design. At the time that the decision was made to put the Queen on the $5 note-her picture had been on the $1 note and the $2 note that were discontinued-there were some 10 or 12 notes in circulation. All of those notes, except for the $5 bill, had depicted on them males who had had a part in Australia's history. There were 11 males and only one female. The Reserve Bank, in what must be classed as an extraordinary error of judgment, decided to replace all of the notes but decided to replace first the only note which bore the depiction of a female. The other notes are, to my knowledge, still in circulation and will be for some time. This Bill would give the Parliament the opportunity, if it so desired, to advise the Reserve Bank-by rejecting a design-that it wanted the bank to submit a design that was considered to be more appropriate for the Australian currency. Other methods of oversight could be used but I think that the Parliament is the appropriate place for such oversight. If the Parliament found a note objectionable it could reject it. Small groups of people disagree with the symbols of the nation as they are presented from time to time, but it is unusual in the extreme for a majority in a House of Parliament to object unless there is a good reaSon. I find it quite extraordinary that Caroline Chisholm's picture was removed from the note, prior to a complete changeover. She was one of a large number of females in our society who have contributed, or are still contributing, to the development of this nation. There would seem to me to be a good reason to rotate the people featured on the banknote from time to time because there is an almost unlimited supply of these people. I would like to go back to something I raised here about four years ago. When we give jobs to organisations which are not necessarily in communication with the general the public, too often the decisions are narrowly made. I was absolutely horrified on Australia Day 1988 when the Order of Australia list came out. This list is devised from a fairly narrow list of people drawn up specifically for that purpose. The list did not. make any attempt to recognise the fact that it was the 200th anniversary of Australia and it made no attempt to put forward the most prominent Australians of our history or our generation. In fact, the list was stacked with High Court judges. Australia Day, 26 January 1988, will not go down in history or live forever in my mind as a day on which we honoured the people who made this country great by including them in the Australian award system; we were too busy giving gongs to High Court judges. In this case, I think the Reserve Bank has made a decision based on the tradition that the lowest denomination note bears the face of the monarch, irrespective of who the monarch is, male or female. To that extent, I do not see any problem with its judgment. Its judgment was, however, that it should start a process of replacing banknotes by replacing the .lowest denomination banknote, thus removing the oDly female face on a banknote and leaving 11 males to be replaced at some later date. On that occasion, this Parliament or the Australian community had had a say, they would have said that Caroline Chisholm·or another female who had contributed to Australia's history, to Australia's development and to what Australia is should have been honoured by being placed on an Australian note. Had the Reserve Bank wished, it could have been done quite easily by replacing one of the other notes at the same time as the $5 note. It was not done, and this was because of a lack of sensitivity and because it is quite possible that the problem which arose, the disagreement with the decision, was not anticipated before it became apparent that there was a significant disagreement. The Bill does not reverse the decision that has been taken. It does not in any way endeavour to change the traditional style .or shape of our currency, or the right of the Reserve Bank to make recommendations on how our currency should look or from what material it should be made. I think the public would like to have a say on these issues sometimes. The Bill provides for the Parliament to have an oversight role in a way that would enable any perceived incorrect or bad design to be reviewed and, if necessary, overturned by the Parliament itself-by resolution of the Parliament, which is not an easy process. I commend the Bill to the House.",33
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT BILL,Is the motion seconded?,35
39,Mrs SULLIVAN,RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT BILL," I second the motion for the second reading of the private member's Bill introduced by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), the Reserve Bank Amendment Bill. To my knowledge, the removal of Caroline Chisholm from the $5 note has been brought before this House on only one previous occasion, which was the dying stages of the last session of this Parliament. On Thursday, 25 June 1992 I moved, by leave, the following motion: That this House: (1) expresses its concern at the decision of the Reserve Bank Board to remove the image of Caroline Chisholm from the design of the proposed I believe that, if new $5 note; and (2) recommends that this decision be rescinded. The present Minister for Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh), seconded the motion and it was resolved in the affirmative. It was a pity that we were not able to have a debate on it at that stage, but we were under very heavy pressure of time to complete the session's business that night, and it was only fairly generous arrangements on the part of both Government and Opposition that got it on the record at all. There was a move to do the same thing in the Senate, and it was not for lack of sympathy that it did not get on the Notice Paper. The Senate Notice Paper was a lot more difficult to break into at that stage of the Parliament than ours. There was a feeling that something had to be said to put on the record concern about the decision of the Reserve Bank board. I have subsequently received a letter from, I think, the Chairman of the board and other material such as copies of press releases that the board had put out. It was far too late to influence the matter at that stage. The note was about to be issued and it could not be reversed. That in itself is symbolic of the need for the type of action that the honourable member for Corio is proposing through this private member's Bill. Since then I have had quite a few people ask me who Caroline Chisholm was and what she did that was so important. I have a hunch that that was probably what all the members of the Reserve Bank board were saying to one another when they addressed the subject of the new $5 note. If they had taken any trouble at all to find out about Caroline Chisholm, I feel confident that they could not possibly have removed her from our note. Of all the people who were responsible for establishing modem day Australia, Caroline Chisholm as an individual stands head and shoulders above everybody else. She was an extraordinary woman, apparently possessed of enormous zeal, philanthropic spirit and vision, who moved people at all levels-the Governor of the colony and very powerful and influential people in London-specifically on the subject of free immigration. Those of us who did study a little Australian history in the days when one used to learn about these things at school will be aware that the history of the establishment of modem day Australia was very much bound up with the attempts to establish a settlement of free people. People had the vision that this was not to be just a gaol but a land of opportunity where people from Europe and, specifically, I suppose, Britain, who lived in miserable and appalling conditions, had the chance of a decent life. That really was the beginning of the story of modem Australia. Caroline Chisholm married a man in the British Army who was posted to India. He took leave and they came to Australia, after being married a short length of time. When she arrived in Sydney she was appalled at the number of homeless people she saw roaming the streets. People were coming here as immigrants, with literally nowhere to live and no way of finding employment. She had two particular concerns. One was protection of the young women who were involved and the other was the establishment and protection of family in Australia. She recognised that if this was to become a stable colony families had to live here. It had to be a good place for women and children. It could not just be for men, be they convicts or people who were knocking over gum trees to plough a little land and plant some wheat. She did not help only female immigrants. By persuading the Governor to give her disused barracks, she set up a home where up to 96 people at a time lived and had a roof over their heads. She tirelessly toured the countryside on horseback, visiting people who could give employment to people who would work on farms. She established overnight rest stations for people on their journeys, and was so successful that in a few years that home in Sydney could be closed down. There was no more need for it; she had established Ii way of getting people to flow into the colony through Sydney and straight into employment. So pleased were employers to welcome the people whom Caroline Chisholm introduced to them that there was no need for a holding centre in Sydney; the people were flowing out. She worked very hard in England as well, and she worked for one very worthy cause. We have all learnt about convicts coming here and becoming ticket-of-leave men, but they could never, of course, go home, and many of those men had families in Britain. Caroline Chisholm was instrumental in arranging a system whereby those men's wives and children could join them in Australia and they could re-establish a stable family life as those men tried to get on with life in a new world which may not have been of their choosing. I mention that Caroline was also the mother of six children. She was doing all these extraordinary things, very fully supported by her husband, as well as being the mother of four sons and two daughters. She did it entirely in a philanthropic spirit. There was nothing in it for Caroline Chisholm or her husband, who in due course retired altogether from the army and worked full time helping her. This is the story of an extraordinary human being and Australia has a lot to thank her for. If the Reserve Bank board had even looked at the less than a page on Caroline Chisholm that appears in the Australian Encyclopaedia, and the slightly more potted biography that the Library has supplied me with from the Australian Dictionary of Biography, I cannot believe that it would have taken her off the note. It is no difficulty for me if the Queen is not on the $5 note. I state here that I am a monarchist-I am not a republican-simply because I think the system works pretty well for us, mainly because it is over in England; I will say no more about that. The Queen is, after all, on all of our coins, of which we have far too many. I hope one of the spin-offs of this new technology-we are told we are going to have these notes that will last for ever-is that the $1 and $2 notes might be brought back. Frankly, I think our currency is in a mess in that sense. There has never been a suggestion that the Queen's head would be removed from all our coins, whatever those coins may be, and I think that is right and proper. The abolition of the $1 note did not distress me for that reason; it distressed me for other reasons. I do not think there was a need to reintroduce the Queen's head on any note. For those who are interested in the subject, Australian currency is very highly regarded throughout the world. We are considered have well-designed currency, particularly notes. For example, I know that people with sight disabilities in the United States wish they had our note system, because in that country all notes are the same size and colour. In Australia our notes have always been history-as different sizes. People whose sight is poor, or hers. who have no sight, can still handle our currency because they can tell the different notes by size. These things-the quality of the design and colour-mean that our currency is highly regarded. The symbols chosen to put on a nation's currency are important, they are not incidenfeminist tal. In a sense, they follow the decision about the symbols a country puts on its flag; it saying something by the people it chooses to put on its currency. It is not good enough the Reserve Bank to say, 'Ab, but we have put Dame Nellie Melba on the $100'. That is nice, I am glad it has put Dame Nellie Melba on the $100 note. That is very right and in fitting. However, if I had to choose between Melba and Chish-lm, in my view it would no contest. It would be Chisholm. I am advocating that Melba be taken off the note but, by any stretch, Caroline Chisholm is a nors. woman who, as I have said before, stands head and shoulders above her contemporaries of the time and she should be well honoured always in Australian history.",35
40,Ms CRAWFORD,RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support this private member's Bill. take note of what the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has been saying. We have to ask ourselves what the governors of the Reserve Bank were thinking about. They obviously have very little understanding of Australian history and Caroline Chisholm's role in it, which has been outlined so fully. We even have a college in Comubia named after Caroline Chisholm and I know that there are quite a large number of colleges and schools throughout Australia named after her because of the kind of woman she was. It seems to me that the Reserve Bank gpvemors show the kind of total disregard for women and women's place in our society that has been accepted by the community for too long. It may be enlightening for many people to to know, particularly here in Canberra, that the Walter Burley Griffin's work was done largely by his fiancee, who happened to be an that architect. It was she who did almost all the work, rather than him, but, given the nature of the times, he is the person whose name in 'his story' - records rather than When we visit many of our museums and galleries and so on, we find that women's place has very often not been defined within Australian society. I am reminded of a recently published book by one of our leading writers, Dr Dale Spender, called Lifelines, which is a collection of letters of is Australian women throughout early Australian times. Their contribution to the life of this for country, and particularly to its pioneering days, is enormous. They endured heartache, isolation and sorrow in giving birth on their own and in various other aspects of life alone the bush. It is those kinds of values, it is that kind of fortitude and strength, the be .. creation of family life, which Caroline not Chisholm has been so noted for and which was disregarded by the Reserve Bank goverIt is also pertinent for us as a House to note that in the history of the church these are momentous times. In Goulbum this weekend we will see the ordination of the first Anglican women priests and in Brisbane we I will see on Sunday night the ordination of that city's first Anglican women priests. So when the rest of society is changing, and even some of the churches are changing and seeing women's roles in a different way, we have to ask ourselves what on earth these governors are doing. I attended a momentous historic occasion in relation to the role of women with the ordination and affirmation of Jan Chalmers from Coopers Plains, the first Uniting Church deacon in our area in Brisbane. It is interesting to note that she has been doing that work for 15 years but has only ever had the title of deaconess. The Uniting Church has now seen fit to recognise her in that new role, which shows a ministry of the word and a ministry of community which very many church women have carried out for such a long time. Caroline Chisholm is regarded highly within her own church, the Catholic Church in Australia, and in fact has been put up as a candidate for sainthood. So it is not unfitting for us to look at the kinds of roles played by women in our churches, in our community and in society generally. We would expect to see them as part of the social symbols of modern Australia on our own notes, because all of us are part of the Australian community. It may be worth reminding people that over 50 per cent of our population is now female and, more importantly for members of this House, close to 56 per cent of voters are women-because we live longer. Perhaps honourable members would like to think about that. It gives me great pleasure to support this Bill and to bring to the attention of the community and of the governors of the Reserv- Bank the enormous support for Caroline which our community shares.

41,Mr BROADBENT,RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT BILL,"I follow the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) with some pleasure. I want to talk about the spirit of Caroline Chisholm. Caroline Chisholm was in the forefront of issues that are still before us every day today. She was an advocate of Aborigines. She was a defender of the rights of Chinese immigrants. All these years later, Australia is still coming to grips with those very issues. I am sure we address them almost on a daily basis in this House and, if not in this House as part of the debate, then certainly we address· them around the corridors and in the parliamentary committees. Caroline Chisholm was worthy of recognition on our $5 note when it was made of paper and not plastic. Some $IOm goes into the exercise of changing a note. Here we are debating what would have been seen by the governors of the Reserve Bank, I am sure, as a very simple change that would not be noticed by many members of the Australian community. As the honourable member for Forde mentioned, 56 per cent of Australian voters are women, and there should have been some emphasis on the fact that this woman was already on the note. Sometimes conventions such as the Queen being on the note of the lowest denomination do not have to be followed. Perhaps we should have been saying that this is a convention that exists on the $5 note. It is important that we recognise the spirit of Caroline Chisholm. That spirit survives today in every electorate. In every electorate in Australia we have women with the spirit of Caroline Chisholm who take up issues that not everybody in the community takes up. I will not name names, but in the Wonthaggi area in my electorate there is a group of women that has taken on the issue of youth and drugs. With no personal benefit to themselves, with no government funding, they have formed a committee. . Those women confronted the local editor of the Sentinel-1imes and said, 'We are going to draw to the attention of our community this issue of drugs-be it cigarettes, alcohol or the harder forms of drugs. We are going to educate our children and their parents and the community as a whole about how to deal with this difficult issue' . That is the spirit of Caroline Chisholm working at grassroots level. They are the people at the forefront of changing Australia and changing it to the sort of society that we want to have. These debates are a great learning experience. I must say that, if I had been asked a couple of years ago, or even last week, who the woman on the $5 note was, I could not have said that it was Caroline Chisholm. I think I would reflect the Australian community in that. The $5 note was worth a lot more, by the way, before this Government was elected. However, I do not want to politicise this debate any more than it should be. I do not think the Reserve Bank governors deserve the belting they have received today on this issue. I believe they would also reflect the Australian community and how it would have viewedMrs Sullivan-They do not have any excuse.",38
42,Mr BROADBENT,RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT BILL,"We will not go into who is to blame. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said he would rather have Caroline Chisholm on the note. Honourable members from both sides of the House have said that they would rather have Caroline Chisholm on it. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) says he would rather have Caroline Chisholm on it. The future leader of Australia and present Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Dr Hewson) says he would like to see Caroline Chisholm on the note. There is a role for the Parliament on issues like this. It should not be left to the governors of the Reserve Bank. The Parliament should have the opportunity, through its Prime Minister, to go back to them and say, 'It will be expensive, but please in future be very careful about what is taken off our notes, and about what it is intended to put on them'.

43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Truss)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned arid the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA NA,39
44,Mr MCARTHUR,AGREEMENTS,"I move: That this House urges the Government to recognise the urgent need to rapidly increase the of true enterprise employment agreements so as to help stimulate economic and employmentgenerating activity in Australia's devastated economy. The key to this debate is the definition of true and genuine enterprise agreements between two parties. Enterprise agreements are not an enforced deal negotiated by the union movement. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deregulated the financial markets in his term as Treasurer, but in his terms as Treasurer and as Prime Minister he has been unwilling to deregulate the labour market. The well known and respected commentator Professor Judy Sloan of Flinders University says that Labor has re-regulated the labour market. The training guarantee levy and the superannuation guarantee charges are two examples. There are two very different models offered to the Australian people as to how their arrangements in individual workplaces should be organised, as this motion clearly demonstrates. On this side, we will put forward the argument that the Government is trying to run the comparison as being very much the same. Professor Sloan and her colleague Mark Wooden, a specialist in labour relations, wrote an article in the September 1992 edition of the Australian Bulletin of Labour. This is a very interesting quotation, covering the major thrust of our whole argument: Overall . . . we conclude that the current vision of enterprise bargaining held by the Acru and the Labor government does not involve a radical change in the way labour relations are conducted in this country ... The alternative vision (of the coalition) ... the bottom line is that workers (or their designated representatives) will be able to negotiate directly with management about the issues that are important to them. This sums up the policy differences quite clearly. The Liberal and National parties are believers in the right of freedom of association. We also believe .that closed shops should. be outlawed, as should union preference clauses, which give a legal status to unions in awards as well as in the position of negotiators. Most of all, the coalition believes that individual employers and number employees are sensible enough to come to decisions about the conditions which are to apply in each workplace, to the mutual advantage of both parties. This does not mean that there is no role for unions. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong, (Mr Howard), has made this quite clear. Responsible unions will have a place in industrial relations in Australia, provided they look after the interests of both the employers and their own members in a responsible way. There is an urgent need to allow Australians to negotiate real enterprise employment agreements that are voluntarily entered into by both parties and not forced by the union movement. That is a key phrase, as the honourable members opposite would fully understand. The Opposition and the governments in New South Wales, New Zealand and Victoria have all proposed slightly different models, but the essential thrust is the same: to give employers and employees a choice as to which arrangements are most suitable for their particular workplace. Laura Tingle of the Australian recently summed up this Government's confusion in commenting on the subject of my motion when she said: The government seems least certain (in the area ot) . . . the labour market. This now seems to be . . . where short term expediency could most put at risk the reform process. There is not any totally credible rationale for what the government is doing at present with the award process, nor one to juStify its claims that award and union restructuring have been a success. Labor's so-called enterprise bargaining is a corruption of the term. In October 1991 the national wage case decision of the Industrial Relations Commission laid down the rules, but section 134, which replaces section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act, says that only a certified trade union can make an enterprise agreement with an employer. What a remarkable position, where only a trade union can make a certified agreement. I think members of the public are unaware of this fine print arrangement. Most people have an understanding that an enterprise agreement is a genuinely negotiated document between an individual and an employer, and yet under the present industrial arrangements we have to fit in with the law under section 134. Section 134 really replaces section 115, which allowed enterprise agreements to be put in place in bigger manufacturing companies such as ICI at Botany Bay and Alcoa in Geelong. These agreements have allowed for annualised payments while removing many of the existing allowances and rorts. Penalty rates for weekend work were removed in the annualised salaries and-surprise, surprise!most of the plant's maintenance was able to be performed during the 38-hour week. Most of the workers, who are now on annualised salaries, did not find the need to return for weekend work because they knew full well that they should do most of that maintenance work during the 38-hour week. So there have been some major changes in those plants. I have actually inspected them and found them to be working very satisfactorily. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, in a recent so-called critique of the Opposition's Jobsback policy, claimed that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has been given a central role by the Government in what the Minister calls Labor's enterprise agreements. Exactly: that is the fundamental problem we perceive. The Government and the union movement are still involved in the enterprise agreement arrangements that are proposed. I note that Bill Kelty of the ACTU declared that the April 1991 national wage case decision was vomit. That is a well known remark, when the Secretary of the ACTU had his falling out with the President of the IRC, Mr Justice Maddem. In a telephone call to the President in relation to the awards being brought down by the Industrial Relations Commission at that time, he said, 'What you are going to do is screw the ordinary workers into the ground'. There is no room for the 70 per cent of the private sector work force who are not unionised to come to a sensible agreement with their employers because under section 134 the union must be involved. There is no provision that would cover all but one of Gazal's 145 clothing employees coming to a sensible agreement with their employer when that Gold Coast factory was in trouble recently. Most honourable members would be aware of that well publicised case, where the workers tried to come to an agreement, tried to keep their jobs, but the union movement would not allow them to agree to a sensible arrangement that had been worked out by the staff association. The clothing union and the union secretary, Anna Booth, would not allow that sensible arrangement to take place. There was no room also for the Metway Bank Staff Association to be an official part of the system. This staff association, which has the active support of the vast majority of Metway staff, wished to enter an agreement that would have bypassed the designated union official. Again,that was not allowed to .happen, although it would have been an advantage to both parties. The Government's corrupted version of enterprise bargaining focuses on the central role of the ACTU and its chieftain, Bill Kelty, along with major employers, in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The resignation of a member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Mr Ken Turbet, on 14 April this year showed just what is wrong with the Government's lack of vision. M:r Turbet, a well known Labor sympathiser and supporter, had this to· say: The so-called accord process has been manipulated to such an extent that it is only the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the ACfU who are now involved in its decision making procedures. What a remarkable observation. In its insistence under section 134 of the Industrial Relations Act that a so-called agreement must be made by a registered trade union, the Government shows its hand, with Prime Minister Keating and his political ally Bill Kelty calling all the shots under these enterprise agreements. This is the most important point about the Government's policy position as compared to the coalition's view. These arrangements exclude the 60 per cent of employees who are not unionised. In the current arrangementS, all those people who prefer not to join a union are not allowed to have an enterprise agreement under the Government's regime. This is a pathetic arrangement where only 300 of the so-called enterprise agreements have been registered to date and they cover only 5 per cent of the work force. The Government also says that employees must not be disadvantaged by their so-called sham enterprise agreements. In his initial comments on the coalition's visionary Jobsback policy, the Minister for Industrial Relations claimed that the 'no disadvantage' test is central to the new certified agreement provisions. We have had long discussions in this House about the Government's attitude to those arrangements. Finally, the employment contracts in New Zealand have worked well, where individual workers have negotiated with their employers to the advantage of both the enterprise and the workers' terms and conditions. I visited New Zealand in July this year with the Deputy Leader' of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). We talked to management and we talked to workers, and there is no doubt, contrary to public propaganda around Australia, especially during the recent Victorian election, that the Employment Contracts Act is working well in New Zealand.

45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Charles-I second the motion.,41
46,Mr COURTICE,AGREEMENTS,"I oppose this motion. If there is anything that clearly designates the different view of philosophy, not only now in this House but certainly between now and the coming election, it is industrial relations. I have said in this House many times before, and I would like to say again, the words that Ben Chifley said that echo through the decades and will continue to echo for generations to come: 'Labor stands for the people, and Labor stands opposed to those who would take advantage of the people'. The debate on industrial relations at the present time is about whether we maintain, for working men and women, an award system· that is the envy of the world, or whether we go back to the Masters and Servants Act of last century in Britain. The industrial relations debate is about whether we go back to the days when people got on their hands and knees and begged for a job paying $3 an hour; and it is about whether kids go up chimneys or back into mines, as many of our forefathers had to do. It is about whether we maintain dignity for the working men and women of this country and ensure the democratic right of people to sell and bargain their labour, with an independent umpire and with a union movement that is dedicated to protecting them. Of course, the new attack on workers' conditions did not start in Victoria at all: started where it all began, 100 years ago, in the pastoral industry in Queensland. About 18 months or two years ago, it started with the intent of a group of people, backed by an organisation called Troubleshooters and a parasite called BJ. Hammonds, to break down award conditions for workers in the shearing industry. The major substance of what I want to say today is not so much about the industrial relations debate as it is about a tribute to a man called Alec-Blue Gown-Walton, who became the President of the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers Union. He passed away on 19 February 1990. He was publicly attacked only two weeks ago in Charleville, because of the stand he took and the dedication he had to Australian shearers and to working people across the State of Queensland, in particular. The fact that Blue Gown could be attacked, more than two years after he has passed on from this world, for defending Queensland shearers and other Australian shearers and fighting for a decent go, highlights the differences in views and philosophy which are under the surface, and which have bubbled to the surface in the pastoral industry over the last few months. Alec worked as an AWU organiser for many years, work which culminated in his election as Queensland Branch President. He organised in the far north of the State, and finally came back to settle in his beloved south-west of Queensland. One of the most touching commentaries on Alec Walton was made by his contemporaries when they said, 'You've never experienced a real friendship until you've known ""The Gown"" as your friend'. I have had a beer with Blue Gown, at the Embassy Hotel, which was and is the favourite watering hole of the Australian Workers Union in Queensland, and I am pleased to say that he was a friend of mine. Various versions exist as to how Alec's name of Blue Gown was arrived at, but most people know that he was a boxer of some note in the early days, and was happy to take on all comers in Jimmy Sharman's troop, and of course was happy to defend workers' rights it out there in the shearing sheds. I think his family can be very proud of the record that he set. The people who discredited and criticised him a few weeks ago will not long be remembered, but Blue Gown Walton will be remembered with pride. When criticism is levelled at people for defending workers' rights they can wear that criticism as a badge of honour. It is something they can be proud of because most battlers, most workers, have very few people to defend them. They do not have the Establishment. They do not have wealth. They do not have power. All they have is the union they belong to, a belief in a fair go and a belief in decency. Blue Gown Walton epitomised those values. I want to pay tribute to him today in this debate more than anything else and let the people of Charleville know that we who support unions can be proud of him. I am proud to be a member of the Australian Workers Union and to have been a friend of Blue Gown Walton. His family can be very proud of him. Prior to coming into this House today to speak on this debate, I rang up a great mate of mine, Gerry Goding. Gerry is in his mid80s and was a district secretary of the Australian Workers Union for many years. He is a man who dedicated all his life to defending the rights of workers. I said to Gerry that I was going to stand up and pay tribute to Blue Gown. In the industrial relations debate that is going to take place across the country between now and the next election it is important that we recognise the people who have fought for the rights of Aussie workers since the time of the Depression, through the war years and through the 1950s and 1960s. The conditions that workers enjoy today did not just happen; they came about as a consequence of the efforts of people such as Blue Gown Walton, Gerry Goding and his two old mates-Alf Cane and Edgar Williams. Between them they have over a century of service to the AWU. Their lives have been dedicated to the battlers and to the shearers. 1I have often had letters-and 1 think honourable members on the other side of the House should recognise this-from shearers who cannot get a job because they have a union ticket and they will not work for less than the award rate of pay. One shearer from Longreach wrote to me and said, 'I have four kids and my wife is going to have our fifth child, but I am a member of the union and·1 will not scab and 1 will not work for less than the award rate of pay because it is the law'. 1 think we can be pretty proud of those sorts of people. They do not have a voice. They do not have the grammar school tie. They do not have all the trappings that go with the Establishment, but they are the people who make this country great. As 1I have said, the Gerry Godings, the Alf Canes, the Edgar Williamses and the Blue Gown Waltons are the people who fought for them and took the criticism. 1 think it is a tribute to 'Blue Gown' that he is still copping criticism today, two years after he passed on. There is another great old bloke called Jack Williams that 1 would like to aclQlowledge. He has just had his sixtieth wedding anniversary. Jack was an AWU organiser and 1 discovered only the other day, although 1I have had the privilege of meeting him before, that his best mate was my mother's father-my grandfather. They knocked around together in central Queensland. One notable thing about the union movement, and the AWU in particular, is the tradition that exists and the determination that exists amongst its members that they are not going to lie down and roll over like the New Zealanders may have done in regard to industrial relations. When people say that New Zealand is an example of a successful experiment, let us look at the New Zealanders. They have voted with their feet and moved to Australia. There are 288,000 of them here today, and the reason they are here is that they do not want to cop a tory government and they do not want to cop such industrial relations. There is something that Henry Lawson wrote that epitomises what this is all about better than anything 1 can say. I would like to read a poem by Henry Lawson called I'm too old to rat: I don't care if the cause be wrong Or if the cause be right; I've had my day and sung my song and fought the bitter fight. In truth, at times I can't tell what The men are driving at. But I've been union 30 years and I'm too old to rat. Maybe, at times in bygone days Remembered now by few, We did bite off in various ways Much more than we could chew. We paid-in bitter strikers' camps Across the Blacksoil Flat, We paid-in long and hungry tramps And I'm too old to Rat. The Queensland Strike of '89 And '90's gloomy days, The day the Opera Company sang· For us-""The Marseillaise."" The sea of faces, stem and set, The waiting bitter cup. The hopeless hearts, unbeaten yet The storm clouds rushing up The fighting, dying ""Boomerang"" Against the ""Daily Press."" The infant ""Worker"" holding out The families in distress. The sudden tears of beaten menOh, you remember that, And memories that make my pen Not worth its while to Rat. I've wept with them in Strikers' Camps, Where shivered man and beast, I've worn, since then, the badge of men Of hell-and London East; White face in the flaring torch, Wraith wives-the slaves of fat, And ragged children in the rain, Yes, I'm too old to Rat. Between here and the next election people will be hearing a hell of a lot more of this because we are going to defend and fight for the right of all men and women in this country to defend their conditions and the right to sell their labour at a decent rate of pay, and not be manipulated as was the case 100 years ago.",41
47,Mr CHARLES,AGREEMENTS,"I am delighted to rise in support of, and to congratulate, my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) on his excellent motion. It really deserves the attention of all thinking Australians. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) is absolutely correct when he says that the battleground for the next Federal election will be industrial relations. It will be all about whether we are going to continue to live in the past, whether we are going to continue live with a snowballing, rising debt, and whether we are going to be able to service that debt. It will also be about our falling living standards, our increasing unemploylocal ment, and whether we are going to make the transition to create an open economy that gives Australians a chance to create jobs, ditions, jobs, and more jobs. The honourable member for Hinkler is a true conservative from the Labor side of politics-living in the past, refusing to accept at or acknowledge the desirability and the necessity for change in the rapidly moving and rapidly progressing international environ- sand ment that is now embracing our economy. I remind the honourable member for Hinkler that the wall is gone. It was his side of politics that tore down the tariff wall and exposed our island continent to the economies of the world. The honourable member for Hinkler, as a true historian, has himself become history. He wants to live in the past, behind the tariff wall that no longer exists. Like the true conservatives, he wishes that we could bring back the glories of the past, the fights and the battles, those vainglorious of the true history of his union movement. I say to the honourable member for Hinkler that those days are dead and gone, finished and buried. The way forward into the twentyfirst century is to deregulate our labour market, and deregulate it must or perish we will. The rest of the world will not sit around and wait for us. They will move on and they will become increasingly competitive in a world that is not so hungry for the things Australia has to offer. This Government is about re-regulating the industrial relations system, not deregulating it. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is today bringing forward into the Senate an industrial relations Bill-which we will debate at a later hour-that acts to further re-regulate and centralise the control of this system. The system itself gives such power and such a monopoly of rights to trade unions as bargaining agents that it denies the intelligence and the ability of individuals to have any idea of what might be best for them. In fact, it is so stifling that in marty instanto ces in small, medium and large industries we find work forces constrained by the centrality rule, which requires people to work in one city as people work in another when their environment demands something quite different. They may well want to work dif. ferently and for different wages and conbut this centrality rule, this prescribed award system, prevents them from so doing. The union bureaucracy sticks its hand in and says, 'We cannot have a microcosm of change one level, in one workplace. The whole system will crumble and fall like the tower of Babylon if we allow so much as one grain of to be shifted'. So the award system becomes inviolable. We must protect it at all costs. Another part of this debate is about protection. Honourable members on the other side of this place argue constantly about the need to protect working men and women from some scurrilous act of some demonstrably bad employer, but they give the employee no rights of his own to look after himself or do the best thing for himself or improve his lot in this world. People say that employers think days they must make sure that the employee is maintained at this minimum level of mediocrity, rather than giving him the opportunity to grow, prosper and be successful himself.

48,Mr LAVARCH,AGREEMENTS,"Fisher) (11.55 a.m.)This debate is being held in a period of limbo., We are not quite certain about the appropriate rhetoric that members of the Opposition should be advancing in this debate because tomorrow we will have the unveiling of their new set of policies, after the absolutely dismal failure of their attempts to convince the Australian populace of the value of the so-called Fightback policy, now known as the 'flipback' or the 'backdown' policy. With one part of the Opposition's policy, industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) got in before there could be debate about it and tried to cut off any possible change. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his public statement said, 'The whole thing is on the table now. We are out and listening and getting in all our feedback. We will certainly take on, board that people might have some concerns about our industrial relations policy'. At the same time, the honourable member for'Bennelong is staking his claim and saying, 'No, no way, this thing only came out seven weeks ago. There is no need to revise it and it will stand finn'. It will be interesting to who wins the battle of wills between the two leading figures of the Opposition. It may have some portent as to who ultimately will become the Leader of the Opposition after the coalition's defeat at the next Federal election. This need not be simply an academic debate. We have seen in very recent times Liberal industrial relations policy in action. We have seen in Victoria what Liberal industrial relations policies actually mean. We have even had differing views from individual spokesmen in the Opposition about what they believe in relation to the Kennett policy. At one point they are saying that what Kennett has done is a bit wrong and they will back away from it; at another point they are 99 per cent or 1{)() per cent behind it. But they certainly do agree with the basic thrust. What has been the basic thrust of industrial relations policy in Victoria under Mr Kennett and his Government? Get through all the rhetoric and decode all the symbolism and all the language. What has it meant? It has meant reducing wages, taking away people's leave loading, attacking their penalty rates-that is, pay them less-and attacking their conditions. The system of enterprise bargaining means to the Opposition that employees will be paid less, that in tenns of production employees are getting too large a slice of the cake and that a bigger slice should be going to the owners. That is the effect of what Opposition members are saying, but they attempt to cloak it in the tenns of the great Liberal tradition. They say, 'What we are interested in is freedom: freedom of association, the ability to go out there and negotiate with one's employer and come to a mutually agreeable solution'. That is the rhetoric of the Opposition, and that is the rhetoric of Jeff Kennett. He put out his campaign leaflets and brochures saying, 'We guarantee that no-one will be worse off. We guarantee that we will not cut people's leave loadings. We guarantee that there will be no attack on penalty rates'. When those leaflets and letters went out to the people of Victoria, maybe some people stupidly relied on what they said. The reality was an attack on their wages and conditions that means, 'I see want to pay you less'. That is exactly what the Federal Liberal Party people are all about. Do not listen to what 'they say now; do not get sucked in by all the rhetoric of freedom of association. Look instead at their actions and at the reality. The reality is that they want to pay people less, they want to attack people's conditions. That is Why the interesting debate between the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong is so important to Australia. It will be interesting to see what changes to the Jobsback policy come out of tomorrow. It has not been GST on food or other complications with the GST which has seen the absolute collapse of the Liberal Party; it has been its Federal industrial relations policy. Its release has coincided with the actions of Jeff Kennett in Victoria. People know what the Liberals really mean, because they can see their policy in action. People know it means that the Liberals want to pay them less and reduce their working conditions. That is why people are leaving the Liberals in droves. (TIme expired)",45
49,Mr MILES,AGREEMENTS,"This is a very important debate. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), talked about reality. I want to bring those people who are listening to this debate to reality as well. For the changes which we are suggesting in the industrial relations area, look at New Zealand. Why is it the reality that the overwhelming majority of people in New Zealand have had a real wage increase? That is the reality. What about the reality of the Australian economy? We have the highest level of unemployment this country has ever had. That is the reality of Australia today. That is why the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) has brought this debate on in this Parliament: this economy has been devastated by Hawke and Keating and Dawkins. Let us just run through a few things. Unemployment is 11.4 per cent and rising, the highest for 60 years in this country. The economy is devastated. It does not matter what we look at. The overseas debt is $200 billion for the first time in our history. Never before in our history has this country seen such devastation, with the overseas debt so high. It is $12,000 per man, woman and child. That· is the debt hanging around their neck. That is the truth. Look at the figures caused by the Labor Party. Look at public housing. In 1983, 60,000 to 70,000 people were waiting for public housing. What is the number now? It is 223,000. That is the number of people on the waiting list for public housing in this country-a situation caused by Keating, caused by Dawkins, caused by Hawke. Bankruptcies are the highest ever in our history. This economy has been devastated. It has been slashed and burnt by Keating. We have got to do something about it. The honourable member for Fisher talked about reality. This is the reality of Australia. It not something to be avoided as he avoided it. He did not even mention the word 'economy' during his speech. Neither did the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). He just went on about the history of some person in the AWU-one of his mates. Let us talk about young people. Fifty thousand of them cannot get into the universities. It is no good the Government saying here that it has been able to maintain people going on to year 11 and year 12. It is not providing places for them in university. We are going to put $2,000m into education over and above. what the Labor Government is doing. That is the reality. Dr Charlesworth-You are lying.",46
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS,"Mr Dubois)Order! The honourable member will not interject. Dr Bob Woods-I have a point of order. I suggest the honourable member for Perth, who called the honourable member for Braddon a liar, should be requested to withdraw that remark.",46
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS,"Order! If the honourable member for Perth did callDr Charlesworth-I didn't call him a liar; I said he was lying. Mr Costello-Withdraw that, then. Dr Charlesworth-I withdraw it.",46
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS,Thank you. The honourable member has withdrawn.,46
53,Mr MILES,AGREEMENTS,"What we have to do in this country is to bring about some changes carefully and thoughtfully. In regard to industrial relations, there is no doubt that we have to trust the men and women and the young people of this country and. the employers to work together instead of having a monopolistic approach by the union movement, which thinks that unions are the only ones who can ever represent the workers. They are not. Many of the workers can represent themselves or ought to be able to choose somebody else to represent them, rather than having the monopolistic power of all-powerful unions. They are one .of the reasons why this country is stuffed. It has is been stuffed by the Labor Party. That is the reality of it. What we need now is flexibility, so that the employees and the employers can sit down and say, 'We have to make our enterprise work. It has to work better, and we have to get out of the road the things in place now that are stifling us and preventing us from being profitable. We have got to get on with the job, because if we work together we are all going to benefit'. This Government is centralist in all its policies. It supports the monopolies of the unions and it supports its mates. Quite frankly, we have to address these issues and not avoid them as the Labor Party has been doing.

54,Mr LANGMORE,AGREEMENTS,"Fraser) (12.05 p.m.)We have just heard an extraordinary speech from the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). He talked about New Zealand versus Australia. The New Zealand economy is still at the level it was in 1987. It has not grown in five years. The Australian economy is growing faster than that of any other OECD country. It is simply a misrepresentation to talk as the honourable member did. The Opposition has great pleasure in trying to create an artificial sense of crisis about Australia and about Victoria. It continually quotes figures about debt. The fact of the matter is that Australia has less government debt as a proportion of national income than any other Western country. There is no industrialised mixed capitalist economy with less government debt as a proportion of GOP than Australia. That is true not only of the Commonwealth but also of the States and local government. Victorian government debt as a proportion of Victorian State product is 26 per cent, which makes it the second lowest in comparison with countries in the Western world. There is only one country-Finland-which has a lower ratio of government debt to GOP than Victoria has. Dr Charlesworth-But they don't want facts. Mr LANGMOREThey do not want facts. Those opposite are concentrating on building up a sense of crisis in order to justify their extraordinarily regressive, destructive and conflict ridden policies. The policies of the Victorian Government, as would the ones which a Hewson government would introduce if it ever got the opportunity to do so, involve a massive shift of power from the employees to employers. If one looks at the figures for industrial conflict in Australia, one finds that already it is managerial policy which is the principal cause of conflict. Those are the figures from the impartial Australian Bureau of Statistics. If the Kennett policies were applied nationally, that would be the normal course of events. There is no industrial relations crisis in Victoria. Victoria has a particularly low level of industrial conflict. Of course, Australia, under the accord, has had a very low level of conflict as well. One of the great benefits of the accord has been that we have had a consultative approach-not only to industrial relations policy but to economic and social policy generally. The employers, the employees and government have all been involved at each level of policy making in advising and deciding how economic and social policies should be made. The result of that has been that we have had less industrial stoppages and fewer hours lost than at any other time in the postwar period. There has been a major improvement in industrial relations under the consensual policies of the Labor Government. The extraordinarily regressive and aggressive policies of the Victorian Government are generating massive conflict. If one wants higher productivity in the workplace, a necessary condition of that is a cooperative approach-not the kind of assault on working conditions .that the Kennett Government is trying to generate. That is one of the central reasons why the policies are so inept. They are creating conflict where it previously did not exist. As well as that, those opposite are talking about the need to increase flexibility. But flexibility for what? Flexibility, in their view, for the employer to exploit the employee. They are going to take away the bargaining strength of workers and employees and pass it over to employers by removing that very effectively built up balance of power between employers and employees through their unions, which we have relied on for nearly 100 years now in order to generate fair industrial relations.",47
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS,Mr Dubois)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.

56,Mr SNOW,ILLEGAL DRUG USE,"I move: That this House: (1) declares that urgent action is needed to deal with organised crime, death and the health social problems associated with illegal drug use; and (2) calls on the Executive to initiate action with the States to: (a) oversee the sale of drugs of addiction such as heroin and other opiates, cocaine and amphetamines by prescription; and (b) ensure that prescribers are approved physicians and that dispensers are approved pharmacists, all having completed appropriate additional training. Illegal drugs are not the major drug problem in Australia. They are overshadowed by the health and social problems arising from the wrong use of legal medicines and the sickness, death and personal debility arising from alcohol and tobacco. Drugs such as heroin, cocaine and amphetamines are different in that they have brought about murders, theft, black markets, violence in foreign countries from criminal cartels, and enticement of children and youth to use and sell drugs. Very often the first dose is free for the young person being enticed onto drugs. All this happened between the late 1950s, when .the drugs were prohibited, and now. Since the announcement that I would move this motion, I have received overwhelming support. The main opponents are ostriches, and there are plenty of them; the Mafia, who would quite happily fund the ostriches in their campaign against legalisation; and those who have not studied the issue but are suspicious. I thank doctors and phannacists in Eden Monaro who have contacted me, every one with encouragement and advice-Dr Marjorie Cross, Dr Tom Gavranic, Bruce Mitchell and Van Doherty. Bruce has had experience in the methadone program and Van and his father, prior to the prohibition in the 1960s, had pharmacy experience with drug addicts, experience which was similar to my own. Ian Mathews, the former editor of the Canberra TImes, Peter Hiscock and many people involved in rehabilitation have expressed their support, and I am delighted to see Ian in the gallery today. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) will second the motion. He has been an Olympic contestant and has also been much involved in community health. Another and Olympic contestant, Kyra Grunsund, of the World Disabled Olympics, wants to move away from the present hopelessness, just as the honourable member for Perth does. The ostriches include some drug addicts and a small minority of those who help them. I was an ostrich myself once, when in a Victorian referendum I supported retention .of 6 o' clock closing of pubs. I was proven wrong by a dramatic improvement in the street environment around 6 p.m. in Victoria. As. I said, objections have also come from people who have not looked at the issue. On Monday, a number of Jerangle people came to see me on my visit to Jerangle and said that they wanted to know more about it, because they would have thought that tougher legislation ought to be tried, that there was no way we could not control people by tougher legislation. It has been tried. It is being tried in Thailand, the United States and many other countries. Unfortunately, there is always someone who can be bought; there are always problems. It is now beyond the ability of law enforcement to control the war on drugs that has been going on for 25 years. It has not been won in any country. but generally it does less well where there is prohibition than where there has been some form of legalisation. Fox and Mathews, in their book Drugs Policy: Fact, Fiction and Future, printed this year, which I can recommend, have pointed out that the United States might be one of greatest opponents of legalisation. I am hopeful that, with the change of adthis ministration in the United States, there will be more reality in its attitude to other countries and particularly to its own drug problem. most vociferous opponents of the sort of action 1 recommended at the national drug summit were Brian Burke, who said, 'Noand nsense', and SirJoh Bjelke-Petersen, who said, 'Foolish'. But people such as George Shultz, the US Secretary of State, and former Australian judge Russell Fox believe that in prohibition has failed and that another proach is needed. We do not have to rely on well known people. People lived in, worked in and visited Kings Cross, Sydney, in the 1950s when heroin, cocaine and amphetamines were not prohibited. In the 1950s, the difference was that addicts were older and their generally followed opiate or other medicinal treatment. As reported in the United StateS Dialogue magazine of April 1992, there were no more opium addicts per capita when opiates were legal than there were when they were illegal. The drugs were not prohibited. They were available on prescription and their addictions were under medical supervision. What illegal drugs did to Kings Cross has been done, to a lesser extent, to other parts Australia. As Franklin P. Adams said of prohibition: It's left a trail of filth and slime, It's filled the land with vice and crime, It don't prohibit worth a dime. It is true that prohibition reduced total alcohol consumption, but the horrors associated with it made it the worse evil. There are a lot of problems associated with illegal drug use today. Workers in the drug area, such as Alex Wodak, Les Drew and Chesher, have highlighted them. Prostitution is linked to drugs. Somebody on the Sunday program in 1988 said, '1 would do anything to get money for drugs. 1 need $300 a night, so that's six people'. Health problems are associated with them, as with other drugs, but the problem with the illegal sale of drugs is that there people who adulterate them with strychnine and talcum powder and so on. That makes the people shoot up; instead of taking the drugs orally, they use intravenous injections, and makes them overdose in many cases. mv is another problem. Me John White, the former Tasmanian Minister for Health, has The told me that mv could cost Australian taxpayers up to $400,000 per person. Associated with mv is the misery and the high social health costs as well as the financial costs. In Holland it is estimated that 30 per cent of intravenous drug users have mv. Dependence affects people in the workplace, at home and their social life, with disruption to society apwhen people have to find $5,000 a week, on average, to pay for their addiction. That is how much the 129 drug addicts surveyed in Australia said it cost. Under the proposals 1 \. am making, that amount could be brought down to $200 a week to live on and take the medication, instead of $5,000 a week to live addiction on and take the drug. Drug addiction also causes crimes against other people, ranging from stealing handbags to murder. Other problems are the propping up of fragile governments, the enticement of youth on the streets, and the high cost of insurance. John White, the former Minister for Health in Tasmania, was proposing to take this matter to the Council of Ministers. That of is what we want to happen. In this motion, US the honourable member for Perth and 1 are moving that the matter be taken to the council of Ministers, just as Me John White was intending to do. A task force should be formed to determine a uniform approach. There cannot be one rule in the ACT and another in Queanbeyan, for instance. There cannot be one rule in Tasmania and another on the mainland. As Me White said, people would move to Tasmania. We cannot afford to have different policies. We have to have a uniform approach. Some excellent ideas have been brought forward. They include bringing the drug addiction problem under public health policy rather than regarding it as a crime; having doctor and pharmacist participants trained; linking up with rehabilitation to look at the are real problems of inadequate family role modelling, problems with self-esteem, school, and youth unemployment. Legalisation will not help promote self-control, but people do need to learn to take charge of their lives, that can be done under this proposal. We could look at a different range of opportunities. For instance, Fox and Mathews have recommertded the availability of a consumer card on application. There could be an administrative cost charge. There should be a reasonable profit. The drugs should not be free, as they are in the United Kingdom, where admittedly 7,000 out of 35,000 heroin addicts purchase legally and there is less crime and less AIDS, but it does create another area of selling because people get them free. So there should be a reasonable cost, perhaps with a tax on them, as recreational drugs such as alcohol and tobacco are taxed, but not enough to make a black market worthwhile. Users need to be encouraged not to transfer to another drug like methadone because that has not worked well in Australia. Perhaps the same drug could be used in another form, like heroin syrup. A doctor and I dispensed plenty of heroin and we phased it down from 100 per cent to 10 per cent in a year with the cooperation of the users. I strongly commend the motion to the House.

57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ILLEGAL DRUG USE,Is the motion seconded? Dr Charlesworlh-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,50
58,Dr BOB WOODS,ILLEGAL DRUG USE,"I am entirely opposed to this Labor Party attempt to legalise narcotic drugs for addicts. Let us make no bones about it, that is exactly what it is. It is an attempt by the Labor Party-or at least by the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow)-to legalise narcotic drugs. One of those honourable members is a founding member of the Foundation for Drug Policy, the FOP, which is an Australian based drug legalisation group. The overwhelming responsibility that I have, and which all responsible members of society have, is to protect our children. Those children have enough problems every day in trying to resist drugs and say no to their peers and to pushers. It should not be their responand sibility to try to keep the message from adults clear and impartial. The responsibility should be ours. Many of those advocating drug legalisation do not realise the damage they are doing. They have never talked to kids, as I have, who are· resisting the pressure to become addicted or to young addicts bravely trying to recover their shattered lives. As Robert E. Peterson has said, it is our duty and our responsibility to speak out for those who often cannot speak out for themselves. We must publicly challenge every assertion that drugs should be legalised. What arguments are we hearing about why the thing should be legalised? We have the old civil liberties arguments. Dr Charlesworth- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask that the Opposition spokesman address the motion. He is talking about something completely different from what is addressed in the motion. We are not talking about the legalisation of drugs at all. He is not addressing the motion.",50
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ILLEGAL DRUG USE,There is no point of order.,50
60,Dr BOB WOODS,ILLEGAL DRUG USE,"The honourable member for Eden-Monaro repeatedly referred to legalisation and the importance of legalisation. The honourable member probably was not listening to his speech. We are talking now about the supposed reasons why legalisation should occur. The other arguments that have been put forward are that drug laws are an evil plot of the new world order, or that they are only attractive because they are illegal. All of these arguments have been completely discredited. But now we have new calls, due partly to frustration, about the cost of law enforcement and the inability of authorities to control drug related crime, and because it has not been completely controlled so therefore we should change tack. One can argue that there has never been complete control of murders but we do not tum around and say we are going to legalise murder, or on a minor level, speeding. We do not legalise speeding. The costs of enforcing outweigh the benefit to society is the argument which is put forward, but it is an absurd argument. It ignores history. It ignores the social and the economic realities. I can understand their frustration but the call for legalisation is a nonsense. Let us look at countries which have approached legalisation in the same way. Let us look, for example, at Sweden. In Sweden in 1965 permission was given to a few physicians to prescribe narcotics, both opiates 1985. and central stimulants, to a limited number of addicts for their personal use. Following studies it became clear that the whole thing had beenDr Charlesworth- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Again I draw your attention to the fact that the word 'legalisation' does not appear in this motion. The motion has nothing to do with the issues that are being raised by the honourable member opposite.",50
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ILLEGAL DRUG USE,There is no point of order.,51
62,Dr BOB WOODS,ILLEGAL DRUG USE,"I repeat, the word 'legalisation' was used repeatedly by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. The physician responsible for most of the activity in Sweden when it was reviewed two years later in 1967 had prescribed a total of 600,000 doses of opiates and four million doses of central stimulants to an average of only 82 patients over a periodof two years. Statistics show that at the beginning of treatment, individual patients received an average of 1,000 doses per month. Six months later it was 2,000 doses per month. After two years, prescribing it had reached 3,000 doses per patient per month. Most importantly, in an interview at the end of that period in 1967, a number of interviews were carried out and people arrested. One quarter declared that they had bought or received illicit drugs from somebody they knew to be obtaining these drugs legally. That is, this system that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the honourable member for Perth are pushing actually supplies the black market. In the UK a similar system was put forward to manage a small number of addicts. From 1960 to 1968 the number of users under this system doubled every 18 months because massive overprescription created an illicit market, with addicts selling surplus supplies to· young people who sought physicians willing to prescribe opiates to them. Physicians were giving addicts as much as they demanded, and from 1,000 addicts at the start of 1960 there were 80,000 addicts by The Netherlands has a strange system. It is a de facto legalisation system where people tum a blind eye to the illegal use of cannabis and prosecutions are not put forward for the use of hard drugs. In this climate the' use of drugs in the Netherlands has got out of control. For example, 15,000 West German drug addicts reside permanently in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam. Each year the bodies of at least 40 are carried back across the border. It is such a great problem that there is a special unit in Amsterdam set up by the Dutch Government to locate German addicts and send them home. The Netherlands has the highest criminality rate in Europe and is No. 4 on the world list. Those attempts have clearly failed and there is no shortage of examples. The argument about alcohol is often raised, but there is a major difference with regard to the prohibition of alcohol, which was never a morally consensual arrangement. People basically thought that alcohol had always been used and should continue to be used. There is an argument that the illicit market might be eliminated. It is just possible that that might occur and that the black market on drugs might be reduced but a black plague of drug addiction, overdose deaths and crime would sweep the nation instead. There is no doubt about that. We also need to take care of drug legalisation and street crime. Cheaper legal drugs lead to an increase in the level of violent and property crime because drug users commit crime to obtain drugs, regardless of price. In the United States, crack is only $3 a dose, but violent crime has skyrocketed. Amsterdam has found that de facto legalisation has led to a wave of theft and vandalism. Would drug legalisation impact on demand? Many legalisation advocates admit that there would be a temporary rise but say that this factor is mitigated by some blind faith that some natural level would be reached. But experience in these other countries shows that one cannot be pro-Iegalisation and hope to discourage drug use by youth. It is putting a stamp of approval on the use of drugs. Experience with alcohol shows that, once a drug is legal for adults, it cannot be kept from kids. Those are incontrovertible facts. Drug legalisation will result in more people experimenting with drugs, more experimenters becoming regular users and more users becoming addicts. Drug laws do deter people. In a study in the United States the main reason for not indulging in drugs was fear of getting in trouble with the law and acquiring a criminal record. The facts are very simple. There is the matter of what happens about the legal onus and who actually takes responsibility should a drug addict die as a result of a legally prescribed drug. The Government seems to have a very great faith in doctors. There are 80 doctors and 30 nurses in New South Wales alone who are banned for illegal use of narcotics at present. What would happen if that number were increased? What is to be done about casual users? There are 60,000 to 90,000 casual users. Would one have to force them to become addicts and registered so that they could get their supplies? Does one tell them they have to go back to the black market? It is a nonsense. It is also a breach of international conventions. There is no doubt that proponents of this approach understate the potential costs and overstate the potential benefits. The bottom line is that, if availability is increased, consumption is increased, especially amongst those who are vulnerable-and that means our children. When there is an increase in the consumption of alcohol, there is a higher social cost and a higher public health cost, and the same thing will apply to narcotic drugs. The current drug crisis has been stratified amongst the poor and the near poor and this is the very group that education and drug treatment are least effective with. This is the group that we need to particularly look after and protect. Many addicts become involved not because they are addicts; they are involved in criminal activities prior to becoming addicted. There are some interesting issues here which seem to be ignored. We know that an increase in alcohol consumption does relate to higher costs and the same thing will apply to drugs. It is important that we look at the higher rates of both crime and addiction. Because people were involved in criminal activity before they were addicted, it is clear that the high rates of crime and addiction have become embedded in social and cultural roots. So the effects of drug criminalisation are becoming confused with those of social deprivation. People use the example of Sweden, saying that criminalisation carries no cost. But the fact is that Sweden does not have large numbers of poor kids killing each other on the illegal market because Sweden does not have large numbers of poor kids.",51

The honourable member will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Australian Securities CQmmission",52
64,Mr FORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Last Friday, the employees of my small engineering business were subjected to a terrorist attack by a member of the Australian Securities Commission bureaucracy. Senior investigator Colin Grant intimidated one member of my factory staff and thoroughly frightened another. All that was missing was his swastika, black shirt and Luger. In direct contravention of the ASC's own rules, this jack-booted thug arrived on his own, failed to identify himself-as set out in chapter 6 of the Commission's investigation manual-and set about intimidating my hapless typist, Heidi. . He presented Heidi with an ASC fonn No. 2, on which my name was crossed out. No attempt was made to deliver the fonn No. 2 to me, or to contact me in any way. Just like the bully boy agents of the Third Reich and Stalin's Russia, Commissar Colin altered the fonn, addressing it to Heidi, a woman who has absolutely no authority of any kind but who could easily be preyed upon by this selfappointed agent of darkness and fear. Heidi has no responsibility for company affairs, is she authorised to speak or act on behalf the company business. Her duties are very basic: typing invoices and answering the telephone. The victimisation of Heidi resulted in a telephone call from my production supervisor to me at my electorate office. I spoke to Commissar Colin requesting that he wait, or return in an hour and a half, as I had electorate matters to attend to, but Colin said could not wait. No doubt other hapless victims of the ASC's Gulag Archipelago had to be lined up for more treatment-the Third Reich revisited treatment. I forbade him from taking any documents unless I was present as the person in authority. On concluding the conversation, Commissar Colin again pursued Heidi, threatening her verbally with a $10,000 fine or six months in gaol if she did not provide the documents he demanded. Commissar Colin also attempted to physically restrict Heidi's movements by following her around the small office in an intimidating and threatening manner. I was compelled to postpone my electorate work and return to my business, where I found three very frightened staff members, two of whom had been accused of hindering ASC investigations. It was only then that the KGB standover man Commissar Colin left my premises. The company tax returns requested by the ASC had been faxed to them at Gestapo headquarters about a week before, in two volumes, as we were advised that 15 pages had not been received. Nothing then was heard until the arrival of the jack-booted Commissar Colin last Friday. This thug and his Gestapo mates should spend a few minutes perusing their own investigations manual. It may surprise them to learn that chapter 6, paragraph 3.10 states: No express power of entry. Investigators must be aware that they have only a common law right of entry onto premises. Needless to say, fonn No. 2 does not state this-an outrageous omission, in my view. It may also surprise them to know that, from a legal point of view at least, the Commission is not meant to be a latter-day secret police. nor It is not an extension of the East Gennan of Stasi, the NKVD, the KGB, the Cheka or the Gestapo. Its charter does not include intimidation and terrorism of innocent citizens. Not only did Commissar Colin remove additional copies of the business tax returns, but he also took information I had already given quite willingly to the ASC. On Friday, the documents were stolen. Several months ago the Commission was he given access to a large number of invoices, without any fonn No.2. They simply asked, and I complied. None of my original documents has been returned, despite the fact that the ASC's own manual clearly states: The law provides that the investigator may retain books as long as is necessary to make cOpies or take extracts. InVeStigators should make themselves familiar with the provisions of this section. While the legislation may give the investigator certain rights, be considerate of the needs of the person who is producing the documents. Try to avoid inconveniencing them. Some inconvenience! Assuming that standover man Grant and the terrorists at Gestapo headquarters can read, why is the organisation acting in direct contravention of the law of the land? This situation, with terror tactics directed against innocent victims, is nothing more than a blatant attack on me as a mem. ber. It is absolutely unacceptable to have to ask the Victoria Police for advice and a means of preventing further harassment and intimidation of my staff-my female staff in particular. This appalling saga of injustice is only one aspect of the ASC's behaviour. Some weeks ago, the Liberal Party State Director received an anonymous phone call from a person with detailed knowledge of my small family business. Such a phone call could have come only from the ASC. Earlier this year a very distorted interpretation of my business affairs was published in the Age. Again, it could have come only from the ASC. So much for the confidentiality requirements outlined in annexure 2.1 of the ASC's manual. On 9 November I drew the attention of the House to the plight of the agricultural engineering industry. My small family company is part of that industry. I have survived in spite of an abrupt change in government policy, high interest rates and a depression, but it has not been easy. While group tax is outstanding, all other creditors have been paid. The name of the trustee company was changed several years ago to prevent malicious rumours from affecting the business in Dandenong. That is another matter. In the old company there are assets available, the value of which is many times the outstanding liability. The ASC has the power to realise these assets, yet it has done nothing. The new trustee company always had to pick up the liability of the old trustee company, and the value of this company is also many times larger than the debt; but I have been instructed not to sell or do anything to diminish the value of this asset. I have asked Glen Cook on several occasions what he is investigating. I have asked why the assets of the old or the new company are not sold to pay the debt. 'Only when the investigations are complete', he says. In other words, there is a debt that can be paid by selling assets over which I have no control. Mr Deputy Speaker, there are several other aspects to this horrendous situation which must be placed on the record. Glen Cook has told my accountant that this investigation is, and I quote, 'a witch-hunt'. Since when has the ASC or any other government organisation been empowered to conduct witchhunts against the citizens of the Commonwealth? In these circumstances it is laughable to read the ASC's mission statement: The ASC's mission is to achieve maximum credibility of Australian corporations and securities markets. Perhaps the ASC could inform the Parliament why an expensive witch-hunt against one of the elected members has become part of its mission. I said earlier that I had spoken to the Victoria Police. However, having to resort to the protection of the law to this extent is something I find most disturbing. When Heidi is well enough to return to work, I intend reporting the incident. at my factory to the Department of Labour in Victoria. I also intend asking the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Ms Fatin) to find out why two hefty standover men, supposedly representing a government department, were allowed to terrorise and harass not only my typist, Heidi, but a female employee at my accountant's office. Finally, there is another and even more disturbing aspect to this matter, which I believe explains much about the actions of the ASC. Last year, in my capacity as a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, along with Senator Cooney and Senator Campbell I submitted a dissenting report regarding the powers of the ASC. Since then I have been subjected to systematic and relentless harassment from several ASC bureaucrats in Melbourne on account of my actiqns as a member. I am forced to the conclusion that this is a witchhunt aimed at influencing my conduct as a member of this Parliament. I contend that the actions of certain employees of the ASC constitute an attempt by improper means to influence me in my parliamentary conduct. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the form 2 which was delivered to my secretary. You will note that it has my name on it, which has been crossed out and my typist Heidi's name put on it. Leave granted.",52

69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I will have a look to see whether the document can be incorporated.,55
70,Mr FORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"To return to the ASC's manual, on page 15 it reads: Take advantage of interim measures for the protec- person. tion in the short and medium term of the interests of shareholders and creditors. This aspect is quite lost in this witch-hunt. On pages 17 and 18 this appears: Ideally, however, civil recovery actions should be taken first and disposed of as quickly as possible for the benefit of the members and creditors particular company, thereafter the wider public mterest. This aspect has also been quite lost.",55

74,Mr SAWFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker, my grievance is about the shame children feel about the word 'children' in Australian society. Let me of the explain. During the week 4 November to 11 November this year, 23 young people between the ages of 11 and 16 came from all over Australia to Canberra to participate in a conference titled 'Partnership for the Future' organised by the President of Peaceways, Ms Ellen Brogren. One of the goals of this conference was that children have input into an Australian national plan of action. The second goal was to create a channel through which Australian children could have a voice in the Commonwealth Government. Before coming to Canberra each child spoke with many other children about their concerns, priorities and suggested solutions for the future. The partnership participants also prepared for the conference by studying . the Australian Children's Appeal, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the World Summit Declaration. During the week they learned much about themselves as children. In discussion about what to name the children's national council they all discovered they were ashamed to be associated with the word 'children'. In Australian society, that word is looked down upon. They ended up saying they were going to change that attitude about the word 'children'. That shame in using the word 'children' is a sad indictment of Australian society. Children represent 25 per cent of the population but are the most undervalued under-resourced, unrepresented minority iour nation. I was extremely proud that the children asked me, as the member for Port Adelaide, to introduce their two proposals for the establishment of a children's national council and for a ministry for children and youth affairs. What follows are the words of the children, and I thank Amanda Tamblin and Mia Handshin for taking the responsibility for organising the information and sending it to my office: We, the children of Australia, ask that you our words carefully. We want you to take them seriously and then, with your wisdom, life experience, expertise and knowledge, encourage us on our path. We want you to believe in our abilities and our commitment to making our future better. We ask you to point out the correct procedures so that in our enthusiasm to proceed we do not overlook important developmental steps. We ask you to be sincere in your efforts on our behalf, because with your confidence we will grow in confidence. We ask for two things to occur: 1. That a Ministry for Children and Youth Affairs be created; 2. That the concept of a Children's National Council become a reality with your approval and support. Today's children will be tomorrow's adults, and with your help they will be independent, informed, committed and united, making this country and the world a better place. The conference had two main goals: firstly, to have the ideas and concerns of children included in the adult Australian plan of action, and in the response to the World Summit for Children declaration-which promises a better life for children by the year 2000-and, secondly, to create a channel into the Commonwealth Government through which children can have an effective voice in the decisions that affect their daily lives. These aims were encapsulated in two documents entitled 'Recommendations for Tomorrow' and 'Target for Tomorrow'. Both of those documents were written by conference members and were presented in Parliament House by the participants. The 'Recommendations for Tomorrow' document was the culmination of over 3,000 opinions on concerns, issues and possible solutions from Australian children. These opinions were collected by the conference participants, prior to them coming together and, as such, represented the thoughts of a very broad cross-section of Australian children. The conference members hoped to have this document included as part of the means of implementing the World Summit for Children: Declaration for the Survival, Protection and attend Development of Children. The document addressed all issues and topics which were suggested in the plan of action for implementing the declaration. Primarily, the document listed the concerns of Australia's children and youth, and sought to remind the interdepartmental committee-the group responsible for monitoring and implementing the declaration-that children comprise a quarter of Australia's population and that the implementation of such plans would have a direct bearing on their daily lives. The conference participants spent much time discussing and formulating a proposal called 'Target for Tomorrow' which embodies the plan for a children's national council. This council will become the link between the children and the Government. It will be the bridge across which each group could walk to unite their efforts and ideas to make that brighter future a reality. The council would provide a voice for the children, an avenue for input, and a focus where children could become respected and valued members of society. It is envisaged that the council would operate on four different levels-comml,lnity, district, State and Federal. The council would operate on a nationwide basis, with each State and Territory incorporating a separate branch of the council. The community level would operate utilising the basic idea of a complaints mechanism. The CNC members would aim their channel at each and every member of the comm).lnity under the legal voting age of 18. They would particularly plan to focus on the disadvantaged, the homeless, and the disabled to give them a voice and to give them hope. The children's national council would operate on the basic premise that all children should have the right and the opportunity to voice issues of concern, and that these words would be heard. The difficulty in assessing information to disadvantaged groups has led to the plan to establish a network of communications. This would target youth shelters and other such residential care places within the general community. The children have created a logo, which they hope, in time, would become synonymous with the children's national council and readily identifiable as a voice Australia's children. There are obvious opportunities here for advertising, and that would serve to raise the profile of the community based operations of the children's national council. There would be children's national council representatives present in every school, youth group, refuge, and any other location where there is a regular gathering of children. At this level, the CNC representatives would be a direct channel from the children in their areas to next step. Representatives at the district level would be chosen from school and community groups. The district could be based on the electoral subdivisions, with several members representing each subdivision. They would deal with issues emanating from the community level. There would also be cooperation at local and municipal levels. It is envisaged that there would be considerable liaison with local members of parliament. This would further augment the communications network. For every subdivision, there would be a representative of the CNC. The distinct advantage of this is quite apparent; MPs would have first-hand knowledge of the concern of younger members of their constituencies. The State representatives would consist mainly of the partnership for the future participants. The aim of this level would be to deal with and oversee the complaints mechanism and the communication network, and to ensure that there is a highly visible State presence of children. They would deal with these issues by responding to suggestions, collating information from district representatives, researching and assessing the viability of possible solutions and reporting to the general CNC body. It would assemble every six months in various parts of Australia. Part of the State agenda would include lobbying within the Government. This would mean presenting appropriate suggestions and concerns that children voice to State Government. It would also mean coordinating and encouraging delegates to put forward information to local for councils. In short, they would be responsible for the implementation of the children's national council policy, and for maintaining open links and direct communication between the CNC and State governments. One of the most important tasks for this group will be to coordinate awareness programs and to ensure that information is readily available to all children. At a Federal level the children's national the council would meet annually in different capital cities, but more frequent meetings would be needs based. The group would discuss, collate, recommend action and report to issues put forward by the council members under the national report. The partnership for the future conference participants would comprise the majority of the original CNC body, and the CNC would work as partners with the Minister for children and youth, who would be· requested to introduce CNC recommendations to the Parliament, keep CNC members informed about legislation affecting children's rights, and monitor all development concerning the World Summit for Children: Declaration for the Survival, Protection and Development of Children. The children conclude: If the C.N.C. is to become part of the consultative system, then power and the ability to make their decisions must be given to the children. The C.N.C. in its efforts to be independent, propose to handle their own funds . .. Official recognition as a national council would be imperative. Then the C.N.C. could be the representative of every child in Australia. The concept of the C.N.C. was created with this aim in mind-to create a permanent link with the Government, through which views and opinions could be transmitted, listened to and hopefully, acted upon. The C.N.C. would represent one quarter of Australia's populationa group currently under-resourced, undervalued and under-representeda group who have, at this time, no voice in the decisions which will affect their future. We simply ask to have a say, to be heard. We ask that you utilise this nation's finest resource, YOUR CHILDREN. As one would expect, the aims of these young Australians are bold and enthusiastic, but they ask that the parliamentarians of this nation listen to them; that they be valued and allowed to participate in their own future. I commend to the House the general thrust of the issues they have raised. Catpix and Pixelgram Technology",55
75,Mr BRADFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I grieve for the so-called clever country. In the House earlier this morning I noticed that there was some discussion on the Australian $5 bill. The plastic $10 note issued by the Reserve Bank some time ago may have seemed clever but, behind the calm picture of Captain Cook, there is a veritable stonn going on. The $10 note was based on technology developed by Dr Robert Lee of the CSIRO Division of Materials, Science and Technology. This technology is known as Catpix I. The Reserve Bank of Australia purchased the rights to the Catpix I technology package from the CSIRO for around $9m. The inherent value of this property was that it allowed the development of forgery-proof bank notes and other such products. Subsequently, some weaknesses became evident in this Catpix I technology. There also seems to be some doubt whether the Reserve Bank actually lodged an application in time for a patent to protect its investment in this technology. Despite this, the Reserve Bank of Australia sold the Government of Singapore the right to use the technology on its $50 note. In doing this, it seems to me that the Reserve Bank misrepresented its ownership of the technology. However, this is only the beginning of the story. While this was going on, Dr Lee at the CSIRO continued his work, and by early 1990 he had succeeded in developing Catpix II technology. This time he had hit the jackpot. This latest Pixel gram technology would indeed meet the needs of the security printing industry. It cannot be forged. It is simply the world's best technology available for this purpose and it has been developed right here in Australia. This apparently created quite a dilemma for the Reserve Bank of Australia. When approached by the CSIRO with the perfected Catpix II technology, the Reserve Bank of Australia indicated that it was not interested. The Reserve Bank declined to become involved. In June 1990 a meeting apparently took place between Messrs Stocker and Lynch of the CSIRO, the Deputy Governor of the  the manager of the note printing branch of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Bob Larkin. At this meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia allegedly suggested to the CSIRO that it should suppress Catpix II so that it did not compete with the inferior and inadequate Catpix I technology which the Reserve Bank had purchased and ownership of which it had failed to safeguard. Having received this information from the Reserve Bank, the CSIRO went out into the marketplace to find a partner to enter a joint venture to commercia lise the Catpix II technology. The CSIRO eventually entered into an arrangement with a Gold Coast-based company called Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd. Charter Pacific, in view of this arrangement which had been offered to it by the CSIRO, entered into a number of other arrangements on the basis of its understanding-a reasonable understanding in the circumstances-that the CSIRO was the owner of the Pixelgram. In January 1992, a dispute arose between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the CSIRO as to the ownership of the Catpix II technology. Apparently by this time the Reserve Bank realised how valuable this property was and that it had made a very serious mistake. The results of this dispute are unfortunate: that is something of an understatement. While this dispute has gone on now for many months, there has been loss of income dollars to Australia from valuable technology developed in Australia. This is not the first time that something developed in this country has been lost overseas or not processed in time. We have lost money, we have lost job opportunities for Australians, and we have lost valuable time in the exploitation of a worldwide leading edge technology. We have seen financial hardship created for a small Australian public company and its directors, who have acted in good faith in attempting to play a role in making Australia the clever country. We have seen, perhaps more importantly than all of the previous points, what now amounts to worldwide ridicule of two of Australia's pre-eminent bodies, the CSIRO and the Reserve Bank of Australia, who are fighting over this. As an adjunct, we are seeing disillusionment in Australia-in fact, worldwide-with respect to Australia's ability tl? get its act together. Charter Pacific entered into a number of arrangements to secure finance for the purchase of what is called an E beam writing machine. However, these arrangements have floundered because of the dispute. I believe, and I have given careful consideration to the facts placed before me by all the parties, the Reserve Bank of Australia made a number of misrepresentations to Charter's business colleagues. Apparently, the Reserve Bank has held itself out as having a legal interest in Pixelgram. It indicated that the Reserve Bank and the CSIRO were in dispute over Pixel gram and that the Reserve Bank would, if necessary, restrain the CSIRO from commercially exploiting Pixelgram. Finally, it indicated-and we are talking here about dealings with potential partners of Charter Pacific-that the Reserve Bank wanted CSIRO to suppress Pixelgram so that it did not compete with Catpix I, which was the technology the RBA had actually purchased and which was shown subsequently to be defective. Naturally it is impossible for this small Gold Coast based company to proceed until the dispute is resolved. It has been forced to take legal action in the Federal Court against the Reserve Bank and the CSIRO under section 75B of the Trade Practices Act. Obviously, it is a David and Goliath struggle. No doubt the Reserve Bank of Australia and the CSIRO hoped Charter Pacific would give up and go away. But why should it? It believes that the CSIRO and the Reserve Bank of Australia have conspired to squeeze it out of the Pixelgram technology commercialisation. Where does this leave the clever country? Frankly, not looking too clever at all. Here is technology calculated by the CSIRO to be worth half a billion dollars in export earnings for Australia. As Pierpont observed in his column in the Bulletin on 8 September 1992: Canberra-which is so good at preachffig efficiency to Australian businessmen-has so far been unableperhaps I should intersperse there 'unwilling'to sort this . . . out. It is better to let the taxpayer pay than for the Government to make decisions. Judge Lee, in the Federal Court, recently instructed the parties to negotiate to resolve their differences. I hope that when they appear again in the Federal Court in Brisbane tomorrow there will have been some progress-I hope that there that has been progress in this matter, for Australia's sake. If we are to become the clever country, surely it is up to the Government to set a good example. Here we have two government instrumentalities fighting over something and acting against the interests of a private Australian companyone of my constituent companies-to prevent them from getting on with the job that they reckon they are entitled to do. Today, I have placed on notice on this subject 13 questions of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). I look forward to his answers but, more importantly, I hope that either he or the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), both of whom are fully aware of the circumstances surrounding this case, will intervene to resolve the problem before it goes any further. Victorian Government",58
76,Mr JENKINS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I grieve for the State of Victoria. In particular, I grieve for the way in which the Victorian Government has embarked upon a policy of exclusion in the methods by which it has been implementing many of the changes that it has decided to carry out. I am not going to enter into the· debate about what needs to be done in Victoria. That is a legitimate debate. It is a debate that should occur and it is a debate that is recognised by many Victorians, including, might I say, the present State Opposition. But, clearly, the methodology that is being used by the Victorian Government is causing a great deal of fear and concern. It was interesting to note the comments made in the·Anglican newspaper Church Scene which described Mr Kennett's approach as being ham-fisted. It went on to say that Mr Kennett's form of government had polarised the State instead of encouraging constructive thought. It is encouraging, constructive thought that is required. My concern is with the Kennett Government's total disregard for institutions such as local government and parliament itself. I am also concerned at its refusal to consult with the wider community. In relation to Victoria, a lot has been said about mandates. The Macquarie Dictionary defines mandate as an instruction or permission from the electorate for a certain policy. The inescapable conclusion is that the electorate will know what the certain policy is. Under this definition, it cannot be reasonably argued that Mr Kennett has a mandate for the social and industrial carnage that he has brought on Victoria. Which of the policies can he claim a mandate for? I do not recall that during the election campaign there was any mention of a Thatcher style poll tax-a pernicious rate levy that takes no account of a person's capacity or ability to pay. I do remember that Mr Kennett told voters that no worker would be worse off under his industrial relations policies; even he acknowledges that that is not the case. How then can the Victorian Government talk of a mandate for its policies? It has no mandate. It simply has the numbers. The way in which it has put the changes through the short parliamentary. session indicates the contempt that it has for the parliamentary process. Bill after Bill was forced through the Parliament without proper debate. Of the 38 Bills introduced in a three-week session, 25 were declared urgent and put through the processes with less than two hours of debate. These were not just small pieces of legislation, they were major pieces of legislation that went to the heart of a number of fundamental rights. For instance, it included industrial relations legislation where people's fundamental industrial rights and conditions were eroded. This contempt for the democratic process was not only evident in the introduction of draconian nineteenth century industrial relations policies, but it was also evident in the way that the Government treated local government. In relation to the poll tax, councils have been told, and I repeat, told, 'Here is this new tax and you collect it'. There was no consultation, there was just a piece of legislation that ensured that the State's position was tightly protected at the expense of council. The piece of legislation meant that, in any case where an individual decides to protest by not paying the so-called levy, it is the council that has to bear the cost. The legislation is framed in such a way that the first $100 of any moneys received by the council is deducted for the levy and not for the rate collections that the municipalities are collecting for themselves. A number of school closures have been announced and have been well and truly implemented, again, without any consultation before or since. As I said in the Appropriation debate last month, there was no recognition in these decisions of the impact on students' educational opportunities, and no recognition of the impact that the closure of these schools would have on the resources of surrounding schools, surrounding schools that all suffered reductions in staffmg numbers. Also, there was no recognition of the wider community use that has been made of school facilities. There was no thought given to compensation for these groups. \yith the one month's notice that was given, these groups were left with few options. For instance, at Keon Park Secondary College there is a wideranging list of community groups which use its facilities. It is used by Italian pensioners' bocce club, by self-defence karate groups, by various dance groups, and by local basketball and cricket clubs. At no time was there any recognition given of the use that the wider community has made of the facilities that are at the school and are being used. Since the announcement of the closure, the school council, on behalf of the wider school community, has been endeavouring to meet with the Victorian Minister to discuss for the first time the future of the school. It is a vain but valiant attempt. In yesterday 's Herald-Sun, on behalf of the school council, Mrs Yvonne Arnall had a number of things to say about the decision. She indicated that the school has recently undergone a facelift where $lm was used to upgrade the facilities. One of the reasons why certain schools have been earmarked for closure is that certain schools need funds that are not available for their upgrading. At Keon Park, Mrs Arnall would contend that that is not the case. She went on to say: As a school that is more than up to standard, even by Mr Hayward's measure, and one that offered the second-best VCE in the State jointly with Merrilands Secondary College (38 out of the 44 units) with a success rate of 92 per cent, hard-pressed to understand why we are to .be closed. She indicated that there would be the need for 10 well-equipped and well-maintained technology studies rooms to be transferred to only one woodwork room at Merrilands Secondary College. Mrs Arnall posed this question: What is this Government thinking of? This is not the type of ""economical"" measure recession-stricken state needs. The Government hasn't done the homework and that's why it won't enter into discussions with us. We don't fulfil any of Mr Hayward's criteria for closure. His decision makes no economic, educational or excu-ble sense! Finally, I am told that the school was granted a delegation yesterday, not with the Minister, but with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, Stephen Elder. Less than 24 hours after that deputation, while this debate is being conducted in this chamber, workers are demolishing Keon Park Secondary College, a school that less than five weeks· ago could have contemplated going into 1993 as a continuing secondary college in Victoria. This is an act of sheer vandalism and political vengeance. Jeff Kennett has no mandate to implement policies of this sort. It is no accident that the present-but for how long?-beleaguered leader of Her Majesty's Federal Opposition has now belatedly decided that he should feign a preference for listening to people. Australians out;>ide Victoria have been given a window into the future. They can recall what coalition governments are all about: they are governments that seek to entrench privilege; that govern on behalf of part of the community; and that act without consultation. This is the politics of exclusion. (TIme expired) Department of Employment, Education and Training",59
77,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Over recent years, I have on a number of occasions raised serious matters concerning allegations of maladministration within the Federal Department of Employment, Education and Training. At the present time, I have many questions on the Notice Paper relating to we are possible impropriety in the running of the Department, none of which has yet been answered by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), and some of which have been there since last May. It is therefore with interest that I note that the Secretary to the Department, Mr G.P. Taylor, in a minute of 29 October this year, this has notified departmental staff of the establishment of a fraud prevention unit within DEET. The minute of Mr Taylor reads: In DEET, we rightly pride ourselves on our commitment and service to clients, on our ability to deliver important economic and social policies and programs, and on the gains that we have achieved across the labour market and our education and training systems. Further on, the minute says: Our record is sullied by a small minority amongst us who defraud the system, or who do not care, who deliberately avoid systems standards and security controls, who condone slack internal monitoring or who otherwise refuse to recognise their responsibilities. There is no room in DEET for these practices, or for the people involved. Recently crimirtal charges have been laid against some officers of the department. Other investigations are currently under way. We have now established within DEET a fraud prevention unit (FPU), which will be headed by Mr Andre Kaspura, and which will operate in every state. The minute later states: We will be pursuing all cases of fraud with the full force of the Public Service Act, and, as appropriate, the courts. We will likewise be pursuing all future cases of irregular or circumvented procedures. This is all very commendable-although the fraud prevention unit is being established for some rather disconcerting reasons-and, no doubt, the Minister and the Secretary are feeling very pleased about the initiative taken. Unfortunately, the initiative looks a little less enlightened, when one looks at the senior executive officer appointed to head the outposted fraud prevention unit in Victoria. Mr Barry Hogan was appointed by transfer on 7 December last, strangely at ""about the same time as the very vacancy to which he was appointed was advertised in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. Mr Hogan was previously manager of the overseas student section in Victoria, and was classified, as an excess officer when the OSS moved to Canberra. In his capacity as head of the OSS, Mr Hogan kept personal records on three members of his staff, without their authority. One of these members, a Mr Joseph Chetcuti, sought his 'secret file' under the Freedom of Information Act. This lead to Mr Hogan denying, in a minute of 15 February 1991, the existence of any such documents. He said: Mr Chetcuti's statement that I kept a 'secret file' on him is both offensive and untrue. I do not keep 'secret files' on Mr Chetcuti or any other member of my staff. It is interesting that Mr Hogan was later forced to retract this statement in an affidavit before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In addition, Mr Hogan misled the Melbourne Age in an article, by Mr John Masanauskas of 30 October 1990, entitled 'Truant students breached their visa'. In the article, Mr Hogan was quoted as saying that there was no evidence of malpractice in the eight institutions examined by DEET at that point that took overseas students. The article read: More than 200 overseas students this year had been identified as having unsatisfactory class attendance and were liable for detention. In fact, the Department was already examining malpractice, such as the 'apparent lack of reporting' by the Academy of English. Moreover, one of two departmental teams alone had 375 terminations of students' status at the time. A letter of 3 July 1991 from Ms Margaret Flynn, Executive Officer, Personnel Management, to the State Director, Mr J.D. Davidson, also clearly shows that Mr Hogan did not honestly deal with a freedom of information request from Mr Masanauskas concerning malpractice involving overseas students and did not properly identify all relevant documents held about this matter. In another incident, a staff member reported abuses to the Medical Board of Victoria by a doctor who was issuing certificates for nonattendance for Chinese students. This officer, for his trouble, was victimised by Mr Hogan. A subsequent inquiry found on 31 March 1992 that the doctor, Dr Woi Chong Chen; had acted unprofessionally. Incredibly, Mr Hogan set out to prevent the officer from appearing before the Medical Board of Victoria to which the officer provided important evidence. This extraordinary litany of events involving Mr Hogan continues further. On 28 May 1991, Mr Hogan advised the DEET State Director in Victoria, in writing, to write off overseas student charge debts of a very substantial nature. The minute pertaining to this reads: I should point out in each case the amount outstanding is in fact a charge imposed on overseas students studying in Australia, i.e., the moneys have not been paid to the student by the Commonwealth as for other study allowance schemes. The charge is levied on the student for each year of study undertaken in Australia. The charge varies depending on the course and the year of study undertaken. Mr Hogan then concluded: Your signature at the top of each of the 10 schedules is sufficient to approve all cases on the schedules, i.e., 218 cases totalling $703,366.39. This write-off of debts by the State Director was unlawful, due to the wrong advice given by Mr Hogan when he was fully aware of his responsibilities in this regard. The purpose so doing-this is the real significance of the matter-was to avoid reporting to central office where write-offs should have occurred. Furthermore, on this same matter of debt write-off, a $6,471 debt, owed by Ms N.N. Liu for 1989, was incorrectly shown on the write-off as two separate debts. Mr Hogan also allowed two senior DEET staff members, Ms Frances Ewe and Mr Stephen Fitzpatrick, to seriously abuse overtime arrangements at a time when the overseas student program was being wound up and, in fact, many Chinese students had stopped studying. The overtime sheets for February, March and April of 1991 amply show the extensive scope of the abuse. Mr Hogan, incidentally, had previously worked hard to ensure Frances Ewe was trartsferred from Austudy. It was interesting to note that a grievance by a staff member who had reported abuses and had been denied the opportunity to act on higher duties was subsequently upheld against Mr Hogan. One other small matter about Mr Hogan is worth putting on the record. In December 1990, Mr Hogan sought a cash advance of $500 for an end-of-year overseas ,students office function. The State' Director considered this amount excessive and reduced it to $100. On any measure, Mr Hogan appears to have had a most peculiar record, but over recent years it is dotted with the most disturbing incidents. Such a record would be most unsatisfactory for any. public servant at - y level, but for the senior executive officer in charge of the outposted fraud prevention unit in Victoria, it is, to say the least, somewhat alarming. With respect, I would suggest to the Minister and the Secretary that, if their wellarrangement. intentioned fraud prevention arrangements in DEET-and I do not dispute the' need for them-are not to fail, they need to again look closely at the appointment of Mr Hogan to this particular post. In substantiation of the points I have made throughout this grievance speech, I seek leave to table a number of very in relevant documents on this matter. Leave not granted. Roads",61
78,Mr NEWELL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise this afternoon to express my feelings about the progress of funding for the Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway, as all honourable members will be aware, is a major road between Sydney and Brisbane. It is a road that carries an enormous amount of traffic. The Pacific Highway has received a great deal of publicity in the last three or four years, and quite rightly so, as a number of very tragic accidents, involving a large number of lives, have occurred on the highway. Those types of things seem to attract a large amount of publicity and it is for that reason that I feel I have to raise the matter of funding for the Pacific Highway with the House. I can vividly recall that during the last two election campaigns the issue of funding for the Pacific Highway was very much to the fore in the minds of coalition members and members of the Labor Government. With the assistance of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), my colleague the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and I did a great deal of the legwork to ensure that Federal funds did come across for the Pacific Highway. It is not directly a Federal Government responsibility. The New England Highway was reallocated as the national highway some years ago under very spurious circumstances, I feel. The Pacific Highway is not a Federal Government responsibility but because of the nature of the road, and because of the traffic that it carries, the Federal Government has seen fit to put funds into this particular road. The Federal Government, with the full agreement and cooperation of the State Government, has come to a creditable funding It is to be put in place over a number of years. With that signed agreement between the State Government and the Federal Government, real progress was being made on. upgrading the Pacific Highway. At this stage, it is a two-lane highway very much following the old route down towards the ferries that went across some of those marvellous rivers. Some honourable members may recall that. I do not recall going across the ferries, but I know that it was not so long ago that they were taken out and replaced with bridges. The highway runs along a very picturesque section of the east coast. It carries a lot of tourist traffic, heavy freight traffic and buses. In the past 20 or 30 years the traffic on that road has increased enormously, and that has led to a much larger number of accidents. When it comes down to the cold hard facts those are the tragedies that occur as the volume of traffic increases. The number of calls to ambulance stations, police stations and other areas increases as well. The insurance companies would know all about that. The funding agreement with the State Government put in place in the last 18 months to two years has been breached in a most insincere way, and without any consultation with the Federal Government. The Minister knows the highway well from undertaking a tour some time ago from Hexham right up to Brisbane-I think it was in July 1990. He certainly learnt a lot and took on board some of the concerns of the local governments, the Government and the Opposition with regard to the improvements that need to be made, some of which, unfortunately, have been put at risk. In the One Nation statement in February the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that some funds from that area and two particular projects were to be brought forward. I am talking about the bypass at Brunswick Heads, a small town in my electorate, and also a deviation around Raleigh. The one at Raleigh, was particularly vital because it was bypassipg a very serious black spot region. The one at Brunswick Heads is a similar situation. I understand that the cost-benefit ratio on the one at Brunswick Heads was astronomical, in terms of spending a few million dollars on a bypass. The flow-on effect in the town was something like six or seven times any of the other cost-benefit ratios of any of the other projects that were on the board at that time. The other benefit to Brunswick Heads was the safety aspect, because the Pacific Highway, at this stage, actually divides the town in two, so that residents on the western side of the present highway have a great deal of difficulty getting across to the east towards the amenities, not to mention the recreational amenities of the river and the ocean. The tour that the Minister undertook revealed a number of things, including black spots. All were very quickly attended to by the Minister, and I compliment him, the Government and the Cabinet for being able to put those funds forward to assist in the Pacific Highway upgrading. There is no doubt that the movement towards a dual carriageway was progressing at a steady rate, but it was through a funding agreement with the State Government that it was going to be achieved. The grievance that I have is that, while that funding agreement may be still in place, a number of the projects which the Federal Government saw fit to bring forward, namely, the Brunswick Heads bypass and the Raleigh deviation,:have all been put on hold, and they have been put on hold for the simple reason that the State Minister, Mr Wal Murray, the Minister for Roads in that State, has come up with this particular notion from somewhere that there needs to be a tollway along that section of the coast as the only way to actually get an upgraded and increased standard of roads. Mr Murray did not consult at all with the Federal Government on this, despite the fact that we had a funding agreement to upgrade the road over a number of years and to see that some of the more notorious sections of that road were improved. At the whim of Mr Murray that was all thrown out, and, also at .the whim of the State Government, that agreement was put in jeopardy and put on hold until they come up with some other package or gimmick somewhere down the track. What particularly concerns me is that at the last two Federal elections, at least, the coalition candidates on the coast have made a great deal of running out of the amount of Federal funds which have gone into the highway. They have gone strangely silent in the last few months, and I challenge them to put back on the record the funding of the Pacific Highway and make it an election issue as they did in 1987 and 1990. I challenge them to make an election issue of the funding of the Pacific Highway and of the coalition's role in that aspect of a very needed public infrastructure which appears to have gone by the board. I compliment the Minister, because I know he was as disgusted as I was when he heard the news but also because he has agreed that the funds will not be diverted anywhere else but will be kept on hold until the State Government comes to its senses and these particular projects can go ahead. I mentioned the degree of political running that was made out of the Pacific Highway in 1987 and 1990, particularly by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr NeW). I would not mind hearing a little more from him now on how he feels about the State Government, his colleagues in the Liberal-National Party coalition, pulling the plug on these particular projects. I wish that he would lend his weight to the argument that the projects have to go ahead. After all, he did make a great deal of running on the issue of the Pacific Highway funding in 1990 and through 1991. I will join him in lending weight to the arguments to go to the State Government to ensure that it gives these projects the go-ahead that they deserve. After all he agreed with me that both the Raleigh deviation and the Brunswick Heads bypass are very necessary, mainly on safety issues, not to mention the cost-benefit ratios. While I have the chance, I· also pay a compliment to the honourable member for Page and the Minister for Land Transport for their work in getting an upgrading of a road known as the Summerland Way, which is not in my electorate but has an impact on my electorate in terms of the funnelling-in of traffic. That road is also a tourist road and will be upgraded in conjunction with the Kyogle-Murwillumbah road, into which the Federal Government has been able to put $1m for very necessary upgrading of local infrastructure. This will have benefits for the area of Uki, Kyogle and Nimbin in my electorate for many years to come. (Time expired) Sugar Industry",63
79,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am probably making my last address in this House in the thirty-sixth Parliament. In the seven parliaments in which I have represented the division of Dawson in this place, I have certainly been one who has been very interested in the mainstay of that electorate, the sugar industry. Before I discuss what I believe are the problems of that industry, I would like to pay a tribute to those farmers, the workers on those farms, the families of those farmers, the people who are the millers, the management and the mill workers, and the researchers and scientists, the marketers and the people who run the services and associated businesses, which have a part to play within the sugar industry because they have maintained it. The number of people who derive a living directly or indirectly from it must be in the hundreds of thousands. Since Federation, sugar has been the stabilising economic and social influence of Queensland, particularly along the coast from the border to Mossman. At this particular time the price of sugar is diminishing further. This week the price of sugar has dropped to US8.4c a pound. Five years ago I can recall that in a Senate committee representations were made that suggested that the break-even price for the sugar industry to survive was lOc. So at the moment we are 1.6c a pound less than what was then the break-even point. I also want to mention the costs that are now associated with the sugar industry and probably with all industries. I was interested in a figure that was given recently that suggests that 21 per cent of all business costs in Australia are State, Federal or local government charges. The sugar industry bears a large proportion of those costs; perhaps not it 21 per cent but very close to it. I also acknOWledge that in today's climate the sugar industry, particularly in Queensland, has a very close association with the AWU and has recently struck an agreement to have oneunion representation in the industry within the farming sector. I believe there are concessions bound into that agreement. But even this season the threat of compulsory unionism saw some farmers' cane being almost black banned, which again adds to the costs of the industry. So, while there is a favourable labour market, it could be improved a lot to relieve the costs on farmers. The types of government charges that we have seen in the last few years have been such things as the fringe benefits tax and the superannuation guarantee levy, and substantial road user, electricity and water charges been introduced by the Queensland have Government. r will give an example of the substantial road user charge. Five years r renewed my drivers licence at $10; just recently r renewed it at the price of $47. That is a 470 per cent increase in that road user charge. These types of charges are affecting not only me but the whole industry. As mentioned before, there is also the diminishing world price. Going back in the history of the sugar industry, it was recognised at Federation in 190 1 that a condition of Queensland's was entry was an embargo on sugar. This remained until 1988 and in the last three years sugar has suffered a halving of the tariff which was then introduced from $115 a tonne to the current amount of $55 a tonne. In that three-year period further deregulation has taken place right across the industry to make it more efficient than it was. Yet the usual inefficiencies that are associated with tariffs and the protection of an industry are not evident in the sugar trade. The sugar industry has coped with the of the favoured Great Britain-Commonwealth trade of the 1960s. It has also coped with diminution of trade to the United States sector in the 1980s. Mechanisation was throughout the industry. New products were introduced. Value was added. Bulk loading the ports was introduced. Research and tariff experimentation have basically been underreform, taken for the benefit of the industry. Throughout the world, the sugar industry Queensland, Australia, is regarded as the efficient producer. r am distressed by what has happened in the last decade or so, and what is continuing to happen to an industry which is the mainstay not only of the as economy but also the social fabric of the Queensland coast. Weather is another factor. Over the last three years we have had unusual drought patterns. r have been to farms and at shed meetings where people have said that family inheritances from three generations have been spent just on surviving. r have seen situations which are absolutely appalling, with women have and children taking the place of men who been discharged from the farm because the farmers could not afford to pay them to ago work on the farm, while people who are unemployed sit vacantly on the sideline. r have seen crops missed for two seasons. That loss amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars. In that time, r have seen the inr come support from RAS become almost non-existent as RAS and DSS fight about where income security should be. In that time, fewer drought provisions have been provided. In fact, the last major water resources supplied back in Queensland were the Burdekin Dam, which the initiative of our last Federal coalition Government, and the Proserpine Dam, which was the initiative of the State Government. The Industry Commission report, which was issued earlier this year, was flawed badly in one area. While the report itself recognised the need for micro-economic reform, it then proceeded to recommend that tariffs should be zeroed by the year 1996-97, irrespective of the fact that those reforms had not taken place. The real problem is that in Canberra the economists who prepared that report and loss made those recommendations were not prepared to look at the major costs that are the instrumental in farmers' costs-that 21 per cent against business which r mentioned-and introduced they do nothing about it. So the Commission was prepared, within at that report, to recommend the loss of that within that time with no labour market no transport reform, no waterfront reform, and no tax reform, while maintaining in government penalties, but taking away the most benefits. The necessity of waterfront and transport reform is borne out by the fact that by we can import sugar from Thailand at the same price, so far as shipping is concerned, the coastal trade shipment from one port to another. None of those reform measures was obvious. I do believe there is an argument on sugar, which separates the sugar industry from other industries. The main one is the corrupted market that Australian industry must compete against, particularly in the European Community, the United States of America and Thailand. At today's price of US8.4c a pound, with the exchange rate of US68.5c for our dollar, these are basically the types of subsidies we are facing across the world .. The $55 tariff is the benefit Australia receives for its domestic price over the world price. Thailand has a $277 per tonne subsidy, which is 147 per cent above world price; the European Community has a $716 subsidy, or 258 per cent above world price; and the US has a $451 subsidy at 162 per cent above world price. They are the types of subsidies we have to compete with. Irrespective of what people might say, the influence of those subsidies on Australia is severe because while Thailand receives a subsidy of 35 per cent on its domestic production, and the rest is export, Australia produc20 per cent for domestic consumption and 80 per cent for the world trade. That means that the effective subsidy available for domestic production is not as available for Australia as it is for those other countries. I believe that this means a need for some retention of a subsidy. I have monitored the sugar task force committee and I am very interested in its recommendations. I believe it was faulty from the outset because there was no State Minister or parliamentary representative there, but I will wait and see what the recommendations are. I want to restate my situation. I have objected to the unilateral decree-(lIme expired) Atkinson, Mrs Sallyanne",65
80,Mr LAVARCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Fisher) (1.41 p.m.)Honourable members might recall that last month I sought to bring the House up to date with the movements of the former Brisbane Lord Mayor, and now Federal parliamentary aspirant, Mrs Sallyanne Atkinson. The overwhelming requests that I have received for .more information on that matter have encouraged me to return to this subject and for tariffs discuss it at greater length. Honourable members will recall that Mrs Atkinson was the high profile Lord Mayor of the city of Brisbane who was defeated at the last Council election. Her defeat came as somewhat of a surprise, given her extremely high profile, but the conventional wisdom explaining why she was defeated was that she was perceived increasingly as being slightly arrogant, out of touch, and enjoying a lifestyle which was somewhat out of step with the lifestyles of a lot of voters who may have been experiencing some difficulties and some uncertainties. Nonetheless, Mrs Atkinson was defeated and became much humbler-understandably so-by the experience. Obviously, anyone would do so as a result. Nonetheless, there was an enormous amount of specUlation as to where Mrs Atkinson's path would lead her. To put people's minds at rest, she decided to hire a room at the Brisbane Sheraton Hotel and conduct press interviews to announce what her intentions would be. I took a fair bit of interest in this at the time because it had been widely speculated in the newspapers by pundits in the know that she was likely to become the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Dickson, a seat which was created in the Federal redistribution. Since I was nominating for the Labor Party for Dickson, it was of some interest to me in this regard. However, my mind was put at rest because as a result of these interviews it was announced, as in that famous line of a former American Vice President, 'You won't have Nixon to kick around any more', that we would not have Saliyanne to kick around any more and that public life would have to survive without her. Lo and behold, some 18 months later, and in a Nixon-like recovery, Mrs Atkinson reappeared as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Rankin. People would be surprised that in emerging from this sort of chrysalis Mrs Atkinson was not reborn as a beautiful butterfly, as happens in most metamorphoses, but rather came out as something rather more dowdy. In fact, her first public appearance was in the suburb of Inala, in the city of Brisbane, dressed in a tracksuit. Honourable members might be somewhat surprised because she had been rather well known for her sartorial elegance and was dubbed 'Salaryanne' and other unkind terms. It was rather strange that she would appear in a tracksuit. Honourable members may not know that the suburb of Inala is probably one of the most working class in the area of Brisbane and so maybe it is not that surprising after all. But she has gone on from that to push this new approach. I mentioned last week the statements at the Boonah golf club where she was musing about the seating hierarchies in aeroplanes and saying, 'Isn't it strange how trade union officials are always up the front while ordinary people like us are always down the back?'. Of course, in some 37 domestic and 15 international trips she undertook as Lord Mayor, never once did she grace the back of an airline.",67
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! It being 1.45 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106, the debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Electoral Boundaries",68
82,Mrs SULLIVAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"One year ago the Queensland Federal Redistribution Commission finalised the electorate boundaries which will apply in that State as from the next Federal election. The changes were quite radical, particularly since an additional electorate, Dickson, had to be created. My own electorate of Moncrieff will lose 50,000 voters to the adjoining electorates of Fadden, Ford and Rankin. The present Labor member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) has since written to my constituents in the Beaudesert region telling them that he is now their parliamentary representative. This is nonsense. The new boundaries do not apply until the next election, otherwise the residents of Dickson would be unrepresented and therefore disenfranchised. I raise the subject today to tell the honourable member for Rankin and his staff to stop their obnoxious strategy of heavying people and organisations in Beaudesert with demands made on the basis that he is now their MP. I am not going to abandon part of my electorate, as he did in 1984, and certainly not because he is trying to muscle in on it. I say to the honourable member, 'Butt out, Beddall, and stop being so obnoxious'. Tariffs: Amusement Rides",68
83,Mr LEE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"A constituent of mine, Brenton Pavier, operates a carnival at The Entrance during summer and moves between Cairns and Perth for the remainder of the  swinging ship ride called a Corsair, which is small enough to be transported on a single trailer. He applied to Customs for an exemption from tariffs as no Australian company has the rights to construct this 220degree swinging ship or its equivalent. Tariff concessions have been gazetted in the past when imported amusement rides cannot be made in Australia. It has come to my attention that a company named Hyfab Hydraulics and Construction has objected to this application and incorrectly advised Customs that it can manufacture the  Hyfab demanded 'a $10,000 up-front payment in lieu of profit for the signing of the concession' and the right to carry out modifications on a cost-plus basis. Hyfab sought to stop Mr Pavier importing the new ride unless he paid them $10,000. I support the use of tariffs to protect Australian jobs, but in this case Hyfab has  by an outrageous manipulation of tariff concessions. I ask the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) to urgently investigate this case and initiate any possible action against Hyfab. I  today that, despite the activities of Hyfab, Customs has agreed to grant the tariff concession. I seek leave to table copies of the relevant documents. Leave granted. Child Abuse",68
84,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to support the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who on 15 October called for an investigation into the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services. The honourable member for Bennelong raised an horrific case of child abuse which was ventilated in the Australian newspaper on 6 April 1991 and on 9 May 1992. This case involved repeated beatings and sexual abuse of a child. Prejudice and bias were shown by officers of the New South Wales Departmem of Family and Community Services against the father when he made efforts to protect his child. Through the efforts of the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Bowen, a degree of justice was obtained in the Family Court in 1986 when custody of the child was awarded to the father. While the father realises that the great injustice and harm done to his son can never be corrected, he cannot accept that the attitudes and actions of the officers of the Department of Family and Community Services which made much of this possible should be allowed to continue. Authorities in New South Wales under both ALP and coalition administrations have so far ignored the father's repeated pleas for an inquiry. The New South Wales Ombudsman refuses to investigate, pleading lack of resources. It is a sickening story of prejudice, maladministration and character assassination and the truth must be uncovered. Civil Aviation Authority",69
85,Mr HOLLIS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Six months ago I stood in this place and, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, called for an inquiry into the letting of the contract for the Australian radar system. The Public Works Committee had serious reservations and Committee members' minds were not put at rest by the appearance of Dr Edwards before the Committee. Yesterday the report of the investigation was tabled in the Senate. It is a damning indictment of incompetence and misleading behaviour and I think that there can be only one result-that the two senior officials from the CAA, Mr Baldw)n and Dr Edwards, should resign immediately. They have been stood aside. I also call on the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the CAA board to resign. I am not calling on the whole board to resign, just the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman who are damned in this report. The most damning thing in this report is the attitude of Baldwin and Edwards, two New Zealanders I might add. They should be sent back to New Zealand posthaste. They have put the Australian air industry in great danger. They have put the travelling public of Australia in great danger. We have to replace the radar system over Australia. The inaction of Baldwin and Edwards before my Committee has delayed the replacement of the Australian radar system for at least 12 months and has caused great damage and danger to the Australian public. Sugar Industry",69
86,Mr MCLACHLAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On Country Hour today, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) took the extraordinary position of saying that his much vaunted report into the sugar .industry is not going to be released. Suddenly it has become an interim report and there is going to be some sort of final report. He says that the committee does not want it released. The real reason is that the committee cannot agree on its recommendations. Yesterday, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), the chairman of the task force, was reported in the Australian Financial Review, as having said, after the task force had met for the last time, that the tariffs should stay at $55. How is this draft report going to evolve magically from an interim report to a final report if the task force has already met for the last time? Perhaps the honourable member for Hinkler will write the report himself. He cannot write the report because he has just compromised himself by coming out with his own view, even though the task force itself has not been able to put out a public view and cannot agree on the recommendations. So the honourable member has compromised himself on the matter, even though the cosseted Courtice 'farce' force could not agree. Perhaps the Minister will now tell us whether he will reconvene the task force and who will be the new chairman, as the honourable member for Hinkler obviously cannot be. Or will the Minister simply rewrite the report himself? For all the information we have on it, he may as well do just that. Moruya: Medicare Office",69
87,Mr SNOW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the mid1980s, the town of Moruya lost its Medicare office to the nearby town of Narooma. The Narooma office is halfway between the Medicare offices at Batemans Bay and Bega. Moruya is less of a tourist town than Narooma. Narooma makes good use of its Medicare service, particularly in the summer. Its gain is Moruya's loss. Moruya needs to be considered again. I have a petition here for the perusal of honourable members. The petition was signed by 756 Australian citizens who just a few days ago put their names to a call to re-establish the Medicare office at Moruya. Narooma needs its Medicare office; so does Moruya. Moruya is a major centre for health services in the region. It has a hospital. It has a community based health team comprising seven general medical practitioners, two permanent specialists, one part time specialist and five visiting specialists-a total of 15 health workers. Local doctors bulkbill pensioners, sickness beneficiaries and the unemployed. Other patients need to have ready access to Medicare. Filling out and posting forms is not easy for retired people. I ask Medicare to either establish an office in Moruya or set up an agency. I have had discussions with Australia Post, and it would be prepared to consider Medicare agencies part of its provision of one-stop government shops for local citizens. Moruya needs a is Medicare office. Australian Securities Commission",70
88,Mr FORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Australian Securities Commission manual for field operations states: So how do you get past the very protective secretary/typist? This takes initiative and imagination. One method . . . is to serve the on that person. Experience has shown that service on a secretary or receptionist can make the executive who was overseas or unavailable through an important meeting available to accept the service of the notice. The words 'intimidation and terrorisation' should be substituted for 'initiative and imagination'. What initiative? What imagination? Should we serve a legal document on a hapless receptionist, someone who is quite obviously innocent, but who is very easy to intimidate and terrify? That is a great initiative, and great imagination! Should we threaten someone, who is absolutely innocent and totally unable to comply, with a $10,000 fine or six months in gaol? This is the stuff of inquisitions. It is not what the Parliament intended. If this is the basis on which investigations proceed, the ASC should be renamed the Australian Star Chamber. Its logo should be the twentieth century's most evocative symbol of fear and oppression, the swastika. Where is the presumption of innocence? Where is the common law right? I ask the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy): how many of these inquisitors start on women? Who is responsible for authorising such Gestapo tactics? Who allows these Rambos to victimise innocent women? These ASC people have the imagination of Hitler, the initiative of Goebbels and the compassion of Himmler. I demand a royal commission into the activities of the ASC bureaucrats in Melbourne. Australian Securities Commission Missing Persons",70
89,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The . honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) must be asking us to forget that Christopher as Skase and Laurie Connell actually did get involved in the activities that they did. That what it is about, correcting the register and serving documents properly, and the individuals I mentioned were part of it in those cases. People need to understand that. An issue that I wish to raise which is of great concern at this time of year is that many people go missing in Australia and the police, particularly the CIB squads, try to find notice whether they have been murdered or whether they have just gone missing. It is with great regret that 1I have to say that the secrecy provisions of the Social Security Act and the Privacy Act very often prevent the police from obtaining information about people who may well have gone missing or been murdered. There have been cases in Western Australia recently where people have apparently suicided and we have discovered later that the person has not died but in fact has still been alive. 1I have to say that the Privacy Act provisions and the secrecy provisions of the Social Security Act really do limit the possibility of the law enforcement officers doing their work properly. 1 think we have gone overboard in trying to engage in this so-called protection of people. It is excessive and we are finding at the moment that law enforcement officers are putting enormous efforts into trying to find people when the Social Security Department and the Health Insurance Commission could provide information to an authorised person on an authorised basis-not for free distribution but to an authorised person-that would enable the law enforcement authorities to very quickly track down whether someone is missing or whether they have come to some foul end. 1 really do think that the secrecy provisions and the Privacy Act do need examination in this respect. Television: Country Stations",70
90,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As the elected representative of a rural community, I am concerned at what appears to be the Government's determination to destroy independent country television stations. 1 refer to the Government's policy of enforced television aggregation, which had the aims of giving country people the same viewing choices as their city counterparts and increasing local production. In the electorate of Bendigo, aggregation has become yet another example of the Keating Government's failed policies, although the architect of this ill-conceived idea was the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson. The benefit of aggregation is that viewers can now watch three commercial television stations plus the ABC and SBS, but that is certainly the only area in which this policy has succeeded. Let me catalogue the havoc television aggregation has wrought on the once profitable stations in Victoria. During the last 12 months, more than 50 people have been retrenched as the three commercial television stations in the Bendigo region try to reel in their operating costs. They need to COl}tain their costs because the marketplace is not financially capable of supporting three stations-there is just not enough advertising revenue. About two years ago, the television industry predicted that this would happen, and an independent analyst supported that prediction, but the Minister of the day, Senator Richardson, knew better. Insufficient revenue also means that the local stations have significantly cut back on local production, yet aggregation was supposed to mean more local production, not less.

91,Mr RONALDSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to take this opportunity to wish all my colleagues on both sides of the House a very happy and safe Christmas. Indeed, 1 would also like to pass on season's greetings to those long suffering people-I gather a number of them-who actually listen to the proceedings of this House. I wish them all a very happy and safe Christmas. 1 will even go so far as to wish the Prime Minister (Me Keating) a happy and safe Christmas. 1 think he has made· an absolute mess of things but I am sure he will enjoy a day with his family and, dare 1 say it, 1 think a day alone with his family is thoroughly deserved, as it is for all of us in this House.

96,Mr KEATING,COMMITTEES,"I move: That this House: (1) expresses its profound sympathy on behalf of all Australians for the suffering being endured by the people of Somalia as a result of famine, clan warfare and banditry; (2) commends the efforts being made by those organisations and individuals who are working to relieve that suffering; (3) affIrms Australia's support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General, his Special Representative and others to promote a political settlement in Somalia and to the distribution of relief assistance; (4) endorses the aims of Operation Restore Hope as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 794 to provide a secure environment for the distribution of humanitarian relief; (5) expresses its support for the Australian contribution to operation Restore Hope and for Australia's continued participation in the UN Peacekeeping Operation, UNOSOM; and (6) expresses its full confidence in, and support for, the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are being deployed to Somalia and looks forward to their safe return. I ask that the House focus today on the terrible human tragedy in Somalia and the international efforts currently being undertaken to alleviate the suffering there. Since the end of the dictatorial rule of ex-President Mahamed Siad Barre in January 1991, the political and economic institutions in Somalia have disintegrated. Fighting between shifting factional coalitions has compounded the effects of years of economic mismanagement and drought, and led to starvation and political anarchy on a massive scale. Famine and clan warfare have so far taken the lives of an estimated quarter of a million Somalis. About two million people, or a third of Somalia's pre-war population, are still at risk of starvation. In this appalling situation, Australian and other international nongovernment organisations have shown great courage and compassion, struggling against frightening odds to get food and medicine to the suffering people. The Australian public has also responded generously, donating an estimated $l1m to SOMALIA the relief effort in Somalia. The Australian Government has added $8.5m in humanitarian aid during this calendar year. Over the last weekend the Australian public donated another $600,000 to an appeal conducted on Radio National for Somalia and other drought and famine-stricken countries in Africa. I should like to congratulate the Australian aid workers with non-government organisations such as CARE Australia and World Vision on their efforts to bring relief to Somalia. The world has been slow to realise the need for decisive and concerted action by foreign governments in response to the human crisis facilitate in Somalia. A response was attempted in April this year when the United Nations Security Council...,...through resolution 751established a peacekeeping operation, UNOSOM, to maintain a cease-fire, to promote a political settlement and to provide urgent humanitarian assistance. But UNOSOM was slow to get under way and was not structured adequately to deal with the problems it faced. The world was appalled to see Somalis continuing to starve while food donated by the international community was plundered by armed gangs or remained in warehouses because safe passage could not be guaranteed. Violence and extortion continued unabated and those UN troops who did arrive in Somalia found themselves confronted by lack of cooperation and hamstrung by their restrictive rules of engagement. It was against this bleak background that President Bush made his ground-breaking offer to provide substantial US troops to a new international coalition of forces that would enforce peace in Somalia, not simply try to keep it. The world community, and specifically the United Nations Security Council, welcomed the President's offer and sanctioned Op""eration Restore Hope through resolution 794 on 3 December. Member states were invited by the United Nations to contribute to a multinational force. With the beginning of the US led Operation Restore Hope the security situation has begun to improve in Somalia. Mogadishu has been secured and an agreement reached between the faction leaders on an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of their militias from the town. We should, however, remain cautious about undertakin.gs given by the faction leaders. Honourable members will be aware of reports overnight that American and French forces have now safely entered the inland town of Baidoa. Feuding and banditry continue in other parts of the country. Lawlessness has increased lately as attempts are made to secure territory before the arrival of coalition troops. The Government has decided-in response to resolution 794 and at the invitation also the United States-to make a large scale commitment of Australian forces to Operation Restore Hope. The operation is intended to create a secure environment for the provision of humanitarian relief in Somalia. We will join at least 20 other nations which have offered to be part of it. This international undertaking makes history. The United Nations has never before sanctioned intervention on such a scale in the internal affairs of a member state for humanitarian purposes. It is imperative that Operation Restore Hope succeed, not only to help the people of Somalia, but also as a demonstration that the international community, through the United Nations, is capable of responding promptly and effectively to a crisis of this scale. Australia's contribution to the peace-making force will consist of an infantry battalion group based on 1st Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, from Townsville. 1st Battalion is part of the Australian Defence Force's Operational Deployment Force. Our contingent will total about 900 personnel, including four rifle companies from 1st Battalion, a reduced squadron of about 30 armoured personnel carriers, and logistic and engineer support elements. A battalion group is the minimum size unit that can fully support and protect itself and can readily integrate with coalition forces. The commander of the Australian force in Somalia will be Colonel Bill Mellor. A small reconnaissance party is expected to leave for Somalia next week, with an advance party of troops to follow in early January. The main body of troops will arrive in Somalia by midJanuary 1993. The battalion will be in Somalia for 17 weeks. This timing has been made clear to our partners in the operation, who have welcomed our offer. The Government is confident that the deployment will enable us to make a worthwhile contribution to Operation Restore Hope. The estimated additional cost of sending a battalion group to Operation Restore Hope for this period will be $19.5m. The length of the deployment takes account of the requirements of Australia's national security. of The temporary absence of one of the battalions of the Operation Deployment Force is manageable, given our currently benign security environment. The Australian contingent to the peacemaking effort will remain under Australian national command. Operational control for day-today tasking will be delegated to the US appointed Joint Task Force Commander. The Government is comfortable with these command and control arrangements. They are consistent with past combined operations. Such arrangements worked very successfully during the Gulf war. The Australian contingent will help provide for the open and free passage of relief supplies, and will assist UN relief operations. Precise details of its operational role will be worked out in consultation with the Joint Task Force Command. Possible tasks for the battalion group include the security of major airfields, seaports, key installations and food distribution points, the protection of food convoys, and support for relief operations. Rules of engagement for the Australian contingent are being drawn up in consultation with the United States and will be submitted for approval by the Australian Government. In accordance with past practice, the Government will not be making public the details of the rules of engagement. Members of our contingent will have the right of self defence. They will be anned with their normal complement of infantry small anus and weapons. The Government does not take lightly the possible dangers our contingent might face in Somalia. A careful .assessment of the security situation has been prepared by the National Assessments Board and considered by the Government. Clearly this assignment will entail risks. But without risks there would be no requirement for the sort of international military operation which we are now joining. The Government considers that the size and strength of the coalition forces will ensure maximum security for all participating personnel. Australia's contingent will be fully equipped and prepared for any dangers associated with its mission. No final decision has been taken by the United Nations on the disanning of the Somali factions. Obviously a reduced level of anus in Somalia is highly desirable both for the safety of international forces and for the longer term internal security of Somalia. Resolution 794 authorises member states participating in Operation Restore Hope to use all necessary means to establish as soon as possible a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia. The question of the most appropriate means of achieving this is currently the subject of discussions between the UN Secretary General and UN member countries taking part in Operation Restore Hope. There will continue to be a major task for the international community in Somalia once Operation Restore Hope has provided a secure environment for the distribution of aid. Australia will, therefore, also be expanding the size of the Movement Control Unit which we have already committed to UNOSOM from 30 to 45 personnel. This will provide an extended contribution to. the peacekeeping effort which will remain essential in Somalia. The contribution to Operation Restore Hope that I have outlined today will be the largest commitment of Australian ground forces overseas in the last 20 years. It represents the Government's considered response to the appalling human tragedy in Somalia. In the fluid post-Cold War international environment, Australia shares an important interest with other responsible countries in ensuring that the United Nations is able to respond effectively to major humanitarian and security challenges. The same thinking lay behind the Government's decision to join the UNmandated international response to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait in 1990. The Australian commitments announced this week to' Operation Restore Hope and UNOSOM sharply increase our total contribution to UN-mandated peacekeeping the and other operations around the world. Taken together, these contributions provide ample demonstration of Australia's support for a stronger UN role in peacekeeping and humanitarian intervention. These latest commitments place clear limits on our scope to participate in further peacekeeping efforts in the near future. But Australia should be proud to take its place as part of the international effort to enforce and keep a just and humanitarian peace in Somalia. I am sure all members will want to express their confidence in and support for the Australian Defence Force men and women who will be deployed to Somalia. Our thoughts will be with them as they prepare to embark on their historic mission. We look forward to welcoming them home safely to Australia at the end of their deployment. I commend the motion to the House.",76
97,Dr HEWSON,COMMITTEES,"The Opposition parties are pleased to support the motion before the House. We do so because Somalia is in desperate need of international assistance. We do so because too many Somalis. have already lost their lives due to famine and violent conflict, and because countless others live in fear of the same fate. We also support this motion because we support an expanded United Nations role in upholding peace and human dignity in the post-Cold War world. Not least, we support this motion because we have the utmost confidence in the professionalism and capabilities of our Defence Force personnel to do the job that they have been given. There is no more serious decision by any government than to send its Defence Force overseas and into hann's way. It is important that any such decision have bipartisan support in the national Parliament. I am pleased to pledge that support today. The recent history of Somalia is one of unparalleled tragedy. The country has been scarred by a civil war brought on as a result of the collapse of a repressive political and the use of terror by so-called 'warlords' intent on personal power. More than a quarter of a million Somalis have already died from the combined effects of war and drought. Another two million of Somalia's six million people are threatened. According to the United Nations Secretary General, more than 4.5 million people are in desperate need of food and other humanitarian assistance. It is a mark of the Somali tragedy that more than 280,000 refugees from that country have crossed over the Somali-Kenya border and more than 2,000 people arrive at refugee camps in Kenya every week. Even neighbouring Ethiopia and Djibouti-which are themselves afflicted by severe droughthave offered safe haven to Somalis fleeing the civil war and looking for food. Within Somalia, reports indicate that there has been a total breakdown of law and order and of civil society. The United Nations reports that the famine has been made much worse by the absence of an effective civil infrastructure to distribute food. There is no national administration, no reliable power or communications, no semblance of a nationally imposed rule of law, and no access to medical or other facilities. For example, of the 15 hospitals which remained at least partially . operational in August 1992, most have no water, electricity or drugs. The sanitary situation is deteriorating at an alarming rate and primary health care is practically non-existent. Disease is exacerbated by malnutrition and hunger. The problems caused by the decay of the national infrastructure have added to, and been made worse by, the large scale failure of the cereal harvest this year-a failure brought on by the lack of rain, the absence of security and the collapse of a market system to distribute what food was produced. Looked at from Australia, the situation in Somalia is a story of human misery that denies the most basic decency and rights to fellow human beings. But, in addition to the depressing problems I have already referred to, Somalia's gravest problem, and .the one which makes the famine much worse, is the problem of random system violence-violence perpetrated by the wellanned gangs of youths, barely, or not at all, under the control of the warlords, who have partitioned the country since the toppling of President Barre in January 1991. These gangs-the so-called 'technicals' who roam the streets of Mogadishu and other provincial centres-have prevented the efficient distribution of relief supplies by overrunning distribution points and by looting supplies directly from docked ships and aircraft at airstrips and airports. One observer recently described the situation of anarchy prevailing in Somalia as 'so complete as to be unique in modern history'. . The appalling situation which has developed through the exercise of random and uncontrolled violence has caused the country to degenerate to the point where no one authority has the power to bring a resolution to the dispute. The warlords have practically no control outside their well-anned compounds, leaving their forces free to conduct acts of banditry against the Somali people and aid workers. Stories have been recounted of the hijacking of food relief supplies, not only by armed gangs but also by villagers to whom the food was originally destined. They had no choice but to forcefully appropriate food supplies before gangs intervened to steal whatever they could to sell on the black market. This situation clearly requires some fonn of concerted international action to bring peace and stability to Somalia. Through Operation Restore Hope, the United Nations is now responding to that challenge. It is a substantial military operation designed to secure the peace in Somalia so that a successful food and medical relief operation will be able to operate throughout the country. In 1990, the coalition parties gave their full support to Australia's involvement in the UNmandated force which overturned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. At the time of the Australian decision to commit forces to the Gulf, I told the House that we had reached a turning point in history in which the future role of the United Nations would be determined. I said that the Gulf war presented a challenge to the international community of sovereign states which could not be allowed to go without a direct and, if need be, forceful response. Operation Restore Hope in Somalia represents a new stage in the post-Cold War evolution of global security. It constitutes a commitment by the United Nations not to accept the barbaric and wholesale mistreatment of people, even within national boundaries. It is to the credit of the United Nations that such a timely response has been instituted to the Somali crisis. And it is to the credit of the United States and other nations, including of course Australia, that they have contributed forces so readily to this humanitarian mission. I would like here to pay tribute to the highly professional and dedicated men and women of the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, who have been called on, once again, to make a major contribution at very short notice. to Operation Restore Hope. I have nothing but admiration for the professionalism of the ADF and its capacity to carry out highly difficult tasks under dangerous, indeed life-threatening, conditions. At this moment, troops of the Australiari Defence Force are making essential contributions to peacekeeping operations in Cambodia and Western Sahara. Our forces are making smaller contributions to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation operating in Jerusalem and the United Nations Mine Clearance Training Team which works in Pakistan, training Afghan personnel in mine clearance techniques. These operations collectively mean that Australia is making its largest ever contribution to international peacekeeping operations. The decision to deploy the First Battalion of the Operational Deployment Force more than doubles this existing commitment of forces. The coalition has offered its support for Australian participation in all of these operations, and we will continue to support any such contributions in the future, provided that they answer a humanitarian need or represent a direct security interest. In the case of the Somalia contribution, Australia has a very clear humanitarian obligation to provide assistance in helping to restore some semblance of normality and human decency to that country. I would like to offer my support and commendation to Australia's non-government aid agencies which have been working in Somalia already for some time. These include a number of Australians working for CARE Australia who have very much been in the front line of dealing with the warring gangs in Mogadishu and Baidoa. But the state of anarchy in Somalia was such that the United Nations humanitarian mission could not effectively go ahead until a broader attempt was made to bring peace to the country. Thus the need arose for Operation Restore Hopeand the need has been met. I have spoken at some length about the situation in Somalia and outlined the enormous task which is before the Allied forces constituted from approximately 30 countries to bring order and stability to Somalia. The coalition parties are strong supporters of Operation Restore Hope and even stronger supporters of the highly capable Australian battalion, which has - n committed to the operation. I should also take this opportunity to refer briefly to some concerns about the precise operations in which our forces will be involved. Our first concern, of course, relates to the potential range of threats which the Allied forces will face. I note the comments on Tuesday by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) that the threat ranges from medium to high. if the force is not engaged in disarming the Somali warring gangs, and high to very high if the forces disarm the gangs. The seriousness of this situation in which our forces will operate cannot be underestimated. The peacekeeping forces are quite likely to face significant dangers. The Government has clearly considered this matter carefully in its decision to send an integrated battalion group to the operation. We hope that we will be kept fully infonned by the Government about the security situation in which our forces will be involved. In this context, I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his statement today indicated that our troops in Somalia will have the right of self-defence and will be armed with their nonnal complement of infantry arms and weapons. We welcome that announcement. In situations of danger, such as will face our troops in Somalia, this requirement is fundamentally important and should not be compromised. Recently, in Morocco, there was an unfortunate incident where our Defence Force peacekeeping personnel had their arms confiscated by local authorities. That was a most regrettable precedent which I trust will not be repeated in situations our forces are in some possible danger. A second concern relates to the functions which the Australian battalion will be called upon to perfonn. I understand that discussions are under way in the United Nations to determine precisely the role of the peacekeeping force, particularly as it relates to the disarming function. Again, I trust that the Prime Minister will keep the Opposition, the Parliament and the public infonned about whatever decision is made on operational roles. Third, we would appreciate some further information from the Government concerning the arrangements for the funding of this deployment. The Prime Minister announced in his statement today that the cost would be $19.5m. We would appreciate some indication as to whether this amount will come from a one-off supplement to the defence budget or whether it will be funded from s-vings in other areas of defence. In particular, we would appreciate some assurance from the Government that the training exercises of Defence Force personnel in Australia will not be compromised. The Opposition has some concerns about the proposed duration of the Australian deployment. I note that the Government maintains that 17 weeks is the maximum time we will be able to spare the battalion from local duty in Australia. Of course, this raises questions about the possible impact on the wi,der peacekeeping operation if the Australian force is compelled to withdraw at this time without regard to the actual progress of the operation 17 weeks from now. This is an important issue which I trust the Government will address during the time of the battalion's deployment. Again, I hope the Opposition will be kept infonned of developments. In conclusion, the Opposition believes that this is a very important deployment fully deserving of the size of the military contribution about to be made by the Australian Defence Force. We have the highest regard for the capacity of the battalion to carry out this task. I am very pleased to join with the Prime Minister, and I hope all where members of the House, in wishing the battalion well and a safe return to their families and loved ones. Mr TIM FlSCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (2.30 p.m.)-On behalf of the members of the National Party of Australia, I support the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and this motion. It is deserving of bipartisan support. An assessment made by the Economist on 22 February 1992 stated: The fight for power [in Somalia] has become a clan feud . . . Somali children know as much about weapons as western children know about computer games . . . Unarmed civilians are at the mercy of marauding gangs, caught in the indiscriminate shelling and random gun fire . . . Hunger is universal. The war and the 1990 drought forced farmers to kill or sell their livestock and eat the seed grain needed for this year's sowing ... Food in Mogadishu is priced beyond the reach of most families; they have had no wages . . . for over a year . . . Outside the capital, some things are even worse; famine is already striking nomads in central Somalia. We have all seen how much the situation has deteriorated, from media reporting, from the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition today, and from other sources. It is very unusual that for the third time in the life of one parliamentary term the Australian Parliament is, by this motion, authorising a major commitment overseas. Firstly, there was the Gulf war commitment; secondly, the Cambodian peacekeeping force commitment; and, now, the Somalian contingent, which primarily involves myoid battalion, the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. In addition, there were commitments to the Western Sahara, the Middle East and Pakistan. Our best wishes are extended at this time, at Christmas, to all Australian forces involved with all of those commitments. The outcome of the Gulf commitment was testimony to the professionalism of the Allied forces. The Australian part of that Gulf commitment demonstrated time and again its professionalism and training by the fact that it could match it with the best. An Australian ship was one of the first ships to carry out interdiction, in conjunction with a United States ship. Of course, the media tilted massively towards the involvement of the United States ship and Australia was mentioned only in dispatches, but we were there in the beginning, during and at the end of the Gulf commitment in a very professional way. I salute that effort. I remind the House that the Cambodian commitment continues today. A number of the members of the peacekeeping force are held by the Khmer Rouge. On Monday, as I was coming through Bangkok, I had the opportunity to meet with General Sanderson, who is the overall commander of the UNTAC force in Cambodia, and I met with Australian soldiers, directly and indirectly, when I visited Cambodia. . Australian soldiers are carrying out that commitment with professionalism, but I warn that it is a deteriorating and extremely dangerous circumstance in Cambodia and one which we should not lose sight of because of other distractions, including the focus now turning to Somalia. I remind the House that those Australians in Cambodia are at risk from passive hazards, such as mines, and from more active hazards as the Khmer Rouge shows some of its true behaviour with its less than constructive approach-to put it mildly-to the peace process in Cambodia. Today we address the Somalian commitment and we wish our contingent well. The battalion grouping has a massive task ahead of it. The contingent comprises some 900 soldiers, primarily from Townsville, and involves the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. I wish Colonel Bill Mellor and Lieutenant Colonel Dave Hurley and their team the very best in carrying out and delivering on their allotted, very challenging, task. Those who have not been in the Services would find it difficult to imagine the degree and intensity of preparation for a deployment such as this one, even though the battalion is a member of the ready deployment group. The battalion grouping will have to be as selfsufficient as possible during the 17-week deployment. This requires a special form of preparation, occurring as it does in the leadup to the Christmas period. It is difficult to relate to lay people the extent of the complex preparation necessary for a commitment of this size and scale. I would like the Parliament to pause for a moment and think also of the spouses and children who will be left behind in Townsville over the next 17 weeks. It will be anxious and stressful times for these families, but I feel confident that the Army and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) will be sensitive to these issues, as was the case with the Namibian commitment and the other commitments I have mentioned, including the continuing commitments. Given that there is a substantial commitment of 500 soldiers to Cambodia, and others elsewhere, I think it is fair to say that Australia's defence forces will be well and truly stretched during this time. We must remember that we will now be down to three battalions. I know the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) will dwell on this when he speaks in a moment. There will be one battalion left in Queensland, and three infantry battalions left right around Australia, during the Christmas period, which traditionally has been a critical time for bushfires, floods and other civilian emergencies requiring the involvement of the Australian armed forces. I think it is time that the Government seized the moment to reverse its decision to abolish 6 and 8/9, RAR-the two Brisbane battalions-said that it got that wrong and accepted that part of the coalition policy to reinstate those Brisbane battalions before it is too late, so ensuring our resource and security and the availability of adequate resources from the Australian Army. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in its report entitled Stockholding and sustainability in the Australian Defence Force, which was tabled today, made the point that the logistic system needs to be able to match the state of readiness of our operational forces. This will be tested in the first half of 1993. It is my hope that the logistic requirements will be adequately met for all our forces that are overseas, most notably the Somalian force, as well as for Australian forces in Australia as they go about their work. It is only too obvious that the suffering of the Somalian people has been immense-and it continues. I hope that the actions being taken by the United States, Australia and others will quickly ease the burden of that suffering by the Somalian people. I think this Parliament must acknowledge the superb leadership of President Bush in taking decisive action to quickly come to grips with this desperate human tragedy. It would have been easy enough for President Bush to say, 'I've had enough. I've got a few weeks left. I'm going to go on the cocktail circuit around the United States of America and leave this problem to my successor'. We would have lost a critical lO-week period in which the suffering in Somalia would have worsened. The problem would not have gone away. Instead, he made the commitment, made the tough decision and took the action. Unbelievably, the media decided to turn it into a media circus. People from the key television programs of the United States of America were on the beaches in Somalia before the marines. The marines almost had to book to get space on the beach at the critical landing. The role of the media in modem day military activity is changing. It should not go without detailed examination. It is the cause of some concern. As important as that role is, and the freedom of the press is, it was almost absurd when the TV lights were on the beach before the marines were there, as they carried out their landing under moonlight a fortnight ago. There is a tremendous challenge ahead for members of the Australian battalion grouping going to Somalia. I salute them. I know they are professional. I know the battalion especially well, having served with it in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969 and having revisited since that time on occasions when in Townsville. The 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, will do Australia proud and will do the ANZAC tradition proud. This motion is deserving of the support of all honourable members and honourable senators of the Parliament. God speed the troops and may they have a safe return.",78
98,Mr BILNEY,COMMITTEES,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (2.40 p.m.)It is a great pleasure to support the remarks which have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). As the Leader of the National Party has pointed out, this is not the first occasion this year when we have had to sit here in this Parliament and contemplate a massive deployment of Australian service men and women abroad in harm's way. There can be no more deserving objective than the one for which our battalion is now to embark. This deployment has encountered virtually unanimou- support, not just in this House but within the community at large, from those who have seen the tragic scenes of the sticklike, starving figures of Somalians, who have been subject to the most appalling degradation at the hands of rival warring factions. Those factioQS have simply not allowed the aid, which Australians and others have so generously donated, to get through. I am very glad to see the spirit which pervades the House in supporting this commitment. Perhaps I will begin by answering some of the points made by the Leader of the Opposition. They were reasonable queries but the Government has thought of them. I am able to assure the House of our support in that regard. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition asked about the funding of the commitment-'-the $19.5m it will cost to transport our forces to Somalia and have them there for the 17 weeks of Operation Restore Hope. That sum will not come from the defence allocation; that allocation will be supplemented so that there will be no financial effect on the ability of the ADF to carry out its mission. This was agreed to-very readily, I might say-by the Government because this operation was unforeseen and over and above the nonnal role for the ADF. Second, in regard to the remarks that the Leader of the Opposition made about the duration of the commitment, we have taken on a commitment which is limited both in scope and in time. However, we believe that within that time the objectives of the mission will be achieved, as they have been described by the United States commander and the United States President, to bring about a situation in which the aid can get through. Therefore, the duration is limited. I point out that we are leaving open what will happen after that time. There is an ongoing United Nations mission in Somalia, UNOSOM, to which Australia has already contributed a number of troops, in the fonn of a movement control unit, which are on the ground now. They will, of course, help to integrate our forces into this major operation. The Government has left open what contribution will be made to that ongoing mission after the main body of our forces leaves. The Leader of the Opposition also made some remarks about the effect of this deployment-and I know that the Opposition spokesman on defence, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who ""is at the table, has also voiced some qualms about this-on the ability of the ADF to handle this commitment and something which might arise as a matter of emergency while the battalion is in Somalia. There is no point in pretending that the ADF can handle an unlimited number of simultaneous commitments with the forces at its disposal. That should come as no surprise to anybody. There is some fearful speculation about the ability of the ADF to cope. There is no doubt that this will strain our forces. but it will not strain them to anything like the extent that has been claimed; One other matter which has been mentioned in this debate and for which I have direct responsibility concerns the conditions under which the troops will serve. Those conditions have been very largely settled. They have been a matter of consideration by the Government, and they will certainly be announced before the troops depart. I believe these conditions will satisfactorily recognise the very severe conditions under which these troops are being deployed, as was the case when we sent 500 soldiers to Cambodia, as was the case when we made our commitment to the Gulf and, indeed, as has been the case in similar operations from Namibia onwards. I can signal to the House that those allowances and conditions will be broadly commensurate with the danger of this commitment and its nature, just as happened in these previous instances that I have mentioned. As the Leader. of the National Party rightly pointed out, and I have direct experience of this so I would like to dwell on it for a moment, we are now participating in peacekeeping enterprises to a greater extent than at any stage in our history as a nation. As I have mentioned, we have troops in Cambodia. Troops are going to Somalia. We have a United Nations mine clearance training team on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. We have a contingent in the Western Sahara, the MINURSO contingent there, and we have troops engaged in the Middle East. We also make a small but important contribution to the peacekeeping operation in what was Yugoslavia. As well as that, several Australian defence officers are attached to the United Nations headquarters. They are making a very valuable contribution. Mr Rocher-Good men; good men.",83
99,Mr BILNEY,COMMITTEES,"I recognise the interjection; yes, they are good men. I think that they are contributing some very valuable expertise to what will become, I suspect, a greater at function of the United Nations as time goes on. This operation brings to 14 the number of United Nations operations which have been undertaken in the last year or so. That is, itself, about the same number as the United Nations authorised in the previous 43 years. Those officers in New York are contributing an expertise which is very important. I might add that I· made it my business earlier this year to visit all our peacekeeping forces, with the exception of those in Yugoslavia. I am not sure whether Colonel Wilson had got there at that stage. I found that all troops were doing an excellent job, and that was being recognised by their peers. In Cambodia, they literally do provide the backbone of communications in a country where the communications infrastructure has been totally destroyed. On the border between Pakistan and Afthe ghanistan, the team is operating to help clear the country of an estimated 30 million mines which have been dropped or placed during indiscriminate warfare that has gone on in troubled country. In the Western Sahara, scenes which are straight out of Beau Geste, our troops are spread across the country as attempting to bring about conditions which a referendum can be held to determine the future of the constitution and the national future of that part of the world. Our longest commitment has been in the Middle East and our people there are also making an excellent contribution. One thing that I should mention is the question raised by the Leader of the National Party dealing with the Ready Reserve. I would have hesitated to do so since, in a debate in which there has been so much bipartisanship, it does seem a little inappropriate to raise this matter. The argument runs that because there are now four regular brigades-and the question of terminology is one that needs thinking about - somehow or other, those battalions into which the Ready Reserve has been integrated are somehow than potent, less than up to the task that have been assigned. Recently I was fortunate enough to go to the passing out parade, the end of year parade Enoggera of the division of the brigade in which the Ready Reserve has been integrated. I think that it is the largest parade I have been to. Three thousand soldiers were there. It was in an extremely impressive force. On their behalf, I reject and resent the implication that this force is somehow less than ready, less than capable, less than dedicated, less than committed, less than well trained, less than the kind of force which it replaced-a rather understrength and underequipped body. In recent times I have made some remarks about the Ready Reserve and I am very our pleased to say that the situation which I foresaw at that time, one in which we might well not attract sufficient numbers of people to the Ready Reserve to keep up the commitment and the plans that we have for the future, as a result perhaps of the publicity that has been engendered, will not occur and that Ready Reserve looks like attracting the requisite numbers of people. I say on their behalf, since they cannot speak for themselthe ves, what an excellent body of young men that and women they are and what a top job they in are doing for their country and will do in situations where we may need to call on them a ready force, rather more ready than is the under case with the general Reserve. Some of the remarks that have been made about first elevens and second elevens in the forces seem to me to be nonsensica1. Those remarks betray not just a lack of knowledge of the modem military, but also a lack of knowledge of modem cric-t. A different side is picked for the five-day test from that which is picked for the one-day game. Each has its role to play. It degrades or denigrates neither of them that those roles should be different. A short readiness role should be different from one which we would need to contemplate were there to be a more substantial commitment, where we needed to rely on forces that were not as ready as others. Those remarks having been made, I want to less conclude by saying, as have all speakers they before me, how proud I am of the action the Government has taken in committing this force. I am proud of those who will be going. Like everybody else in this country, I strongly support their role. I support the men and women who will be going. It will be for the Government to make sure of their conditions as they serve there. The fact that they get their mail on time, their pay on time should reflect the importance of this commitment. On behalf of the Government, that is an undertaking I give. It is also important that those who are left behind, the wives and husbands and loved ones of those who are going away, should also receive the support that they deserve. That, too, will be part of the Government's commitment to see to it that their welfare is protected. This is important, too vital a national commitment and too good a cause for it to be otherwise. I salute those men and women. I wish them well in their commitment and a safe return home.",84
100,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"As the shadow Minister for Defence, I would also like to give my strong support to the motion moved today by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to congratulate the Government on the decision it has made to send the battalion to Somalia to deal in a humanitarian way with this quite awful situation. At the end of the Cold War, at the end of the super-power conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, there was no doubt that many\aw that the great danger for the future was Ii proliferation of small localised conflicts around the world which would be extraordinarily difficult to deal with. Some of that concern has turned out to be quite well placed. Nevertheless, probably the most promising international development that did flow from the end of the Cold War was the establishment of what President Bush has described as the new world order-the capacity of the United Nations at long last to fulfil what one might describe as its destiny to become a body which is able not just to achieve peace around the world, but, as this operation, I think, illustrates, to impose peace where peace might otherwise not be possible. We have a global structure now which enables the world to deal with the sorts of localised conflicts and crises that are predictably arising, and it is excellent to see the way the United Nations is becoming so significant in helping to achieve those objectives. The role of the United Nations in passing the appropriate resolutions of the Security Council which led to the liberation of Kuwait, its role in the Cambodian crisisyet to be brought to fruition, but on its way, I hope-and the role which it has now been able to play in the case of Somalia is, frankly, enonnously encouraging. The success of these United Nations sponsored operations is absolutely critical to the future of the peace arid the stability of the too world. It is absolutely critical. If these types of operations do not work and if responsible countries are not prepared to support them, then that structure will fail and we will no longer have a way of dealing with conflicts of this kind. Really, though, the United Nations is coming close to achieving the vision that in the mid-1940s people like Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and others had for that organisation. I am really very proud of the fact that Australia has become a major contributor to peacekeeping within the United Nations. I would only make this comment: I have never believed that the structure of the Australian Defence Force should be determined on the basis of a United Nations role. It should be determined on the principle of the defence of Australia but, nevertheless, where that force is able to be of assistance, then I am not only happy to see it contribute, but I think it is important that it does. The cast) of Somalia, as all Australians know, is a particularly poignant one. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) pointed out, of a total population of just six million, there are two million lives threatened through starvation, famine and internal civil conflict. I thought that an article which appeared in the December edition of the Quadrant magazine by Philip Ayres, an academic from Monash University, was particularly moving. In his article he described Somalia as: . . . an anarchy so complete as to be unique in modem history-imagine the entire infrastructure of society destroyed down to such basics as water supply, sanitation and electricity, not to speak of services like the telephone and. the post, let alone the law. Honourable members would be aware of reports constantly coming out of Somalia of a desperate situation in that country. In his article, Philip Ayres made the point: One desperately wants the Magruficent Seven to ride into town, but they won't, I would like to feel that, whilst the Magnificent Seven, of course, will not ride into town, something more constructive is now happening, and that is that Operation Restore Hope is taking place and that we will at last see some stability return to that poor and troubled country and that lives will be saved. As I said, I am very pleased that Australia is making a contribution to relieving this terrible situation. When the United Nations Security Council passed its resolution in support of what 'became Operation Restore Hope, I put out· a press release saying that I hoped that Australia would make a contribution to it, and although I have to say that Senator Ray responded with a rather political remark that I was being far too gung ho, I am glad to say that the Government, on greater reflection and particularly after representations came from the United States Government, decided to act. So, the Government has responded' to the request of the Uruted States. It has done that with the support, I think, of the whole of this Parliament"":""-I hope so and I am sure so-and the battalion from the operational deployment force in Townsville is now to go for a period of 17 weeks, or approximately four months. That battalion wiU join not only the tr<;>ops of the United States, who are already doing a sterling job in Somalia, but also tro<;>ps from France, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia and I think one or two other Arab states. The Australian battalion will be under the command of Colonel Bill Mellor, assisted by Lieutenant Colonel David· Hurley. I know both of those officers have a high reputation for their professionalism and ability. I wish them well in their great responsibilities, not only for the battalion but also for the continuing high reputation of the Australian Defence Force and Australia as a whole. The operational deployment force-the most ready part of the Australian Army-is an extraordinarily professional body. I had the pleasure of visiting the force in Townsville five or six weeks ago- I spent a whole day with them and I can only say that I was extremely impressed with the level of training and commitment of all I met. . It has been said that the risks in the case of Somalia will range from medium possibly to very high. It is noteworthy that amongst these is not only the risk. of being attacked by the armed gangs which roam around Somalia, but also the risk of disease and general quality of life. I think it is important that the House take account of that. These very professional men and women are entering an environment with a reasonably high-and possibly a very high-level of risk. I hope that we will not let that fact slip from our minds. They are our fellow Australians, they are extraordinarily professional Australians and we wish them the very best. They will be involved in Operation Restore Hope which will fall into four phases, the first of which is pretty much complete. The first phase of Operation Restore Hope was to secure the airport and seaport at Mogadishu and subsequently deploy to Baidcia. As honourable members will have seen on the neWS last night, the deployment to Saidoa has been successful and Mogadishu airport and the seaport have both been secured as well. The second phase of the operation is to facilitate food distribution in those areas. The third phase is then to expand the operation to the south. I imagine that the Australian ba-talion will be involved particularly in the expansion of the operation to the south of Somalia. The north of Somalia is in a much stronger position. The food distribution system there is better and the humanitarian problems are nothing like as great as they are in the south. That is why Operation Restore Hope is focusing initially, after Mogadishu and Baidoa, on the south of the country. The fourth phase of the operation, which is likely to be completed in anything up to four months, will be the hand-over of the operation gen-rally to UNOSOM, which is the peacekeeping force to which we are making a contribution, as the Prime Minister has pointed out. That peacekeeping force will replace Operation Restore Hope which is effectively a peace-making force. I think we are all very proud that the Australian Defence Force is taking part in this exercise. All Australians are extremely confident that our force will perform very well. We have raised a range of issues which have been discussed already in this debate and which I have discussed with officials from the Department of Defence. The more I learn about the Government's planning of this operation, the more satisfied I become that many of the issues which could be of concern have been thought through. For example, I think the Government has addressed the very important issue of command and control quite appropriately. As the Prime Minister said, the command and control arrangements will be very much the same as the arrangements that applied during the Gulf war with, at the end of the day, national command remaining with Australia. Those who are interested in military history will not forget that one of our great mistakes was to let national command be taken over altogether on occasions by the British during the First World War. I think many Australians feel that they probably got a fairly raw deal as a consequence. National command should always remain with us, as Australians, and in this case ultimately that will be so-although the day-today operations will be coordinated by the coalition commander who is an American. The rules of engagement have not yet been determined, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bitney) pointed out. I look forward to getting at briefing on what the rules of engagement will be once they have been coordinated with the United States. But I make the simple point that our troops must have the unequivocal right of self-defence. I am sure the rules of engagement will guarantee that right of self defence. I think the Prime Minister has alluded to that being the case. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel also referred to the. conditions of service for the soldiers who are going to Somalia. I am sorry that those conditions of service cannot be announced today because it is important that they are sorted out as soon as possible. The last thing we want in these cases is some unseemly haggling at the end of the operation as to conditions of service. . I think the Government should announce the provision of a daily allowance as quickly as possible. I understand the figure being looked at is $68 per day. It should also announce that the tax exemptions which are usually provided in these circumstances will apply. Again, we do not want any unseemly haggling with the Treasury or the Australian Taxation Office. This is an extraordinarily important matter. Given that our soldiers will experience a level of risk ranging from medium to very high, those appropriate conditions of service should be looked after properly. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel referred to the $19'hm being provided by a supplementation rather than coming out of the Defence budget. That was the first public acknowledgment of that supplementation and I am very pleased that the money will be made available in that way. The final point I make is in relation to the media. I understand that a very large media contingent will be going to Somalia with the battalion. Of course, I do not dispute the simple proposition that Australians not only have an interest in what their troops are doing overseas, but also have a right to know, at least to some extent, how they are faring. We want to know how they are f/,iring, but we do not want the media getting in the way. We do not want the media sinking to its occasionally callous levels, particularly in relation to the least a private Somalians themselves. Others have spoken about the way the media behaved when the Americans first landed in Somalia. I must admit the cartoons which appeared in newspapers subsequent to that event summed up very clearly the insensitivity of the media. I hope that the Australian media contingent going to Somalia with our battalion will behave with a much greater degree of sensitivity. In conclusion, I wish the battalion the very best. I wish our soldiers great safety and good fortune. On behalf of all members of the coalition, I send very best wishes to their families and loved ones-most of whom will be in Townsville, but wherever they may be. I know they will be concerned and anxious during this period. I want them to know that our thoughts are with them and that we are extraordinarily proud of the Australian Defence Force and of the battalion which is going to Somalia to deal with an extremely serious and pathetic human crisis.",86
101,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"The first section of this motion states: That this House: (1) expresses its profound sympathy on behalf of all Australians for the suffering being endured the people of Somalia as a result of famine, clan warfare and banditry; Indeed, virtually from its inception, this tragic country of Somalia has endured and suffered warfare and political instability on a scale which is hard for Australians to conceive. Even today, in the southern and northern parts of Somalia there are disputes obtaining as to ownership of parcels of Somalia and as to whether certain sections of the population can live with other citizens. The inability to resolve this unfortunate and tragic circumstance is creating great suffering. One of the fundamental freedoms annunciated by the United Nations was the freedom from want. Another one of the fundamental freedoms was the freedom from fear. These two freedoms in particular have been denied to the people of Somalia. Indeed, a situation of absolute barbarism has been going on in Somalia for some years. Even before President Barre was removed from office there was banditry, civil insurrection, armed conflict and wide scale barbarism in a way which is unknown to this country. The majority of our people would be incapable of even understanding the barbarism that has occurred. The people of the world expressed great hope when the United Nations was formed that the United Nations itself would take a far more active role in the protection of people's freedoms and liberties and also that it would have the ability to intervene within nations to secure those rights if those rights were denied to those citizens. This was borne out of the failure of the League of Nations, particularly in Abyssinia, or Ethiopia-where the League of Nations failed, through cowardice and appeasement, to uphold those basic freedoms. I believe this House should pay tribute to President Bush for his initiative in spurring the United Nations to take action to deploy United Nations forces to Somalia to ensure the pacification of the country so as to enable humanitarian aid to be distributed to the starving millions in Somalia. It sometimes occurs to me: what would happen if the United States did not take these steps to spur the United Nations, or spur the conscience of by the world, to take this humanitarian action to protect the people of Somalia? I fear that without the moral leadership of the United States this action may not have occurred. Indeed, I am unaware of any report in the United Nations where one country out of 160 of the United Nations has taken those necessary steps and said, 'We as a nation will deploy our forces to ensure the success of the operation and the survival of the people of Somalia'. I pay tribute to President Bush for his outstanding leadership not only on this occasion but also on many previous occasions. I congratulate the Government on its ready acceptance of the request by the United States Government, through our distinguished visitor, Ambassador Mel Sembler, for the provision of Australian ground forces to Somalia. I believe that is consistent with the reaction of the Australian Government when assistance was requested to assist the United Nations operations in the Gulf war Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm to ensure the freeing of Kuwait and the liberty of the people of Kuwait. I believe that this ready acceptance by the Australian Government signals to the nations in our immediate region that Australia does have the backbone and is prepared to deploy its military forces within United Nations confines, resolutions, to ensure that these basic liberties are upheld and that people's basic human rights are protected. Of all the units in the Australian Army, it gives me great pleasure to know that the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment has been selected to participate in Operation Restore Hope for its pacification role and to enable the provision of humanitarian aid the people of Somalia. The 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment is one of most highly trained battalions in the Australian Army and has a distinguished record of service in wartime which, in my view, is not exceeded by any other unit of Australian Defence Force. We are extremely proud of that battalion. The battalion's duties will be to ensure the area of operations within which it will undertake its responsibilities will be pacified and that, upon pacification being achieved, the provision of humanitarian aid can supplied to the starving people in Somalia. has been decided by the Australiari these Government that the force will be in Somalia for 17 weeks. I would think that the time-frame nominated by the Government simply a guide at this stage and that, if the battalion or its replacement were essential the duties that have to be performed in Somalia, the Government would accede that request by the United Nations. There are, however, some matters which wish to touch on with respect to the deployment of the battalion. The first concern I had initially was the absence of artillery support to the battalion. I know from a briefing that artillery support will be available from United States forces. On reflection, would have preferred that the Australian force had its own artillery support, or New artillery support, for the battalion. That is a very important matter. Secondly, I believe that it is fundamental for the battalion to be fully motorised. I that 30 armoured personnel carriers-that a small squadron of APCs-will accompany the battalion in its deployment to Somalia, well as a number of trucks. It is essential Headquarters Australia Defence Force ensure that the battalion and its supporting elements are fully motorised. Thirdly, I urge the Australian Government to ensure that the force has an medivac capability. I have been briefed that medivac capability will be provided by United States forces, but I still adhere to the view that we should have our own medivac capability. Fourthly, I believe that we should to have both first line and second line repair capability for the equipments that are being the deployed to Somalia and also that the Australian Government should not rule out the option of providing helicopter air mobile capability to the Australian battalion if so the required and if any problems were being experienced by the Australian contingent in obtaining readily air mobile capability, and in that particular air mobile fire power. The battalion will be tented in Somalia in the area of operations and will rely to a great extent on the logistics support of the United be States. The point should be made that It Australia will pay its own way throughout operations. I know it is a sense of pride to Australia that on every deployment that Australia has made, wherever it has taken was place, we have paid our own way. The soldiers deployed to Somalia will enjoy for full repatriation benefits on their return to Australia. They will receive the appropriate to allowances. I have asked the Australian Defence Force to ensure that there is a weekly I deployment of a C130 to Somalia to bring mail and other necessary equipments to the force to ensure that regular contact is maintained between Australia and our soldiers in Somalia. I am pleased that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr BiIney) I gave an ironclad guarantee that the mail for our soldiers in Somalia would be delivered to Zealand them on time and without any delay. I want to mention a few other matters about our involvement in the United States forces. Firstly, what happened to our Australian know soldiers in Morocco should never be allowed is, to happen again. Their steyr weapons and raven radios were taken from them and stored as in facilities which I am not certain were that secure. The raven radio is one of the most sophisticated pieces of tactical radio communications in the world-perhaps the best. It appals me that that piece of equipment was out of the possession of Australian soldiers indigenous for a certain period. As far as removing personal weapons from Australian soldiers deployed overseas is concerned, that is simply not an option. If there is no need for personal weapons to accompany the soldiers, then it is my belief that civilians should be deployed to that particular area. I have confidence that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) will never allow that situation to obtain again. I am also pleased to note that the Australian Government will be providing supplementary funding to the Defence float in excess of $19m to pay for our commitment to Somalia. This is fundamentally important· at a time when the Defence budget has been stretched to the limit, and when there is virtually no fat whatsoever in the Defence budget. It is very importan't that headquarters of the Australian Defence Force has that undertaking from the Government to ensure that there will be no intrusion by the cost of this operation into our Defence budget. I make the following point on the rules of engagement: there must be no constraints on Australian soldiers in Somalia in respect of, firstly, defending their own persons; secondly, the security of the battalion unit as a whole; and, thirdly, the discharge of their legitimate operations to ensure the pacification within their area of operations and the provision of humanitarian aid. They must not be constrained by unrealistic rules of engagement. I know that Colonel Bill Mellor and Lieutenant Colonel David Hurley will perfonn their duties in the highest traditions of the Australian Anny and that they will bring credit not only to the battalion but also to Australian military forces in general. We are preparing a major progr,am in Townsville to farewell the soldiers from Lavarack Barracks on their deployment to Somalia and to wish them well and godspeed. We will ensure that the families of· the soldiers are given all the necessary support we can possibly give them whilst their loved ones are away, serving our country on behalf of the Upited Nations, - d that they are not forgotten. I know that much effort is being devoted in that regard in Townsville. I commend the motion to the House. This is a significant motion. It is the first time that an Australian combat infantry battalion has been deployed off our shores since the Vietnam war. It is an historic motion and I am pleased that it has the bipartisan support of the Parliament. I know that it has the overwhelmingly support of the people of Australia.

104,Mr SMITH,MRSPEAKER,"Bass-Manager of Opposition Business) (3.25 p.m.}-I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Bass moving forthwith that Mr Speaker no longer possesses the confidence of this House for the consideration of following reasons: 1) That in the discharge of his duties as joint administrator of the Joint House Department he did knowingly sign an official report of that Department to the Parliament which included an anonymous reference to a public liability compensation settlement to himself without giving any personal explanation to the Parliament; 2) That the Speaker has failed to protect the dignity of the Parliament by consistently seeking to hide the facts surrounding his compensation claim and subsequent settlement from the Parliament and people of Australia. In speaking in support of the suspension of Standing Orders to subsequently move the motion of no confidence in the Speaker, I commence by stating that it is a serious matter for this chamber and the coalition to moving a suspension of Standing on Orders in the terms that we have. I did not seek to intervene in private ,members' have business-although I sought the call this to morning to ask the Speaker a question-and I did not seek to intervene in the discussion that has just taken place about the matters in Somalia. I note the comments of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). We joined him and others in a bipartisan The bicycle incident is a matter which is central to the credibility of the Speaker's role, on and there can be no graver issue for the Parliament. That is why I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to move the motion of no confidence. In a sense, the Speaker has been caught out. He failed to notify the House that he had instituted proceedings against the Joint House Department, which he is charged to administer. As a servant of the Crown and the of 'House, he failed to notify the House that he had received compensation for a public liability claim he had instituted against the Crown. The quantum of the $65,000 has raised eyebrows. As I and my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr made Peacock), who is seconding my motion, will illustrate, .it appears that amount is extraordinary. But it raises a range of questions. This morning I wanted to ask the Speaker whether he was going to come to the Parliament today-our last day of sithas ting-having been denied a Question Time today, to explain in a great deal of detail basis of the charge that I make on behalf the coalition today. It is not just the coalition playing politics House with this issue. Many honourable members on the Speaker's side of the chamber were also surprised, to say the least, when they heard the amount and the circumstances of its uncovering. I think all would have felt that if a man or a woman had been injured and there was some legitimacy in the claim-that remains to be proven; I do not cast aspersions on that because we have not had the benefit of the legal advice-the opportunity to explain should have been taken some condisclose siderable time ago. We find from the Speaker's own statement, following a question from my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadthis man) yesterday, that this accident took on 25 April-ANZAC Day-in 1990. He had an accident outside the precincts of the Parliament. We understand it occurred down by the lake when he was riding a bicycle, which he states was hired from the Health Recreation Centre at Parliament House. That raises the question: was it hired, borrowed on loan? Somehow or other, he had anacreport. cident. The circumstances of the accident have not been explained, but I understand went something like this: he took the bike, hired or otherwise-and those bikes were available to honourable members-and somewhere along the way it is alleged that the bike broke in half. He fell off, rolled on to his face and hands and, subsequently, suffered a chipped forearm which required some attencost tion. It was on that basis that he instituted· proceedings through his own solicitors and settlement ensued between his own solicitors and the Commonwealth in an amount of $65,000. That does not explain whether legal fees were covered and what the quantum was up of. Was it an assessment as to the extent of the injury? Was it an assessment as the quantum of that to loss ofMr Lindsay-Wasn't liability admitted?",92
105,Mr SMITH,MRSPEAKER,"We do not know whether liability was admitted. But other information come to hand. As people would expect, this matter has been the subject of great the discussion around here. We understand-it is of available to the Speaker to reject this interpretation-that he went to the Joint Department and said, 'No, I'll put the bike together'. He put it together and then took it away. If that were the case, there would be some element of contributory negligence. I think that he ought to be given the opportunity to answer the gravamen of these charges, and they are serious charges. I do not believe it is appropriate, and the community would not expect it to be appropriate, for the Speaker to actually and intently not seek to fully the benefit that he received. This came to light in the annual report of the Joint House Department, and I ask honourable members to remember that this event took place in 1990. There was even reporting of accident of the Speaker. There was never place any report that he Was seeking a claimMr Ruddock-Did he disclose it in his pecuniary interests statement?",93
106,Mr SMITH,MRSPEAKER,"I am going to come to that. and There was never any disclosure until this report became available. In my office I found or it on page 130 of an appendix attached to this All it says under the headings of 'Fraud Control' and 'Claims and Losses' is it that in 1991-92 the Department had three public liability claims settled. The first two claims were for $325 and $20,000. Then there is an interesting sentence: A third case resulted in payments for medical expenses and a public liability settlement totalling $65 000. AU of the reported details exclude the of legal representation for the Department. That $65,000 seems a fairly extraordinary a amount. There are some learned lawyers on this side of the House, and I am sure there are on the other side. I am only a suburban solicitor and another lawyer in parliament, but $65,000 appears to me to be a lot of money. I want to try to balance that amount against some other assessments of quantum that might be available to those who receive compensation in the public liability sense or a workers compensation sense. For example, a person in Queensland who loses both eyes gets $71,000. ",93
107,Mr SMITH,MRSPEAKER,"Certainly one-eyed, and that is a matter for further debate. But a person who loses both eyes gets $71,000. Mr Martin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. In the course of this debate, some latitude is given, but when interjections cast aspersions on the character of the Speaker, and there are other forms of the House that could be employed, I would ask that that be withdrawn.",94
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,The Chair did not hear an interjection,94
109,Mr SMITH,MRSPEAKER,"I am approaching this matter with some sobriety, and those who have seen me here before know that I can get quite excited",94
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"I ask the honourable member for Bass to wait a moment. I also do not think that the material that the honourable member is now - injecting into the debate is appropriate for the debate on the motion for suspension. If we were dealing with a substantive motion it would be, but in fact it is outside the terms of the motion before the House. So the honourable member needs to get back to the arguments as to why Standing Orders need to be suspended.",94
111,Mr SMITH,MRSPEAKER,"I take your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the point I made about the quantum is well made by citing that example out of the Queensland legislation. Similarly, if we look at the ACT workers compensation legislation where there is a basic limit of $20,000, that also makes the point. I come back to the issue of why we want Standing Orders suspended, and the basis of the motion that I wish to move: that is, that Mr Speaker has failed to protect the dignity of the Parliament and has not brought forward in an open way the fact that he has received this payment. We went to his pecuniary interests statement, and that also raises an interesting issue. It states: Although it is unclear from the resolutions of the House whether it is necessary to notify it, I advise that a personal injury accident claim against the Commonwealth has been settled. There is no reference to the amount that is being proposed. I would have thought that the Speaker, of all people, ought to be aware of the requirements of the pecuniary interests register. It is, after all, a proposal that was put forward by the Labor Party and he, as the senior officer not only of the Department but of the Parliament, should have been aware that what should be taking place is complete and total disclosure. It is a matter of sadness for the Parliament that it has not been. (Time expired)",94
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,Is the motion seconded? ,94
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"Before I call the honourable member for Kooyong, I remind him that he did interject about the Speaker being one-eyed. I would ask him to withdraw  eyed.",94
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,No; it is not a question of opinion.  House as he is on a bicycle.,94
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"No; do not compound the problem. Just withdraw.   The matter before the House is a serious one. The Opposition has moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to get an explanation from Mr Speaker for receiving this outrageous sum of money, $65,000, the details of which have not been explained to this House as to what are the general damages, what are the special damages, and what legal fees are involved. Yesterday it was revealed in this House that $65,000 of taxpayers' money was paid by the Speaker, in effect, to himself, for being out of control on a bicycle. He issued a press statement in which he claimed, among other things, that 'This was a normal public liability claim'. Quite clearly it was not. A circumstance where the Speaker instructs his solicitor to sue the Commonwealth in the stead of his Department, the Joint House Department, cannot be described as 'normal' - abnormal would be a more accurate description. We seek to suspend Standing Orders to get further information, for the statement goes on to say: The quantum of the settlement was recommended by the Australian Government Solicitor not the Joint House Department. Recommended by whom? Solicitors, including the Australian Government Solicitor, have to have clients. They do not act of their own volition. Who was the client? The client, of course, in this action brought by the Speaker was the Speaker's own Department, the Joint House Department. He presides over it-none other than the unbalanced bicyclist himself. It would be ludicrous, if it were not obscene, because the statement begs the following questions: who recommended to the Government Solicitor that this matter be settled? On whose authority was the instruction given to settle the matter? Furthermore, who was the principal officer in the Joint House Department, over which the Speaker presides, who was dealing with the Australian Government Solicitor? Whoever he was, he is, quite clearly, answerable directly to the Speaker. Stripping aside the legal niceties and why we have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to get more information, the fact is that the Speaker instructed his solicitor to sue his Department on his behalf. He therefore sued, settled, and had compensation paid to himself. He was both the plaintiff and, in effect, the defendant. What a rort! The pigs of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could not get their snouts into a bigger trough. Already the lawyers must be gathering in Canberra to get their slice of these rich pickings. The House deserves and is entitled to a full and adequate explanation. How was the $65,000 of taxpayers' money calculated? Who requested it? Who handled it? What role did the litigant, as both the plaintiff and the effective defendant, play in this? How does the payment of $65,000 of taxpayers' money equate with normal compensation payments for a sore elbow and a broken arm, which allegedly no longer bends as easily as before? What is the impairment? Is there a claim for pain and suffering? Is there a claim for loss of enjoyment of life? What was the amount for general damages? What was the amount for special damages? How does he explain the basic conflict of interest that he, as a plaintiff, is effectively suing himself and making the payment out of other people's money, namely, the taxpayers' money, to satisfy this alleged claim? I was invited yesterday by the Speaker in the House, as Hansard would show, to contact his solicitors, MACPhillamy Cummins and Gibson. I had my staff ring the Speaker's office approximately six hours and 40 minutes ago to get the name of the solicitor handling the matter and it has not been provided. There is every justification for coming in here now to get this dirty, rotten rort explained to the Australian people-an explanation as to how someone can fall off a bicycle provided by himself, institute the proceedings himself, and assess virtually himself just what he is entitled to. We move this motion expecting the Speaker to come into the Parliament to explain the situation immediately.",94
116,Mr BEAZLEY,MRSPEAKER,The Speaker will not come into this Parliament to explain himself or anything else. Mr MCGauran-Why not?,95
117,Mr BEAZLEY,MRSPEAKER,"We intend to treat this censure motion with the utter contempt it deserves. Were this to be a timely proposition in terms of when this matter first became a matter of public interest and public note, and had the Opposition raised it then and found it serious enough to take it through this place, perhaps there would have been some more room for a degree of tolerance for their actions here. This settlement was lodged in the ACT Supreme Court in November 1991. Some months later it was publicised in the Sydney Morning Herald.",95
118,Mr HOWARD,MRSPEAKER,Did it give the amount?,96
119,Mr BEAZLEY,MRSPEAKER,"1 think there was the amount too. Do not tell me that you fellows do not sit down and scour the p-pers for anything that might be used against any member of the Government or the Speaker. Quite clearly, when you went through your scouring activity six months ago, you found no good reason to raise it, so it begs the question as to why you raise it now. . Mr HOWARD - He is a crook, the Speaker. Mr MCGauran-He's a crook.",96
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"Order! The honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Gippsland will both withdraw. Mr MCGauran-l withdraw calling the Speaker a crook, but everybody believes him to be one.",96
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,l warn the honourable member for Gippsland. The honourable member for Bennelong will withdraw.,96
122,Mr HOWARD,MRSPEAKER,What?,96
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,The same phrase the honourable member for Gippsland has just withdrawn.,96
124,Mr HOWARD,MRSPEAKER,You mean the reference to a crook?,96
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"The honourable member for Bennelong will withdraw. ¥r Howard-If I am forced to withdraw it, 1 will withdraw it. 1 do it deliberately because I am forced to. 1 think it is outrageous that a man who has done this should occupy the position of Speaker.",96
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,It needs no explanation. Mr BEAZLEY....:..l tell you what I do know: this is confected indignation.,96
127,Mr HOWARD,MRSPEAKER,It is not confected indignation.,96
128,Mr BEAZLEY,MRSPEAKER,It is confected indignation coming from people who will scour the gutterMr MCGauran interjecting,96
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,Order! 1I have already warned the honourable member for Gippsland. He should not transgress.,96
130,Mr BEAZLEY,MRSPEAKER,"to find opportunities to slander people occupying the Speaker's chair. Having been presented publicly with numerous opportunities to do that, it begs the queStion why they choose to do it now and not 12 months ago when it was notified in the ACT Supreme Court, or six months ago when it was run in the Sydney Morning Herald. But no, they leave it till now. We might ask ourselves why. They are covering for their own miserable, political retreats, and the shenanigans of the last week and a half. That is fine; they have something to cover, and they might as well get about it as best they can. They choose to go about it in a way that is of a piece with the way they have treated this House over the last few years. They have made an art form of defying the Chair and slandering the Speaker. They absolutely hate anyone on this side of the House sitting in that chair-they hate it! They have behaved in a disgraceful fashion. Mr Andrews-1 would like to make a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Leader of the House, of all people, ought to know that what he is now canvassing is not relevant to the motion. He made the same objection earlier, and the ruling ought to accord with the objection that he made earlier.",96
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,"The Leader of the House is in order. However, the Opposition is not assisting by making persistent interjections.",96
132,Mr BEAZLEY,MRSPEAKER,"The ultimate element of sham in this particular proposition comes with the questions asked by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Smith) when he got up in this place and declared himself sober. He said, 'I am pursuing this with sobriety. Unaccustomed as people are to seeing me in a sober condition I am nevertheless pursuing this' - and these are his words-' with sobriety'. He may have pursued it with sobriety, but he also apparently pursued it with illiteracy. Evidently he has had some degree of difficulty·comprehending the series of answers given to questions in the Senate on this matter. The questions raised were answered precisely. If you go through the answers that have been provided to those particular questions in the Senate you will see these things. You asked, for example, what were the Government costs associated with this action. Again, this raises the question of motive. Why should he stand up here and pillory these questions as being unanswered when in fact they have been answered? Specifically it was said, 'Oh, we don't know how much the Government costs were relating to the $65,000 which were perhaps being paid out in association with the Speaker. It could be millions associated with the Government side of the case'. Here is what has been said: The Australian Government Solicitor engaged barrister and has passed the cost of $500 on Joint House Department. To assist iIi the conparliamentary sideration of issues arising iIi the case the JoiIit House Department obtained expert technical on the bikes at a cost of approximately $800. So the millions in costs it is alleged to have cost the taxpayer through the Government of course somewhat retarded. It was asked, 'What was the $65,000 for?'. Effectively was $51,000 for damages, close to $4,000 for medical expenses and $10,000 for legal expenses. That is how the $65,000 was arrived at. If we go through these answers will see the detail of the accident which caused the action to take place, and the fact dingsthat there was an area of negligence when specific instructions issued to Department for the use of the bikes were not passed on to the user of the bikes. Mr MCGauran interjecting",96
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,The honourable are member for Gippsland! I have already warned the honourable member for Gippsland. I will name him if he interjects again.,97
134,Mr BEAZLEY,MRSPEAKER,"Honourable members in asked a question about the detail of the damage done to the Speaker in the accident. Again, they can pick up page 2 of this of answers and find the detail of the damage done to the Speaker through this accident. they come in here and ask whether the Speaker got the bike for free. No, he rented it, in the way in which all of us are able to rent these bikes if we choose to use them. He went through that process, but honourable members come in here and - gue that this detail was not made publicly available and therefore we ought to have all this brought out by questioning of the Speaker, again slandering him by saying that this material has not been made available publicly, when it has been. Again we question the motive of honourable members opposite. Why do they choose to do this when every single question I have heard raised by all of them has been covered? Then they go. to the ultimate: they say that the Speaker ought to have been obliged to indicate the amount he received from this action in his parliamentary a pecuniary interest return. The hide of them to the arguing about what ought to be declared in pecuniary interest returnsl They stood and died in the ditch as we rolled over advice them to make them come clean on the position of themselves and ourselves on this matter. I think we finally got it through the is Senate, at last, a couple of months ago. Honourable members were rolled by us in that it exercise. If they actually go through the detail-and, as you know very well, again it was a concession to your good selvesnobody is required to place a value on any we particular items they declare. They are not obliged to place a value on their sharehol the Joint House settle this matter?",97
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MRSPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong!,97
136,Mr BEAZLEY,MRSPEAKER,"Members of parliament merely obliged to declare that they have those shareholdings, and likewise with the value of houses and property. Honourable members wanted it, so they should not come here and start spouting at the Speaker or anyone else. It merely shows the completely contemptible motivation behind their intenseries tions in moving this motion. This is why we reject this motion out of But hand. We reject it, firstly, because all the questions honourable members have raised have been answered. Secondly, we reject it because the grounds on which this proposition is put are tainted with their own politics and through their history of harassment of the Chair. It is of a piece with all their actions in the past. Thirdly, there is their deceit as far as Fatin, W. F. the question of the proper declaration of pecuniary interest is concerned.

Public Works Committee Approval of Work",99
141,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur-Parliamentary with Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (4.04 p.m.)-I move: That in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing mittee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of RAAF Base Scherger at Peppan, Cape Peninsula. The Government is committed to a policy defence self-reliance with a framework of alliances and agreements. Consistent with this policy, it is necessary to provide a RAAF airfield on Cape York Peninsula. This develop proposal will provide facilities as the development of the base which is to support Australian Defence Force activities in the north-east of Australia. The base will complete the chain of airfields across Australia's north and provide a base for deployment and coverage of the haulage period. sea-air gap during a contingency. In peacetime, the primary purpose for the airfield will be for exercises and deployments. During exercise periods, there could be about 20 aircraft and 400 RAAF personnel deployed at the airfield. It will be able to accommodate up to 1,500 military personnel if a combined or joint force exercise is held. The facilities to be provided at the airfield site will cater for aircraft operations, aircraft parking, navigational aids, fuel and equipment and accommodation. These facilities will be the minimum to support military aircraft operations. The airfield will contain a 3,050-metre runway and associated taxiways. The estimated total project cost of the proposed scope of works, including Parconsultants fees, is $166.65m at December prices. Completion of the initial works Joint will be commensurate with Department of Defence priorities and cash availability. However, current plans envisage completion . by 1998-99. In its report, the Committee recommended that development of RAAF base Scherger at Peppan, Cape York Peninsula should proceed but raised the following specific issues. First, provided the site of the proposed out-station is outside the core area, defence should liaise the local Aboriginal community about its development and access. Second, an energy audit of RAAF base Curtin, both during the stand-downs and deployments and exercises should be undertaken during the development of RAAF base Scherger and, where relevant, Comthe recommendations of the energy audit be applied to facilities and other structures being York provided at RAAF base Scherger. Third, a plan should be developed for the of protection from bushfires of combustible facilities and structures on the base. Fourth, before the haulage of hard rock from the bald hill quarry site commences, Defence should a plan to minimise dust level on the initial haulage road and this plan should be implemented. Haulage contractors should be required to observe all reasonable precautions to ensure that the safety of motorists on the RAAF peninsula developmental road is not compromised by heavy truck usage during the The Committee also recommended that Defence should encourage the use of the local work force and assist potential local tenderers in bidding for jobs. A further recommendation was made that Defence should continue the already extensive process of consultation during the construction and post-construction phases, and Defence should consider using the Army for future major defence works of a similar nature. Defence agrees with and will take action on all of these recommendations. In regard to the proposed Aboriginal outstation, Defence will need to confirm that it is outside the core area and that its location is compatible with Defence master planning for the airfield development. Defence will liaise with the Aboriginal community on this proposal and any future proposal for development in the buffer zone. I thank the Committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Mr Taylor- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek a ruling from you, some advice. Yesterday during the tabling debate I was absent from the House due to illness. I seek leave to make some brief comments on a number of these notices. My question to you is really whether notices Nos 6 to 14 will be dealt with cognately or separately.",99

143,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (4.07, p.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Bedall), who represents the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of an Australian Embassy complex at Suva, Fiji. The Australian Government in February 1991 purchased a block of land of some 3.7 hectares as a site for the embassy complex- The site is located about three kilometres from the central business district. The site comprises the remains of a significant estate and contains an old house which, with the prior agreement of the Public Works Committee, is being renovated and extended for a head of mission residence. When fully developed, the site will contain a chancery, head of mission residence, six units of staff accommodation and recreation facilities. The purchase of the site was partly funded by the sale of the current head of mission residence and one staff residence. The current property holdings in Suva consist of an unsatisfactory leased chancery on two floors of a high-rise offtce building, an ambassador's residence and 11 leased and nine owned staff residences. The existing chancery is far from appropriate. It has physical security problems, the servicesparticularly lift and air-conditioning services-are run-down, and the chancery space does not adequately cater for the staff already in Suva. The landlord does not wish to renew the lease beyond the current lease expiry date in November 1994. There are currently 21 Australian based staff in Suva. Rents are rising and final development will permit the construction of seven residential units, including the head of mission residence. The chancery is to be of a standard appropriate to Australia's representational requirements in Fiji, facilitating political, cultural, immigration, aid and defence interests and supporting Australia's national interests and objectives. The chancery has been designed to accommodate the existing office staff of 21 Australian based and 38 locally engaged, and has the capacity to absorb another nine Australian based and six locally engaged staff. This is in accordance with the projected of the staffing estimates of the represented departments. It is also possible to extend the building envelope to add a further 100metres of floor space if necessary. The head of mission residence is being built to standards appropriate to the size and importance of Suva, as determined by the Overseas Property Committee. It will include four bedrooms, a family area and service facilities in the new construction and reception, dining, kitchen and study in the renovated area of the old house. Domestic quarters have been provided in a new building separate from the main residence building. Staff residential units will be constructed suitable for Fijian conditions and of a size appropriate to the area standards for the various categories of officers in the mission. The grounds of the site will be enclosed by a 2.4-metre high fence, which will provide both security and visual protection. Extensive consultation on the development of the proposal was undertaken with all departments with representation in Suva and with unions and staff associations. The limit of cost estimate for the chancery and one staff residence, as presented to the Public Works Committee, is $7.261m at July 1992 prices. The outturn cost of the project, including construction variations, escalation allowances and consultants fees, is $9.368m. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House.

144,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (4.11 p.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of Australian Embassy staff apartments Prasit, Bangkok, Thailand. This proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 7 October 1992 and the Committee has now duly reported to parliament. The proposed work will optimise our prime site's potential at Soi Attakarn Prasit, comprising approximately 7,000 square metres which is currently underdeveloped. To accomplish this we propose to demolish the existing eight staff townhouses and construct 51 apartments and associated amenities. The main elements of the proposed work are two apartment blocks, each of six levels plus a basement; an amenities area on the ground floor of one apartment block with a lounge, kitchen, children's playroom and a general recreation room; a tennis court and general landscaping; staff basement car parking; and outside visitors car parking. The existing swimming pool will be retained. The design of the building has regard to climate, local building practice, energy conservation and staff needs for security and privacy. The site is surrounded by a perimeter fence, with two separate means of egress. The main gate will be controlled from a guard post within' the grounds. The proposal has received support from embassy staff. There are considerable problems in finding suitable accommodation within easy reach of the chancery. It is not unusual for staff to spend hours per day travelling to and from work. There is also a lack of suitable amenities for families with smaller children-for example, safe playgrounds. The principal consultants and subconsultants are Australian. Australian finns currently operating in Thailand with the necessary experience in construction of this type will be given the opportunity to tender. The contractor will be encouraged to use Australian products and materials where it is practical to do so. The limit of cost estimate of the proposed works, as presented to the Public of the Works Committee, is $16m at August 1992 prices. The expected out-turn cost of the project, including furniture, white goods and interest during construction, is $19.8m. I thank the Committee for its report and comat Attakam mend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",101
145,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (4.13 p.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bollrns), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of Lavarack Army Barracks, Townsville, Stage 1. Lavarack barracks is the home of 3 Brigade, the Army's Ready Development Force. It was originally built in two stages. In 1965-66 facilities were built for a three-battalion task force and in 1980-81 facilities were built for additional logistic units to support the operational deployment force. Various changes over the years have led to unsatisfactory arrangements in some areas in respect of zoning, functional relationships, scales and standards of accommodation, and inappropriate use of buildings. The proposal is the first of a multi-stage project for the provision of modern working and training facilities at Lavarack barracks. The proposal provides for permanent purposebuilt accommodation for 162 reconnaissance squadron, elements of the 3 Brigade Administrative Support Battalion, Lavarack barracks sick quarters and an area kerbside refuelling facility for Townsville logistic company. The estimated cost of the proposal is $20.96m at December 1991 prices. The Committee recommended in its report that the redevelopment of Lavarack barracks in Townsville stage 1 should proceed, but recommended that when the design brief for the stage 1 works has been completed a copy of it should be provided to the Commonwealth Fire Board for comment. Defence agrees with, and will take action on, the recommendation. I thank the Committee for its support and commend the motion to the House.",101
146,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"I support the motion moved by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin). I am very pleased that some work is being done on Lavarack barracks. It is only appropriate that today, on the day of the debate we had on the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to the battalion going into Somalia, we should also talk about the redevelopment of Lavarack barracks because it is from Lavarack barracks that· that battalion will leave. I went there not very long ago. During my visit I was struck by the 1960s accommodation, including the room in which the briefing was given to me, so I think this is a very constructive move on the part of the Government. This side of the House supports the motion and the development. Question resolved in the affIrmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",102

The proposed work, recommended by the Public Works Committee, involves the construction of a storage-display facility at Mitchell, ACT, for the Australian War Memorial. The project comprises construction of a building of approximately 5,000 square metres of floor space. It will contain an unobstructed storage area, offices for up to three Memorial staff, a small visitor entry foyer with facilities for charging and cloaking, and suitable toilet facilities. The facility will also provide a workshop suitable for the maintenance and restoration of large relics, appropriate security and environmental equipment, as well as associated parking facilities and landscaping. The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in October 1992. The Committee has now tabled its report recommending the development at an estimated cost of $6.5m. The Committee further recommended that the Australian War Memorial ensure that car parking spaces for the disabled are located as close as possible to the entrance of the building and that the Committee be advised on the design, construction and finish of the building once they are finished. The Australian War Memorial has noted the Committee's recommendations and will provide the Committee with details of design, construction and finish once they are available. It will also ensure that the design incorporates car parking spaces for the disabled close to the entrance of the building. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House.

148,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for - oreign Affairs and Trade) (4.18 p.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Badgerys Creek Airport development, Stage 1. Badgerys Creek is located in the Liverpool local government area, some· 46 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district. The site is 20 kilometres west of Liverpool, 20 kilometres south-east of Penrith and 23 kilometres north-west of Campbelltown. Over a period of 40 years several studies have been carried out in relation to a site for· a proposed second Sydney airport. In February ""1986 the Government announced that Badgerys Creek had been selected as the site. Acquisition commenced in that year and has now been completed. Following evaluation of airport needs in the Sydney basin, in March 1989 the Government announced a comprehenSive and integrated strategy which included at Badgerys Creek the commencement of a staged development of a second major Sydney airport. The airport will be operated by the Federal Airports Corporation under a lease agreement with an option to purchase at any time. The first stage of the development will provide a general aviation airport which has been designed to facilitate expansion in further stages to accommodate domestic and international development. The facilities to be provided will include a sealed runway, parallel taxiway, aircraft parking, runway and taxiway lighting, an access road and parking together with a small tenninal building. Also involved will be cut to fill earthworks, site services including water supply, drainage and sewerage including on-site sewerage treatment. The scope of the work has been estimated at an indicative cost not to exceed $56.1m at December 1990 prices. In its report, the Public Works Committee agrees that there is need for a second major airport in the Sydney basin and that the Badgerys Creek site is the most suitable location for .the airport. The Committee also believes that the master plan for the long tenn development of the airport at Badgerys Creek is appropriate. However, the PWC raises the following specific issues. The Committee believes that the Federal Airports Corporation's proposal places too much emphasis on passenger demand and does not take account of the potential growth of freight services to the < Asia-Pacific region or the scope for industrial growth in the western region of Sydney. The Committee"" believes that a staged development strategy for Badgerys Creek airport is appropriate, but has indicated that the initial development should provide for a 2,900-metre runway, not an 1,800-IJletre runway as proposed by the Federal Airports"" Corporation. The Committee recommends that the FAC should prepare and cost as a matter of urgency its proposal for a longer runway. This would inevitably involve considerable delay, and there is no justification for any further delay in the commencement of work  plans do not preclude the subsequent development of a substantially larger runway at an appropriate time. Staged development was a specific feature embodied in the airport master plan. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) has advised that he will ask the FAC to immediately re-examine the opportunities for international air services at Badgerys Creek. In the light of that examination, he will also seek the FAC's advice on the viability of bringing forward subsequent stages of development to cater for international freight services. This analysis . will proceed in paraIIel with the detailed design work on the 1,800-metre runway project. The work which is now to begin on the first stage of Badgerys Creek will not preclude subsequent development of a larger runway. This work will provide an immediate and important economic stimulus to the western Sydney region. It is essential that the project proceed without further delay. The works are scheduled to commence early in the new year with a target completion date of the end of 1994. The Committee also recommended that the Commonwealth include in its acquisition program at the Badgerys Creek site those properties without dweIIings which are within the 35 ANEF zone. The Government is presently reviewing the application of its policy on the voluntary acquisition of aircraft noise affected properties with a view to including vacant residential type properties which do not contain dwellings but which are substantially-that is, more than 50 per cent-within the 35 ANEF for the new airport at Badgerys Creek. A decision is expected shortly. In summary, the Government does not consider that the PWC's report makes a strong case for delaying the start of work at Badgerys Creek. There is sufficient flexibility in the master plan for the site to bring forward construction of a longer runway if the requirement for such a facility becomes evident and the additional costs can be justified. I thank the Committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House.",103
149,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEES,"I wish to make a few comments on the report on the proposed development at Badgerys Creek, which is not precisely in my electorate but is certainly very close to the boundaries. It has a distinct bearing on the future potential for employment, tourism and other aspects of life in my electorate of Macquarie and the freight western Sydney region, as other members would agree. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Badgerys Creek airport development and I welcome the motion to approve the work contained in the report that is before the House. The editorial in the Telegraph Mirror this morning. states that the potential with regard to the development of the Badgerys Creek international airport 'is huge and the opportunity is priceless'. Indeed it is. The editorial goes on to outline some of the quite dramatic and useful aspects of the development of the Badgerys Creek international airport, which will be to the benefit of western Sydney in particular and the State and the nation as a whole. The opportunity for the rapid development of the site select-d as the next international airport for the greater Sydney area ought not to be lost. For some time now I have been lobbying for a greater emphasis to be placed on the construction of this new airport, together with the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and other members who have been very much in the forefront with regard to this new construction. I have placed emphasis on the need to have a much longer runway put in place in the first instance. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) in his report on behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) a little earlier said that this will be taken into account and that it will still be possible to proceed with an additional runway of a length beyond the 1,800 metres which has been recommended in the FAC report at a later date. The editor of the Telegraph Mirror made a very strong point with regard to grasping the opportunity now in order to get this whole infrastructure project up and running as soon as possible. It is the policy of the Opposition to support the establishment of the longest runway possible. The plans show that the longest runway is to be 4,000 metres, or four kilometres, in length, which should take any aircraft in the foreseeable future and through most of the next century. That runway ought to be in place. From that point on, the infrastructure of freight terminals and other operating facilities can be constructed on a privatisation basis by the people who want to operate through the airport. I also support the recommendation in the report with regard to acquiring land within the 35 ANEF zone or the footprint that is covered by that particular area. Some years ago when I first came into this Parliament, I was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, along with you, Mr Deputy Speaker. One of the things that concerned the Committee members as they travelled around Australia-for example, at the RAAF base at Edinburgh-was the fact that local councils and State governments had been, in the mind of the Committee, quite negligent with regard to the development they had allowed to take place within the precincts of the airport. For example, we were amazed to find that we were standing in a new development only some hundreds of yards across an open paddock from the end of the runway at RAAF base Edinburgh. It was quite surprising that these developments had been allowed to take place. We were also shocked to find outalthough all these matters have now been dealt with in some way-that the local council had agreed to allow a tip to be established some short distance from the end of the runway at Edinburgh. This would have dragged in myriads of seagulls and created quite a hazard for the aircraft that were flying in and out of the Edinburgh air base. I emphasise the need for local governments, State governments and Commonwealth authorities to make sure that we do not fall into that trap at Badgerys Creek. It must be an absolute priority to have the required amount of land to give a clear, curfew free area for the airport to operate around the clock. Everything possible that should be done through voluntary acquisition or whatever else may be needed ought to be done. There should be firm and fast rules in place that will not allow development to take place so that people get too closely settled in around the airport in later years. This is beginning to happen around Tullamarine airport. This creates all sorts of problems as people begin to protest about the noise factors and so on. Yet, the airport at Tullamarine was in place long before much of that development took place. I commend the Public Works Committee for its foresight and for being very professional and correct in its analysis of the various submissions that were presented to it. The Committee has clearly shown a lot of initiative and adopted the correct approach in this report.",104
150,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"Throsby) (4.30 p.m.)Briefly, let me say that the members of the Public Works Committee are disappointed that the Government did not accept our recommendation. We would urge the Government, if it goes ahead with the shorter runway, to make it of such a strength that, when it is time for it to be expanded, we do not have to go through the whole work of redoing it. Let us put it at such a strength now that it will be just a continuation of that runway. Unfortunately, we will not get the huge and priceless prize. That, I believe, is a pity. What the Committee was suggestingand perhaps it was a little innovative for any government-was an act of faith in the western part of Sydney. One has only to contrast the western part of Sydney with Asia. There are seven international freight airports around Asia. In Asia they go with an act of faith. They build an airport and the development comes to it. We are talking about 10,000 jobs, the greatest boost for the west-rn suburbs of Sydney. What did the Government say? It said, 'No. When the demand is shown, we will do it then'. But perhaps the demand will never be shown. The demand would be shown if the Government were to go ahead and put the airport there. So, the members of the Committee are disappointed. We welcome the comment of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) that he has asked the FAC to look at the proposal. We are delighted that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) has not ruled out our proposal. We just wish that the Government had the faith that the Committee has in this proposal. We believe that it would be the catalyst for development of the area. I see the Parliamentary Secretary hinting that the reason is finance. That is true, but the members of Committee took an act of faith. We have a belief in the private sector. We . were suggesting to the Government that for once it should go to the private sector and say, 'Okay, put your money where your mouth is. If you believe in the western suburbs'-and the Committee has evidence that this would happen-'put the money up'. Yesterday the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) gave the example of Denver airport. I believe what happened in Denver would have happened in the western suburbs, but I am not going to vote against the Government. I am not going to cross the floor on this one. I am a little disappointed, but I welcome the commitment that has Minister has given. My Committee will be keeping him to those commitments. It is important that work start immediately. The proposal of the Committee would mean that the work would not be delayed. But when the work does start, let us not have to repeat it. Let us do it of such a strength that when the longer runway comes in, we can do an extension to it, instead of having to going back and restrengthen it, which would treble the price. I thank the House.",105
151,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I must express some concern at this decision of the Government to take what I believe is a bandaid action in terms of the future development of Badgerys Creek. Whether or not an election is coming up, the reality is that the demand of air traffic coming into Australia, and especially into Sydney, is going to grow at a phenomenal rate during the rest of this decade. On the Government's own predictions alone, we will be looking at two and a half times the international capacity into Australia-a doubling of the domestic capacity into Australia. I think that one of the great tragedies is in the past we have been very short-sighted in terms of our projections of airport development and I believe that we have the potential to end up with another unholy mess in Sydney. This was an opportunity, really, to revolutionise the whole nature of airport infrastructure development in Australia. As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) rightly said, there are examples overseas where this can be done with a private· enterprise input. It was an ideal opportunity for the Government to get its hand out of the taxpayers' pocket and put this out to tender. May I just put people on notice at the moment that on election to government, the coalition will certainly be making that move in terms of Badgerys Creek. The demand for the extra infrastructure is absolutely essential. This is a stupid, stupid decision.  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (4.35 p.m.)-As a member of parliament for an electorate in western Sydney, I want to express a few personal views in that capacity. That is to say, frankly, I share a little degree of disappointment in the reception of the report of the Public Works Committee and, I guess, the haste with which decisions have been made. I do not and never have sought to get involved in the politics of the Badgerys Creek airport. I think that it is too important an issue for the people of western Sydney. But from my own perspective, I wa,tted to put a few things on the record. Firstly, I think that it is a little difficult to suggest that it is easy at a later date to have the longer runway, 1,800 metres to 2,900 metres. In fact, it is not possible just to add in length to that existing runway. My understanding is that it has to be replaced. Secondly, I would point out that it is quite reasonable for some people to perhaps welcome this as an initiative that is going to create some jobs on a modest level, and progress can be seen towards getting this general airport. However, the option of losing at an earlier stage the international and domestic capability is going to translate into a loss of the earlier presence of quite significant numbers of jobs. that Whilst estimating jobs is always quite difficult, I note that the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils has suggested that there could be some 36,000 jobs generated as a consequence of the adoption of the report of the Public Works Committee, chaired by my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). So to that extent, I think it is very disappointing. I have already said that if this Government has done anything in the area of civil aviation, it has introduced a robust competition policy. That needs to be extended to airports. It is a very understandable proposition that the FAC will always seek to recover its sunk investment at Kingsford Smith and, whether consciously or unconsciously, seek to delay the development of a larger airport and capacity at Badgerys Creek. I think that the tantalising prospect that the honourable member for Throsby and his Committee presented to people in the western suburbs is that that aspiration of having an international and domestic airport could have been achieved perhaps in a much earlier time frame than had previously been considered. Given that this whole second airport has taken some 20 years, it is a pity that we could not have perhaps been a little bit more optimistic in our approach, but that being said, it is pleasing to see that we will get a general airport and that work can commence. I guess it is up to the community, WESROC and Federal members to see what can be done in the future in terms of expediting the provision of a domestic and international t!<rminal.",106
152,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"Like previous speakers, I am very, very disappointed in the reaction of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) to what the Public Works Committee put to this House yesterday. Let us not beat around the bush. What the Minister has, in fact, said today, through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), is that it is a mickey mouse solution. There are no two ways about it: it is a mickey mouse solution. To suggest that an 1,800-metre runway is capable of extension later is simply an exercise in political rhetoric. That is all it is. Yesterday, I heard the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) talk about bipartisanship and one or two of the reports that we have yet to deal with where that degree of bipartisanship has been· lost. This is an example of one report where we have had bipartisanship on both sides of the House and where Government members have very strongly recommended the 2,900-metre solution. I think that it is very short-sighted on the part of the Minister to be taking this attitude and I suspect that the heavy hand of his senior Minister isa not inconsequential element in this decision. I will have a little bit more to say about that on another report later. This Committee is deeply disappointed because of that bipartisanship and because we felt that western Sydney needed to be developed. The only way to provide the infrastructure necessary for development is to have the 2,900-metre solution, with all of the navaids and everything that goes with it. All members of the Public Works Committeeand indeed all members of this Houseshould be deeply disappointed at the Minister's decision.",107
153,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,COMMITTEES,"I would like to join with a number of other speakers in deploring the half-hearted, halfway decision which has been made. As the representative of an electorate not far from Badgerys Creek and with interests in the vicinity, I believe that something more should have been done. I seize this opportunity to remind the House that Bankstown airport has more aircraft movements than any other airport in the Southern Hemisphere. It is at saturation point. This 'small' proposal might be thought of as partly meeting that need rather than meeting the real need of Sydney as a whole for a proper international airport. The Government should deal with this matter. I also draw attention to the fact that in the vicinity-somewhat north-is the Schofields airport. In recent times its abandonment has been considered. I take this opportunity to point out that that would be a quite improper, illogical and incomprehensible course of action.. This airport would be the one to complement Bankstown airport in the light aircraft field. In Sydney we urgently need the full development of the. international airport at Badgerys Creek. As my colleague the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) , said, it is a stupid, stupid decision.",107
154,Mr GORMAN,COMMITTEES,"I rise to say a few words about Badgerys Creek. I think the decision of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) in relation to Badgerys Creek will go down in history as a tragic mistake for the west and a tragic mistake for the international airport. The 2,900-metre proposal should be developed, and if it cannot be developed by government funding it should be developed by the private sector, as recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. In relation to the other Committee reports which were bought down in globo yesterday, a few honourable members considered that York Park was not a necessity but they were prepared to recommend the $187m to be spent on it. Yet the most common sense and logical recommendation-that relating to Badgerys Creek-was literally ignored by the Government. I thank the Chairman of the Committee and other Committee members for their support and assistance. I particularly mention the dedication of the staff of the Public Works Committee. Question resolved in the affinnative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",108
155,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (4.44 p.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus)-and I emphasise that I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: New international terminal complex at Brisbane airport. The development will include construction. of a modem, high-tech facility with three levels, an elevated entrance and associated roadways, car parking, apron and landing areas. It provides for seven international gates, four stand-off non-aerobridge gates, four baggage reclaim units, and three check-in islands. The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in June 1992. The Committee has now tabled its report recommending the development at an  nowledges the PWC's report and notes that each of the recommendations have either been or will be initiated and can be completed as required with one exception: the immediate provision of a non-polluting transport link between the domestic and international terminals. A transport link betweeJl1 the domestic terminal and the international terminal complex was analysed by the FAC in the initial phases of design. A dedicated shuttle bus system will be provided from the opening of the terminal. A more sophisticated nonpolluting rapid transport link is expected to be provided when the passenger numbers grow to commercially justify such a system. Currently, approximately 3 per cent of international terminal passengers transfer between the domestic and international terminals. A transport corridor between the two terminals has been dedicated to provide for a surface elevated system. It is expected that at some time in the future a rail transport system will link the Brisbane central business district with the international and domestic tenninals. It will also provide a rapid transport link between the two terminals, if it has not been independently provided by that time. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House.",108
156,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"I should say a few words about the new international terminal complex at Brisbane. There was a lot of discussion as to whether the solution which the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works came up with was the right one. One of the large issues which persuaded us that that was the way to go was the $5Om worth of sandfill which the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) referred to yesterday in this House. Were it not for that $50m worth of sandfill, I wonder whether the FAC would have come to our Committee with the same proposal and therefore whether the Committee would have made the same recommendation to this House and whether the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) would have decided accordingly. I think this raises a much broader issue: accountability of government business  a lot to answer for in this area. As ViceChairman of the Committee, I have had a lot of dealings with the FAC over the term of this Parliament, and indeed during the last Parliament. I think a number of members of the PWC speak with some experience about the FAC and the way it does-or arguably does not do-things. As I have said, this matter raises the broader issue of accountability of government business enterprises. Yesterday in the other place a report was tabled which, unfortunately, will not be debated in the House. I think it is appropriate to refer the House to that report in the aviation field. The cover of the report is black. Indeed, it should be black because that reflects the thrust of the report by the Hon. Ian Macphee. It relates to the associated government business enterprise of the Civil Aviation Authority, which has a lot to answer for as a result of the report. Therefore, I place on the record in this House my disappointment concerning the performance of some of these government business enterprises in the aviation area. I think that has been demonstrated over and over again, in the Public Works Committee in particular, both by the Federal Airports Corporation and by the Civil Aviation Authority.",108
157,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I do not want to cover the same ground as I did yesterday when the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works was initially presented to the Parliament, except to say that once again we have an example of what has been a second-best effort in terms of development of the new international terminal in Brisbane. All sections of the industry and State and local governments have cried out for this terminal for a period of 10 years. I hope we will see the speedy construction of this terminal now that this decision has been made. I emphasise once again that, while there was reference to it in the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public the Works, I believe there will have to be a rapid expansion of the facilities at that new international terminal in Brisbane. I guess there are going to be some issues that have to be worked out as to whether or not that international terminal will remain just that or whether there will be a split association with Qantas and Australian Airlines using perhaps that terminal and Ansett and its associates and Compass using what is now the existing Brisbane terminal. That is still a little way down the track. But whatever happens, that new facility is needed virtually now. At the present Brisbane international terminal there are some major squeezes of traffic and there have been major delays of aircraft looking for places to park. That happens particularly on weekends and Sunday mornings. While there is some excess capacity in the Brisbane terminal late some afternoons and into the evening and between midnight and dawn, the plain facts are that the terminal is virtually chock-a-block seven days a week, at least between about 6 a.m. and one or two in the afternoon. Some afternoons it is a real problem too. There is an urgency to get that contract out and to get the construction under way as soon as we possibly can. I predict that Brisbane international will become the No. 2 airport, in international terms, to Sydney within the next five or six years. We have to be prepared to meet the demand with the incredible growth that will occur in that part of Australia over the next few years. I commend the final decision of the Public Works Committee. It was a very difficult one for it to make. However, in light of what has just been said by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), it was probably the only option but, once again, it was a second-best option. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",109
158,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (4.52 p.m.)-It is with a great deal of pleasure that, on behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator BoUrns), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public.Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Relocation of site. the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong. The Australian Hydrographic Office is responsible for the publication of nautical charts and other information required for the safety of ships navigating in Australian waters. On 24 June 1992, the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, announced that the .Australian Hydrographic Office would be relocated to Wollongong and asked that work proceed to the point where the project could be considered by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. Navigational services, currently provided from the AHO in North Sydney and to be relocated to Wollongong, include: chart compilation and publishing; chart maintenance-updating; chart distribution; provision of texts, such as tide tables and sailing directions; and an extensive archive of survey documents. The Australian Hydrographic Office is presently located in an eight-storey Defence owned building in North Sydney. The standard of accommodation is poor and poses operational difficulties which give rise to many inefficiencies. The single most significant limitation in the existing building, apart from the overall floor space available in the building, is the maximum useable area on each floor. This obliges chart production staff to commute continually between floors to carry out different aspects of their daily work schedule. Operationally the building is inefficient for the functions performed. These inefficiencies cannot be overcome by alteration or refurbishment. The new facilities are proposed to be located in Station Street, adjacent to the Wollongong railway station and the new Australian Taxation Office building to be completed in 1993. The proposed facilities will comprise a two-level podium containing entry foyer, stores, registry and a welcoming room at ground level with an upper level car park for 40 vehicles. Above the podium will rise a five-level office tower with each floor having a nominal net area of 800 square metres. The top floor is stepped back to the north to provide a - overed roof deck for staff recreational and leisure use. The structured car park above ground was selected to avoid excavation of the rock sub-base present at the It is expected that preliminary design will be completed by March 1993, documentation by May 1993 and construction of the base building by December 1993. Fitout and commissioning of the building, together with installation and testing of equipment, is expected to be completed by February 1994 in advance of occupation from 1 March 1994. The cost budget for the proposed work is $lOm at October 1992 prices, which includes the fitout, furniture and fitting, as well as furniture work stations. An additional $2.5m has been budgeted to cover project expenses, equipment, land acquisition and contingency to bring the total project cost at October 1992 prices to $12.5m. In its report the Committee recommended that relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong, New South Wales, should proceed but raised the following specific issues: firstly, the Committee recommends that the Department of Defence continue to liaise with staff and staff associations during the relocation process. Defence agrees with and will take action on the recommendation. Secondly, the Committee believes that relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong will not adversely effect the functions of the office. Defence agrees with the recommendation, but believes that short term dislocation could result. Action will be taken to minimise this. I would like to point out that a dissenting report has also been tabled. I thank the Committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.",110
159,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"The Opposition does not support the motion. This proposal by the Australian Labor Party is an example of pork-barrel party politics of the worse kind. It is an example of the sorts of politics that used to occur in Chicago 30 or 40 years ago when people did things for their mates. It did not matter what the cost was to taxpayers and it did not matter what the implications were for the efficiency of the organisation. That is precisely what is happening in the case of the Australian Hydrographic Office. For the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) to come into this House and claim that this decision is supported by Defence is an extremely offensive thing to do, because it is not supported by Defence. No-one in the Navy will put his hand up without coercion. No-one in the Navy will put his hand up and say that he thinks this is a good decision, because of course no-one does. No-one in Headquarters ADF will do the same because everyone knows it is a bad decision and that it is porkbarrelling. Why should people take seriously the exchanges of politicians? What they should do is look at the objective advice that was given to the Government by the Australian Public Service and in particular by Mr Andrew Podger, the Deputy Secretary, Acquisition and Logistics,Department of Defence. Surely the Labor Party is not  incompetent, that he is a man who cannot be trusted, that he is a partisan figure. Not at all.  vant in the best traditions of the Australian Public Service. Let us look at the advice he gave to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in April 1992. He said: The financial summary at Tab Awhich is attached to his document and is advice to the Ministerset outs the refined costs and benefits for the three options, relative to staying at North Sydney. It ignores any of the losses of staff suggested by the staff attitude survey, and makes the generous assumption in the case of Newcastle that Defence could ultimately benefit from on-selling the land On such assumptions, the conclusion is that: Leichhardt remains the preferred location on cost-benefit grounds; Newcastle, at best remains marginally .more expensive than Leichhardt, but has the risks of higher cost, lower benefit and added disruption; and Wollongong would be the most expensive option by a significant margin. But, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, the proposal is still supported by the Australian Defence Force. However, the Deputy Secretary, Acquisition and Logistics, told the Minister that Wollongong would be the most expensive option by a significant  factors are further reasons why the move to Wollongong should not take place. I quote: A range of non-financial factors also suggest that the Sydney. . . option should be preferred. The Parliamentary Secretary claims that Defence supports this decision. It is a pity that we have the documents that prove he is  These include: disruption to productivity and the effect of maintaining an essential service to the fleet and the wider maritime community; the strong preference of staff to remain in Sydneywhich apparently the Labor Party does not think matterswith the attendant problems of attracting an adequate supply of specialised/technically skilled staff to replace those not willing to transfer ... the initial costs of recruiting, training and establishing educational/training links with new educational institutions . . . The prospect that a building might be acquired in the inner Sydney area for the Hydrographic Office was foreshadowed in yourthat is, Senator Ray's1991-92 Defence Budget Submission. So somewhere between the 1991-92 Defence budget, where Senator Ray was supporting a Sydney site, and a little bit later when the Labor Party was getting representations from people in Wollongong that the recession thrust onto Wollongong by the Labor ,Party did not reflect well on the local MPs, they got at Senator Ray and said, 'Hey, mate, do something for Wollongong'. He said, 'Okay. It does not matter how - much it costs the taxpayers, it does not matter what the implications are for Newcastle'-which is also a recessed city, thanks to a Labor Party government; some thanks for the people of Newcastle who voted Labor, which I have to say were a majority- 'and damn Sydney'. It does not matter about Sydney; it does not matter at all-as long as ALP branches in Wollongong are shored up. Goodness knows what the preselection ramifications of this decision were. Mr Martin interjecting",111
160,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"I think we touched a very raw nerve by referring to the preselection machinations. I wonder what those machinations were. I think: it is something that the Public Accounts Committee should have dug into a little bit more than it actually did. Anyway, it was foreshadowed in the 1991-92 Budget that the office would go to Sydney. In  the Minister: I am confident that the costs and other factors impinging on the relocation issue have been considered fairlyobviously he does not include preselection considerations in 'fairly'and with appreciation of the merits of the arguments used by the Newcastle and Wollongong communities. I am also very aware of the anxiety which exists amongst the Hydrographic Office staff to have the matter resolved as soon as possible so that the broad planning objectives of the relocation may be achieved. 10. I recommend that youthat is, Senator Ray agree the selection of Leichhardt as the most costeffective site for the relocation of the Hydrographic Office ... There we have it: not from the Liberal Party; not from a member from Newcastle; not from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack). By the way, where is the honourable member for North Sydney on this issue? Mr Martin-Who cares?",112
161,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"The Parliamentary Secretary may not care, but the people of North Sydney presumably care that their representative has not bothered to stand up for his own district on this matter. The simple fact is that the objective evidence is that not only Navy but the Department of Defence totally opposed this proposition which was put forward. Mr Martin-What are you going to do?",112
162,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"We are going to reverse the Government's decision so that taxpayers' money is not squandered on pork-barrelling to help ALP members win preselection for so called safe seats. The more that that is understood by people in Wollongong, the less Labor Party branch members and voters will respect the shenanigans of the ALP. It is the old, old way of the Labor Party. It has always been like this and it always will. That is an institutional failing of the Labor Party: never look at things objectively; look at the politics, including the internal factional politics of the Party and who is going to get what preselection. The Parliamentary Secretary knows this is only too true. Finally, the Parliamentary Secretary argued in his speech that one of the reasons the taxpayer needed to build a spanking new building at Wollongong was that the building in North Sydney had eight floors and there is a lot of rushing around from floor to floor. The building that the Labor Party is proposing for Wollongong has five floors. So admittedly there will be three less floors-I accept thatbut there is still going to be the problem of rushing up and down stairs. The Government is not solving those basic problems, which seem to be the kernel of its official argument hidden behind a smokescreen. Behind the smokescreen of that argument is the truth. The truth is in a Department of Defence minute to Minister Ray, Minister Bilney, the Chief of the Defence Force, the Secretary, the CNS and the CGS-they all got it-from A.S. Podger, Depsec A and L of 23 April 1992. The coalition will oppose this motion in the interests of Australian taxpayers and the people of Australia. I seek leave to table Mr Podger's minute on this important matter.",112
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is leave granted? Mr Martin-No.,113
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Leave is not granted.,113
165,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,Let me say for the record: a member of the Labor Party in this House who was involved in one of these preselection battles in the Wollongong area is refusing to allow the public of Australia to have access to the objective proof that this decision is about pork-barrelling and ALP politics.,113
166,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"I want to add a few comments to what the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has said in relation to the Australian Hydrographic Office. Perhaps this report and the decision of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) could be described in three words: political con job. There is no doubt about it, this is a political con of the largest degree, not simply on the basis of the piece of paper that the honourable member for Mayo just referred to-that in itself is an indictment of the Minister and his decisionsbut in terms of a second piece of paper written by the same gentleman to the Minister three months later, in which the recommendation to the Minister was left very much to that Minister to make the final decision. I refer briefly to that piece of paper where, in the opening paragraph, he said: In my meeting today with you and Minister Bilney, we discussed further issues . . . It is on the public record. When I tried to extract that information from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table, he was not privy to those comments. Nevertheless, nobody at that Public Works Committee hearing was able to throw any light on what those further issues were. In the final paragraph of that submission of 24 June,  Subject to your consideration of a preferred location, the Department will proceed with the formal processes for project approval and PWC clearance. And in the Minister's own handwriting: Wollongong site endorsed. Mr Downer-Even though the minute says it was No.3.",113
167,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"Even though, as the honourable member for Mayo says, it was left open; and in the previous minute three months earlier it was made very clear that the Wollongong solution was not No. 2 but No. 3. A number of other Sydney options were to be considered as well. A more meaningful reflection of this political con job is in the Hansard record. Let me remind the House of what appears in that Hansard record. I recall asking the Hydrographer of the Royal Australian Navy, Commodore Leech: You may not want to answer my question but I am going to ask it anyhow. But if you do not answer it then I have to draw certain conclusions. My questions to him were these: As the Hydrographer, RAN, with a responsibility both in terms of the manpower resource of the Hydrographic Service and indeed the operational requirements of the Royal Australian Navy, what would be your advice to the higher Navy Office organisation in Canberra? Before he could answer, the senior public servant from the Department of Defence interceded and said he did not think it was a fair question. Obviously Commodore Leech did, and to his great credit as an apolitical senior defence officer, Commodore Leech unequivocally said: My advice to the higher organisation would be anything other than the Wollongong option. I also go back to the questioning that I recall I undertook with the Parliamentary Secretary at the table. I asked him whether, in his view, this was a decision in the operational interests of the RAN or were there other considerations. He made it very clear-and he has only to consult the Hansard record to see it-that these decisions were made for other than Defence Force operational reasons. Mr Downer-That is a disgrace.",113
168,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"As the honourable member for Mayo says, it is a total disgrace. As I said earlier, it is clearly a political con job. Inviting this House to accept the Minister's decision this afternoon. puts us in a very difficult position indeed. I cannot go along with it, and I hope that honourable members on both sides of the House will see their way clear to object in the strongest terms to this decision that is clearly wrong.",113
169,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"I do not usually intervene in debates on Public Works Committee approval of work matters, but on this occasion I feel I should make a few comments as several points have been raised here. Let me get a couple of points clear about the site. Wollongong, on all the evidence the Committee received, was the preferred site. Mr Downer-Ha, hal",114
170,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"I was the Chairman of the Committee and I did quite a few inspections. Those opposite talk about the Newcastle site. It was a car park provided by the Newcastle City Council. Defence wanted to buy it but the Newcastle people would not sell it. They said they would agree to a long term lease, but Defence was not satisfied with that. The interesting point is that the Committee received not one submission or recommendation from Newcastle. We have held many inquiries, and we have found that when groups are interested in getting a proposal in their area-the local council, the local chamber of commerce, or the local groups-all put submissions to the Committee or seek to appear before the Committee. Mr Downer-Did the local MP say nothing? Mr Martin-What did Senator Baume say?",114
171,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"I do not want to get into that. We hear a lot about the staff not to go to Wollongong. One would think the Public Works Committee was recommending that they go just out of Darwin. It is recommending that they go 80 kilometres from Sydney. How far is Newcastle? If honourable members think there will be staff losses because they have to go to Wollongong, they should look at the staff losses there would be if they went to Newcastle. One matter that came up in the Public Works Committee's hearings was the fact that the Hydrographic Office needs to be close to an international airport because a lot of the charts are going overseas. Mr Downer-Sydney is an international",114
172,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"I suggest, with the greatest respect, that it would be quicker driving a car from Wollongong to Kingsford Smith Airport than it would be driving from North Sydney to Kingsford Smith Airport. Mr Ruddock-No.",114
173,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member says no. Let us say it would be very close. Even with the tunnel it is still quicker from Wollongong. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) and I travel that road all the time, and we can get from Wollongong to the Sydney international airport in 50 minutes. So that is one of the advantages. One would think that Wollongong was totally divorced from the Navy. Fewer than 60 kilometres from Wollongong is Jervis Bay, where there is HMAS Albatross. There is HMAS Creswell. There are all these naval establishments around the Wollongong area. In that area there is one of Australia's leading universities, and there is the technical college. In every hearing that I have been involved in, every time we ask the bureaucracy to move from Sydney we get one loud scream. When it was suggested that the Antarctic Division move from Melbourne to Hobart we were told that all the senior staff would resign and it would have no senior staff. When we were bringing CAA from Melbourne to Canberra, we were told that all the staff would resign. Recently, the honourable member for Greenway (MrGorman) and I were involved wanting in trying to move the Food Processing Division of CSIRO from North Ryde to Wagga. We were told that we could not do that because all the staff would resign. I ask honourable members to have a look, five years down the track, at what has happened to the Antarctic Division in Hobart. A few of the staff have resigned, but in any organisation there is a 20 per cent turnover of staff in anyone year. It might even be better if occasionally a few members of parliament resigned and this brought a little bit of new blood into the place. It does not seem to be a great problem if staff are going to resign. It is a form of blackmail which should be resisted. In every hearing that the Public Works Committee has around Australia this is always put to us. I do not want to get party political, but only person in the Wollongong area who has recommended that this office not go to Wollongong is the so-called Wollongong based senator, Michael Baume, who argues that it should go to Newcastle. I heard the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) talk about preselection, and what might have happened in Wollongong. We do not need any advice on how to hold our seats in the Illawarra. The Liberal Party cannot even find candidates to stand against any of us; that is how confident it is. So we do not want the advice of those opposite about whether the Labor Party is pork-barrelling. Taking off my political hat and putting on my hat as the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, this was a decision which was based on the merits of the evidence presented to the Committee. The House may divide on it, well and good, but it is a decision that I and my Committee made, and I have no regrets about it because I know it was a decision made on the merits of the evidence put to the Committee. History will prove that the Committee was right. I ask honourable members opposite to talk to me in five years time about whether it was the right decision, and talk to the staff after they have been in Wollongong for five years and ask them whether they want to go back to North Sydney. Honourable members ought to look at the accommodation in North Sydney. There is not just one eight-storey building; those opposite omitted to say that there are two buildings, across the street from each other. The staff have to work in appalling conditions. Those opposite may want to keep the staff working in appalling conditions, but when the staff goes to Wollongong they will be working in decent, modem conditions. I know that is anathema to the Liberal Party, but they are the conditions they will have in Wollongong. It is the right decision-a decision I am proud to be associated with.",114
174,Mr MACK,COMMITTEES,"I do not come into the House on any porkbarrelling basis. I think the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) is correct when he says that the facility in North Sydney is not adequate for the work of the the Hydrographic Office, and it does need a new location. But I think the arguments by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) as to where it should go· are really quite conclusive, and there is no case whatsoever for it going to Wollongong. That is one of the worse pork-barrelling decisions I have seen, although admittedly I have been here only a short time. I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) has to learn a few things about politics. While I might not have been here that long, I have been around quite a while, and one of the golden rules is this: never insult anyone unintentionally. The location in Leichhardt would obviously have been far better on an economic basis and from the point of view of the staff. This organisation is unique in the world. It has a level of skill and expertise which is drawn on by the United Nations and by many countries. There are no jobs that these people can go to. There is almost no employment to be had by the people of Wollongong; if there were, I would be the first to be supporting it. But, in fact, it will mean very little increase in jobs for Wollongong because of the specialist nature of this activity. I think the arguments put by Commodore Leech were excellent. I do not criticise the Public Works Committee; it can only make decisions on the evidence brought before it. Quite obviously, in many cases the evidence brought before it is not adequate. This is the worse pork-barrelling decision, and I am very happy to oppose it. I think the honourable member for Mayo canvassed the arguments very well.",115
175,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (5.20 p.m.)-in reply-I rise to support the recommendation of the Public Works Committee. I do so as the local member, not as the Parliamentary Secretary who was asked, on behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), to read the speech of approval into Hansard this afternoon.",115
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The Chair acknowledges the honourable member as the Parliamentary Secretary-and in closing the debate.,116
177,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Fine; thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Downer-Not more pork-barrelling.",116
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will stop this constant interjection.,116
179,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Thank you for that protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. But the honourable member for Mayo has reminded me of the first issue to which I wish to draw attention; that is, this preselection nonsense he raised the course of his dissertation this afternoon. If one looks at the timetabling-and I am not sure whether Opposition members have had preselections in the Liberal Party in their own circumstances, but there are probably a few on the other side that have not, and occasionally we get involved in them on this side of the House-the preselection process to which he referred,' involving another member of the Labor Party and me, actually took place on 27 June, some three days after the announcement was made by the Minister here. If honourable members are telling me that people are likely to change their minds about a preselection ballot in a three-day period, clearly they have not been through too many preselection ballots, and certainly not too many on our side of the House. It is absolute rubbish. Who would it have been promised to? The honourable member for Mayo spoke a little earlier about doing things for mates and about pork-barrelling. He was talking about the people of the Illawarra getting a $12.5m building, the construction costs that would come with that which would then go into the local community to local contractors, and the multiplier effect that would follow from that. If they are my mates in Wollongong, then I am proud of it. I am pleased to know that they will get some work out of it. At present our construction industry is booming, and this will add to it over the coming 12 months under the approval process that I have outlined. In regard to the IOI-odd jobs, very few of which the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) said would actually come to Wollongong in the technical field, I agree with him. We have said that before. I have said that as a local member, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has said that, and the local media have said it as well. But there will be some people, in the clerical areas and so on, who will not be prepared to move. Some of those positions will be created there. I would suspect that over time people will develop an infatuation and a love for the in Illawarra like those of us who live there, and be prepared to move. It is cheaper to live there than in Sydney, and the environment is quite conducive to a healthy lifestyle. That has to be attractive. If 101 people move there and buy a house, that is not too bad: We need to remember the injection of the money that they earn in salaries. As I think the honourable member for North Sydney might have said on a previous occasion-or as somebody said-these are highly qualified and senior people who are therefore paid reasonably well. If they come to Wollongong, they can spend their money in Wollongong, and we will welcome it. I recall appearing as the local member at the Public Works hearing in Wollongong to support the project there. As the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) said, the question was raised as to whether the decision was made for other than operational reasons. When I said that the answer. was yes, I went on to qualify that by talking about things like economic and social benefits. I said that in many cases decisions taken by government to decentralise facilities out of central Sydneywhich is in line, for example, as I said yesterday, with an economic strategy that has been developed for the Illawarra-is perfectly legitimate. If there is an additional economic cost associated with that, so be it. But the social consideration of a region which has slightly above the national average in unemploymentMr Downer-Slightly?",116
180,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"Slightly, as I said, by comparison with some other areas of Australia. Yes, it is about 13.8 per cent compared with 11.4 per cent nationally. If that is the case, we will support that, and we will most certainly support it on those grounds. I think I said that at the Public Works Committee hearing in Wollongong, and I stand by that now. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a strategy of supporting decentralisation. There is always this view, with whichever government department it happens to be. If it is in Sydney and needs to be relocated, it goes to somewhere else in Sydney or to Melbourne, Adelaide or Brisbane. Yet major regional areas like the 11lawarra, Newcastle in the Hunter region or Geelong, or some other parts of Australia, are pushed to one side. In the course of these debates this afternoon on the Public Works Committee recommendations, I find it absolutely hypocritical that Opposition members are talking about the Government having taken the wrong options on Badgerys Creek and the airport in Brisbane by not spending enough money in the economically distressed area of the western suburbs of Sydney or around Brisbane. They are in here saying, 'Spend more money because it will create more jobs in the western suburbs of Sydney'. But when we suggest we do that in a place like the Illawarra, the reaction is 'Shock, horror!', 'Pork-barrelling', 'Doing it for your mates', and all the rest of it. It is a nonsense. This is a project that will be welcomed in the Illawarra region for the reasons I have outlined on many occasions in the past. To suggest that there was some particular conspiracy involving doing things for mates because there was a preselection contest on is absolute nonsense. The fact is that we have here a decision taken by government. It has been endorsed by a majority report, which I acknowledge, of the Public Works Committee. We can look at the facts and figures, and the whinges, and the leaking of a document by some officer in the Hydrographic Office who does not want to go to Wollongong-and I am sure honourable members will agree that it is nothing more than that; that is exactly what it is all about. We can look at it objectively and see the basic economic difference after the revision Wollongong City Council was prepared to do in terms of the provision of car parking. The honourable member for North Sydney knows of the difficulties associated with whether or not an organisation is a Commonwealth entity, of getting Commonwealth governments to adhere to the Environment, Planning and Assessment Act in New South Wales and the conditions there laid down. If none of that is done, then the cost difference is absolutely minuscule. So to suggest that there is any other reason why this particular facility should not come to Wollongong, other than to support the economic base of the Illawarra, is certainly glossing over the real reason. This will be welcomed in the Illawarra. As is always the case, the commitment of a Liberal Party to anything in the Illawarra was clearly demonstrated by the honourable member for Mayo when he said that if, by some strange quirk of fate, the Opposition becomes the government before this project starts, the Liberal Party will stop it. It is like anything else those opposite have ever done for the Illawarra; it amounts to absolutely nothing. I think the people of Wo11ongong will long remember that. I can only echo the sentiments of my friend and colleague the honourable member for Throsby. When we talk about political candidates and so on, as he said, the mob opposite cannot even get anybody to stand in the electorate of Throsby. They had to drag a publican out of his pub in north Wollongong to ask him to join the Liberal Party so he could stand against me. Thanks very much. We will have candidates of that quality any time. This proposal is worthy of support, and the Government certainly supports it. Question put: That the motion (Mr Martin's) be agreed to. The House divided. [5.34 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Hon. J.D.M.

181,Mr BILNEY,PAIRS,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (5.39 p.m.)I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Comniittee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: York Park Office, Barton, ACT. The proposed work recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works involves the construction of the York Park office at Barton in the Australian Capital Territory. The project comprises a four-storey building above ground level, and a lower ground floor and basement comprising two wings joined by a central core. The building will provide parking, storage and plant areas in the basement level under the southern wing; main entry and orientation space on the lower ground floor, with parking in the southern wing and storage workshop space in the northern wing; and general office accommodation on the ground, first, second and third floors. Associated site development works will comprise stormwater drainage, water and sewage reticulation and the construction of roads, car parks, associated footpaths and landscaping. The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Cominittee on Public Works in September 1992. The Committee has now tabled its report recommending the development at an estimated cost of$186.832m. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Administrative Services and the National Capital Planning Authority have noted the Committee's recommendations and have agreed to undertake an energy audit of the completed building one year afte- occupation; to continue consultations with the Conservation Council of the south-east region and Canberra and the National Trust of Australia-and seek the assistance of those bodies in developing a program to protect the day flying moth located in the York Park area and its habitat; provide the Committee with a copy of the completed botanical survey of the York Park area; and continue consultations with staff and staff associations during the design, development and construction of the York Park project and with the Public Sector Union: and staff associations regarding options for the provision of child-care facilities. ,The York Park office will replace existing unsatisfactory 'accommodation at the Administrative Building in Parkes, where the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and I once worked, which does not meet Commonwealth standards for office accommodation. The building is suffering from overcrowding and has pressing occupational health and safety problems, including inadequate fire safety provisions, unsafe electrical services and obsolete air-conditioning services. Basic building services are not overdue for upgrading to present day requirements and are expected to fail in the next two to three years. Studies undertaken during the feasibility stages of the project indicated that the York Park office project would be the most costeffective and expedient solution to these pressing occupational health and safety problems. The project is also consistent with the Government's objective of providing costeffective office space for departments to enhance operational efficiency and the delivery of government services. It provides a solid investment opportunity for the Commonwealth with a viable long term return on funds invested and represents the most effective use of public funds. The building's construction will also generate employment opportunities in Canberra and interstate by providing 750 person years of on-site work and a further 750 person years in manufacturing, fabrication and supplies. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House.  Opposition will be opposing this blatant waste of money on the shift to York Park. The proposal before us has a long history of delays and incompetence very much associated with this Government. In 1986,. the then Department of Housing and Construction was commissioned by the National Capital Development Commission to prepare a refurbishment master plan for the building. It was for a staged refurbishment plan over a number of years. At that time, staged refurbishment was regarded as the preferred option. In July 1987 Jackson and Swayn Pty Ltd, architects; were commissioned by the National Capital Development Commission to implement stage 1 of the refurbishment proposed in the Department of Housing and Construction report. The project did not go ahead. Jackson and Swayn produced a new report in December 1988. It reCommended early action to deal with the problems in the Administrative Building and canvassed two options: firstly, the construction of a new building for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and secondly, the construction of one or two annexes to the Administrative Building which would be used to relocate people during the refurbishment. In 1989, in consideration of the recommendations contained in the Jackson and Swayn report, DAS identified a number of suitable building sites and put a submission to the Government for a new building at the York Park site in Barton, which was reServed for major policy departments requiring proximity to Parliament House. At the request of government, DAS expanded on the option. in a supplementary submission in 1990. The options considered by government in 1990 were: firstly, the construction of a large building which would allow the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to colocate from its existing five locations; secondly, the construction of a smaller building; and, thirdly, the construction of a less prestigious building. The decision taken in the 1990-91 Federal Budget was to allocate $4m for detailed design work-that $4m did not cover the enonnous amount of money expended on different reports and different submissions up to that point, from 1986 right through until 1990-sufficient for referral to the Committee for the York Park building on the basis that it would provide general purpose office accommodation as a staging place for a number of tenants, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In 1991, Project Coordination Australia Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Australian Estate Management group for this particular purpose. It is interesting to note that the building that the Department has proposed is for 46,300 square metres of net useable floor area. The present departments all up have 47,117 square metres of floor area. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at present occupies 41,117 square metres and Austrade some 5,900 square metres, bringing the total to some 47,000 square metres. The 46,000-square metre building at York Park will cost $187m. The honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gonnan), who is in the chamber, expressed his concerns today at the enonnous cost, and so he should. I am pleased that he, too, ,is concerned about the cost. The $187m relates to a square metre building rate of $3,970 per square metre which is an excessive amount. It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) described this project as being a significant waste of money at a time when one million Australians do not have jobs, and when this sort of funding should not be allocated to what has aptly been described as 'Gareth's Gazebo'. Nonnal building costs in the commercial area for this sort of lavish building run at between $2,000 and $2,500 per square metre. In the Government's own report it was estimated that to build 14,000 square metres of new building, which my colleagues put down in the dissenting report, attached to the existing site would be $2,214 per square metre, which is about right. The Government is proposing to build a building that will cost just on $4,000 a square metre, whereas in its own report it estimated that to build 14,000 square metres as an annex to the existing site will cost only $2,214 per square metre. It is amazing how costs have been bandied around and manipulated to justify one's ends-to try, in some contrived way, to justify such an enormous waste of money on this building. If we go back to the early costings, which are contained in the 1988 master plan, we see that the construction of a new home to accommodate the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was only $1,622.48 per square metre. In the middle of a reccession, when building costs have been falling, we have had . enonnous cost jumps from $1,622 to $2,214, which is about right for a very substantial building-and, for a building in this case, of $3,970 per square metre. The report also contains a refurbishment cost of the existing building estimated to be worth $80m. Even the estimated cost to refurbish the existing building runs at a rate of $2,190 per square metre, whereas the Government's own report put the costing for the refurbishment previously contained in the report at $1,446.55 per square metre. Somehow there has been a staggering cost increase just on the estimate for the refurbishment. The estimate in the proposal put forward to the Government was $80m, and $187m for the construction' cost. An all-up expenditure of $267m has been proposed by this Government. As I mentioned earlier, the Government is proposing that sort of expenditure for no extra floor area. The report went on to say that this work was desperately needed because the staff in the building were working in 'cramped conditions' and needed extra accommodation. The new building is in fact marginally smaller than the present accommodation-but at a massively increased cost. It would seem that after all of this we have not achieved the original goal. We have spent an incredible amount of money on this development at a time when governments should be. looking at sensible expenditure and not a blatant waste of money, as we have witnessed in this area. In a dissenting report brought down by my colleagues the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Senator Paul Calvert, senator for Tasmania, they recommended that the existing building be refurbished and that an annex of 14,000 square metres be built. The all-up cost of that was estimated to be $102,624,000, which included the refurbishment of the existing building, a new 14,OOO-square metre building as an annex and additional car parking. I would have thought that that would have been a far more sensible way to go. Previously in this chamber I have raised question of substantial costing discrepancies in regard to the development of Commonwealth Government offices. I think this one beats the lot of them. This is the grand dandy of all of them. To spend this sort of money, $3,970 per square metre, to construct such a lavish building would rival the spending on this Parliament House-and it would not meet the original requirements. We are now told that there is an urgent need because occupational health and safety issues must be considered. This all started August 1989. It is amazing that the Minister and the Government have mucked around recession since that time right up until, magically, . someone suggested, 'Let's whack up this great building'-a monument to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and his Department, at enormous expense to the Australian taxpayer-'on York Park site. Hang meeting the reconstruction quirements of suitable accommodation. Let's forget about the fact that the original modation is cramped. Let's forget about the here. fact that we can achieve our aims at a far more affordable and realistic price'. For that reason, the coalition supports the Leader of the Opposition's description of this as a blatant waste of money and opposes the expenditure of these funds for this purpose.",118
182,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I rise to speak in this debate on the York Park proposal representing in this chamber the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Hill. It is clear that the York Park solution in relation to the needs and requirements of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for proper accommodation for its officials is not the most appropriate option to be pursued. There are various reasons for that. Many of them have been advanced in the dissenting report attached to the Public Works Committee document. Evidence has been adduced in relation to that. Another reason, which worries me more, is the political imperatives operating at this time. It is clear that proposals for a separate building for the Department of Foreign Affairs have been afoot for a long time. It is only this year that those proposals have got up. Previously the Government accepted the advice that a proposal of this the sort was extravagant and, in the worse recession in 60 years, an inappropriate option. I remind honourable members that this proposal is being spoken of as one which will create employment opportunities in Canberra. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) has commented that approximately 750 jobs would be created over three years as a result of the Government's decision to construct a new building for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Yet Canberra has one of the lowest rates of in unemployment for its community of any part of Australia. If we look at the impact of the and the requirement to generate jobs through construction, we see that the priorities are anywhere but Canberra. If we look at the profile of the unemployed in Canberra in need of work, we will see that they are not seeking employment in construction projects. The the people who are very often involved in projects are brought into Canberra to enable that work to proceed, and the accomrecruitment is undertaken well away from I can remember the advisY""tused to receive from the former member for Lilley in relation to the sorts of public works and expenditures that governments ought to be involved in during periods of recession. The late Kevin Cairns made it very clear that if we are looking at the long term economic advantages for Australia as a result of public works expenditure-induced expenditure to create job opportunities-we are looking at major infrastructure developments that will improve our economic capacity. In other words, if the Government were serious about addressing Australia's long term problems and it had hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, it would not be looking at upgrading office accommodation when it could improve roads an4 ports and railways, which might enhance our economic capacity as a nation. This Government put some weight on those factors in relation to the expenditure that it has planned for local government. In my community I have had to explain why local councils in our district will not receive any local government funding from this Government when we have an unemployment rate approaching 5 and 6 per cent, comparable with the numbers in Canberra. The basis upon which my electorate, and many electorates such as mine, are excluded from the opportunity to participate in local government programs is that the unemployment levels in our districts are correspondingly lower and, therefore, the need does not exist. That is an argument that is put, fearlessly, in relation districts such as the Shire of Hornsby, the Shire of Baulkham Hills, the Municipality of Ryde and others in the northern areas of Sydney. Yet when it comes to Canberra there is a different psyche. There are interesting coalitions involved in this exercise. The Department of the Treasury would normally counsel prudence in these matters. What do we find? Treasury sees the prospect of being able to move from shared accommodation with the Department of Finance and others to a refurbished kremlinas I am told the old Foreign Affairs building has been affectionately known. The sort of opposition that one would expect quietly disappears in the context of doing a deal so that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade gets its new building. One would expect that Treasury would have counselled carefully against a development of this sort in the context of the wider economic arguments and the recession that we are dealing with. Here we have one of the most extravagant buildings planned for Canberra at a time of enormous difficulty for the rest of the Australian community. When one compares the size of this proposal with other major buildings here in Canberra, this building, to be erected for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will have 47,000 square metres of space. The MLC tower has 20,000 square metres, so this proposal is more than double its total accommodation. The Advance Bank in Civic has 15,000 square metres, so this proposal is more than three times its size. Another interesting fact in relation to this development is contained in the minority report of the Public Works Committee. It becomes clear that when one compares the available space in the existing building and the work that needs to be undertaken in it-that is, as distinct from other issues of amenities, corridors and so on-there will be very little difference in the available working area. Those opposite have to ask themselves why they put together a proposal that involves at least $80m more than the estimated cost of other proposed solutions, such as adding an annex to the existing administrative builto ding-the kremlin-as well as the further $80m that will be required to refurbish the administrative building after it is vacated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade when its new building is erected. We have a total additional cost of $160m for very little advantage in comparison to the alternative cost-effective proposals. In the context of all that evidence, we have to ask why this very large amount of money needs to be spent in Canberra at a time when one of the Commonwealth's own agencies is vacating a major building that it has occupied in Canberra for alternative premises in Melbourne; that is, the CSIRO. The point is that we have other premises presently occupied but which will be vacated by a Commonwealth agency and which, as I understand it, the agency cannot sell. All of that is occurring during the worse recession in over 60 years. The priorities are distorted in the extreme. Is it any wonder that the Opposition takes the very strong view that the building, which has been affectionately labelled already as the Gareth Mahal, does not find support from Her Majesty's Opposition? Our position has been made very clear. I worry greatly when I find what appears to be cosy deals being undertaken by the Labor Party in relation to this. One report in the Canberra TImes states that the ACT Chief Minister-also in the Labor party-had ordered her bureaucrats to ensure that all of the arrangements around the development of this particular proposal be facilitated by the end of this year contracts in relation to this construction can be signed before any election. The cynicism of that would be extraordinarily disappointing to most Australians. These deals are being done between the Labor Party locally and nationally to get this particular development afoot so that the cost of being able to bring the development to an end is such that it is unlikely that that would occur. When Australians elsewhere are suffering so much, it is beyond my comprehension why this Government would seriously contemplate that approach. The Opposition will vigorously oppose this proposal.",121
183,Mr GORMAN,PAIRS,"I wish to say a few words in relation to the proposed York Park development. As a member of the Public Works Committee, I was initially totally opposed to the proposal. At that stage I was prepared to stand more or less alone, separate from the Opposition, and not vote for the proposal. However, after a great deal of coercion and almost kneecapping from the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hullis), and my brother in politics, the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), I have been convinced to support it. I should have waited for a broken ann, then I could perhaps have sued and got a settlement. I am still reluctant about the building but I have joined the majority recommendation on it. Mr Ruddock-It's a pity.",123
184,Mr GORMAN,PAIRS,"It is a pity that one must change one's mind and become a bit of a coward, I suppose, to some people. Mr Ruddock-You shouldn't be cowed on these things.",123
185,Mr GORMAN,PAIRS,"In actual fact, I believe that many more jobs could be created in the western suburbs of Sydney, or even the western suburbs of Melbourne, if this'money were diversified. In fact, if half of this money were allocated to the full construction of a 2,900-metre runway at Badgerys Creek, many more jobs would be created than this building will create. Canberra is an area that is not really suffering unemployment to the level of the western suburbs of Sydney. Mr Ruddock-You had better come back so that the on board-on this side.",123
186,Mr GORMAN,PAIRS,"No, I will be on this side when the count comes about. I just wanted it put on the record that I was totally opposed to the proposal but was finally talked around by two particularly nice people who are members of the Committee. To some extent, I feel sorry for the Opposition members on the· Committee that they could not finally agree, because in most cases we do try to agree to a proposal. Mr Ruddock-What reasons were given?",123
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Dundas has had his opportunity to speak in the debate.,123
188,Mr GORMAN,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the protection from one of my almost neighbours in Sydney. I have said enough. I have recorded the fact that I was totally opposed to the proposal at first but have now been turned around slightly. I reluctantly endorse York Park.",123
189,Mr TAYLOR,PAIRS,"I take the opportunity to elaborate briefly on the reasons why I, together with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Senator Paul Calvert from Tasmania, dissented from the majority view of the Public Works Committee. The nub of it has already been brought out both by the honourable  honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). The basic reason is that this whole York Park proposal fails on the majority report itself, simply because that report does not substantiate the need for the expenditure of $187m as the most cost-effective solution. As the honourable member for Dundas very succinctly said, there are a number of other issues-whether they be refurbishments, additions or annexes to existing buildingsthat are not explored in sufficient deu,.il within the body of the report. No matter which way one looks at it, we are not dealing simply with $187m today; we are dealing with at least $100m more than that simply because those refurbishments-whether they be to the administrative building, the Treasury building or whatever-will go ahead in due course anyhow. We are dealing not simply with $187m but with a substantial amount over and above that figure. The other point-and it is something that the honourable member for Forrest brought out-is in terms of occupational health and safety. He made a very valid point that those occupational health and safety matters were known to this Government five or six years ago. Suddenly, it has become the major issue, something that will take a number of years correct. So, it is not something that I think Government can really hang its hat on in terms of proving to this Parliament that, fact, the York Park proposal is the most costquickly effective. In terms of jobs, as the honourable member for Dundas has said, those jobs predominantly will go outside the ACT region. There is doubt about that. A lot of those jobs will be generated and, in an area where opportunity unemployment is below the national average, it seems ludicrous to me that this Government should be spending $187m that could be better spent somewhere else. One matter which nobody has raised so far, but which is in the body of the dissenting report, is the ability of private enterprise compete in designing a building that would suit the requirements of the Department Foreign Affairs and Trade. Australian Estate Management and Australian Construction Services have been involved in this proposal and, as a result, have come up with a that will cost an amount approaching $187m. I would say to the House that there is a lot experience around that would indicate that private enterprise, were it given the oppordebate tunity, could come up with a building still suit the DFAT requirements at substantially less than a cost of $187 million, if indeed the York Park option were to be the optimum one. In my view and in the dissenting view, that is not the case. There is no doubt that we are dealing here with a Taj Mahal or, if one were to be cynical, a Gareth Mahal in terms of the York Park proposal. I think that it behoves everybody in this place on both sides to look very objectively at what is before us and to vote accordingly. In finishing my comments in this debate, I would draw on some comments made in debates about some of the earlier notices relating to the Public Works Committee. I would like to take the opportunity, because I did not yesterday, in terms of the tabling debate, to pay tribute to the Public Works Committee secretariat and to the great work that they have done over calendar year 1992 but, in particular, over the last three or four to months. This Government has placed a very the large load on the PWC and I would like to think that the members of the Committee have in come to the party and recommended quite to this Parliament, as was said yesterday, of the order of $750m worth of capital expenditure. I notice that the honourable member for no Greenway (Mr Gorman) has left the House. not That is unfortunate. It is probably my last in this place to pay tribute to both the honourable member for Greenway and the honourable member for for Grey (Mr O'Neil), who will not be continuing as members of the Public Works Committee in the next Parliament. I have to say to the House-and I am sure I speak for all of my colleagues on both to sides of the House-that Mutt and Jeff, as we call them in the Public Works Committee, are of two gentleman whom we in that Committee will miss in the next Parliament, if indeed we are members of that Committee in the next Parliament. I think that all members in this proposal Parliament would share those views. I would also like to pay tribute to the of Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). As he said earlier in this and in earlier debates, he has exercised to a very large degree of bipartisanship as the Chainnan of that Committee. It is a very bipartisan committee. It is unfortunate that the Willis, R. last two reports of that Committee to this House have expressed minority views upon which we will divide. Nevertheless, I think that a large measure of that, in fact, goes back-and I put it squarely at the feet of the present Government in terms of the Hydrographic Office-to a blatant political move. Really, in terms of the York Park proposal, I think that it is simply a waste of public money which could be better spent elsewhere. Question put: That the motion, (Mr Bitney's) be agreed to.

190,Mr BILNEY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (6.24 p.m.)I move: Price, L. R. S. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 10 (1992) The tariff proposal which I have just tabled contains an alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Tapestry kits are free of customs duty while other needlecraft kits are dutiable at 15 per cent. Both types of kit are designed for needlework hobbyists. As such, they compete with, and are direct substitutes for, each other. There has been a problem with the identification of each type of kit. In addition, situation has been further aggravated by a recent Federal Court decision. As a result of this decision, many kits not considered by the industry to be tapestry kits are now legally defined as such. As there is no local manufacture of these kits, the Government has decided to dispense with the tariff advantage enjoyed by tapestry kits by providing a free rate of duty for all kits of heading 6308. A summary of the alteration contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Filing) adjourned. NA NA The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Bill 1992 NA Public Accounts Committee  present the following reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts: report 321, Finance minutes; report 322, Report of activities 1991-92; report 323, Managing people in the Australian Public Service: dilemmas of devolution and diversity; and report 324, Commonwealth support for private sector investment in research and development. Ordered that the reports be printed.  comment on the finance minutes report or the report of activities; however, I would like to say a few words about the reports on the Public Service and research and development. Report 323, Managing people in the Australian Public Service: dilemmas of devolution and diversity, is the result of the Committee's inquiry into the efficiency and this effectiveness of human resource management in the Australian Public Service. The Committee's purpose in conducting the inquiry was to assess the impact of recent refonns in the management of the Public Service. These refonns included the abolition in 1987 of the Public Service Board as the central human resource management agency for the Australian Public Service, the creation of the Public Service Commission as its successor, and the decentralisation and devolution of its functions to a number of other coordinating agencies and line departments. The report identifies the need for further refonn in certain key areas of human resource management in order to restore fundamental Public Service values and ethics in a climate characterised by an increasing emphasis on achieving efficiency in purely economic tenns. I would like to tum, firstly, to the area of decentralisation. The Committee has found that the current decentralised arrangement of functions which involves the Public Service Commission, the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Finance and the Department of Employment, Education and Training is failing to provide for effective management of people in the Australian Public Service. The decentralised arrangement has, in our view, resulted in a loss of consisReports tency, equity and Service-wide perspective. For this reason, the Committee has recommended, in a major shake-up, that the management of the Australian Public Service be re-centralised into one single body: the Public Service Commission. In recognition of the Commission's new role, the Committee has also recommended that the Commission be restructured and that appropriate resources be allocated to it. In the area of devolution, the Committee found in its inquiry that devolution of many management responsibilities to departments has also contributed to a loss of consistency and equity. While we recognise that a balance is required between central controls and devolved responsibility, we have made a number of recommendations to address issues which have suffered-in particular, issues such as equal employment opportunity. The Committee has also recognised the need to increase the powers of departmental secretaries in order for them to manage their staff more effectively. In this mittee has recommended a more streamlined process for managing under-performing officers.",125

192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member has been here long enough to know that that is not a comment for the Speaker to report upon. (Quorum formed)  Bruce (Mr Beale) is a typical Liberal. Even on the event of the tabling of a bipartisan committee report, he has to tear something down. He cannot contribute to anything: he has to tear something down. Regarding the human resources report of the Public Accounts Committee, I refer to the issue of broadening the range of policy advice to government. A major focus of the inquiry was to look at the current narrow, predominantly exclusively economic, range of policy advice which is offered to government. The Committee found that amongst the current departmental secretaries and amongst the majority of officers in the Senior Executive Service a higher proportion have narrow backgrounds which are dominated by an economic approach to management. While recognising the need for balance, the Committee has emphasised that economic rationalism must not be the sole driving ideological force behind change .and improvements to efficiency. Accordingly, we have made a number of recommendations designed to broaden the area, the Comrange of policy advice. On other issues, the report addresses a number of matters. They include: recruitment and selection processes; access to more flexible forms of employment, such as permanent part time work; performance appraisal mechanisms for all staff; the placement of surplus staff; and training and development opportunities for staff, including the establishment of closer links with educational institutions. The report also recognises some reservations about performance pay and, whilst recognising some of the potential benefits of workplace bargaining, has also expressed some concerns about its impact on the Australian Public Service. I pay tribute to my Committee colleagues, both near and far. Senator Pat Giles, whilst performing her duties at the United Nations in New York, has found time to contribute her ideas to this report. I also thank the secretariat staff-Sue Morton, Sameer Chopra and Yolanda Campagna-'-for their efforts to produce the Committee's report in such a timely manner. I thank my fellow members of the Committee and in particular the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) who has put in an extraordinary amount of time and effort to this report. I now turn to report 324, Commonwealth support for private sector investment in research and development. Committee report 324 examines support that government provides for research by the private sector and private sector development and commercialisation of research. It is the second volume of the Committee's report on its inquiry into research and development. The first volume covered research and development by public sector research organisations. The inquiry resulted from a concern that Australia did not have a good record of commercialising its research, in spite of high levels of government expenditure on R&D and an excellent international reputation for its research perfonhance. In addition, the level of investment in R&D by the private sector in Australia was known to be one of the lowest of the OECD countries. The Committee resolved to examine the reasons for this situation and the extent to which the Government's programs are effective in stimulating private sector performance of R&D and, importantly, its commercialisation. The Committee identified two important factors that affect the private sector's success m commercialising research. The first is the need for capital to finance research, development and particularly the commercialisation phase of the process. Large Australian firms have access to capital but the situation facing small and medium sized firms is difficult. The second factor is the generally small size of Australian firms. They tend to lack the range of expertise and contacts needed to commercialise their products effectively, especially overseas. Finance for research and development and . commercialisation was one issue which preoccupied the Committee. The 150 per cent tax concession for R&D, which was introd-ced in 1985, appears to have prodQced a considerable increase in business investment in R&D. The Committee fully supports the Government's initiative in the last Budget to extend the tax concession indefinitely and so encourage a continued commitment of corporate funds to R&D, and has recommended a number of improvements to the concession and its administration. For example: it should be extended to costs associated with market analysis and the development of market entry strategies; the interpretation of the Income Tax Assessment Act should be clarified so that pilot. plant and equipment and research conducted either overseas or by multinationals in Australia cart be more easily claimed as concessions; anomalies that hinder the transfer of intellectual property during commercialisation should be removed; and encouragement should be given to genuine syridicates and collaborative ventures. In addition, the Committee considered possible means of making more. capital available for R&D and its commercialisation. Significantly. the Committee has rejected, for the time being, the idea of· compelling superannuation funds to invest a certain proportion of their funds-their RD&C, research, development and commercialisation-and has called for clarification of the 'prudent man rule' to remove any impediments to investment in RD&C. The Committee endorses the call by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for superannuation funds to report more fully on their investments in different classes of assets, including development and venture capital. These reports should be made public through a report from the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to the Parliament. There are other ways of stimulating the availability of capital, such as tax exempt savings accounts and modifying the requirements for investing in pooled development funds. These points were the subject of recommendations, as was the need for the . Australian Technology Group to focus its funding on selected industries and on joint ventures . I tum to the aspect of growing Australian companies. Successfully exploiting research is much more easily achieved by larger organisations than smaller ones. Helping fiims to get larger is therefore an important objective in promoting the commercialisation of research. I have already mentioned the Committee's recommendations on supporting joint ventures through tax and capital measures. Another way in which companies can grow is through networking and forming strategic alliances. The Committee strongly supports the existing government programs that promote networking and recommends their extension. The Australian Technology Group could also play a significant role in this regard. I tum to management and marketing skills. Not only are many firms disadvantaged by their small size; some of the smaller ones also lack management and marketing expertise. Programs such as the national industry extension service make a valuable contribution in providing training in management and marketing skills. Such programs should receive additional funding, and grants t9 firms for R&D should be made conditional upon the firms receiving help with management and marketing if these appear to be necessary for the successful commercialisation of the R&D. Turning to government programs supporting private sector investment in R&D, the Committee believes that the existing programs adequately cover the range of activities involved in transforming research into saleable prodUCts. A number of problems common to several programs were identified by the Committee: firstly, there is rather little information available about the relative effectiveness of different forms of support for R&D, and research is needed to establish what is the best approach for the Government to take; secondly, there are a confusing number and variety of programs run by different agencies-a single source of information about them should be available and they should be monitored and coordinated; and, thirdly, unsuccessful applicants for R&D grants do not always receive feedback on their lack of success. The Committee examined a number of individual programs dealing with offsets and intellectual property and recommended evaluations in both of these areas. The Committee also noted the criticism levelled by the Industry Commission at the national procurement development program. We acknowledge that this program has experienced problems but believe that its role in providing an opportunity to firms to link with large government customers to trial and demonstrate technological developmentS is vital in establishing the credibility of these new technologies to other potential customers. The Committee believes that there is a strong case for maintaining the national procurement development program or a similar scheme. The Industry Research and Development Board is responsible for many of the Government's programs assisting private sector RD&C. The Committee believes that the board plays an important role in this respect, but that it should be strengthened. The Committee recommends that the board be reviewed and its mission and the objectives of its programs clarified. The Committee supports the view that government agencies charged with assisting R&D should support areas in which Australia has a competitive advantage. They should also tailor the assistance provided to the specific needs of firms and industries. This should be carried out within the context of national production and export goals set as a result of extensive community consultation. Finally, I would like to give my very great thanks to the staff of the Public Accounts Committee, particularly Sarah Hnatiuk, who worked very hard on this report, and before her Miss Fiona Taylor who did likewise. I would like to thank all members of the Committee, particularly the subcommittee, who worked tirelessly on this report, but it would be wrong of me not to single out for particular mention the honourable. member for Tangney (Mr Shack) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), both of whom did an enormous amount of work in this regard.

194,Mr BALDWIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (S.15 p.m.)-I move: That amendment No. 8 be disagreed to, but, in place thereof, the Bill be amended as follows: After clause 82, page 53, insert the following new clause: Transitional-equipment royalties paid under pre-18 August 1992 contracts ""81A.(I) Section 128B of the principal Act as amended by this Act does not apply to an equipment royalty if: (a) the royalty was paid or credited under a contract entered into before 8 p.m., by standard time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 18 August 1992; and (b) no variation of the contract occurred during the period: (i) beginning at that time; and (ii) ending immediately before the royalty was paid or credited. ""(2) In this section: 'equipment royalty' means: (a) a royalty covered by paragraph (b) of the definition of 'royalty' or 'royalties' in subsection 6(1) of the Principal Act; or (b) a royalty covered by subparagraph (f)(i) of that definition, in so far as that subparagraph relates to paragraph (b) of that definition."". The Government has reconsidered its position in relation. to whether equipment royalties should be grandfathered when they are paid or credited to a non-resident pursuant to a contract entered into prior to the Budget announcement by the Government of its intention to introduce a final withholding tax for royalties. The arrangements that some companies have entered into with payments to aircraft lessors through a tax haven are exactly the type of structure that the royalty withholding tax was intended to combat. There is no doubt that tax avoidance through offshore leasing abuses has been shown by the lobbying that has occurred since the Budget to be even larger than the Government had identified. This Government is not in the game of countenancing tax avoidance. However, the new arrangen:tents would cause considerable additional cost to companies that have grossup clauses in their contracts, as they would have to pay the withholding tax on behalf of the recipient. The Governmerit has therefore concluded that there is a case for grandfathering equipment royalties when they were paid or credited under the terms of the contract entered into before Budget night. The Government cannot agree to the Opposition's proposal to extend grandfathering provisions into contracts entered into after the Budget announcement. .",134
195,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The coalition welcomes the Government's change of mind in this connection. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) did provide for retrospectively imposing an obligation. to taxation pursuant to certain commercial leases involving equipment and non-residents. Essentially we proposed, in an amendment to the Senate, that transitional arrangements be put in place, intended to ameliorate the retrospective elements in the Bill, as we see them. Naturally, we do have some other concerns, which are not entirely addressed by any of these amendments. I want to point out that the provisions do have the effect of applying unfairly to existing equipment leases with non-residents. We join the Government in trying to combat tax avoidance, and the intent of the Bill of course draws no objections from us. On the other hand, we can come to grips with tax avoidance in different ways, but innocent people .who have not been practising tax minimisation or avoidance can also be trapped. Those innocent people can be unfairly hurt. The tax· could have resulted in the demise or the severe financial distress of some taxpayers, with the obvious and inevitable effects on employment. As it stands, Australian residents often carry the tax under these proposals because it is common for royalty agreements to pass the burden for such taxes to the Australian buyer. It was 11,0t only non-residents, in effect, that could have been snared-or will be-under obligation to pay tax in the future. The effective rate of tax, I might add, is up to 43 per cent under current Tax Office grossing-up rules. The amendments as a whole incorrectly assume that large profits are derived on equipment leases which currently escape Australian tax. I heard the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) indicate some surprise, and judged an estimate that there was widespread tax avoidance on the basis of the people who lobbied him-and particularly the numbers, I think I heard him say. That is an indication of people's interest, but it does not necessarily mean that there is any untoward tax minimisation or tax avoidance being practised. Despite .c1aims to the contrary, these amendments are inconsistent with overseas practice on equipment leasing too. They seem to be terribly inconsistent with the move towards self-assessment in the taxation area generally. By moving amendments in the Senate which caused the Government to reconsider and to come out with this albeit different commencement date, we at least gave the equipment leasing industry the opportunity of consultation which it did not have prior to us doing so. So what we proposed were reasonable transitional provisions. In the amendment which has been altered and is now before the Committee, we propose that the relevant provisions commence on the day the Bill passed the House of Representatives. We do not have any terrible difficulty with what is now proposed and simply note that we claim the credit for forcing the Government to reconsider. Once again, that is due in no small measure to my very valued colleague Senator Watson. Question resolved in the affinnative.

By way of comment, the Government is also proposing a further amendment to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 to provide an exemption on food for livestock. Although most food for livestock presently qualifies for exemption under a general provision relating to business inputs for primary producers, there are some situations where food for livestock is not exempted.

It is appropriate at this stage, this being the last amendment in the schedule, to note that there are almost 11 pages of amendments to this legislation.

199,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is more than a lot. The context of what we have been doing here in the last couple of days and our experience through the life of the Parliament with taxation laws indicates that original legislation goes through this place, more often than not, under the guillotine, thereby preventing any sort of sensible sort of discussion or debate. It goes on to the Senate, and eventually the amendments come back into this place in the fonn we have tonight. This is a classic example of it, where we need 11 pages now to amend legislation which went through this House without a murmur simply because debate was not allowed on it. I even believe the honourable gentlemen opposite accept that that is a crazy way to legislate; it certainly does not add anything to our understanding of tax law. But more importantly, for those who practise in the area and those who have to honour obligations and pay tax as a result of these laws, I think we should have a much better record of getting it right in the first place. I have said that before-and with little effect, I am sorry to say. Until we pay closer attention to our original legislation, I guess we are going to have to suffer in this way.

Second Reading",136
200,Mr GRIFFITHS,CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will make amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to ensure that all persons working in the offshore petroleum industry in Commonwealth waters are protected by occupational health and safety legislation. Currently persons working in the industry offshore Western Australia and Queensland are not covered by occupational health and safety provisions. The Bill rectifies that situation. However, the provisions of the Bill will cease to apply once the relevant States move to extend the coverage of their occupational health and safety legislation. The occupational health and safety provisions in the Bill reflect similar provisions found in most State legislation and closely follow those in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. The occupational health and safety provisions in the Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act are modelled on existing StatefTerritory legislation. The Bill places a general duty of care on employers and employees alike to protect the health and safety of all those working in the offshore petroleum industry. It provides a framework within which employers and employees may cooperate to address health and safety issues in the workplace. The amendments will provide a framework at the workplace for the selection of employee health and safety representatives and the establishment of health and safety committees with employer and employee representation to facilitate cooperation in the protection of the health and safety of employees at work. Standards on specific hazards may be included in regulations and codes of practice may be approved by the designated authority for the relevant adjacent area to give guidance to the industry on meeting obligations made by the occupational health and safety provisions. The provisions will be administered by the designated authority for the relevant adjacent area. n is indisputable that there is a need for framework within which employers and. to employees cooperate to protect the health and safety of all those working in a potentially hazardous industry such as the offshore petroleum industry. The need was heightened by the major disaster which occurred on Piper Alpha production platform in the sector of the North Sea in 1988. Regrettably, in that instance, 167 lives were lost. The Australian Government has responded comprehensively to this disaster and set up the Consultative Committee on Safety in the Offshore Petroleum Industry, COSOP. COSOP, consisting of State and CommonGovernment's response. wealth Government, union and industry representatives, was charged with assessing the findings from the UK inquiries and vising the Government on the future direction of offshore safety in Australia. COSOP's principal recommendations were: - the adoption of the safety case approach to offshore safety, together with the progressive introduction of objective setting regulations to replace prescriptive rediminish quirements wherever possible; - the extension of occupational health and safety coverage, based on the relevant provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act, to those offshore areas where no occan cupational health and safety provisions interest. currently apply; - the establishment of a single point of contact and responsibility for offshore cupational health and safety matters in each the explanatory memorandum. State or Territory; - the adequate resourcing and training of authorities to enable them to effectively administer the new regime; and - the establishment of a national incident data base. These recommendations have been accepted by the Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory governments, the petroleum industry and the unions. The first element, the adoption of the 'safety case' approach to offshore safety, is already being implemented. Companies operating in Australian waters are now a required by the offshore petroleum legislation prepare safety cases for all platforms and floating produ<;tion facilities for which either design commences or which commence operating after 1 July this year. The safety case is a concept new to the Australia for the management of hazardous UK industries. The principle has also been adopted in a draft standard prepared by Worksafe for adoption by all jurisdictions by the end of 1993. The extension of occupational health and safety coverage to all offshore areas, which will be implemented by this Bill, is the second element of the Further elements of COSOP's recommendations will be implemented over the next 12 adto 24 months. The Government has made available in the Budget $379,000 in 1992-93, with further sums in the following financial years to ensure implementation. The implementation of COSOP's recommendations represents a substantial change in approach to the management of safety in the offshore petroleum industry. They are designed to the situations and conditions that can lead to accidents occurring and will result in improved safety conditions for all employees on Australia's offshore petroleum installations. They will also demonstrate the way in which governments, unions and industry work together to further the national None of the amendments in this Bill have any significant financial impact.

201,Mr TIM FISCHER,CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL,"The House is considering a Bill for an Act amend the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) 1967 to promote the occupational health safety of persons employed in the designated areas, and for related purposes. As simple that title might seem, the Petroleum bmerged Lands) Amendment Bill is wealth duplicating complex legislation, and it is an unnecessary addition at this time when the Western Australian State Parliament is on the liament. verge of acting in relation to these measures. In line with the stated position of the coalition in the Senate, the Opposition is opposed to this legislation. In reaching conclusion, it does not for one away from the commitment of the coalition to occupational health and safety. It is how best that is delivered in the legislative framework in an area where there is certainly a Federal role in passing and a more significant Federal role in relation to other areas of jurisdiction lation. of the Commonwealth Government. One particular matter which has been employees brought to our attention relates to the fact the Bill deals with both Western Australia ahd Queensland. Effectively there is no activity Queensland which would be picked up by the covered legislation as things stand. As I have menSafety tioned already, there is legislation in Western Australia and, according to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in his second speech, this aspect of the legislation will trip out the moment the Western Australian ference Parliament does so legislate. That means that we have another 45-page piece of drafting The working its way through the Federal Parrepresentatives liament. It was meant to be introduced at 2.00 a.m. last night; it has now come on at the multiple more civilised hour-dare I say-of 8.30 tative tonight.

202,Mr TIM FISCHER,CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL,"One million dollars course for legislating. There is a lot of existing regulation applying on this occupational health and safety front. We cannot put a price on life; we must accept the full safety element. A term utilised by the Goveniment in another area of its operation-namely, to aviation-is 'affordable safety'. Absolute Act minimum standards are required in quite and dangerous work involving the offshore rigs which this Bill may cover for a period of 10 as days. By the time it is actually gazetted, it (Sucould well be that this massive Commonlegislative process will be in operation for as little as 10 days before it trips out and is handled by the Western Australian ParAlso of relevance is the fact that there was little consultation with industry.

The result will be work groups each with their own represenhaving major powers of investigation and the to order work to stop. A single health and representative should be appointed by and answerable to a single Health and Safety CommitAPEA made several other points relevant to its recommendation that this is not the right of action at this time-not the least .of which being that the legislation is unnecessary and may never become operational. APEA commented that the legislation will create duplication and conflict regarding the notification and reporting of accidents, especially under 'current Directions clauses 280-287 and the draft Bill clauses 68-69'. The draft Bill clauses were adjusted, and the Bill before the House has already passed through the Senate. For once, the Parliament should pause and think about what it is doing in respect of this legislation. A great deal of effort is required to ensure that the occupational health and safety standards are fully maintained across the Commonwealth. That requires a good deal of voluntary cooperation. We cannot legislate against someone taking dangerous action on an oil rig-for example, not wearing a safety helmet, harness, or glasses, or life jackets in certain loading and unloading circumstances, even though it is prescribed by legislation. The legislation in relation to seat beats classic example. It is now the legislation of the land that seat belts be worn at all times. Yet at times police find that high percentages of people are not responding to that legislated approach for sensible road safety-that is, the wearing of seat belts at all times. We cannot guarantee enhanced safety by legislation. Legislation should presumably help to enhance safety, but we cannot guarantee it. It takes a combination of effort and occupational health and safety to bring abount the correct conclusion. This legislation does not meet the standard required by the coalition for a sensible approach to this important policy area. For the reasons I have outlined, the coalition is opposed to the Petroleum (Submerg- Lands) Amendment Bill. We believe that the Government should go away and ask its Western Australian Labor colleagues, somewhat distracted as they might well be, to speed up this legislative approach. On the Minister's own admission if this process were sped up then this section of the legislation relating to offshore Western Australia would be eliminated. Notwithstanding the slight improvement in the legislation before the House, for these and related reasons, the coalition continues its stated opposition to the legislation. The coalition believes that there are better and more correct approaches available and ones which will not result in duplication which could endanger lives. To be fair, that is a thing that neither the Government nor the Opposition would want to see happen in the workplace.",140
203,Mr SNOWDON,CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (8.46 p.m.)-As the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) indicated, the key purpose of this Bill is to protect the occupational health and safety interests of those petroleum industry workers not currently protected by State occupational health and safety legislation. That situation currently emerges in only Queensland and Western Australia. Queensland has exploration leases, with the possibility of exploration drilling. Western is a Australia has a Bill, but no Act. Who knows when the Act will be promulgated as the Western Australian Parliament approaches the end of its life. In this instance, it is very important that the Commonwealth pursue this legislation. I point out to honourable members opposite that COSOP was involved in the consultative process which was the basis for formulating this legislation and which went on for years. This Bill has been accepted by the industry. I am aware that members of the staff of the Minister for Resources spoke yesterday to the Managing Director of Woodside and he indicated he was comfortable with the Bill and the procedures therein. The real issue is that the Government is concerned that there is proper and adequate health and safety on offshore oil rigs, in particular off the coast of Western Australia. It is the traditional view of the Opposition that the Commonwealth should not involve itself in these areas, but we believe that it is extremely important. In the Piper Alpha disaster, 167 lives were lost. It is extremely important that this country appropriately puts in place very stringent health and safety standards-that is what this legislation seeks to do. I am the chairman of a task force that has recently been looking at oil and gas exploration off the Northern Territory and in the Timor Gap. What is evident from my involvement in that task force is the preparedness of industry and the unions involved to work cooperatively to get a proper working arrangement in that area. I say to honourable members opposite that it is appropriate that there be consultation, that the unions be involved in a very forthright and up-front way in protecting the interests of the work force, and that this legislation be passed here this evening. I hope the Government will get the support of the Opposition for this legislation. I believe we would be seen to be wanting by the community if we were not to pass it. We would certainly be seen to be wanting, and failing in our duty, by those people who are working in the oil industry offshore if we did not enhance the capacity for those people to survive any disaster and, most importantly, ensure that no disaster takes place. Proper health and safety standards are the basis for making sure that that happens. I commend the legislation to the House. Question resolved in the afftnnative. Bill read a second time.

(Quorum formed) NA Assent to the following aills reported: Migration Refonn Bill 1992 Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill 1992 Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1992 MIGRATION (OFFENCES AND UNDESIRABLE PERSONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read first time. Second Reading",141
204,Mr HAND,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (8.55 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Following the challenge to the decision to exclude from Australia non-Australian members of the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club, there has been close scrutiny of the decision making regime for the exclusion of persons of bad character and of persons generally who may represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of it. This Bill represents the results of that process and enables the Minister to exclude from Australia persons of bad character and other undesirable persons. The Bill provides that, from the dates of commencement, certain decisions under the Migration Act will be subject to detenninative merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The commencement dates take account of the fact that some provisions in the Bill apply to the Migration Act in its current fonn and others will apply only to provisions introduced into the Act by the Migration Refonn Bill which are scheduled to come into operation on 1 November 1993. The Bill provides the Minister or his or her delegate with the power to refuse or cancel a visa or entry pennit where a person fails to meet the character criteria set out in the Act. There is also a power for the Minister, acting personally, to refuse or cancel visas or entry pennits where, on the basis of information available to the Minister, he or she is satisfied that a person, if pennitted to enter or remain in Australia, would be likely to engage in criminal conduct, would represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of it, would engage in vilification of a segment of the community or would foment discord in the community. The power is intended to be exercised in a manner consistent with well-accepted Australian values, such that it is aimed at those persons who may regard entry to .this country as a means to attack those values. a The new provisions would not be used to breach established standards of industrial democracy, for example. The provisions will also not impact on the continued implementation of current Government policy in relation to criminal deportation. That policy has been effective since May 1983. It was updated in December 1988 when the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs clarified certain important issues for the benefit and guidance of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. While it is open and will remain open to the Government to change that policy from time to time in order to maintain its effectiveness and to give appropriate direction to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, apart from re-stating it and revising and updating the policy to take account of the legislative changes, there is no need at present to make any major changes now. A statement of the amended policy is tabled in conjunction with this amending legislation. This will ensure the currency of Government policy on criminal deportation and provide up-to-date guidance to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in such matters. .In future, this Bill will provide a basis in the primary legislation for refusing or cancelling visas or entry permits on the grounds of character. It remains open to prescribe criteria relating to character hi the migration regulations, but this would occur only in exceptional circumstances. Under this Bill, the Minister will be able to consider whether a person is of good character by reference to a person's actual criminal conduct, his or her general conduct, or by reference to a person's association with any other person, group or organisation who the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe has been or is involved in criminal conduct. Policy guidance will be developed in due course to assist those 'detision makers delegated with the power to make' decisions under this legislation. All decisions taken under the powers provided for in this legislation will be subject to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Specifically, the decisions which will be subject to such review will be criminal deportations, decisions to refuse a visa or entry permit, decisions to cancel a visa or entry permit on the grounds of bad character, or where a person may engage in criminal conduct; vilify a segment of the community, foment discord in the community or represent a danger to the community. These decisions will be subject to such review from the date of royal assent to this Bill. There will be. special arrangements for protection visas under provisions introduced by the proposed Migration Reform Act 1992. Protection visas will be granted on the basis that the applicant is entitled to protection under the United Nations convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees. Decisions to refuse protection visas will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where adverse determinations are made against persons such that character concerns are sufficiently serious to engage those articles of the convention which provide for the exclusion of an individual from the provisions of the convention, article IF, or for the expulsion of a refugee, articles 32 and 33(2). Such decisions will only be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on and after 1 November 1993 . Review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the exercise of the new powers provided by this Bill will not be permitted; however, the Minister, acting personally, m-y decide that it is in the national interest that such persons not be permitted to enter or remain in Australia. In such cases the Minister will be required to include, as part of the decision, a certificate stating that, in the national interest, the person is refused entry to or permission to remain in the country. In those cases where a certificate is included, the Minister will be required to table a notice of the decision in the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the taking of the decision. , Providing for determinative review of these cases by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will mean that it is the sole merits review body for criminal deportation decisions, decisions refusing or cancelling visas or entry permits under the new character'provisions, including decisions made relying on those articles of the refugee convention which allow for exclusion or expulsion of individuals and those decisions taken on the basis of information which satisfies the Minister that a person would vilify, incite discord or represent a danger to the Australian community or segment of it or would be likely to engage in criminal conduct in Australia. In these cases, the Immigration Review Tribunal, the new Refugee Review Tribunal created under the Migration Refonn Bill, and internal departmental review officers will have no jurisdiction whatsoever. For the sake of clarity, any visa or entry permit refusal or cancellation involving the exercise of the powers provided for in this Bill will only be reviewable on the merits by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal, in reviewing such matters will be guided by relevant policy directives of the Government, such as the criminal deportation policy and that developed to guide the use of the powers provided for in this legislation. In such cases, this Tribunal will also then review all other aspects of the decision. Review before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will only be permitted to a person whose visa or entry pennit has been refused or cancelled if he or she is present in Australia at of the decision. If the person is not present, the Bill provides for that person's nominator or sponsor in Australia, if any, to take the matter before the Tribunal. Finally, if a person has his or her visa or entry permit refused or cancelled, the person will be excluded from Australia for a period set out in the migration regulations. This will mean that, prior to 1 November 1993, those persons in Australia whose entry pennits are cancelled because of these provisions will not be permitted, after being deported, to re-enter Australia for the period set out in the regulations. After that date, criminal deportees, who will continue to be subject to deportation, and persons in Australia whose visas are cancelled and who are thus liable to detention and removal from Australia as unlawful· non-citizens will be similarly prevented from re-entering Australia for a period set out in the regulations. Persons who have not entered Australia will not be permitted to enter Australia for the period prescribed in the regulations. The regulations will be able to set out variable exclusion periods. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",142
205,Mr RUDDOCK,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It is a rare opportunity to be able to respond immediately after a second reading speech and not have to give some indication as to the nature of the Bill that we are discussing-in this case, the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill 1992. No doubt, after my comments on this occasion everybody will be quite familiar with the matters that are being addressed as a result of the observations made by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). I want to put these matters into context. We do support the BjII. We regard it as an important Bill. I think it is incumbent on me to make c1e- why these matters are being addressed in this way at this time. As I understand· it, we are putting into law as an Act of parliament the provision to deal with the character issues that are the time presently covered by regulations. The reason for the Bill arises in part from the challenge to the decision of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to exclude from Australia members of the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club. It may be recalled that the Minister fonned a view-and I think it was a proper view, on information available to him-that these people should be excluded from entry to Australia on character grounds. As a result of the Minister's decision, there was a challenge to a single judge of the Federal Court. He was minded to allow entry of representatives of the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club for their run, as I am told it is called. The matter was taken on appeal to the Full Court and the exclusion by the Minister was found to be lawful. I think a number of serious issues were raised in that challenge, such that it was thought appropriate to put the matter beyond doubt. This legislation seeks to put beyond ddubt the question as to Australia's entitlement to exclude people who have been convicted of significant criminal offences in their home country, or in another country before they have come to Australia, and also to ensure that people who may be convicted of serious offences here in Australia or who have failed to disclose serious offences before they obtained admission to Australia-and fraud may be involved-could be removed from Australia after entry. It may be thought that character issues sometimes are matters that are taken up by the Minister and me on a fairly emotive basis and that these things ought not to be given as much profile as they are, but there have been a number of serious questions raised abc:mt character issues recently. Not in every case can the matters be addressed under the precise form of this legislation, but I want to put some of them clearly before the House. A number of people ask the questionproperly, I think-as to how certain people were able to entet Australia and then commit the murder of a very distinguished Australian, Dr Victor Chang. When we recognise the horror of that event and the fad that it occurred in this country and involved people who were not Australians but were here temporarily, the importance of character as a basis for determining people's entry can be well understood. I think it is proper to ensure that people who are coming to settle in Australia permanently are the subject of full and appropriate inquiries to establish their bona fides. People who have been· convicted of serious criminal offences ought not to be able to enter Australia and settle permanently. But ought a Minister not be able to properly take into account a person's predilection to engage in criminal activities which may not be known by an offence in Australia but which may well be known to overseas agencies in relation to the admission of such a person to Australia? Intelligence information from international agencies is a very important aspect of character checking. This Bill provides a schema which recognises that that is information which may be known to government but which, if it became more broadly known and was the subject of challenges under our administrative law regime in a public forumwhich we have discussed in other contexts recently-may well put at risk the very ability of Australia to obtain such information from overseas authorities. This situation could occur particularly where decisions in relation to entry are being challenged. The schema that we have here is one under which, in circumstances where one is relying upon intelligence information, it is the Minister who will form a judgment and it is the Minister who will be able to issue a conclusive certificate in order that he can properly protect the national interest. I want to emphasise the importance of this schema and the responsibility that the Minister is being asked to assume under this legislation. The scheme is unusual but it is appropriate. It was appropriate in the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club situation, for reasons better known to the Minister than to myself but for reasons that I understand. In relation to the Chang case, we were dealing with temporary entrants. One would hope that intelligence information could be used to try to protect Australia from situations such as that. It is a matter which Australians are very much aware of and concerned about. I want to raise one other matter which I think concerns the electorate of the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who will follow me in this debate. Recently, some very unfortunate events occurred in the suburb of Cabramatta. A young man was killed as a result of a very savage bashing. I do not believe the people who were responsible for that event have been apprehended; we may not know who they are. One of the honourable member's State colleagues has offered a view that, if the people involved happen to be non-citizens, certain action ought to be taken in relation to them. The Minister referred to a schema in relation to people who are non-citizens-that is, people who are permanent residents but have not taken out Australian citizenship. If those non-citizens have committed serious offences in Australia they may be liable to deportation. These serious offences involve the production, importation and distribution of and trafficking or commercial dealing in hard drugs; organised criminal activity; serious sexual assaults; armed robbery; violence against the person; terrorist activity and assassination; and kidnapping, blackmail and extortion. If the people who committed the event in which this young man died-which was violence against the person-were ascertained to be non-citizens and convicted, then that would lead to criminal deportation. We had a very dramatic call by the State member for Cabramatta, Mr Newman, for deportation ofin his words-non-nationalised Asian immigrants involved in the gang violence. I do not know who was involved in this violent activity but I amhorrlfied at what happened and the circumstances in which it arose. If they are non-citizens, then to me criminal deportation seems a proper outcome. I suspect that, with the very high take-up Australian citizenship amongst immigrantsparticularly people from Indo-China-if the people involved in this action were from Indo-China then it would be very likely that deportation would not be a remedy because they would be Australian citizens. The takeup rate amongst the Indo-Chinese for Australian citizenship is about 95 per centvery worthwhile, but very high. Two years as the period of qualification to ascertain whether a person has a proclivity to commit serious criminal acts in Australia is a very short period. That is one reason why the Opposition has suggested that, when reviewing citizenship eligibility, a period longer than two years would be an appropriate reform to consider. I assume that honourable members opposite strongly support the need for criminal deportation in serious events of this sort. However, if the people who are involved in such brutal acts are able to be here for a period of two years and are then eligible for Australian citizenship, it is a nonsense to talk about criminal deportation. It is very unlikely that that remedy would be open to the GoverruI,lent. We cannot deprive citizens of their entitlements, particularly if they have forfeited another citizenship. We cannot leave them stateless. That is why the act of granting citizenship has to be seen as a very important step. There needs to be time to assess accurately whether or not the waiver that is involved in this Bill is something that might prejudice the Australian national interest. For that very reason we believe the period of two years for eligibility is too short. This becomes clear when we look at this legislation against the background of these horrific events that have occurred and which may have involved our new settlers. Australia has a very good outcome with character checking. In fact, migrants generally have a much lower propensity to commit criminal acts than Australians. On the statistics that I have seen, the only national group that has a higher average than Australians to commit criminal acts is New Zealanders. That does not absolve us from the responsibility of maintaining proper character checking and a legislative of regime to ensure that that will happen. We also need to look at the citizenship question that the State Labor member for Cabramatta has put clearly in issue by his reference to the need for deportation in these cases if noncitizens are involved. On behalf of the Opposition, I take this opportunity to commend the legislation. The decisions in it are appropriate. They strengthen the regime of character checking. That is a matter of fundamental importance. I commend the Minister for bringing this particular legislation before the Parliament, even though it is in the twilight of his ministerial office.",144
206,Mrs CROSIO,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I join with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, and the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), in supporting the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill 1992. The Bill aims to protect Australian citizens and society from what is classified as notorious or disreputable characters who could present a danger to our country if allowed to enter Australia. The determination of this by reference to a person's actual criminal conduct or association with any other person, group or organisation who the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe has been or is involved in criminal conduct is action that we must take. The amendments that are contained in the Bill will allow· the Minister, as the Minister has indicated tonight in his second reading speech, to refuse to grant or cancel a visa or entry permit if a person is not considered to be of good character, or who is likely to be engaged in criminal conduct of any description whilst in Australia; and to refuse to issue or to cancel a visa or entry permit or to expel a person to whom refugee status has been granted. The legislation clearly states that the Minister must be satisfied, in cancelling that visa, that the person would be likely to engage in criminal conduct or could vilify a segment of the Australian community, incite discord in the community or part of the community, or could represent a danger to all or part of that community. In saying that, I believe that it is appropriate at this stageand I know I will only have a limited time because of other events that are going to overtake me-to place on record my appreciation of the work that has been done during this term of parliament by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. It is, when all probabilities are taken into account, possibly the last Bill that this Minister will have the opportunity to introduce into this Parliament. Too often we have a tendency to praise a person when that person is no longer here. I would like to have placed on record my appreciation of the work that this Minister has done during the term of this Government. I believe that it is only appropriate that it should be said here and now. I am particularly proud to have had the opportunity of working with the Minister. I have been particularly proud, too, of the reforms and restructuring that have been put into place in the areas of immigration and local government affairs. I am particularly pleased at the very caring and humane attitude which the Minister has taken at all times in all pieces of legislation dealing with immigration that have come before this House. I think that there has been a change out there in the community at large when groups have been able to communicate with and consult with the Minister onsuch a scale. I am very pleased that I have had an opportunity, as I will continue to have during the debate on this Bill, to have said that, so that at least the Minister knows that we appreciate the very caring and humane way in which he has handled what are at times very difficult pieces of legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I see that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has entered the chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Valedictory",146
207,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," I move: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 23 February 1993, at 2 p.m., unless otherwise called together by Mr Speaker or, in the event of Mr Speaker being unavailable, by the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought I would take this opportunity to thank the House for its forbearance over the course of the last year, for. the passage of legislation and the proceedings of its business which it has allowed to be conducted. It has been a very eventful year. It is not every day that a constituent seeks an audience in IGngs Hall without getting out of his car first. It was a first for us in our five years. Of more long term significance for members was the recent decision of the High Court which ruled that the former honourable member for Wills and other candidates in that by-election were not eligible to stand for parliament. The High Court declared, of course, that Mr Cleary had an office of profit under the Crown at the time of his nomination and ruled as well that the Liberal and Labor candidates were not eligible to stand for parliament as they had failed to take reasonable steps to renounce their foreign citizenship. These were events of some magnitude for us in this place where we tend to notice all these sorts of rulings and conditions. The implications raised are far reaching in terms of fairness and the representative nature of the parliament. I think that both sides of the House would probably agree that only a constitutional referendum can decide that matter in the long term. These matters notwithstanding, the Parliament has had a very busy year as the Government has worked to continue on a far reaching reform process which it embarked upon nearly 10 years ago. I know that this has put great pressures on members; not only on members, but on all those involved in our parliamentary system of government to make certain that it operates smoothly. I extend to all members of parliament, therefore, my thanks for their efforts over the course of year and wish them a happy Christmas and an enjoyable and well earned break. When I first came here, we were well and truly up by early December. But a few things have changed over the years which make life more bearable. In my first parliament, often we used to go home in daylight. We would go back to the Kurrajong Hotel and have a shower and a change of undies and come back. Some, of course, did not bring a change with them. But we always knew which ones they were. Not all rooms had facilities either. We would come back often at night. I remember that, in the old Parliament House, in the dining room we would have supper at 3 a.m. They would bring out the sausage rolls and the sausages and everything else and everybody would be into the bangers anq mashed potatoes. That was regarded as appropriate fare at 3 in the morning. Honourable members used to sleep around the corridors and on the lounges and in their offices. Of course, in those days, there were two and three people to an office often. It was pretty hard to sleep in there, so they would sleep in the corridors, et cetera. That all changed in the period of the Whitlam Government when the 11 o'clock rule came in and, since then, that has never been the order of the day. Occasionally we break it, but not very often. So the hours are better, but we are sitting longer, I think. The House is sitting for most of December these days. The Senate sits interminably, as we know. We/they will sit again this year nearly to Christmas. So it does make a long year of it and it means that there is a lot of pressure on families and being away from home, and that is something which I think all members experience. Apart from the hours that we put in, of course, and the days that we put in, this is also true of all the people· who support us here in our offices. Those people in all of our offices in the building generally are here, even when we are not here, keeping the system rolling. I am sure that we owe them a very clear debt of gratitude. I must particularly mention the Clerk and the the Deputy Clerk, Lyn Barlin and Ian Harris. With the able support of the Clerk Assistants and the Sarjeant-at-Arms, Phil Bergin, they have been able to again ensure that the business of the House is managed smoothly and competently. I do not know of any Department of the Commonwealth which has a more dedicated interest in serving a group of people than this Department does in serving the Parliament and its every need. The courtesy and service which have always been extended to us-not just the efficiency, but the courtesy and service-have been, I think, almost without peer anywhere in the Commonwealth realm. This has been my experience. I first met Lyn, of course, when he was a much younger, fresh-faced Clerk Assistant-I am not sure-and I was a callow youth. But we have been here 23 years. He has been here longer than I have, but I have been here long enough-23 years.",147
208,Dr HEWSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,We will soon put an end to that.,148
209,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I do like determining my own demise. The Joint HOllse Department, which is responsible for feeding us, informing us, guarding us, arranging or transportation, looking after our surroundings, has again served us well. I must also particularly mention the transport officers who tend to look after our movements, which are particularly special to us-in getting from home to here or around Canberra or to and from the airport, or even other movements in other capital cities. They have always been particularly obliging and very close to members, and have stayed close, which is a nice thing. I would also like to note the fine work of the Hansard staff, who operate under constant pressure to record every pearl of wisdom uttered by us. You have got to have a lot of heart to be a Hansard reporter. There are some members in here I would not want to report. I recKon I would be a total failure at that. I would say, 'This is rubbish, forget just a big space'. Even though I know this dedication to recording accurately what is said is the predominant culture of the office, if one had just a modicum of discernment one would, on a number of occasions, want to put the pencil right through the text. Not only do they not do that, but also they make the text read so nicely. We say thank you to them for carrying out a very difficult task. The other largely unseen group are the people who staff the switchboard-the switchboard operators. The supervisor, Marlene, and her crew-Dalroy, Pam, Margaret, Gaylene and Ann-are always courteous. That is what I find whenever I use the service and I am sure this is the experience of all honourable members. We thank them very much and wish them the best for Christmas and the New Year as well. I repeat my thanks to the Clerk, his officers, Hansard, the telephonists, and the transport officers. I would also like to thank the people who work in the Parliamentary Library who are particularly attentive to our needs. I also take this opportunity to commend the work of the Whip on the Government side-I am sure the Leader of the Opposition. (Dr Hewson) will mention his office-bearers. I would like to mention George Gear and his Deputy, Ted Grace, who maintain the numbers and round up reluctant members. But the best thing they do for us is deliver victories in the divisions. I acknowledge the work of George's office and Catherine Mundy on his staff, whose work is greatly appreciated. I also thank the Parliamentary Liaison Office. Clare Nairn and her staff have done a wonderful job in assisting the passage of the Government's business program. We thank them very much for their hard work and professionalism in keeping an eye on the House, following the ebb and flow of the debate, knowing when someone has to speak, when amendments have to be moved, getting people down to do that and getting the legislation .in. These are important things. I understand that Clare has completed her stint with the Parliament this session and will be returning to my Department. We wish her all itthe best and thank her for her enthusiasm and patience-thank you, Clare. I must also acknowledge the excellent work done by the Leader of the House, Kim Beazley. His unfailing good humour-particularly his laughing at my jokes; he cheers me up no end-and persistence have kept the House operating effectively. Even in the most heated moments, Kim and his new Opposition counterpart have been able to work cooperatively and get the business of the House through despite political differences. I thank him and I thank Warwick Smith also. Of course, Wal Fife was his predecessor in the job and we would like to remember Wal's contribution over the course of the year and over many years. We thank him as well. They are both good-natured, good people and we have been able to work with them effectively and well. Mr Speaker, you have one of the most difficult jobs in the House-on occasions I do pride myself on making it more difficult for you. I should think you, like the rest of us, have to earn your money. I think encouraging\ Speakers to perform is a very worthy thing', for all of us to aspire to. I thank you and your Deputy, Ron Edwards, for your efforts this year in bringing order to this place. I know it has not been easy. A lot of public policy has been discussed this year and there have been big issues between the Opposition and the Government. Obviously, this often spills over into public debate in the chamber. Your adjudicating that debate is avery hard thing to do. This is the last Christmas in parliament for a number of members from both sides of the House. I would like to take the opportunity to thank those honourable members who are retiring and wish them well for the future. The contribution of one of these departees-the Hon. Gerry Hand, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs-has been outstanding. He is always out there amongst the people. He truly is someone who has represented a constituency conscientiously and he has made a tremendous contribution to public life. In his ministerial career, he has distinguished himself in a number of portfolios: Aboriginal Affairs, where he had the responsibility, and I think he would say the privilege, of setting up ATSIC which has totally remodelled the way in which Commonwealth moneys in the area of Aboriginal affairs are expended in this country; and, more latterly, in the immigration portfolio, where probably we have never seen greater change than in the recent period. We thank him for his contribution to the nation in these important areas and for doing things with such a great sense of compassion. and good spiritedness. We will be sorry to lose him. We will miss him most particularly for his good humour and, I know in the case of some members, for his tips for Saturday. All of us who are associated with the Parliament know that the worse of pressures are borne by families. The demands of public life impose great penalties on families. It diminishes their privacy and free time. We all feel that, and know that a heavy price is being paid by those who are closest to us. That is one of the great misgivings that I am sure we all have. We want to remember them. I think I can say on behalf of the Government-and the Leader of the Opposition will probably make the same point on behalf of the Opposition-that we owe a special debt to our families who suffer with us the burdens of public office, and do it graciously. One final thing I would like to talk about is simply the way in which the chamber has operated and the public reporting of it. this is one of the great chambers of the world. We debate and settle national issues here at great speed in comparison with other countries. Our debate is robust and the nation knows what we think about things. It knows how the debate changes, how the issues are put and how the weighting is made. It results - - in a lot of conflict, but I would like to think - - . that we do not take the conflict beyond these doors-that is in a personal sense, although we certainly do in a policy sense. I think the chamber works. I know that with the televising of parliament some people in the community have felt that the tension of the Parliament or the transmission of its debate is maybe too vigorous for either the community or the household which is watching it to absorb. I have always begged to differ on this point. I have always thought that we have effectively cleared national pressures in the clearing house of national pressures: the House of Representatives. The place does its work and it does so effectively. In other countries national issues are settled by shots ringing out across the footpaths and through the houses, towns and cities where there is a lot of grief, conflict and human misery. This does not happen here. Big issues are brought to bear. here. We have feelings about them and we express those feelings. It does generate some heat, but we do resolve them-if not immediately, in a very short space of time. Maybe there has been some culture shock with the televising of parliament, but the place has always been thus. I told a story recently about Winston Churchill. As a child, his father took him to a circus and the star exhibit at the circus was somebody called 'the boneless wonder'. Churchill's father said that Winston's young eyes should not see this exhibit and he was denied entry to it. Churchill said to the then Prime Minister, Ramsay MACDonald, 'Ittook me 50 years to wait to see a boneless wonder sitting on the Treasury benches of the House of Commons'. It went on in this vein to show just how robust and spirited the debate. of the House of Commons was. When one looks at the history of that chamber one sees that it has been I think more robust than this one. In other chambers-for instance, the Japanese Diet-it is fisticuffs every week. In some of the chambers of Europe, certainly in France-for example, the Council of Europe-it is on every week. In comparison, the behaviour in this chamber is relatively demure. We remember that in the 1970s somebody threw a glass of water over somebody. Someone else has thrown some papers and books, but I think that is about the end of it. I do not know whether you would say that on the intertance national -«ale of things we are a pretty timid or dreary lot, but we ,try to keep it interesting. Perhaps the public should understand that here their interests are being debated arid are keeping faith with $e best. democratic traditions of the country., This is a deeply democratic country and we have deeply contribution democratic traditions. Those. traditions are very obvious to us in this Parliament. At - y rate, I think we all enjoy it, and that is imporof tant. We think we are doing good work and good things for the nation and that is tant too. I thank all members on both sides for their contribution to the debate. I thank the Speaker again. To all the people who have served us: I thank you for another year of effort. will go home to our families, I am sure, looking forward to the Christmas break and world. of course, for 1993, an election for another parliament where it will all begin again. Happy Christmas to everyone, and a happy New Year.",148
210,Dr HEWSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I we1c-me this opportunity to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)' others, I am sure, to look back on the passing year and reflect on what has been a very tough year for some and a very interesting year for others. We particularly thank the Prime Minister for the touch of excitement which he brought us about 12 months ago. We look forward to that process continuing into the early months of the year. As we - ee it, we have had almost a 12-month election campaign already and, at best, we have liament. between one and five months to go. Mr Hand-And we are in front.",151
211,Dr HEWSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am happy to have a frontbenchers as well. debate on that right now, if you like. It is also important to reflect briefly on the situation in Australia. It has been·a particularly tough year for most Australians. If there is one thing that should unite this place and pull us together is a genuine concern to do something about this recession and to jettison the policies the past and get on and make sure that this time next year the Australian economy is in the same position that it is in today. The Prime Minister mentioned the imporof families. We all spend an enormous amount of time away from home, not only in this place but also in the performance of our in parliamentary duties in other places around we Australia and elsewhere. We should always reflect on the tremendous support that we get from our families and the very important that they make to us. Many of us are a bit slow at times in acknowledging just how important a contribution that is, but most us could not be here without that support. This is an occasion to thank a lot of people. imporI should begin by thanking some of my immediate colleagues. Tim Fischer, I believe; is the best coalition partner that anyone could have. On Tim's behalf, I congratulate the with Prime Minister on deferring the DeCember We election plans so that Tim could build an even stronger romantic coalition elsewhere in the Peter Reith has been the very best deputy anybody could have. One of Peter's most celebrated utterances this year was, 'We are going to put the ship of state back on the and we are going to do t-at tomorrow'. Warwick Smith has already been and complimented. Having read today's newspaper about Telecom, this boy knows how to leak. But I congratulate Warwick on filling a very difficult role with tremendous dedication. He has shown that he can be an effective leader of the House from our side. He has enjoyed a particularly good relationship with Kim Beazley on the other side and . that has been' an essential feature of what has been a very smooth operation of the ParWal Fife's shoes were not easy to fill and Warwick has done a terrific job while maintaining a very active portfolio interest beyond that. Of course, I have to thank all my Mr Beddall-Where are they? Have you sent them all home?",151
212,Dr HEWSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"They are busily being it briefed. I will find out whether: I should thank the back bench when I get back to the of meeting. I will certainly thank members of the front bench for the tremendous job they have not put in in taking it up to Ministers and marketing the Fjghtback package. The Whips-Bob Halverson and Neil Andrew from our side and Noel Hicks and Garry Nehl from the National Party-have done an outstanding job. I particularly thank Bob Halverson because at a recent drinks party in Parliament House he insisted that we sing the national anthem. He was good enough to bring the words along for me, which made it a particularly memorable occasion. . To Mr Speaker, what can we say? You are a pillar of objectivity, as we have always But I do not, quite honestly, think that Australia could afford your falling out of that chair, so please take care. To the Clerks-Lyn Barlin, Ian Harris and the others-what an outstanding contribution you make. You have the unique capacity to be exceptional in the. quality of your advice and the dedication with which you serve this place. I congratulate you on how you sit there at times with such a straight face during some of the worse performances that this nation has seen. They may not be bad by international standards, but I think the people of Australia seriously worry about parliamentary standards on particular occasions. The Serjeant-at-Arms, Phil Bergin, has done an outstanding job this year. I have had the privilege of serving with Phil on parliamentary committees and I think the transition has been a very successful one. We congratulate you on that, Phil. There IS a host of other people who make this place work: the parliamentary liaison officers, the Hansard reporters, the attendants, the Bills and Papers Office staff, the Parliamentary Library, the catering staff, the drivers",151
213,Mrs KELLY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,The drivers?,152
214,Dr HEWSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I was just about to broaden that to include the taxi drivers. They make an outstanding contribution and quite often we take it for granted. But this place does run very smoothly with the contribution that all those people make. It is very important that we recognise that contribution in a genuine way. They are the unsung heroes of this place and we should never forget that. I suspect my own personal staff are amongst the most hard pressed people in this place and I want to give particular thanks to them. I am sure all honourable members would join me in thanking their staff for the tremendous contribution that they make to the work that honourable members do in the course of a year. I was very conscious of the extent to which they are hassled when the other day one of my senior staffers rang one of my back bench colleagues and the back bench colleague said said. to him, 'You must be returning my call'. When my staffer said, 'Which call?', the backbencher said, 'The one from last May'. I think there is an element of that involved. They do take the knocks when something goes wrong. I remember that one former staffer of ours commented recently that he had helped run 24 election campaigns; politicians had won seven and he had lost the rest. There is a bit of that feeling, I am afraid, when it comes to dealing with our staff and it is appropriate at this stage that we recognise the. tremendous contribution they have made. As the Prime Minister said, a lot of people are leaving this Parliament on this occasion. I think it is important that we single out a few of those from our side for particular mention. Firstly, Fred Chaney has made a very distinguished contribution to both Houses of this Parliament. I want to put on the record a recognition of that contribution, both in government and in Opposition. From a personal point of view, he has been a tremendous friend to me in the last couple of years and he has'done an outstanding job in some of the work he has taken on in his final days in this place. He did not have to, in a sense, continue to be as active as he has been, but he has gone 110 per cent in support of us winning the next election, and we should acknowledge that. Wal Fife has been mentioned. Wal has been around the parliamentary Party for about 40 years and I think he has served in Australian parliaments for something like 35 years. He again was a very good friend of mine and I was very disappointed to see him go. I think we should acknowledge the contribution that he has made in government-at the State and Federal level-in opposition, and as a friend, adviser and confidante to many of us. Others from our side all making their departure include Ian Wilson and Peter Shack; the Tasmanian firebrands, Max Burr and Bruce Good luck; and Harry Edwards. I single out Harry Edwards because he had the misfortune one way or another of teaching me economics for several years at the Sydney University. I have always respected Harry. He will remain, I am sure, as active as he has ever been in matters related to parliamentary duties; but, more broadly, he has a very wide range of interests. Ewen Cameron, Peter Fisher and Bruce Cowan are als9 leaving from this side-the last two are from the National Party. In the Senate, Senators Durack, Lewis, Walters and Flo Bjelke-Petersen are all leaving. All of them, in their own way, have made a very important contribution to this Parliament. I think it is very important that we acknowledge that at this stage. There is certainly a very large changing the guard from our side. We wish them well in whatever they choose to do in the remainder of their careers or, in some cases, in retirement. It only remains for me to wish everybody the very best for Christmas and the New Year. We look forward with great relish to the New Year, Prime Minister. This will be our last Christmas on this side of the House, and we thank you for it.",152
215,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Generally, it is the Leader of the National Party who speaks at this stage, but I shall slightly pre-empt him and add my own comments in support of the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). On this occasion, I would like to thank, firstly, and unusually, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Clare Nairn. She does an extraordinary amount to keep this House running and this is definitely her last Christmas in the position that she holds; she will be moving elsewhere. She has the trust of both sides of the House. She has the business of the day in her head, and has the most exquisite internal clock, watch or whatever I have every come across. She absolutely times to the second when people have to appear in the House and when Ministers are required. She handles parliament like a veteran, even though she has only been here for a short time. Her staff back her up-Lyn, Hannele and Ruth. Our thanks go to them, too. I would also like to thank members of our Caucus for their contribution during the year, particularly those who are committee chairmen, and those who spend a considerable amount of time making the private members' business of the House work well. It is an interesting innovation. Both sides of the House are required to perfonn in that regard and they do extremely well. It has made this Parliament, as it has not been for some time, a real sounding board of national opinion, and that is a very important function for it. I thank my counterpart, Warwick Smith. I must assure Warwick that we are going to do absolutely everything we can to ensure that there is no effective challenger to him for a front bench position from Tasmania after the of next election is held. We do that, at least in no small part, due to the regard in which we hold him. Probably only very few of us know these things-Warwick certainly does; Wal Fife does; Ian Sinclair does; and Gordon Scholes and a few others on this side of the House know-but we share one secret: we absolutely know how to destroy the working of this place. We know that, at the end of the day, if it. is detennined by an Opposition that the House will not work, then it probably will not. Over the years both sides of the House have held themselves in terrorem against the day when they might be on the other side, and so nobody goes quite for broke. This is the oldest living nuclear balance, and it continues. It is most important that it is fully comprehended that that is the case. Very few people know that most legislation goes through here, even when guillotined by leave, and it is a very significant contribution to the on functioning of the democratic process that there are, by and large, no go areas. I would also like to add those thanks to Wal Fife who was Manager of Opposition Business for part of the time. I said a great deal about him towards the end of last year and I do not, for time's sake, want to reiterate that; but he will be very much a loss to this place. I would also like to go through a list, as Leader of the Opposition did for those of his colleagues who were leaving this place. Though there may be an opportunity for us to come back again and do that it is possible within the parliamentary timetable-this is certainly their last Christmas, and the last Christmas here ought to be acknowledged for a few on our side of the House. I will go first to Gordon Scholes, who has' been a noted parliamentary contributor for many years. He has held just about every office of this chamber that can be held, and he has held a deal of ministerial positions as well. He is a very canny individual and he will be a loss to us on this side. I would also like to acknowledge an old Cabinet colleague of mine, Stewart West, who is also going to be leaving after this election. He was a most extraordinary person to be with in Cabinet; he was the most punctilious individual with a brief that I think I have ever come across. He was a loss to government and he will be a loss to parliament. Gerry Hand comes very much into that category as well. I think that he will enjoy life enormously. He has a great gusto for it. Most of us will miss this place terribly-he will not. He is definitely going to fill his time effectively when he leaves here; but he will be missed by us. We have a number of other very substantial contributors who are leaving: Ric Charlesworth, Elaine Darling, Steve Dubois, John Gayler, Lloyd O'Neil and John Scott. They are not going to be with us after this election. I think that, in many ways, this place has become a more difficult place to serve in and to survive a lengthy political career. There no question about that. I was amazed to hear the Prime Minister say that he has been here for 23 years. I cannot believe that somebody who looks like that has been here for years. The fact of the matter is that 23 years in this place would kill most of us now. father was able to survive for 32 years. There was something of him left at the end of it, not a hell of a lot. The physical difficulties functioning here for that period are now just enormous. I think one or two of the names have read out are basically casualties of that. the They will be missed because they have been great contributors to the parliamentary process while they have been here. The Clerks and the Serjeant-At-Anus keep this place functioning with tremendous tolerance and tremendous straight faces. I cannot believe that they can look so stolidly and impartially at all of us from the shenanigans that we inflict upon this place, but they do, and they give very sound and interesting advice. One of the interesting things about being Leader of the House is, firstly, to be able to acknowledge to yourself that you know nothing and, secondly, to be able to acknowledge that you will actually get an opportunity to worm out of the hole by a quick consultation with the Clerk. You know that a consultation with him will not be passed on to your opponents, and you know something very similar is going on by your opponent with another Clerk's ear, to ensure that effectively when we do things in this place we get a sort of rough facsimile of conforming to the Standing Orders. We should acknowledge the attendants who protect and assist us; the Sound and Vision Office; the Hansard staff, who of course have already been acknowledged; the catering staff; the people who keep the grounds in good order; the cleaners; the maintenance staff; the air-conditioning staff; and the gardeners. I particularly thank the staff and the people who perform the essential function on our side of the House of keeping it going: the Whips, George and Ted, and Catherine Mundy in particular, who basically from our side of the House runs this place. Praise should be given to the Presiding is Officers. They are long suff-ring and much maligned but, nevertheless, I know from my . personal knowledge of them that you, Mr Speaker, your Deputy, and your assistants 23 from both sides of the House hold those positions basically because you love this My place. You love its forms, you love its traditions and what it stands for in terms of but the political life of the nation, and you do of acquit yourself with great tolerance and forbearance given the number of times when I you may feel that what we do in this place offends against some aspect of those traditions or some aspect of the regard in which this House is held in the national community. So we thank you as well. I join too in the comments that have been made on our families. We put them to the test regularly. In many cases that test fails, and that is very much a matter of misery for us and misery for them. This is a life in which we are not permitted self-pity. Nobody can walk out of this place and expect pity from the general community. At least there is one thing we can share in a bipartisan sort of we actually all do know what each other goes through in this life and we can all have at least that unspoken sympathy for those personal experiences. All that remains, I think, is to join the comments of the other two speakers in wishing everybody a happy Christmas and, on this side of the House, a successful new year-and, for those opposite, a happy one.",153
216,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) prompted me to say a few extra words about some of the colleagues I had forgotten who are not contesting their seats again. He mentioned Gordon Scholes. I would particularly like to say that I have had a association with Gordon here. He is one of the few people in the chamber who have been here longer than I have-since 1967, when he won Corio. He held various substantial portfolios over his period in this place and was Speaker during the turbulent period of 1975. He acquitted himself in that period with great dignity, thoughtfully and carefully-a period of great turmoil when a Prime Minister had been appointed who did not have the confidence of the House. He conducted the Parliament during that period and then presented himself at Governme-t House with the Parliament's decision. It was a time when stature and judgment mattered. I think most honourable members on both sides would say that he distinguished himself during that period. He did so subsequently in other portfolios. He was Minister for Defence in a senior and significant portfolio when the Government was elected in 1983. He held that for a number of years and then gave the Government substantial service for most of the 1980s. So Gordon did see ministerial service and service as Speaker. Most particularly, he flew the flag of the Labor Party in the seat of Corio with great distinction. He always held the seat despite the swings, I think because he was held in such high regard by the community of that region. Gordon, many of us will miss you being around the place. My colleague Stewart West was a member way: of the Cabinet with me, as Gordon was, and Kim mentioned Stewart this evening. I cannot remember exactly when Stewart arrived in the House but it was in the 1970s. Before he came here I used only to see him at New South Wales Labor party conferences. Mr Lee-Not often agreeing with you.",155
217,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Not often agreeing with me, but we found common cause in many things. He more than distinguished himself. Kim said that he was a punctilious member of the Cabinet. No Cabinet Minister ever read Cabinet submissions quite with the comprehension that Stewart read them. He would be across the subjects and across the themes and making a valuable contribution in long the areas for which he had responsibility. Through great change in the 1980s in housing-one of the areas that he had-he was a substantial contributor to the changes which took place in the financial deregulation of the housing industry and the subsequent changes to that industry. He comes from a working class area, the area of Wollongong, and he has never done or said a thing which he thought or knew was injurious to the people he represented, only always speaking in their favour. Other retiring members who are not Ministers also served with distinction and were part of this Caucus during these parliamentary years when I think never has a Caucus of the Labor Party ever distinguished itself as this one has for good sense and judgment. There are a number of members who have served here in that period, taking the issues on board, and making some of the great changes which have given Australia the opportunity to be a successful, modem industrial country again. Let me name a few of them: John Scott, Elaine Darling, Lloyd O'Neil, Steve Dubois, and Ric Charlesworth. Ric is probably the only Olympian who was a serving member the Parliament when he attended an Olympic Games. Sir Hubert Opperman was an OIYIl!pian but, if my memory serves me correctly, it was before he became a member of parpattern liament. This group of members has served elected in 1984. the Parliament with distinction. They are now going to do other things with their lives, some because they have just decided that they to do something else. This is a terribly healsitting thy attitude for members to take. Having in here, having served the public well, they have decided to do something else with their lives and give another person the opportunity to represent their constituencies. I want place on, record my appreciation of their parliamentary service. I say as Leader of Labor Party, for the distinctive way that they have contributed to the affairs of the Labor - arty as a parliamentary party, that all of us will miss them.",155
218,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I extend Somalia, Christmas greetings. and pick up one parGulf, ticular point from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). He referred to the pressures of modem day politics on the functioning of members, and I think Western Australian members have a particular cross to bear. make two points arising from this. I think is sometimes easier to function on a working honeymoon involving four nations in four days than it is to function in a four-day sitting week on the floor of the Federal Parliament. There was Mexico, the United States and UK in four days, and then Thailand on top, and back on duty in time to address the creates. package that will alter the future of Australia and change the Government at the next work election. But this is the occasion for Christmas greetings. The second point I wish to make is in relation to the sitting pattern of the Parto liament, and the functional pressure on every member and senator of this Parliament, their families and staff, and others. happy compromise, the basic arrangement of two weeks on and two weeks off-the first week Tuesday to Thursday and the second week Monday to Thursday-does constitute as good a system as we can get. I stake a of claim for the next parliament, under the coalition government, that this House should never sit on Fridays, nor ever contemplate going back to sitting on Fridays as was the for the first few years after I was A committee was set up which addressed this question in some detail. I made a submiswant sion to that committee about a stabilised schedule. There is no easy solution to been these matters, but in extending a happy Christmas I think it relevant to make the point that the Leader of the House is correct in his statement that there are inordinate pressures to placed on members in terms of the physical commitment and the hours of service in the volved, and I certainly acknowledge that. I would like to take this opportunity to salute those Australians in service for their Government and their country at this time, not only those in the armed forces in those six places I referred to earlier today-those in Cambodia, the elements still in the the Sahara, the Middle East and Pakistan. I also refer to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They are not all on cocktail circuit postings of great comfort. I cite the example of those working in I Mexico City, the capital of Mexico. Mexico it is a magnificent country showing a considerable economic plus, but equally it is dominated by a killing smog over much of the city area for most of the time. It is so bad that consideration is being given to not the sending people with young children to Mexico City because of the difficulties it I take this opportunity to acknowledge the of those Australians in the service of the Government of Australia in a wide range of jobs: those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, those in. seconded service the World Bank and elsewhere, and those on aid projects. I commend them on their work, and extend Christmas greetings to them If there is a through this forum. Turning to the Parliament more specifically, I extend my very best wishes to the large number of honourable members retiring from both sides of the House. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the House have detailed those in the Labor Party. I acknowledge especially the service of the former Speaker of the Parliament, the honourable member for Corio, Gordon Scholes, and also the honourable member for Grey, Lloyd 0 'Neil, with whom I served on the committee dealing with that wonderful subject, transport-and particularly rail transport and the east-west corridor. That committee provided a basis for the advent of the National Rail Corporation on which the Western Australian Parliament finally, quite recently, passed legislation. It is now about to become operational. I would like to take this opportunity to salute the work of that committee and to note that it has been a catalyst for ideas. Particularly I note the service of the honourable member for Grey, who has taken a deep interest in the operation of Australian National and rail as a mode of transport over many years. Turning to members of the Liberal Party, I would like to highlight the retirement of my neighbour and colleague the honourable member for Hume, Wal Fife, who has served in both the New South Wales Parliament and the Federal Parliament. Wal has put in decades of service, not just in a parliamentary role in both the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and the Federal Parliament; he also chose to take upon himself many community roles-roles which were not absolutely essential-with regard to hospital work and a raft of other activities. He took a leadership role in connection with hospitals in his electorate, especially in Wagga. He was involved in a whole range of other activities, and he gave some very decisive leadership, for example on the campus location of the then college of advanced education, now Charles Sturt University, which showed a lot of foresight. Thming to the National Party, I pay a particular tribute to the honourable member for Lyne. Bruce Cowan, in both the Legislative Assembly of the New South Wales Parliament and in Federal Parliament, has given some two decades of dedicated, determined service.",156
219,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,One of nature's gentlemen.,157
220,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I take the point of the Leader of the House. He is one of nature's gentlemen. The honourable member for Lyne is also a very courageous person who has suffered a horrific personal tragedy J but has elected to ciUTy on in the service of his electorate. I salute his service to this Parliament and to the widest possible range of community groups he represents. Nothing was too small or too large for Bruce to undertake. He finetuned my process of representation when I was a very young and new member of the New South Wales Parliament. In a sense he showed me the 'two-minute Tim' trick: the ability to be available in front of a post office or a council chamber and doa fair dinkum tour of one's electorate, being readily available to everybody. From some small towns with unpronounceable names in his electorate to the very biggest centres in his electorate, Bruce Cowan covered the distance. The honourable member for Mallee, Peter Fisher, also played a role in my parliamentary service. I salute his two decades of service. Peter Fisher-damn him-happened to be at the MCG in 1984 when news of the latest redistribution came out regarding Federal seats in southern New South Wales. History might record that if Peter Fisher had not been at the MCG grand final, and if Tim Fischer had not been at the MCG grand final, Peter Fisher would not have had the opportunity to convince Tim Fischer that then was the moment when he should switch from State to Federal politics. He was responsible for describing the atrocious coat I was wearing on that occasion-which I still have not given to St Vincent's, I might add. Peter Fisher, again, has been a dedicated servant to his electorate. Like Bruce Cowan, he will be greatly missed. I believe they are both determined to get on with one or two other things-for instance, the deep interest they have in the land and local projects. I wish both Bruce Cowan and Peter Fisher the very best in their deserved retirement. I might refer to one other neighbour of mine who is retiring-the honourable member for Indi, Mr Ewen Cameron. He also fits that description of nature's gentleman. He has just returned from service with the United Nations. I have heard a lot about the UN observer trip in my years of service. From all I heard when I passed through there, the honourable member for Indi served Australia well in his representation at the United Nations. The caravan that Ewen Cameron polluted his electorate with was a notable dimension of his service to his electorate. It is a gigantic vehicle with signs all over it. I am not sure where it is now-Euroa? Mr Ewen Cameron-I have lent it to another electorate.",157
221,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"It was a distinctive hallmark in Ewen's electorate. I genuinely salute his service, and I wish him well in his retirement. I salute all those who have served the Parliament throughout the course of this year: yourself, Mr Speaker, as Speaker; the Clerks of the House; the many people in the Sergeant-at-AnTIs Office; the many people in the supporting offices associated with the Parliament; those people in the transport office; and those people carrying out the various other functions which are perfonned sight unseen. I salute everyone involved and extend to them a happy Christmas, but there is one area in particular I salute. Right down in the bowels of this place there is an area called carpenters shop. For the first time in my political service I had occasion to visit the carpenters shop. I had heard about this shop. One of the workers down there is the son of an Anny friend of mine. I went to meet him and to wish him well. I might add that the conditions there have recently been improved. There had been quite severe dust problems of an occupational health nature. So whether it be to the carpenters of the Parliament, who sometimes perhaps know more about some activities of the Parliament than the rest of us, or whether it be to everyone else involved from both the House of Representatives and the Senate sidesnotwithstanding certain missives from Clerks of the Senate-I extend to them my best wishes for a happy Christmas and a happy New Year. The aviation services afforded to honourable members are often taken for granted. But a number of people from the airlines of Australia, including from Ansett and Australian Airlines principally, go out of their way to facilitate the almost impossible demands of members and senators on a raft of occasions. Whether it be a 'Melissa' at one of the lounges in the Sydney airport or a range of other people right around Australia, their particular service is often underrecognised as we belt out with our bags to catch the closing door of an improved flight connection. I take this opportunity to salute all of them right around Australia, particularly those from the key airports of Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, on the work that they carry out and for the slight softening of the schedule that they bring us as we cover all of our commitments. To my own staff, both here in Canberra and in Albury, to my Deputy Leader, Bruce Lloyd, to my colleagues from both the front and back benches in the coalition, and to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I extend my thanks and Christmas greetings. These comments are extended to my Whips, Noel Hicks and Garry Nehl as well. I extend my Christmas greetings to the Prime Minister. Whilst I am tempted to reiterate my concern over his announced the decision tonight to remove reference to Her Majesty the Queen from the Oath of Allegiance, I am conscious of the conventions of this debate. It is not as historic as last year's, which was a most memorable occasion, whatever your particular attitudes to the events of that day. Nevertheless, in the tradition of Christmas, I wish everyone. a happy Christmas and a happy New Year and:-to reverse the twist of the Leader of the House-a very successful new year so far as the coalition is concerned. I wish everyone a safe Christmas break, so that everyone who is re-elected might safely return to this place some time after the next election.",158
222,Mr JOHN SCOTT,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I believe that the shortest speeches are the best, so I will try to give the best. Because this may well be my last address to the House-along with some 16 others who are voluntarily retiring; not to mention those who might not come back for other reasons-I crave the indulgence of the House to say a few words. When I came into the Parliament in 1980, it was an extremely good year for the Labor Party. Some of my colleagues who came in at that time were Ross Free, Ros Kelly, Bob Hawke and many others. Two of my colleagues whom I miss very much are Peter Milton and Lewis Kent. The three of us were known as the Three Musketeers. We caused some jealousy in the Caucus because we were invincible and could not be tom apart in any way. I want to endorse the statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to express best wishes to all honourable members and to those who work in this Parliament. I hope that that will be taken as read because there are a few things that I would like to say, not just because it is the end of the year but because I am retiring after 12 years-12 years of my life that I would never have believed to be possible. We were in opposition when I came into parliament. We were magnificent in opposition. I regret to say that our colleagues the other side have been wimps in opposition. I say that in a kind way, because democracy requires activity on both sides of the House. If we do not win all of the time, it is because those opposite put pressure on us so that we have to modify policies. But we were magnificent in government. In my early months in parliament I ran into some problems with the Speaker. I hope I will not have that trouble tonight. Speaker Billy Snedden took a bit of a shine to me because he liked to hear my accent. It made him nostalgic, so I got the call far more than I do now. However, I tested the patience of Billy about five months into my first year when I was suspended from the service of the House. I caused a ruckus. I have to say in confession that I picked the issue deliberately. My colleague Stewart West was the only one who knew that I was going to do it. I kicked up a fuss because of a uranium issue. I had some problems because some of my colleagues did not want to count me out. Nevertheless, that is history. When I got back to my Federal electorate office in Hindmarsh and was recalling this particular incident to Clyde Cameron, who preceded me, he said that that was about the same time that he was in before he was kicked out. I do. not know whether that is accurate but that is what Clyde recalls. When moving into government we-that is, John Scott and some of my colleagues-had a dreadful year because we entered into the Combe affair. For me it was a dreadful tearing apart of the Party. David Combe was a particular friend of mine. He is someone whom I had admired and I do admire. I hope that he will always be my friend. I was glad to befriend him during those dreadful days when he was before the Royal Commission. I hope David-wherever you are and even though you have given up politics-that you know that you made a mark and you still have some very good friends. We had a dreadful time to begin with, learning the ropes. Of course Hawkey had his own particular way. Hawkey and I have some things in common. When he became the on President of the ACTU it was because he managed to get the votes of the executive. He was voted in by the Left, by the way-we have made a few mistakes. At the time Albert Monk was the President of the ACTU and he had the numbers. You may recall that Harold Souter was also in there vying for the position, but because there was no ACTU Congress the position had to be filled by the executive. . We did not have the numbers. On Labour Day 1969 Bill Brown of the Trades and Labour Council of South Australia died. He was a member of the executive. That position was contested by Jimmy Shannon who was of the Left. When he was elected he provided the numbers to allow Bob Hawke to become the President of the ACTU. The vacancy that Jim Shannon left was in the Amalgamated Engineering Union and I filled that vacancy and served in the trade union for 12 years. It is a position that I am extremely proud of holding. I feel privileged to have served and I will never ever be ashamed of being a trade unionist. I probably have one of the unique union tickets in Australia-it is John Scott, motor mechanic, factory, Parliament House. I may get a job here afterwards. That was the designation the union gave to me after I left that particular position. I moved on to some other precarious positions. When the present Prime Minister was giving the Budget Speech in, It- 1986 I found some of it difficult to take and protested violently, but I was clever enough to get out before I was counted out. I was followed by my musketeer friends Lewis Kent and Peter Milton and the argument with the Government at that time was the sale of uranium to France. It is history, but I am glad I was part of it. It is a pity that Robert Tickner is not because he played a role in what I want to say, The following year, while we were sitting in the old House and Paul was going through his Budget Speech, a note was delivered from Robert Tickner. It read, 'John, will you, Lewis and Peter be staying for the whole of the Budget Speech this year?'. That is part of my memorabilia. I apologise to Paul, but he knows the game; he knows what politics is about. ;I want to be specific and say thank you to some special people. The Parliamentary Library has not been mentioned specifically, although it was referred to in some ways by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I want to mention special names. It does not mean that they are special and others did not do the job. Dr Rod Panter is perhaps one of the best researchers Australia has. I do not know how we can afford people like that. Rod and his team, the team in the law and government section and various other sections of the Parliamentary Library, are unique. I am sure that most people who use the Library would agree that the Australian Parliamentary Library would be alongside .the best in the world. When we measure our mark in this Parliament, sometimes it is measured by the number of speeches we make. If that is the score, then I have been a failure--perhaps a total failure. I believe that there are other measures, and I hope that my mark in this Parliament, in this democratic process, has been in our Caucus committees and parliamentary committees. I have tried, wherever possible, to engage the Fourth Estate in the issue of parliamentary committees because I believe it is a very important part of a democracy. I hope that some day they will wake up to it. Unfortunately, senators such as Bronwyn Bishop are making their mark, perhaps in the wrong way-in a way that hurts-but, nevertheless, I think people are now starting to look at parliamentary committees. I think they have a tremendous role to play, and none more importantly than the role that was played just recently by Chainnan Peter Morris in the inquiry of the Standing Committee on here Transport, Communications and Infrastructure into ship safety. Tim Fischer mentioned the transport Committee. I was part of that. .one can go on and on. Another example is the Public Works Committee. It is time we backbenchers told the people on the front bench that parliamentary committees are very important. We should be able to write what the issues are that we are going to follow up, not be told by the leaders or by the Ministers. It is time there was a revolt on the back benches, because it is at the back bench level that we work togetller. We work together well, do we not? Ewen, Bruce and others have done this in many committees. I think that is to the benefit of democracy. If the Ministers decide to reject the wisdom of our reports, then that is also part of the process. But, in serving the people, we should ensure that these committees become more important. I regret that we on the Government side in the House of Representatives eliminated the expenditure review committees. They were great fun. The people in the Senate have great fun. Ministers hate it, so it must be good. Also· in government we changed Question Time. That may have been a good thing. Bruce rocks his head and says no. I recall when Question Time was at the beginning of the day. Often at 10 o'clock in the morning, if the Ministers had had a late night in Cabinet, they were a bit shaky. I have seen many on exhibition. I will not mention a particular Prime Minister, but I was in opposition at the time. It provided us in opposition with a great opportunity to score on the government. But perhaps that was a better result to have. Mr Hand-Can you give us another hint?",158
223,Mr JOHN SCOTT,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"He was taller than I am. I do not think it is important to mention names. There is one score I would like to settle before I leave this place. It is not on this floor; it is up there in the press gallery. Often we are told that we are in the ivory tower. If this is the ivory tower, there is a mezzanine floor up there, and they are bloody protected. They write history. They use us, they suck us in and we fall for it. I would like to take the gallery on. There are a few journalists who are the exception-I could name them, but that would finish them-who do the research, do not toe the line and do not follow a line, and more power to them. Parliamentary committees, providing the opportunity to go overseas with colleagues from both sides of the House, from the Senate and the House of Representatives, build up great friendships. I recall that in 1983 I had the privilege to lead a delegation to Japan. I had friends such as Ewen Cameron, Bob KaUer, one of our penguins, Jim Pender, and many others. I want especially to mention Jim Pender. As long as we have people like Jim Pender in the Public Service, Australia is in a good situation. In that particular delegation to Japan, which was quite strenuous, I had the great support in particular of Bob Katter. He is not with us now, but Bob was a very good friend. I had difficulty with one particular senator, a Liberal-you know what they are like-and it was Bob Katter who lined him up and told him, 'Johnny Scott's the leader'. I am ever grateful to Bob for that particular support. Of the friends I have had in this place, there are none closer than Peter Milton and Lewis Kent. I miss them dearly. I am sure the Parliament misses them. I was very privileged to have those friends with me. I thank my staff and my office for looking after the house when we were not there. Most importantly, I thank Michiko, my wife, my supporter, my friend, who has been beside me. It has sometimes caused some problems for some of you, but I was lucky to have my wife with me. I think it is a dreadful burden that members of parliament have to bear with the trouble and the hours and do not always have their family with them, especially the younger members who have children still at school. My heart goes out to them. I hope they can bury politics and start to get some respect and recognition for the sacrifice that each and every one of them makes. Lastly, I want to thank the people of . Hindmarsh for giving me, a motor mechanic from Glasgow, the privilege and opportunity to have served in this Parliament for 12 years. I wish you all the best for this season. I say to those who return: keep democracy flying high. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",161
224,Mr SMITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"John, we certainly on this side wish you the very best. I want to join the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others who have spoken in the sentiments they have expressed in the valedictory debate. As I was listening to John Scott, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, one of the more attractive elements of this debate came forward, and that is that at a time like this we can express some of the friendships we feel for each other, not just on our own side but across the chamber. That is one of the things that we do not see often enough in this place. We all share a common bond in serving our nation. John has expressed those sentiments very well tonight, and I think all of us appreciate what he is saying. Tonight, as someone mentioned earlier, the numbers that are actually retiring from the chamber are unprecedented. Because of that, I want to speak only briefly as I know that there are several on the other side who would like to make a few remarks, and I know that two of my colleagues on this side would like to have an opportunity to speak briefly. I quickly take the opportunity, firstly, to thank the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), for his kind remarks and cooperation during the short period that I have had this task. I am trying to learn from him some of the tricks of the trade. I have to say that I learnt another one tonight. When you have a look at the list, you will see that the very last Bill tonight is the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. The only speaker listed for the Opposition is me, so the longer I speak, the longer I am going to be standing here later in the morning. Kim, for the very last day you won another round. I know that this list was ably put together today under great travail by Clare Nairn. Clare is leaving us after a 2 11z-year stint as PLO. I have only worked with her for a short time, but I extend to her good wishes and thanks. She has been very cooperative. It is in the gift of the Prime Minister as to whom Anna, who has just arrived, might be working with when the Parliament resumes. Whomever it might be, you could not see a finer example of how the job is done than by observing Clare. To Lyn Barlin, his deputy Ian Harris, and Ian Cochran, I say a particular thank you. I received a telephone call not that long ago and I thought it was yet another leader who had the wrong number. I did ask him to repeat it, just to make sure. I then borrowed a copy of the Standing Orders. Lyn, I am sorry I had not been a great one to follow them closely, but I have since made some study. I thank you and Ian Harris, particularly, for the assistance you have given me through what has been an interesting and not easy time. I thank those in the Parliament who serve us. There are many of them: the staff responsible for transport, particularly John May, the staff of Hansard and the Sound and Vision Office, those in catering, on the switch and in the library, as well as the many others who have already been mentioned tonight. I spent five years on the Library Committee. I think information to members is extremely important and I do not think we ought to ignore the contribution the library staff makes. I thank those in my own office, Vivienne Shield and Rob Douglas, for their invaluable assistance. To run a very busy and complicated portfolio as well as attempting to do this task puts great demands upon them, and they meet every challenge. We are an office that works well and with a great deal of good humour. On behalf of all my colleagues, I thank Whip Bob Halverson-and his assistant BA-who had to put up with some fairly difficult times with a new chum in the chair. They do a magnificent job, as I am sure do the Whips from the other side. Unfortunately, Mr Speaker has left the chair. It has been a difficult time for Mr Speaker to be running this Parliament. I think he tries to deal as best he can with the very difficult personalities in this chamber. At various times tempers get heated, but he is still there. Whether he will be there later on is another question. I have known Leo for quite some time and have a regard for him, particularly because he is the only person who has ever occupied that chair as Speaker who has visited Flinders Island, which is the most remote part of Bass Strait and a part of my electorate. Leo, whatever you get for Christmas, I hope it will not be a pair of roller skates. I thank my Leader, John Hewson, as well as Tim Fischer and Peter Reith. I thank John Hewson particularly for his kind remarks. I appreciate the words that he extended to me. I make special mention of several of the Labor members who are leaving, particularly Gerry Hand, who I hope will have a chance to say a few words. I had the very interesting opportunity to be shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs at a time when Gerry had the carriage of a piece of legislation which generated quite a deal of community discussion and debate in this place. I think the contribution that he made in this very difficult area and the genuineness with which he approached the topic are things that he will be remembered for. I think we have been lucky in this chamber that the people who have taken on this task, from both the Opposition and the Government side, have generally been chosen by their colleagues and leaders. They try to do a job and fix things which cannot be fixed in the short term. They must try to display some empathy and understanding for the long term issues involved in that portfolio. I also pay a compliment to Dr Wooldridge for the work that he is doing. Gerry, it was a very difficult time, as you know. During that period, being a Tasmanian-I do not say that in any flippant sense-to take on that portfolio was doubly difficult. You extended to me courtesies which might not otherwise have been extended through a very difficult time. I am pleased to see that the approach to Aboriginal affairs in this country is now moving to what I would regard to be very sensible and bipartisan, and very genuine in attending to the very real challenges that face us all. I do not think I have ever actually talked to Gordon Scholes about the observation I am going to make. I have served with him on many committees. In 1975, in the old chamber, when I was a student of political science and law, I used to be a regular attendant of the Parliament. I was there on that momentous day. I spent the day outside wandering around and talking with a colleague, Justin O'Byrne-someone who is very well known to me from my home town of Launceston. You did have a very difficult time. I thought it was befitting for your Prime Minister to pay you the tribute that he did. We do not share the same views about that event on every issue, but I thought it was a fitting tribute was paid to you tonight. I salute you for the service you have given your nation. There are several colleagues from my own side whom I want to mention-Wal Fife particularly. Wal Fife went into the New South Wales Parliament in 1957. I was three years old at the time. I think that is a tremendous period of service. I do not think it will be equalled by many of us here. I think Mr Beazley said that his father was here for 32 years and there was a little left of him when he finally departed. Wal Fife is a man with infinite wisdom. He is a man who exudes a gentleness but a firmness that many of us have drawn upon. He is a model for many in this place, wherever they might sit, as to how this game works. I hesitate to call it a game. Perhaps we should call it a profession-if we elevate it, perhaps the community will follow us. He has displayed the sentiments and the demeanour of a parliamentarian which we can all see as a valuable example and try to emulate. I express my regard for my colleague Ewen Cameron, who is leaving the Parliament, and for his wife, Alison. He was a Whip here for some time. For a number of years he was also my fiatmate. We have had a very strong personal relationship for a long time. Ewen, I wish you well. We are very sad to see you go. You know how much I will miss you, as will many of my colleagues. Fred Chaney is not here at present. He is leaving and I wish him well. Dr Edwards is also leaving. The contribution he has made to the Christian group in the Parliament will always be remembered. Ian Wilson from South Australia, Bruce Cowan and Peter Fisher are also leaving. My good friend Peter Shack is a young man who is leaving prematurely from the Parliament. He has made a very strong commitment to this Parliament over a long period. His going out as a young man .and then coming back again to keep fighting the way he has is another fine example. I will miss him as one of the people whom I am closest to in this place and I certainly wish him well. I mention my Tasmanian colleague, Max Burr, who is not here tonight, and his wife, that Ros. We will miss Max, who has his electoral office in Launceston. He has been very much an individual politician. He has not been scared to take on his colleagues on this side of the House on any occasion about any matter. He has held a seat for us that we might not otherwise have held, by sheer dint of hard work on the ground in a very difficult electorate. Bruce Good luck, we know you have been ill and we hope that leaving this place will see your health return. You will be missed. You have acted as the conscience of our Party. You have spoken up about the human issues. At present the national debate is about human issues and putting them first. Putting people first is important. Bruce has always put people first. Bruce, I think that has been your finest contribution during your time in this place. I wish you well. The prospect of your former colleague Michael rejoining us ! did worry me a little, but I understand that it may be his younger brother. If that is the case, we certainly would welcome him. I would like to finish on a personal note. John Scott, the Prime Minister and indeed my own Leader referred to this matter; that is, we should thank our families, particularly those of us who have young families. I would like to mention my own family: my wife, Kathryn, and my three young children, Mirinda, Isaac and Sabrina. They do not understand' now why their father is not there. Maybe one day they will. Serving the nation is something that is to be cherished. It is something that I think all of us can take great pride in. We do it well and as best we can with the abilities that we But if we bring to the job a warm heart and generous spirit, this country can only prosper for our having been here. Ladies and gentlemen, happy Christmas and all the best for the New Year.",161
225,Mr HAND,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)-As has been said, this may well be my last speech in this place and so I will take a few moments to make a couple of points. First of all, I would like to join with other speakers in thanking all those people who help make this place work-not only this last year but for the time. I have been here, which is just a bit of a blip in the whole show. Everyone has always been most helpful even though they are not always treated with the degree of courtesy that they ought to be treated with by us here. I want to thank one particular group-the staff in the dining room, who I do not think have been mentioned yet. Some women have been working up there for a long time-Josie, and people like that. They really do go out of their way to make us feel very much at home. I hope the Clerk will not hold it against me for making a special mention of those people. It is important because it can get very lonely here from time to time. I would also like to thank all the people with whom I have served on this side of the House and in particular a group of people that I meet with regularly, although not so regularly these days. To everybody on this side of the House: I would not be a Minister if it were not for you. I would not be a member of parliament if it were not for the people in my electorate, and I would not have been the endorsed candidate if it were not for my Party. I thank all of those three groups of people. Not everybody in my electorate of Melbourne voted for me, but I do not think there is a better electorate in the country in terms of its make-up. The membership of the Melbourne branches of the Labor Party is the best and always has been. We will continue to be the powerhouse of the Party. I say that quite seriously because over the last 15 or so years it is a fact that the Melbourne branches have. have been the powerhouse in terms of numbers, contributions and policy development within that State. I once stood for another preselection battle, and I lost. I wonder what would have happened if I had won Wills. I know one thing: we probably would not have needed to have a by-election; we probably would not have had the High Court ruling; and things might have been quite different. I would like to pay special tribute to both Prime Ministers whom I have served under. I make particular reference to Bob Hawke. It is no secret that I did not get on all that well with him in the early days, prior to coming here. We grew closer together while I was here. We both had one failing, which we both gave away. I beat him on that; I was years ahead of him. Nonetheless, we grew rather close here and he gave me an opportunity to be the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Paul Keating, whom I have also been much closer to over the years on a personal level than many people have understood, has done a magnificent job as leader. I have no doubt that he will be the Prime Minister after the next election, whenever he decides to call it. I will be working alongside him and others to make sure that happens. I tum to one of my colleagues, Mick Duffy, who I know I am going to bump into a lot because we both share an interest in a fourlegged species. There have been some low times here, and I want to make a special mention of Mick because I have relied on him in a couple of ways which are perhaps not known to people here. I want to make reference to that. I want to thank not only my ministerial staff here in this place but also my electorate staff. It has been a pretty turbulent six in the Ministry and my time in Aboriginal Affairs was a pretty torrid one. But what a great time it was. I would say that I have the two most exciting portfolios that one have. They were the only two I wanted, and I got them both. They were both people portfolios. I would like to thank Warwick Smith for his comments. The Aboriginal people are very important to this country. We must always remember that. We have a long way to go before we correct the wrongs of the past. Without going into the guilt thing, because am not into that, I do not mind saying that have a long way to go. This current portfolio is exciting because it is part of culture to run alongside the old one. Nowhere else in the world do so many groups of people get on so well together. That is exments citing. I have had numerous opportunities which never would have had, had I such as the opportunity to travel. For example, I have had the opportunity to camp in the bush with the Aboriginal people and told things about their culture; to meet people in the tragic situations of the borders of Somalia and see those poor kids dying; to visit Turkey, Iraq and Iran after their respective wars. I say this to the people who wrote to me upset about the Gulf war: I have no regrets for the way I voted during the Gulf war debate. I have longed to say that yet again. have no regrets because I went there and saw the women waiting outside the hospital with their dying babies. I saw that in the flesh, not on the TV. I have seen the results of Saddam's murderous regime. I backed Kurds the night I spoke here on the war, and before I go I wanted to say that I have no regrets about that particular vote. I would like to relate a couple of experiences I have had, because as a member of parliament we do have some funny moments. I always try to be tough while under attack. I remember that one night when I was at function and the people there were particularwill ly upset with me, I said, 'This isn't going too good' but by the end of the night we had years worked our way through it and photos were taken. It is always a good sign in ethnic affairs that you are travelling pretty well when had photos are taken at the end of the night. can However, a bloke sidled up to me and said, 'I would like to apologise, Minister, because we've got a demonstration planned for Friday'. I said, 'That is good, who is it against?', and he replied, 'You'. Being the tough guy that I am, I said to myself, 'We're still not travelling all that well'. I said to him, 'It had better be a good one because I get really upset if you don't have a good demo I when I am involved'. They had a meeting on we the Thursday night and made sure they had a big demonstration. It does not always pay to the new challenge people to do things. I want to say something about families. I really do resent Bishop Hollingworth's comabout politicians only doing things at election time. I have never ceased to think I about it from the day he said it and the· day not been here, Hawke tackled him. I remember going to a Party function with my wife, Maree. I walked in and somebody be asked her, 'How long have you been with with Gerry?' She said, 'About 28 years'. The woman said, 'Oh my God, I am sorry, love, and I never thought the wives would come'. The wives do come and they do a lot for us. I just make that comment on her behalf. Mrs Crosio-So do the husbands.",164
226,Mr HAND,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"And the husbands too; I am I sorry, ladies. You cannot change an old dog. I am just too old to change, but I try; by God, do I try. We are moving house tomorrow and and guess who is at home packing up? When I get off the plane tomorrow I will probably walk the in and say, 'Is everything ready?'",165
227,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,You were always a good organiser.,165
228,Mr HAND,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I always was a good organiser. To Michelle, Vicky and Leigh, my three kids who have put up with me being away from home for 20 years, I say thank a you very much. They are funny kids but I not bore you with their stories. I am grateful for their support. They never ceased supporting both Maree and myself. The people sitting in the gallery might think that this is a lot of sentimental nonsense. It a great privilege to come here and to try to help people. You only get one shot at it. I have had my shot. I am very proud to have been here. I make one plea to both sides of the House. My electorate is an interesting electorate. It has all those high rise estates it. It has a lot of poor people in it. Do not forget the poor.",165
229,Mr EWEN CAMERON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"This is the first time in my political career that I have spoken on the valedictory. I have always felt that it was for the leaders to make the valedictory speeches but, tonight, in my opinion, it is a very special occasion. I am quite convinced that this is the last sitting day of this Parliament. I might be wrong. Tonight I was challenged that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will announce an election tomorrow. I realise that it is illegal to have a bet on the result of an election, but I am quite convinced that you could have a bet on the likelihood of the Prime Minister calling an election. I have $50 on that and I hope that the Prime Minister is listenmg. I hope he does not let me down. I do not want him to announce the election tomorrow. It is a very moving occasion for me after 15 years in this place-IS very enjoyable years. I have never regretted standing for preselection in my electorate and, perchance, being elected as the member for Indi. I sincerely thank the people of Indi who have allowed me to participate and have the privilege of serving in the Australian Parliament. Today, as I say, is a very sentimental and special occasion because I am convinced that this is the last sitting day of this Parliament. This evening we had what might be called the family last supper. My family joined me, including two of my three new grandchildren. They are very beautiful babies. You have got to be pretty good to have three grandchildren in five months. I really cannot take credit for that. The real joy to me is to have my wife with me tonight, plus my children and the grandchildren. As many honourable members realise, it was Alison who raised my children. I have been a member of parliament over that is period and she has raised my children. I want to take the opportunity in my retirement to enjoy the raising of the grandchildren. As a member of parliament, I have enjoyed great friendships with members on both sides of the House. I have enjoyed great friendships in with the parliamentary staff and with people in the dining rooms, particularly in the old days, when we had staff who stayed with us and we did our own thing. I am not saying that I criticise any change in this Parliament House, but they were the days when great friendships were made with the maids and a whole series of people. I have particularly high regard for the Clerks of the House who work so very hard in an endeavour to make us aware of the way this place really should work. I would like to thank them very much. I would like to thank in particular John May and Brian in the travel office and others who have worked there. One of the major things in this place from our point of view is to get here and get home. I have enjoyed enormously my service on parliamentary committees. It has created great fr-endships with members from the other side of the House and from my own side of the House. They are permanent, lasting friendships formed on overseas delegations and while travelling all over Australia and conducting hearings of parliamentary committees. It really was a great honour for me, and I thank my colleagues for allowing me to be one of the two representatives of the Australian Parliament at the recent General Assembly of the United Nations. It was an enormously marvellous experience and I will never ever forget it. It was the pinnacle of my 15 years in this place to finish on that note. I would like to say how extraordinarily professional the Australian mission to the United Nations is. The dedication to duty of the staff of the mission really made me open my eyes. It made me proud that we Australians have such a mission to the United Nations and to see in the United Nations itself how they look to Australia for leadership in so many areas, so much so that the ambassador is now chainnan of a committee which is organising the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of the United Nations, as well as looking at making recommendations for changes to improve the structure and the working of the United Nations, in particular the secretariat. I do not want to speak at any further length, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank you for the years of association I have had with you and for accepting my request tonight to say a few words.",166
230,Mr SCHOLES,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I want first to thank those who have said nice words about me tonight. I came into the parliament with my eyes open. I first stood for parliament in 1964 and I first seriously stood in 1966. It was not quite a vintage year for the Labor Party, but it was a watershed for the Labor Party. We got cleaned .out, totally and absolutely. I only got beaten by 7,800 votes. It was not all bad. Seven months later, I was a candidate in an election and eight months later I was a member of parliament. That year was also a watershed for the Labor Party. Whilst I won a by-election, Australia won a new political system-a rebirth of its political system which had died in 1949 and had been, I suppose, trampled by the advent of the DLP in 1955. Whilst I can remember the enthusiasm· of the 1966 election, I am not sure that too many people in the Labor party thought that we could win or ever thought that we could be a government again. I am certain that, on the night of the 1966 election, that was the feeling. The by-election in 1967 was the result of an enormous amount of work by a lot of people. There are two people to whom I think I have to give real credit, and who later reaped the rewards of that effort-Gough Whitlam and Lance Barnard. There were a lot of people who put in, but Gough Whitlam and Lance Barnard almost lived in Corio for that period, and the result was that the politics of Australia were turned around. The Liberal Party was in a pretty bad way. I say that with some regret but, nevertheless, Harold Holt was Prime Minister 20 years after he had passed his prime. Billy MCMahon was also a Prime Minister who was there while the Liberal Party was waiting to regenerate. I do not want to go through those years again, but there was a lot of trauma and a lot of things happened. But what did happen was that the politics of this country became competitive again and the people of Australia were given a choice and, when they were given a choice, they changed governments when they thought changes in government were necessary. I had the opportunity - I must say in a time of crisis-of becoming Speaker of this Parliament. I think the day that I became Speaker was one of the most traumatic days of my life, or many others. I seem to recall that I lost seven pounds in about four hours sitting in that chait wondering whether I would be Speaker, because Jim Cope at that stage had not resigned. It was not one of the great days for this Parliament and it was one of the lesser good days for Gough Whitlam. I had later opportunities-and I do not want to go through those. It has been a privilege to serve in this place for 25 years. I have to thank a lot of people, particularly the 70,000odd people who are the electors of Corio and the branch members and supporters of the Labor Party who have turned out year after year in good times and bad to support Labor candidates, not only when we were winning, but, I seem to remember, when we had no members at all and we were losing every seat by 4,000. They were still turning out. Over the river in Corangamite they were turning out, too. This Parliament has a lot to do in a very short period. We are now in the new Parliament House. We have the opportunities, but we have not seized them. We are doing our business now the same way we were when I came here in 1967, but the business is not the same. One can say that the three years of Gough Whitlam changed the government of Australia and who governs Australia forever. The amount of legislation in this Parliament and the important matters which no longer get debated in this Parliament are far greater than they were in 1967. We cannot do the business in the chamber in the time we allocate ourselves and it is highly unlikely that we will allocate time in the chamber to be used for that purpose. I have advocated for many years that we need plenary and committee sessions of this Parliament so that we can deal with the routine business of the Parliament expeditiously without neglecting it, but leaving time in this chamber for the real business of the Parliament of Australia-that is, debating the major issues and the major legislation of this country. I have to thank one or two people. I know the hour is late and I know that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has·great difficulties. I sympathise with him, but I am afraid I cannot altogether bend to his will. I have very few staff members during the time. I have been a member, other than those when I was a Minister. I believe all have served very loyally. I do not want to try to name them as I am sure to miss one at this stage and I want to thank them all. If you are contesting a marginal seat or if you hold a provincial seat where you are an identifiable person and your office is the place people go to, your staff have to be able to carry the load. All of my staff have been able to carry the load and they have done it with great credit to themselves and with great benefit to me and, I hope, the electorate. My family has put up with a lot. My kids were only so high when I came here; they had just started school. They did not-and do not-see their father very much. When you are a member of the Federal Parliament for 20 years your wife has to carry a very great and my wife has done that. I do not want to thank them because I do not think that is the right thing to do. I want to express my appreciation that I have been given the opportunity to pursue a career which does not come to many and which needs the support of everyone around you, including, and most importantly, the support of your family. This profession is very hard on families and there is never an occasion when there are not some families breaking up around us. It happens on a regular basis. I have been lucky, I think Minister who spoke before me has been lucky, but others have not. I thank all of those people who have served with me during the period. While I have been here I have had some successes and some failures. Some of the things which I thought I did right were some of the most criticised. I would never acknowledge that I thought the decision on the Invincible was wrong. I am not sure whether we could have done more on that fateful day in 1975, but I made some remarks about that at the time of John Kerr's death and I do not think it would be appropriate to add to them at this stage. Mr Speaker, I thank you and everyone in this chamber. I particularly thank the people who sit at the table and who have assisted me for 25 years, both as Speaker and as a memhad ber of this chamber who has quite often made demands on them which were a little greater than those of some other members. I make me particular reference to Bernard Wright. He is not here at the moment, but he was my private secretary in my early days as Speaker. It was a very difficult job for a person who was going back into the Department and it was even more difficult when the person back in the Department who was deciding your promotion was someone like Doug Blake. I thank everyone in this chamber-the people who look after us. I do not want to name them, but they have always looked after us well and I hope I have always had good relations with them. It has been a pleasure. I have not quite finished yet, but we mayor may not come back to this place early next year. I regret leaving it, but everyone has to pass through so that others can renew and load, improve the Parliament and the manner in which we are governed. Finally, the Parliament has a task to meet. It has to do its business better, it has to change its procedures and it has to change the whole way in which it approaches its business if it is going to do it better; otherwise its reputation will become such that it will become irrelevant.",167
231,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Before I call the honourable member for Franklin, I would like to make a few remarks-particularly after the the speech by the honourable member for Corio. If you were looking for someone in the place to call a parliamentarian, it would be Gordon Scholes. I do not think anyone who is in this chamber at present has had as distinguished a parliamentary career as Gordon. H.e - as been Deputy Speaker, Speaker, a Jumor Minister and a Cabinet Minister. Even in his last year here he has been working actively a committee chairman to ensure that we wtll have some better Standing Orders and procedures in this place in order to make the Parliament work better. In the years that I have been here, I do not think anyone has had as varied a career as Gordon. I think, Gordon, you will be a loss to us. I must say that the times you want to take points of orde! on me are a bit worrying and I will not truss that. But, Gordon, I think you will be sincerely missed. I know the Leader of the House is starting to have a heart attack because the program is getting away from him, but I want to make a couple of other comments. Last week Ian Sinclair sent me a Christmas card that said that we live in interesting times. I rang him up and asked him to stop making it as interesting as he was. But I think this year has been an interesting one for the Parliament. We had George Bush's visit earlier in the year when· the senators came over and joined us. We had the Queen's visit, the change of Prim.e Minister the arrival and departure of Phil Cleary - d we had Bruce G-luck's announcement that he really was chicken man and his decision to retire. Certainly some interesting things have occurred in the building this year. I would like to join with others in thanking a number of people in the building. I thank my colleague the President who shares some of the burdens of running this place with me; my colleague and Deputy, Ron Edwards; and Margaret Fisher in his office. I particularly thank the Clerks and Lyn Barlin, who, as the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister said earlier, is a person whose advice is always sound and who is unflappable. I think the Prime Minister said that you often wonder what is going on behind those inscrutable eyes as he watches us here each day. There is no doubt that members on both sides· the Leader of the House and his staff, the Manager of Opposition Business and his staff the Whips, the Sergeant-at-Arms and the people who run the chamber have contributed a great deal to ensuring that we get where we are tonight. As I look at the clock, I see that I have to make sure that we do not stay here too long. The people who run the smaller things in the building need to be thanked: John May and the transport people; the switchboard operators who have been mentioned earlier; the attendants who make sure we get our mail and who sometimes make sure we find our way to our offices and sometimes move the furniture; the people in the commentary box who let the people out there in electorate land know precisely which of us is speaking at any one time; and all of those other people who do the small jobs around the building: They might seem small to us, but they are unportant to them. One of the best things about being the ministerial head of the House of Representatives is the high level of dedication of the staff in this Department. The Prime Minister remarked on that earlier and he is absolutely right. I thank my own staff, both in Sydney and Canberra, for the support they have given me this year. In particular, I thank Ann Stewart, my senior adviser, who proves that those of us who employ women are smarter than those of us who do not. Many of us have spoken about the support we get from our families. Gordon in particular mentioned how his children were young when he first became a member and now they are grown up. My youngest son was one year old when I was elected and he is now just over 14. I saw my other children grow up, but I have not seen all that much of Martin growing up. That is something that happens to all of us. Too often people are willing to pillory members of parliament and say that we are people who do not do much of a job, that we just gad about. That is a sacrifice that people do not notice and our fami-ies, p:uticularly our children, pay a very high pnce for our being in this job. You only start to realise that high price when you have been here for a while and go home on Friday afternoons-as I am sure John Howard and Gordon would tell you-and look at your kids and think you have missed a damned lot and ask whether it was worth it all. When people think those things sometimes it does make them pause. I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. I hope that those of us who return-whether there is an election or notwill all be able to get on with each other a bit better than maybe we did sometimes this year. Yesterday I was unkind to the honourable member for Pearce and I want . to tell him I am sorry. I might not be sorry to see you go, Fred, but I am sorry I said it. No, Fred; always found you to be a very decent person and I should not have said what I said yesterday. I wish you all well. I wish all the staff of the parliamentary departments well. I hope that we all have a safe Christmas and that if we come back before the election we will all be able to get on with each other. If we do not come back until after the election, I suppose the kindest thing would be to say that I hope all of you who are recontesting will still be here. I think I should allow the chicken man to make one last confession and then I will call",168
232,Mr GOODLUCK,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Give John a go.,170
233,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to say one thing very briefly, in a general sense, to all those members on both sides who are retiring. In different ways I will miss them. I will miss the creative banter with the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand), particularly in Question Time. To all of the colleagues on my side of the House who are retiring, I wish them very good fortune and good health. To the retiring member for Corio (Mr Scholes) especially I say that I am one of what is now a dwindling number of people who were here on 11 November 1975. I have had occasion to say in the past-and I take this opportunity to repeat it, as it may be his last day in the House-that of the many things I remember in this Parliament and its predecessor building, I think his behaviour on that day displayed impeccable standards of restraint and strength. It was not an easy situation for him. Whatever differences we may have had about the events that led up to the events that were consummated that day and the events that followed, I think that he displayed very great firmness and great courage. I do not think an occasion should pass when that goes unremarked when those on this side of the House feel that way. The honourable member deserves the credit of the House for what he did then. It would be uncharitable of me if I did not take this opportunity of saying so. I wish everybody a very happy Christmas. I thank my friend and colleague from Franklin for yielding to the I have junior member from New South Wales.",170
234,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Stirling)Because other members wish to speak I will very succinctly thank some people. Mr Speaker, I thank you for your leadership. I have had a brief opportunity to open the batting and I do not think it is appreciated just what it is like when you are in there opening the batting every day. A lot of people down here should understand what it is like up there. You have about as much time as they have in cricket to make the decisions. It is a hard game and you are called upon to make the decisions. I appreciate your leadership. It is a difficult job and you certainly have great strength and determination. I heard very clearly what you said earlier about the human aspect of this experience. I wish to thank my team-Don Dobie, Steve Dubois, Colin Hollis, Harry Jenkins, Michael MACKellar, Garry Nehl, Gordon Scholes, Les Scott, Warren Truss and Kathy Sullivan. I particularly thank Steve Dubois and Gordon Scholes, who are retiring, for their support. I also thank Margaret Fisher and my staff in Perth. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), with you, Mr Speaker, has done a great job in reforming the processes of the House. I do not think it is understood that private members' business is quite a special experience in this Parliament and you deserve great credit for that. I also thank the Whips, the attendants, Clare Nairn, Hansard, and John May in the transport office who always succeeds in getting us back home, which is what we want to be able to do. I pay tribute to the retiring colleagues of this Parliament who have graced this chamber. To all of my colleagues may I wish them well and a pleasant and peaceful Christmas and New Year. As I want to keep this speech brief, I say in closing that the important thing about this Parliament is that basically it is populated by decent people. We have seen the flow-through of decent people and we have heard some very decent people speak tonight. There will be further ones. But out there in the larger electorate people need to understand that there are people who are very decent and wellmotivated in this place. On this side we need to note that we in the AustClilian Labor Party have stuck together and are now in a situation that is vastly removed from that of 12 months ago. We have a sense of purpose and a Leader with great purpose and a sense in which we are committing ourselves to the larger cause that the electorate grants us. I thank you all very much. I also thank you for listening to me on this occasion.",170
235,Mr GOODLUCK,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I have 90 seconds, have I? I am always cut short.",171
236,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I thought you were going to make two appearances.,171
237,Mr GOODLUCK,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I can make that chook noise for you, if you like. I would like to wish you all a merry Christmas. My words will be very brief. Tonight, and just about every day, I cannot think of one person on either side of the House of Representatives that I dislike. You are all a decent lot. I thank Hansard, the people in the ABC, the cooks, the attendants-everybody-for being very kind to me over the last 17 years. I have not had a bad word from anybody. People have always been very gracious and kind. I think they have treated everybody in the same way. It has been an honour serving here for 17 years. I do not please everybody: I do not want to. But it has been a real pleasure. Like Gerry, we have to remember the poor. I came from a very poor background. I say to the Liberals that they do not want to listen to all that talk that we represent just a certain section, that we come from this and that we come from that. Many of us have come from very poor backgrounds, and the sooner we tell people the better. Then they will understand that we care just as much as those opposite say they do. I do not mean that nastily: I mean that with dignity. Mr Speaker, you finally said that I was the chicken man. I would like to say that there are two members here tonight who are Ministers and they know that one of your junior Ministers was the chicken. I have taken that for so long. Don't they believe it? Mr Smith interjecting",171
238,Mr GOODLUCK,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Warwick, for those. kind remarks. That was very nice. I would like to wish you all a very merry Christmas and all the best for the future. Mr Hand-Which one laid the egg?",171
239,Mr GOODLUCK,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I do not know. I am not an expert on that. I wish everybody all the best for the future.,171
240,Mr DUFFY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to say a few brief words about people who are leaving, particularly my colleagues on this side of the House but also those on the other side of the House. One has to remember that the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron) shares a couple of interests with some of us on this side. He has bred and raised some very good horses. He is a very close friend of Neville Stribling, who is one of the great clarinettists of this country: he is a great jazz clarinettist. Ewen Cameron is a great bloke. We ought to remember that he came here by defeating a National Party candidate or member. So that was a feather in his cap. There are two people about whom I wish to speak briefly. The first is Gordon Scholes. You have been spared having to listen to me because it was covered very much by what was said by Mr Speaker and also by Gordon himself. It summed him up. Gordon has been a great parliamentarian. He is a person who has enormous respect for this place. He has done everything he could to reform the House in the way it operates. He has put a lot of time into that. Those people who were here at the time. I was not here-have universally said that he was a great Speaker. We in the Labor Party owe a great debt to Gordon because he has also been a great member of the Party. We all remember 1966, which he mentioned. I remember in 1966 going home at lunch after being on a polling booth. Caroline said to me, 'How is it going?'. I said, 'Well, don't go out or they will set the dogs on you' . I remember that very well, Gordon. To you, I say thank you for a wonderful performance on behalf of the Party and a wonderful performance here as a parliamentarian. I think it says something about us-or about me-that we all have a lot of acquaintances here and we have a lot of friends, in a sense, but not a lot of close friends, I suppose. It is a sad moment for me tonight to realise that Gerry Hand will not be here next time. My association with Gerry goes back a long way. It· goes back to the period when Gerry and his friends that he referred to over there-and Clyde Holding will well remember all of this-actually ran the show in Victoria at one stage. They ran it in a pretty tough way; they learnt politics in a pretty hard school. The only thing they could not do was ever win an election. Dr Charlesworth-Outside the Party.",171
241,Mr DUFFY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Outside the Party. They in fact used to have an enormous celebration if they won a by-election during an unpopular period of the Government, which was. then the Bolte Government, after he had hanged somebody or something like that. That was considered to be a spectacular success. Of course, there were great differences of opinion in those days. Gerry was on one side, and he had the numbers. Clyde was on another side; they thought they had the numbers. I was in another group which did not have any numbers. But there was a combination that grew up there, and I must say that the personal relationship with people like Gerry Hand became very strong through that period. We still disagreed on a lot of matters of policy, we still fought a lot, argued a lot and had a lot of differences. But I can honestly say that since 1965 in the Labor Party-and that was a long while ago-there is no person that I have known in the Party that I have respected more as a friend than Gerry. He can be tough-very tough-but once you know where you are with him, that is it. If he makes an arrangement with you, he sticks with it, and he sticks right through. The friendship that I have enjoyed with Gerry Hand has been an enormous pleasure. I regret very much that he will not be here. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you should pass on to the Speaker that John Howard made a confession tonight that some of the problems we get at Question Time are his fault. We attempt to behave reasonably and he does not let us. He will not be able to use Gerry as an excuse in the future. He picks on Gerry. In closing, I can always think of one story. It is very difficult to embarrass Hand, but I remember one day at the Moonee Valley racecourse when he was there with another member of the Party. They were standing at a tote queue and it was raining. Mr Hand-It was the scones queue.",172
242,Mr DUFFY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am sorry; he was getting some scones. I was out in the open and I had on a raincoat and a hat and looked a bit like a policeman, I suppose. I walked up behind the two of them and called out in a very loud voice, 'Do the course detectives know that you two are on the course this afternoon?'. Everyone turned and stared at them-which they continued to do all afternoon. He spent a very embarrassed afternoon at the races that day. But to you, Gerry, I say thank you very much for your friendship and support. You have very black Irish moods. You go. up and down like a yoyo. One never knows what sort of mood you are going to be in, but I manage to put up with that, because I have an equal sort of temperament and I am able to handle you. It is going to be very lonely without you, Gerry, and again I must say-as with Gordon Scholes-you have performed very well here. You have been a good Minister, a very good Minister; you have worked very hard. I think that you have been very lucky-and you know that-with the support you have had from Maree. She does not put up with any of your nonsense, and that is also a good thing. When you get home tomorrow I do not think you will be told, 'Well, I've packed up and let's just move'. You are going to have plenty to do when you get home tomorrow. But thank you for your contribution to the Labor Party, Gerry, to this place and, more particularly-just on that personal note-for what has been a period of great friendship and a great relationship with you over so many years.",172
243,Mr CHANEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"1 had not intended to take part in this debate tonight, but 1 was drawn in by the very gracious comments of the Speaker and to some extent by the comments of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). 1 would like to put on the record my sense of privilege at having served in the Parliament in this place and in the other chamber. I listened to what the honourable member for Corio said, and I thought he very accurately summed up the burden which is borne by one's family. The balance to thatand families do give up a great deal-is that they to some extent share in the privilege of what we are enabled to do. In the case of my own family, 1 think that they felt as I did, the whole 20 years would have been worth it for the couple of years that we had when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and where they shared with me an extraordinary close contact with the Aboriginal community and 1 think grew and became far better people for it. To the extent that I as a member feel guilty about the treatment that my presence in this place has meted out to my family, 1 take some consolation from the fact that they shared what I think were some very special times and some very special insights. I also want to thank a number of people from my electorate of Pearce, which 1I have served only once and which has been a joy, and 1 particularly want to acknowledge the Liberal Party of Western Australia. When 1 was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I gained the support of 10 people at a State conference which had 400 voting delegates. This was a fairly sobering experience, especially as my endorsement was shortly to come before the same group. 1 always thought it was a sign of their tolerance, or something, that they returned me as the No. 1 on the Senate ticket and guaranteed my return to the Parliament. But I acknowledge that, within that Party, 1I have had lots of vigorous debate. I acknowledge what has, I think, at times been the breadth of understanding that has been shown by some people who have been at times bitter opponents of mine but have been prepared to see me continue to represent them in this place. I would also acknowledge what I think is one's second family in politics, and that is one's staff. In my case, from the time 1 went into parliament, 1 was served by people who gave an extraordinary amount in terms of their own - ommitment. My wife, Angela, has always said that they have become a second family to me. That is certainly true, and 1 suspect it is true of most of us in this place. The people who are in Parliament House at the moment enjoying coffee l hope with my wife-Keith Kessell and Kirstin Mardardyare simply the latest of a group of people for whom I have enormous affection, respect and a great deal of gratitude. 1 do feel that much of what I would have that wished to say was said by the honourable member for Corio. 1 acknowledge the sacrifice of my wife and children. 1 enjoyed it when 1 said to my 22-year-old baby, Patrick, 'I am giving up politics; let's go to the beach and I'll teach you how to make sand castles'. He seemed remarkably unthankful for this offer on my part and seemed to think he had learned to do that in my absence. I am sorry the Speaker is not in the chair, because he was gracious enough to say that he regretted what he had said about me yesterday. I was trying to work out whether 1 regretted what I had said about him yesterday which led him to respond. 1 thought 1 would like to say in his presence why 1I have had some heated moments with him. It probably is all the fault of someone lending me a book called The Lion Under the Throne. As I recall, this was a history of Coke's contribution. We have a historian at the table, and he can probably correct me. In one of the early British parliaments 1 think the Speaker was Coke, and this is an account of his battles as Speaker. This led me to believe that the Speaker was the person who stood between the Parliament and the Executive. 1 had this vision of the early English Speakers sometimes being executed because they had dared to withstand the blandishments of the kingMr Beazley interjecting",173
244,Mr CHANEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am sure the Leader of the House could improve on my history. 1 would have to say to the Speaker, and I am sorry he is not in the chamber, that 1 guess what has really disappointed me is that he has not been executed for standing up on behalf of the Opposition against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This explains, 1 think, my lack of patience with him, and at times my irritation. I did expect that from him. In the teeth of an election, which of course 1 hope and expect my Party to win, 1 will be judging the now Opposition, I hope the then government, against those same standards. The speech which was made by a new member which most struck me was that of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costel10), who is not in the chamber at the moment. He made an outstanding maiden speech when he said-I quote from memory, so it may not be exact-""In the great struggle between Parliament and the Executive, I stand for the Parliament'. I am going to watch with an eagle eye the honourable member for Higgins as a Minister. 1 expect him to be a rigorous critic of the Speaker if he dare not protect interests of the House and of the Opposition. I hope that the next Government, of whatever colour it might be-of course 1 expect it to be a Liberal-National Party government-will acknowledge the role of the Parliament against the Executive. I have always hoped that this House, with its peculiar geography, would enhance the Parliament. I like the fact that the Executive is put in a separate wing; I think that is the right symbolism. 1 think this chamber is not the creature of the Executive. It should not be allowed to be and yet, of course, the Executive always has the numbers. Three years in this place has almost made me a republican. It has almost made me believe that the Westminster system is not the right system, but 1 suspect that is wrong. I think that the Westminster system is right for Australia but it requires a parliament which is self-conscious, very strong, and which actually regards the Executive with suspicion. 1 look forward to watching the Parliament in future as being a parliament in that light.  of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), may I quickly-I suspect on behalf of a number of members on this side of the House-say a fond farewell to a number of members, not the least of which are four of our colleagues from the class of 1983. To John and Mary Gayler, we wish them the very best. To Lloyd and Mary O'Neil, we will miss them so much. Lloyd is a quiet and compassionate man who has never forgotten where he came from. 1 might say to him on the record, once and for all, that I shall never forget his high jinks against me on Masada. Ric Charlesworth sat next to me here for three years. He is an Olympic champion, a doctor of medicine and a parliamentarian. He is leaving this business all too soon. He is a champion in every aspect of his life. He loves his kids-he will see a lot more of them. We are sad to see Ric go, but he is off to his other life of hockey, and we wish him well. To Gerry and Maree Hand: I do not think there is anything more 1 can add other than this testimony to Gerry Hand. Last Monday week in my electorate he spent the whole day the working his backside off as the Minister for Immigration. He did not once show the signs of someone who was retiring. With his black Irish wit we hope we will see him a lot. 1 did say something nice about someone from the Left, but it took his going to do it. To others outside the class of 1983-to you, Mr Deputy Speaker and Steve Dubois, the honourable member for St George, it is with great sadness that you leave this place. It is not something that we-and particularly I-wish to see, with your dedication and down-to-earth representation of people that you care about and lived amongst. I wish you and Annette the very best. The honourable member for Bass, Warwick Smith, spoke of the contribution of the honourable member for Tangney, Peter Shack, on the other side of the House. I note Peter's enormous talent, commitment and great company as a colleague in this House and as a committee member. We will miss him very much. Finally, I mention Stewart West-a very principled fellow. We would have liked to have seen him here again, but he was forced into a stand-off with another very valued colleague. I hope that Stewart West, Peter Shack, Gerry Hand, Ric Charlesworth, Lloyd O'Neil, John Gayler and Steve Dubois will find a way of serving in another capacity. The nation is indebted to them for their dedication.  difficult to believe that as of 2 December this year I had been here 20 years in a career for which I never had any ambition or inclination. It is pleasing to be able to say that I leave without any regrets or any enemies, and with an enonnous pride in the people of the Mallee whom I represent. The Mallee today takes in about one-fifth of Victoria and includes the district of Mallee, the district of Wimmera, and a major part of the western district. The name 'Mallee' conjures up many images. Many people here think of the periodical dust storms that sweep in, not just across southern Victoria but also across New Zealand. We can think of the unique blend of flora and fauna contained there. I particularly think of the innovations of the fanning community that have made such major contributions to our agricultural production, to farming techniques and to machinery invention and development. In this place we speak constantly of sustainable development. At times I wonder whether we really know what we are speaking of. My region was regarded as marginal country, but this year we will probably have a threefold productivity increase over what we had some 20 years ago, on soils that were considered fragile but which today are in better heart than they were one or two decades ago. I refer particularly tonight to the worse period of economic and social decline that we have ever encOlmtered in our region. Tragically, this has taken place over the last few years. Despite this, the people in my constituency grasped the positives. They seized on the strengths of their communities to release a new spirit of vigour and innovation. Since that time, particularly since the 1982 drought, we have seen the formation of community structures that have avoided many of the tragic circumstances that took place across Australia, and particularly across rural Australia. As an example we saw the first community appointment of a rural counsellor, from which extended the rural counselling scheme which is now so valuable across so much of country and rural Australia. I would like particularly to thank the people of Mallee, who have elected me nine times, returning both myself and my Party and at the last election making Mallee the safest seat in the Federal Parliament. I thank particularly it the people in my small home community of Yaapeet. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, John Scott, spoke of a boy from Glasgow being elected to the Parliament of Australia. It is also fairly unique for a g9Y who comes from a village of 50 people to· gain preselection and be elected to the Federal Parliament. I thank my home community for that. I praise the tolerance and the respect they have shown to my family and _me, irrespective of any differences we may have in political affiliation or policy. In general, I also thank all the Clerks, and all the people who administer and service this Parliament. Over the years they have been wonderful to me. I include everyone from the highest people in the administration of the Parliament to the people who administer the other facilities in the place. It has indeed been a privilege to be part of this vital democratic institution. I have been fortunate ,to have experienced the old Parliament House and to have taken part in proceedings in this magnificent place. I recognise that there are probably some difficulties in administration, but I believe that this place is one of the great buildings of the world and. something of which we can all be very proud. The honourable member for Hindmarsh also mentioned the committees. The committee work I participated in has been invaluable. All of us can lay claim to various achievements, but I believe that the work of one committee I served on - and it has been called by various names; today it is the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts,. has led to some of the most significant achievements regarding the protection and promotion of Australia's natural resources. I mention here the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). Out of the Fraser years, which many people in this House may have forgotten, caine the formation of Kakadu National Park and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Since that time all sorts of outstanding things have happened in the environment and conservation area that have given a great profile to Australia as a nation. I would also like to mention the opportunities we are given in this place to travel, to expand our knowledge and our horizons. I believe this in itself opens up opportunities for us to serve our people. I think particularly of the opportunity I had prior to the Los Angeles Olympic Games when, as shadow Minister for sport and recreation-and I thank John Brown for this-I was involved in the development of the Australian Olympic Team and in the organising and managing of the arrangements for our team in Los Angeles. I think of the time we held CHOGM in this country. As part of the emissary team I was sent to the Caribbean to speak to the Prime Ministers of the various countries involved. Like the member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), I had the opportunity to represent this Parliament, and the Opposition, at the United Nations General Assembly. Very briefly, I acknowledge the loyalty, the camaraderie and the strength of my National Party colleagues. Many people have been mentioned by name here tonight. I will not mention any of my colleagues by name because over the years all of them have been very close friends. They are people I have admired enormously, and people with whom I have never had an argument. I acknowledge the work of my staff, of whom there have been very few over the years. All of them have been wonderful; loyal and competent. I must mention briefly two of my staff: Marie Schlemme, who has been with me for 17112 years in my Swan Hill office, and Pat Birrell, who has been here with me in Canberra for the past 14 years. I conclude my remarks by acknowledging the work of my wife, Judy, a delightful lady who has managed me, our property and, in the last few years, our horses. She has managed two incredible children, Anthony and Nicole. I conclude by wishing everyone a happy and holy Christmas. May 1993 bring to the Australian people a renewed confidence and opportunity that we probably lack at the moment.",174
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Dubois)Before we get back to the business of the House, as a retiring member I would like to take this opportunity to say farewell to you, my colleagues and friends. I came here in December 1984. Had anyone asked me three or four months before that whether I wanted to become a member of parliament, I would have said no, because for many years I had seen what branch members used to do to my predecessor, Bill Morrison. I am sure we all have them: there are at least three or four people in every branch who think they can do a better job than the member, and at least one or two who think they can do a better job than the Prime Minister. It was never my intention to come here but, as fate would have it, I did. We were very lucky in that our youngest son was 17 years of age at the time, so my wife did not have to become the mother and father, garbage putter-outer and chief cook and bottle washer, as have a lot of the wives and husbands of honourable members. I want to thank honourable members for their companionship and friendship over the years. I want to thank the staff. It is a bit dangerous to start naming people, but I particularly want to mention Lyn Barlin and Ian Harris for their forbearance and for coaching me in this job. It is reassuring that they know the Standing Orders. Some of us think we know them, but they certainly know them. I often remember a story that Michael MACKellar told me some years ago about Malcolm Fraser when he was the Prime Minister. He used to watch that famous BBC series Yes, Minister with the then Secretary to his Department, Sir Geoffrey Yeend. The two would laugh at different times. Some of us think we know what we are doing, and others really do know what they are doing. It has been a great honour and a privilege for me, and for all of us really, to have been elected to the national Parliament. I know it is something that we value. I can honestly say that I have not known any of us who have discharged our duties without honour. It is unfortunate that those people in the wider community who do not know what we do are very quick to denigrate us. I can only say that, as a retiring member, I will certainly sing the praises of honourable members and try to educate people about what a tough life it really is for us. It is unfortunate that are so ignorant on this matter. Finally, I wish all honourable members a happy Christmas. I hope that those who are seeking re-election do get re-elected. I look forward to coming back as a former member and renewing acquaintances then.",176
246,Mr COWAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I briefly thank my Leader, Mr Fisclwr, for his kind words about me earlier this evening. I also thank the other speakers who have paid a tribute to those members who are retiring. I have been in the three tiers of government for about 35 years: 15 years in State government; 8 years in local government; and about 12 years' in Federal government. It has been a great privilege for me to serve not only in the Federal Parliament but also in the State Parliament. I have a great respect for the institution, as I am sure we all have. There are times when we realise the safeguards that we have under the Westminster system. When I first came into State parliament, I was advised by a former Labor Premier, Mr Heffron, who would be recalled by honourable members. On the afternoon that I was sworn in, he spoke to me near a little post office behind the Speaker's rooms. He was no longer Premier, but he was still a member. He said, 'Bruce, I will advise you of two things: firstly, if you sling mud, some will stick; and, secondly, all the brains are not on the one side of the House'. I have always remembered. and certainly abided by those two principles. I do not know whether I should say this, but in my whole political career I do not think that I have ever been called to order or warned by the Speaker. I do not know whether I should be proud of that, because lots of members say, 'Well, you are not a member unless you are thrown out at some time or other'. I have respected the Speakers and I have respected the systems. I have had good friends on both sides of the Parliament over a long period. One of the interesting factors about my life spent in serving a parliament is that I have been able to know the individuals and to study the personalities of people. I can recall, particularly in my own Party, fellows who people came off a farm and came into parliament who had hardly made a speech before. I use the example of the Lions Club-and I often quote this-where after a period we see the common sense that people have and see their abilities to extend themselves and make the speeches that we eventually expect from them. The greatest attribute we can have is not so much an education-I had very little myself as I came from a very poor family, too-but common sense. The important thing is the ability to make a decision. I have noted this in quite a lot of the people whom I have served with over the years. I want to stress my great respect for the institution of parliament. I know that the people who serve in the Parliament are criticised at times. I often say to people 'Look, members on both sides of the House work hard. If they do not work hard to represent their constituencies and particularly the individual, they do not survive in the roughness and toughness of the game'. I pay respect to my family because they have supported me so well over the years. I have been a lucky person and an unfortunate person, in a way, but I have still enjoyed my life. I say thank you to the people in my electorate. None of my branches asked me to retire and no person came to me and said, 'It is time you stood down, Bruce'. I appreciate that after such a long time. I thank the organisation and I thank the people. I thank my electorate council chairman, Mr Allan Cowan, who is a cousin of mine and who was the State Treasurer of the party for quite a period of time. I thank him and the rest of the organisation. I particularly thank my secretary, Mrs Wendy MCKeough, who has been with me over a period of 15 years both in the State and in the Commonwealth. Mr Fischer knows her and she has great respect for him. She has certainly served the electorate very wen, as wel- as me. To all those people and particularly the servants of the House-the Clerks, the transport officers, the stewards, everybody around this place-I say thank you. I am pleased to be retiring. I think I have been a very lucky person. If you look back over your lifetime and you can say that you still have your health and if you can say, 'Well, I believe that I have served the community and the Parliament to the best of my ability', then you are a very lucky person. As myoid friend the late Mr Bill Chaffey, the honourable member for Tamworth said, 'After you retire, if you can walk up the main street of your town and look everybody in the eye, you are a very lucky person'. I wish everybody the very best for the festive season. Question resolved in the affirmative. Friday, 18 December 1992 NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That leave of absence be given to every member of the House of Representatives from· the determination of this sitting of the House to the date its next sitting. MIGRATION (OFFENCES AND UNDESIRABLE PERSONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading' Debate resumed.",177
247,Mrs CROSIO,LEAVE OF ABSENCE,"I would never have realised 3112 hours ago when I moved that the debate be adjourned that I would have heard such fine and glowing speeches. In coming back to the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill, I believe that what we should take note of-and I sure some statistician will for the benefit of Hansard-is that possibly we are saying farewell tonight, or when the Parliament resumes next year, to people who will be finishing this particular term and who will have in excess of 200 years of dedicated service. That is what makes up the people who have signalled they will be retiring. I have been doing only a rough calculation whilst I have been sitting here over the last few hours. This Bill continues along the same lines as initiatives that were announced by our Government in the 1992-93 Federal Budget. They have been aimed at producing a net benefit for Australia through employment related measures designed to complement and streamline the migration program with an increased emphasis on skills and English proficiency, while retaining priority for family reunion and humanitarian entry. The key elements of the Government's migration strategy give greater effect to the critical role of English in the settlement through increased emphasis on English in migration selection and additional resources for English as a second language training in Australia. We have seen better targeting of settlement services for migrants, including a focus on established migrant communities that have made such a tremendous contribution to Australia's development. We have ensured that arrangements for onshore asylum seekers have been both fair and compassionate. It is always necessary to consider the effect of of immigration on our country when drafting immigration legislation. The Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill does just that. It scrutinises the effects of persons of ill-repute being allowed to enter our borders and pose a threat to our society. Another issue that must be considered when drafting immigration legislation is the effect of immigration intakes on our Federal Budget. In .a recent report commissioned by the Bureau of Immigration Research it was found that immigrants make a negative contribution to the Commonwealth Government Budget in the short to medium term but a very positive contribution over the longer term. Better targeting of settlement resources has certainly helped Australia retain the long term benefits from immigration. We have seen major initiatives in this term of the Parliament in the English language area. We have seen those courses being designed to overcome the legacy of policies over the last - O to 40 years and to prevent a recurrence of those mistakes. In the context economic restructuring, many older migrants who came here 20 or 30 years ago to help build Australia's industries are now feeling the effect of a lack of English language and employment skills. We have seen initiatives over this term of parliament such as entitlements for newly arrived migrants with less than functional English to obtain up to 510 hours of English language tuition. We have seen an additional $309m being placed in the Budget over four years to help an estimated 48,000 job seekers overcome the English language barrier that stops them from getting work. We have also seen the introduction of limited user charging for new migrants other than prt!ferential family and refugees for their English language tuition, with the revenue to be used to increase English language tuition places in AMEP. All of these have been put into place to ensure that the mistakes of those 40 years ago will not happen again. This Government remains committed to a global non-discriminatory migration program where anyone who can satisfy our selection criteria is a welcome migrant. The Bill before the House is clear evidence of the continuation of this commitment and further refines the basis of Australia's selection criteria for entrance into this country. One of the recent main points of contention has been the changes to the adult migrant English program under which the maximum of 510 hours of English language tuition was to be made available to migrants. When we convert that 510 hours into months according to a school week, that works out to be approximately five months of training for five days a week. It is necessary to keep reiterating that great social reforms resulting from these changes to the adult migrant education program is to entitle those who arrive in Australia as migrants or refugees or who are currently in the country to 510 hours of tuition in English at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. It is a very generous response by the Australian community. It seems to me that an increasing number of our migrants to this country expect the Australian of Government to support them in more ways than just unemployment benefits. Name me one other country which pays for its migrants to learn its language and funds a vast array of migrant services aimed at helping new arrivals to settle in. Issues of immigration law are involved, complex and always emotional. I am confident, however, that our Government, in its attempt to streamline the migration program, has retained a sensitive and caring attitude towards the many immigration issues that must be addressed in legislation. It is all about being fair and equitable. I think it is important to emphasise the fact that as long as people try to immigrate to Australia illegally, or through the back door, the laws must be made tighter and stricter to close as many loopholes as possible, and people who are trying to do the right thing and migrate legally are disadvantaged by longer queues and tougher legislation. For example, the recent High Court decision to deport 16 Cambodian boat people who had been in Australia for three years trying to get refugee status may seem tough, but by the same token these people have not done the right thing by Australia in trying to migrate to this country illegally. The 16 Cambodians now housed in Western Australia's Port Hedland detention centre were among 26 people on a boat which landed at Broome in November 1989. None of these 16 people had cases which met the United Nations criteria adopted by Australia for refugees. Of the 26 people who arrived on the original boat, two received refugee status, four returned home voluntarily after withdrawing their applications, and decisions were pending on the remaining 10. the Each individual case has been investigated by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and these investigations have been necessarily lengthy and meticulous to ensure fair and lawful decision making. The High Court's decision to uphold the right of the Commonwealth Government to detain people who arrive illegally in Australia, including asylum seekers, is to be commended. Why do we make laws in this place if they are to be continually challenged in the courts? I believe that the courts are an important checks and balances system on our laws to an extent, but why then do we have two chambers in this Parliament also checking and balancing every law made in Parliament? Immigration law is necessarily strict in order to protect our country. It was confirmed earlier this week that a further 89 Cambodian boat people had completed the process of refugee determination and had been formally rejected as refugees, while two others were granted refugee status. These applicants were all part of a group of 119 boat people who landed at Broome in March of 1990. It is important to note that, for those whose claims for refugee status were rejected, it was the second time that they have had their claims examined and the second time that they have been rejected. Unfortunately, our media are very selective in what they report about this issue. Often the fact that Australia has a strong commitment to refugees and a long and proud record of humanitarian assistance is forgotten when those stories are written. After all, the refugee system of determination in Australia is based on that of the United Nations. If people meet the UN criteria for refugee status and are found to be true refugees, they are permitted to stay in Australia. If not, they will have to go. Our Cambodian boat people who have been refused refugee status in Australia have been offered resettlement assistance in line with the practices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Such reintegration assistance is in line with international practice in similar circumstances and is, I believe, both a humanitarian and practical gesture on behalf of the Australian Government. Australia's migration policy strives to a proper balance between social and economic targets in the most fair, equitable and sensitive way. The amendments contained in this legislation before the House tonight will continue to contribute to a fair and just system of immigration. In the limited time before me, I too would like to join others in wishing everyone in this House a very merry Christmas and a very healthy and prosperous New Year.",178
248,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEAVE OF ABSENCE,"Because of the late hour, I will not take up much of the time of the House in relation to the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill. I want to say just a couple of things about it. Before I do so, because this is probably the final meeting of the Parliament before the election, I want also to pay tribute to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for the work which he has done in the last nearly three years. I have been Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations for a few years and have worked with a number of Ministers. Although there has been some publicity from time to time about supposed differences between me and the Minister, the fact is that the Minister has worked very well with the Committee for all of this period, and it would not have been possible to get so much legislation and so many changes through the Caucus and the Parliament without his cooperation with the Committee. Those who try to say that the Minister has not been working with the Committee or with me are mistaken. Naturally, when there are so many issues and concerns, of course there are bound to be some differences, but the reality is that on the overwhelming proportion of things there has been very significant cooperation between us and, in particular, with the whole Committee. . The Minister was appointed shortly after the whole regulations approach had been introduced into the immigration portfolio. During that period we had quite a bit of angst about how the whole thing was going to work out. The Minister set out to put some order strike into the situation and ensure that the regulations approach remained but that it was refined in such a way that it had practical and objective application in the immigration program. I think we have achieved that. We have achieved a number of other things under this Minister. We have achieved a complete revolution on the whole question of illegal immigration-the first really serious tightening-up of illegal immigration-and in getting rid of rorts in the system with respect to things such as marriage rorts, while at the same time ensuring that in the case of a genuine marriage the partner is allowed to join his or her spouse in Australia. I think we have achieved a very sensible balance on this point. One provision which showed the sensitivity of the Minister was the acceptance of a provision suggested by the Migration Regulations Committee to help deal with the unfortunate case of a marriage in which a spouse, usually a woman, is brought into Australia and then subjected to· domestic violence. That person is caught in a situation in which she has left the other country to come to an unfortunate position in Australia not of her making. The Minister has introduced a regulation to deal specifically with that sort of case. Even though we wanted to tighten up against rorts, at the same time we wanted to assist people in genuine need. In the last three years the Minister has overseen a significant transformation of the immigration system. The other thing that he will be remembered for is the consultation which occurred on multicultural issues. There is no doubt that this Party remains firmly committed to multiculturalism. The Minister has preached that message throughout Australia in his consultations. He has been an ambassador for Australia around the world, taking the message of multiculturalism to other countries. Many other countries have a significant interest in Australian multiculturalism. We underrate its importance as a social and cultural policy and as one for which we are increasingly well known throughout the world. Many countries are interested in how the policy works because of the way in which it has created so much tolerance, understanding and harmony in our society. Many countries are envious and are interested in adopting a model similar to the Australian multicultural model. . The current legislation is another example of our need to have a balance between protecting the Australian nation and giving people rights to enter Australia. This is often the kind of difficult balance that is required in immigration policy. The Minister has put forward a Bill which will give the Minister the power to exclude certain people who have committed offences or whom for several reasons it is undesirable to have in Australia. The kind of person we are thinking about is someone who specialises in preaching messages of hatred and racial tension, someone who wants to promulgate extreme views about violence, or someone who has a criminal record. Under these rules the Minister will be able to exclude such people. He will make that determination, as the law says, acting personally to ·refuse or cancel visas or entry permits when, on the basis of information available to the Minister, he or she is satisfied that a person, if permitted to enter or remain in Australia, would be likely to engage in criminal conduct, would represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of it, would engage in vilification of a segment of that community or would foment discord in the community. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, this power is not intended to be exercised against people for political motives. It is intended to be exercised in the sorts of cases that I mentioned-for example, extremists, violent people and people preaching hatred or violence. It is not intended to be used against people who have a political philosophy different from that of the Government or the Opposition or who may have different views on industrial relations or industrial democracy. All of those assurances have been given by the Minister to the Committee in relation to the sorts of people who would or would not be excluded. Therefore, I have no problem in supporting the Bill. I think it is a very good balance. It protects the system and, at the same time, gives the Minister the power to act to exclude certain undesirable persons. I support the Bill and wish the Minister well in his retirement. I hope that he will continue to take an interest in immigration and ethnic affairs matters, even after his retirement, and that from time to time we will see him in the Parliament or in the environs of the Parliament. I am sure we will see him participating in migrant and ethnic community events.",180
249,Mr HAND,LEAVE OF ABSENCE,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (12.21 a.m.)-in reply-I thank members of the Opposition for their commitment to support the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill. I thank the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and my two colleagues the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) for their kind remarks and also as the chairperson and deputy chairperson of my committee. They have been outstanding in their contribution at that level and in this place. I thank them for all the work and counsel they have given me during my period as Minister. I also give a very sincere vote of thanks to my Department, from which I have enjoyed a very high degree of loyalty and dedication-both the Australian based people and the many people who work in the Department overseas. This sort of legislation is important to those people. They will be the ones who implement these decisions of the Parliament. Often as not, as politicians we forget that when we make decisions in here they have to be implemented by somebody. I have a damn good Department, headed by a very good Secretary. This sort of legislation is designed to protect the nation, as honourable members, including those opposite, who have spoken in this debate have said, and the departmental officers are the ones who will be given the responsibility for implementing that policy.

250,Mr BALDWIN,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill currently before the House proposes measures concerning conventions of the International Labour Organisation, the ILO. Insertion of a regulation making power for certain limited purposes Firstly, the Bill proposes the creation of a regulation making power to enable procedures to be prescribed for the purposes of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144). This convention was adopted by the International Labour Organisation on 21 June 1976 and ratified by Australia on 11 June 1979. Convention No. 144 requires the Government to consult, at least annually, with the most representative organisations of employers and workers about a variety of matters specified in the convention, including: action proposed in connection with new conventions and recommendations; the re-examination at appropriate intervals of unratified conventions and/or recommendations to which effect has not yet been given, to consider what measures might be taken to promote their implementation and ratification as appropriate; questions arising out of reports to be made to the International Labour Office under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation concerning ratified conventions; and proposals for the denunciation of ratified conventions. A matter of particular signific-nce involves questions arising out of reports made to the International Labour Office under article 22 of the ILO Constitution. Under this article, member states are required to report at regular intervals on the current state of relevant law and practice for each convention they have ratified. . Article 22 reportS, as they are known, examined by the ILO's Committee of Experts on the application of conventions and recomreview mendations, which comprises 20 independent persons highly qualified in legal or social fields and with an intimate knowledge labour conditions or administration. Upon examining an article 22 report, the Committee of Experts can seek further information and can raise issues about Australia's compliance with ratified conventions. This is usually in the form of a docuinent known as it direct request, which in the case of Australia is addressed to the Commonwealth Government. Where the Committee concludes that further Australia does not comply with a particular convention, it may request the Government make appropriate changes to Australian law and practice. Direct requests, and the Government's responses to them, can therefore be very - ignificant. Accordingly, Government considers it desirable to formalise procedures for the consultation required Convention No. 144, by the making - f apendorsed propriate regulations, particularly in respect the handling of direct requests. The other measures proposed in the Bill are amendments to the Migration Act 1958 and the Navigation Act 1912 to bring Australian law into conformity with two ILO conventions. As honourable members would be aware, the Government is committed to the ratification of International Labour Organisation conventions which are suitable for Australian conditions. Ratification of appropriate ILO conventions is desirable because: it supports and strengthens domestic policy and program initiatives; it confirms and maintains Australia's herence to international labour standards, with consequent benefits for workers employers; it lends credibility and authority to our international standing on labour, social and broader human relations matters; it underlines our support for the ILO; and it promotes higher labour standards in the Asian and Pacific region. So far Australia has ratified 51 ILO convenare tions. In May 1991 the Government established an interdepartmental task force to some 75 unratified conventions with a view to determining their' suitability for ratification and increasing the number of of conventions ratified by Australia. These amendments arise from that initiative. As a general rule Australia does not ratify a convention until law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions complies with the done requirements of the convention. The Bill proposes amendments to the Migration Act 1958 and the Navigation Act 1912 which will bring ,Australian law into conformity with a two conventions: No. 108, Seafarers' Identity Documents, 1958 and No. 73, to Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1946. The proposed amendments will also enable further progress to be made towards achieving compliance with Convention No. 147, Merthe chant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976. Peak employer and union bodies, through the by National Labour Consultative Council, have the suitability of convention Nos 73, of 108 and 147 to Australian conditions and the desirability of their ratification. Am.endments to the Migration Act 1958 Amendments to the Migration Act are contained in part 2 of the Bill and are designed to bring Australian law into compliance with the requirements of Convention No. 108, Seafarers' Identity Documents, 1958. This convention has been examined by the'ILO conventions task force, in conjunction with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and has been classified as a suitable ,convention for ratification by Australia. The convention is one that is solely within the competence of adthe Commonwealth Government and does not require any action by the States and Terand ritories to achieve compliance with its provisions. Convention No. 108 deals with the issue and recognition of seafarers' identity documents by the appropriate authority each country. It also specifies that the documents shall remain in the seafarer's possession at all times. The existing provisions of the Migration Act comply with the terms of the convention in relation to the issue and recognition of seafarers' identity documents. However, the Act currently specifies that a seafarer's identity document is to be held by the master the vessel or the officer in charge of a ces or sea installation. The amendments Act are designed to bring Australian law into full compliance with the convention by Article providing that a seafarer's identity document is to remain in his or her possession at all times. Amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 Amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 are contained in part 3 of the Bill. They are memorandum. intended to facilitate the ratification of ILO Convention No. 73, Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1946 and to establish substantial equivalence with article 5 of Convention No. 68, Food and Catering (Ships Crews), 1946. Convention No. 73 applies to seagoing ships and provides that seafarers shall not employed on a vessel to which the convention applies unless each seafarer holds a certificate attesting to his or her fitness for the work sea for which that person is employed. Most seagoing ships in Australian waters are engaged in interstate or overseas voyages. They thereby come within Commonwealth speech, jurisdiction and are covered by the provisions of the Navigation Act. A small number of seagoing ships, however, fall within the jurisdiction of a State or Territory. proposed amendment, which has been adhered. developed in consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, will enable regulations and orders to be made under the Navigation Act to give effect to the convention in respect of all seagoing ships in Australian waters. Bill provides that such orders and regulations will not, however, apply to the extent that existing or future law of a State or the Northern Territory gives effect to the convenGovernment tion. The second of the proposed amendments to the Navigation Act will amend sections 117 in and 118 to enable Australia to establish substantial equivalence with article 5 of Convention No. 68, Food and Catering (Ships Crews), 1946. This is required if Australia is to ratify Convention No. 147, Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976. Convention No. 147 is the principal ILO convention dealing with maritime labour matters. Convention No. 147, amongst other things, of provides that compliance or substantial eresourquivalence must be established with the to the conventions or articles of conventions specified in the appendix to that convention. 5 of Convention No. 68 is specified.in that appendix. The proposed amendments will ensure that a ship is carrying water of suitable quantity and quality and also food of suitable quality, quantity, nutritive value and variety for the crew of a vessel. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",182
251,Mr HOWARD,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Bennelong) (12.32 a.m.)The Opposition will not oppose the passage of the International Labour Organisation be (Compliance with Conventions) Bill 1992, although the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who at is at the table, should not assume that such an offering remains good for other Bills that may be before the House this evening. As the Minister indicated in his second reading this Bill is designed to give effect to some fairly inconsequential amendments to the Migration Act and also to the Navigation Act pursuant to Australia's obligations under The some ILO conventions to which we have I do not want to take the time of the House in making a long speech about the detailed provisions of the Bill but, because reliance upon ILO conventions is much in the news at The present, I thought I would take the oppor.tunity in speaking in the second reading any debate on this Bill to say something in broad terms about the announced intention of the to rely upon the external affairs power in the Constitution to purport to legislate to impose certain national standards in the area of industrial relations pursuant to obligations assumed to exist under ILO conventions. Let me state on behalf of the Opposition that we regard it as a wholly undesirable constitutional practice for the external affairs power of the Commonwealth Constitution to be used in order to alter the internal power balance between the Commonwealth and the States within the Commonwealth of Australia. I would say to the Government that, if it wants to alter that power balance, let it have the courage to ask the Australian people at a referendum to do so. If I can be completely contemporary when it comes to constitutional courage, I ask why, if the Government wants to remove references to Her Majesty from oaths of allegiance, it does not have the guts to invite the Australian people to have a vote on matters relating to her constitutional position. The same principle applies to the use of the external affairs power. If the Government wants to alter the internal balance, why does it not ask the people of Australia to refer the power to the Commonwealth Parliament? Why does it use the external affairs power that was never intended to be used for other than the external affairs of this country to alter the internal balance? That is why, since the dam case-in some learned article I read the other day it was incorrectly called the dams case-we have argued consistently that the external affairs power ought not be used .in this fashion. Here we have the Government threatening to do exactly the same thing, threatening to say, 'Well, we are going to use the external affairs power in order to impose our will on industrial relations'. I think that is an illicit benches. use of the external affairs power. I do not mind all the other powers of the Commonwealth Parliament being used in relation to industrial relations, and I put it on record that I am in favour of using, for example, the corporations power, if necessary. I see no problem with that. But the external affairs power of the Constitution was put there by the founding fathers to regulate the external relations of this country, in other words, the relations between Australia and other nations, not the relations and the power balance between Australia and the several States of Australia. I am no raving States rightist. I think that State provincialism has done this country a great deal of harm, but I do not believe that the Government should use the external affairs power to subvert the design of the Constitution. In reference to the other matter I raised, I think that, if people want to delete references to the head of state from oaths of allegiance and pursue that kind of republicanism by stealth, they ought to have the courage to confront people with referenda, rather than adopting that kind of approach. Of a similar ilk is what the Government is proposing to do in relation to this legislation. I do not intend to delay the House any further on this measure. I have quite a lot to say on the measure which is next listed and which goes to the very heart of the industrial relations debate in this country. What the Keating Government is on about is denying the workers of Victoria the freedom of choice that has been given to them by the newly elected coalition Government of that State. Let me say that, on the principal guts of the Bill, I am quite happy for it to go through, as long as those opposite understand that we think they are indulging in a rather gutless use of the external affairs power, an improper use, an illicit use, a use that we cannotpossibly support.",184
252,Mr HOLLIS,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"As other speakers have said, the hour is late. I do not want to delay the House UJlIl.ecessarily. I know that there is riveting interest in this legislation, which is evident by the overflowing gallery and the overflowing Nevertheless, this is quite significant legislation. Although people keep saying that they are only amendments and, more or less, tidying up, it is very important that Australia continue with its progress in ratifying ILO conventions. It becomes even more important today when we look at some of the matters being ratified, such as carrying adequate water on ships and various other things to do with conditions. I was going to say today, but, actually, as the hour is so late, it was yesterday that a very important report entitled Ships of shame was presented by my colleague the  Morris). I am a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure which prepared this report. Only two weeks ago the Committee was talking about one of the regulations that it proposed. That is that the Federal Government deny entry to Australian waters to ships which do not meet ILO Convention No .. 147 standards in relation to crew employment conditions. That was fine until we realised that Australia had actually not ratified ILO Convention No. 147. We were in the difficult situation of saying that foreign vessels which were coming to Australia would have to meet ILO 147 standards, which at that time Australia had not ratified. We knew the legislation was before the Parliament. We did not realise that it would actually come to the Parliament the same day that the Committee's report would be presented. In the report, we say that legislatiori is before the Parliament and we urge the Government to speedily pass the legislation. Indeed, one of the recommendations is that the Government speedily adhere to or ratify ILO Convention 147. I guess that would set a record. This is the quickest period in which a committee of this Parliament has made a recommendation to the Federal Government and, within hours of that recommendation being made by the Committee, the Government has acceded to the wish of that Committee. This report will be known, I guess, as. the Morris report. The Committee is recommending to the Government that, if foreign ships come here and they do not meet ILO 147 standards in relation to crew employment conditions, they be denied the right to trade in Australian waters. The majority of ships that come to Australia are in very good condition, but a minority are not. The ratification by Australia of this convention will result in a continuing ongoing program to make sure that ships that come here do meet international conventions. This is perhaps the last day that this Parliament will meet. I guess everyone knows something that I do not, but everyone is saying that it will be the last time we meet. As someone who represents one of the great ports of Australia, Port Kembla, someone who has a great interest in shipping matters, someone who has devoted a good deal of his spare time in the last 12 months to this report, it gives me particular delight in these early hours of the last day of this retiring Parliament to see the passage of legislation which is required if Australia is to ratify convention No. 147. I support the legislation. I am delighted that the Opposition supports the legislation. I look forward to the battle that will ensue in the coming hours. I commend the legislation to the House.",185
253,Mr CHARLES,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I rise tonight, like my colleagues, to support this legislation. I want to make a few points in passing. We talk about International Labour Organisation conventions. It is my belief that the use of those conventions through the external affairs power of the Constitution in . order to re-regulate our industrial relations system will be a highly inappropriate use, both of those conventions and of the external affairs powers. It is an indictment, I think, of this Government that, in these dying days of this Government, it finds it so necessary to try to re-establish and re-regulate the system that it talks so eloquently about during Question Time. The labour market is a very important issue in Australia today. It is important in the sense that we have, in the true sense of the word, started to leave the Fortress Australia concept. We have started to. internationalise our economy. I have given full credit-and I will againto the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for continuing with the deregulation of the financial system and the deregulation of the money market. But this Government has not had the will, nor the capacity, to deal with the labour market. This Government, through its mates, has been, is and will be in the future in partnership with trade union bureaucracies in Australia. This Government has not the will or the capacity to break that bond which creates the bureaucracy which holds up the whole systhe tem. If we want an international economy, we truly want to compete with the rest of the world-if we want factories which make In things and which can compete with other countries-and if we are to address our serious balance of payments problem, we must, at the end of the day, address this question. I remind honourable members Australia is now virtually alone in the world in terms of having a highly structured, Pacific, regulated labour market controlled still by club: the big unions, the big employer ganisations and, the grand-daddy of them all, the AIRC. When the April 1991 national wage case decision came down, the Government, Bill Kelty and the Acru moved heaven and earth to try to discredit the AIRC and the commisthan sioners themselves. They said all manner of horrible things about those people. They denigrated them, they ridiculed them and brought them into disrepute. But of the club bureaucracy must be broken if we are ever to become competitive. Yet this Government now wants to re-regulate: to give back to the AIRC the power that over the life of this Parliament I have seen stripped, Bill by Bill and piece of legislation by piece of legislation. We have not only taken away the comI munity'S regard for the AIRC, but also destroyed its concept of itself as being independent body. We have done that through destroying also the credibility of the of Remuneration Tribunal. There is no question that our industry will not become competitive and give us jobs and we will not build a school. better Australia-an Australia where our children have a future-unless we finally give away this concept that we can regulate the wage market. I remind honourable members that we would make no attempt to regulate truly the prices of goods and services in our economy. We have tried it from time to time. We have tried to fix the prices of goods and we have always failed because free markets will not work under the control of regulated prices. Yet we allow the club system to control the prices of wages and the conditions of work in labour market. We think we can, through if monopoly control, provide fairness to the community and fairness to individual workers. fact, we are limiting their horizons, limiting their prospects and limiting the ability of business to respond to the competitive pressures of the market, both here and overseas. As the walls of Fortress Australia have that come down and we have become not an isolated island continent in the south-east but a truly international economy with the a dollar exposed to all the vagaries of the orworld marketplace, with high speed communications operating in micro-seconds to tell us what is happening in the rest of the world, the rest of the world has put pressures on us and we are responding very poorly to those pressures. That is seen nowhere more vividly in our rising debt, now standing at $162 billion and increasing at about $1.5 billion per month. We have one million unemployed and they almost 700,000 young people do not have a the shackles parent who has a job. We have a government which announces, 'We're going to take on the State of Victoria and we're going to use an international bureaucratic treaty of conventions made up by bureaucrats to re-regulate the wages system in Australia'. That is not only inappropriate, but frightening. It is frightening for my children. am frightened to death that there will not be jobs for them. I have two children who left an the school market this month. They are not sure what they will be doing next month. One them is trying to get back into school and the other will pick mangoes in North Queensland for a while and then perhaps try He wants a full time job, but there are not any jobs for my son. Thirty-five per cent of kids in my son's age bracket in the State of Victoria cannot find jobs. They are kids who want jobs. But we have a government that wants to control the labour market. Through the bidding of its masters down at Trades Hall-the ACTU - it says that youth wages must be the same as adult wages because they must be doing the same job. What we are really trying to bring in through this ILO convention is the idea of unifonnity: equal pay for equal work, regardless of how or what it is for. I think it is appropriate that we think about that concept and about ILO conventions. They are international-and we emphasise the word - international'. Let us think about it in context. If a shoemaker in the State of Victoria is on $500 per week and a shoemaker in China is on $50 per week, perhaps we had better lower the wages of the shoemaker in Victoria to the $50 per week of the bloke in China. Or do we in fact make it the $700 per week that is paid to the shoemaker in northern Italy? What do we do? How do we internationalise and reregulate our labour market so that we have absolute wage relativity which is comparable in an international sense using these international conventions? I hear no answer from the other side. There will not be any because it is a conundrum without an answer. We cannot do that; it is absolute silliness. It is the epitome of nonsense to consider that we can describe, define and classify the work that an individual in some location in Australia does and compare him or her to the work that someone else does in some other country. It is just a bunch of nonsense for us to try to describe that same situation for an individual in Canberra versus an individual in Hobart. This proposed use of conventions is certainly a straight-out attack not only on the States and our concept of States rights-which I remind honourable members are enshrined in the Constitution-but also on the intent of the Constitution. The Constitution specified some powers in relation to settling industrial disputes. But the proposed use of this convention is an attack on that system because it says that the Federal Government shall have the right to control what the own free will and volition, being freely elected by their constituents. This Government will impose its will on them-full stop. It is not in a manner of cooperation, nationhood or agreement, but in a manner of control for politics sake. That is what this is: a political stunt. It is a stunt to try to impose the will of a Prime Minister, who is almost violent at times, who thinks that his will in this matter transcends the rights of Australian people-their right to select a government and to make rules and regulations for their States. He thinks he has the right to override their will. I am totally opposed to the use of international conventions in this manner. This Government has sought to use the external affairs power of the Constitution to run roughshod over States rights in an environmental issue for political purposes in order to help win an election. If we examine it, the proposed use of the convention is, in essence, an attempt to make union dominance and control of the system immutable. By the time we have finished with this proposed legislation, union control will be absolute and the rights of the individual will be of no consequence whatsoever. We have a government that is so intent on retaining power, so hungry for power and so absolutely detennined that its relationship with the trade union bureaucracy will not be broken that it is willing to do anything, make any suggestion and pass any law, to make sure that that bond is not broken. I could speak at great length on this Bill, but it has been a long night and there is a long way to go. I suggest that this proposed use of international conventions in order to control and re-regulate the industrial relations system in Australia is inappropriate, unwanted and undemocratic.

254,Mr BALDWIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 is a portfolio Bill which amends 10 Acts in the industrial relations portfolio. The most significant amendments relate to section 111 of the Industrial Relations Act. The Government's proposals concerning section 111 reflect our clear policy in industrial relations. We support cooperation over conflict, choice over coercion, and the proper protection of the interests of employers, workers and the general community. Such an approach provides the basis for achieving lasting economic and industrial reform fairly and flexibly. If Australia's industrial relations system is to meet these objectives, it must guarantee employers, employees and their representatives that where agreement cannot be reached over industrial differences, there is a fair, speedy and impartial system for resolving such problems. For most of this century, this has been achieved at the Federal and State levels by the provision of a system of conciliation and arbitration, administered by independent industrial tribunals with the power to compel parties to disputes to appear before them, and to make binding awards, by arbitration if necessary, to resolve the matters in dispute. This system has provided the basis for the fair and effecti.ve prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. Importantly, through awards, employees are guaranteed enforceable (Traand equitable terms and conditions of employment. The balance between Federal and State systems has been maintained partly by the preferences of the parties, partly by historical influences and partly by a mechanism in the Federal industrial legislation which allows the Federal commission not to hear a matter which is appropriately left for resolution by a State industrial tribunal. In the Industrial Relations Act, that mechanism is found in paragraph l11(l)(g). Under that paragraph, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can dismiss or refrain from hearing a matter on various grounds, including that the Commission should defer to a State industrial authority, or that further proceedings are not necessary or desirable in the public interest. From time to time, the Commission acts under this provision without further hearing a matter. In this way, the Commission can leave the matter to be resolved within a State;s jurisdiction if that appears to be more appropriate. A matter should not be so dismissed where the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by the exercise of powers of compulsory arbitration in the relevant State jurisdiction in cases in which no other resolution can be achieved. On the other hand, the Commission should be able to dismiss a matter if it is merely an attempt to re-open an industrial agreement freely entered into by the parties in a State jurisdiction that permitted access to compulsory arbitration. Nor should a temporary denial of access to compulsory arbitration be relevant, if it is the result of an award that was made within a system of compulsory arbitration. The proposed amendments recognise these situations. Accordingly, it is proposed to provide that the Commission may not dismiss or refrain from hearing a matter where compulsory arbitration cannot apply or could not have applied in the State concerned. Without such amendments, industrial disputes within the constitutionally authorised jurisdiction of the Commission could be left unresolved, and one party or another could be in a position to impose an unfair result by using much greater bargaining power. I emphasise that the proposed amendments do not direct the Commission how to decide any matter to which they apply. Their effect will be to ensure that the Commission hears and decides such a matter on its merits,and that it cannot be dismissed without such a hearing. The Government referred the proposed liament. amendments to the National Labour Consultative Council and to State governments for their consideration and comment. The views of the National Labour Consultative Council members have been taken into account, resulting in some changes to the original draft amendments. A clause has been omitted sion which would have imposed an obligation on federally registered employer organisations to give notice of changes in their membership the Australian Industrial Relations Commisbe sion and relevant unions. Such changes membership can affect respondency to awards. The proposal has been removed for further examination by the National Labour Consultative Council. The States were given the opportunity comment on the Government's proposals. governments of two States, New South Wales and Queensland, provided substantive ments. The representations led to some chanwithin ges to the draft Bill. Proposed subsection 111(1a) has been altered to make it clear that State awards which cannot, for some period, be varied, are outside the proposed restriction on the powers under paragraph 111{l)(g). addition, the Bill is framed so that required 'employment agreements' as defined are also outside that restriction. The concerns of these governments related to awards and agreements under their own industrial legislation, but are also relevant other State systems which maintain compulsection sory arbitration as an ultimate means of detennining disputes. The status quo under paragraph 111{l)(g) has been preserved such cases. The Queensland Government also suggested that paragraph 111(l)(g) should itself be amended by inserting an express provision allow the Commission to dismiss or to refrain from further hearing a matter where it has bee- the subject under State law of an employment agreement, as defined. The Commonwealth recognises the validity of this point and proposes to raise it in the National Labour Consultative Council and with the other States, to seek their views on amending section 111 appropriately. This will occur before the next sittings of the ParThe other amendments in this Bill are all designed to improve the operation of the Acts concerned or the functioning of offices or bodies established under them. Each of the proposed amendments is sensible and of real value. They have been the subject of discusin the tripartite National Labour Consultative Council and accepted by its members. The Bill contains two further amendments to to the Industrial Relations Act which should mentioned. The first is to improve the in operation of section 202 of the Act, to strengthen the administration of federally registered unions. Section 202 is designed to overcome difficulties that can occur when a Federal union and a State union have substanto tially overlapping membership. The section The allows a Federal union to enter into an agreement with a counterpart State union. comMembers of the State union who are not the Federal union's eligibility rules can then become members of the Federal union and participate in its internal affairs. The Federal union cannot represent the industrial interests of these members unless it sucIn cessfully goes through the nonnal process, by other provisions of the Act, to make the changes to its eligibility rules. Section 202 provides a way of overcoming legal difficulties that might arise from the participation by the State union members into the affairs of the Federal union. The existing 202 is confined to States which have legislation that confers. corporate status on registered unions. Experience has shown that in the section could usefully be extended to unions in the other two States-Victoria and Tasmania. The new section 202 provides for this, and to will also pennit an agreement to be used to facilitate amalgamations between federally registered unions. To avoid abuses, the new provision gives the Australian Industrial R-lations Commission greater powers of supervision over agreements made under the section. The new section 202 remains a provision concerned with the rights of members to participate in the internal affairs of a federally registered union. It does not give such a union any additional rights to represent thosemembers industrially. For these purposes, a federally registered union is limited by its eligibility rules, which will not be affected by an agreement under section 202. The Bill also gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the protection of the law of contempt of court. It will be an offence to do anything that would amount to contempt of court if the Commission were itself a court. Commonwealth law already gives this same protection to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Trade Practices Tribuna1. This new provision will replace a broader provision in a paragraph of section 299 which the High Court has recently found to be invalid. The High Court interpreted that provision as purporting to prohibit criticism of the Commission even when that criticism was honest and fair. The new provision will not suffer from that defect. Under this .new provision, the genuine exercise of a right of criticism will not be an offence. The new provision will apply only if a person is acting in malice or attempting to impair the administration of justice. The Bill also makes minor changes to legislation concerning occupational health and safety, Commonwealth employment and the membership of the Remuneration Tribuna1. These are explained in the explanatory memorandum. . Financial Impact The Bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",189
255,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Bennelong) (1.06 a.m.)The Opposition will oppose the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) root and branch, through every stage of its passage through the Parliament. It is a very important measure and it has enormous consequences for the industrial relations system of this country. It is a proposal by the Keating Labor Government that strikes right at the concept of any notion of electoral mandate in this country. Let us make one thing very clear at the outset. It is the dying hours of this Parliament and, in a sense, it is a disgrace that a measure as important as this should be brought before the Parliament at five past one on the last morning that it may sit. This Bill is not about giving greater choice to the workers of Victoria; it is about taking away choice from the workers of Victoria. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwm) had the impertinence in his second reading speech, the sheer and unadulterated gall, to say that this is about choice over coercion. Let me tell the House how it is the exact reverse. If this Bill is passed, it is the coercion of this Federal Parliament over the free choice of the Victorian people, expressed at a recent State election, and the free choice of individual Victorian workers to go into workplace agreements under legislation enacted by the Victorian Parliament. This measure will enable any group of trade union officials in Victoria to apply for Federal industrial relations award coverage in relation to any work category in the State of Victoria. Irrespective of the wishes of people who may be working in that classification, if that award coverage is granted, then individual Victorian workers, often against their will, will be dragged out of those workplace agreements and put under Federal awards. This legislation is not about allowing individual Victorian workers to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission for Federal award coverage. Every time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says that, he distorts the truth and misrepresents the position. This Bill is about giving the union bosses of Victoria the power once again to assume control over what individual Victorian workers-many not belonging to those unions-want to do with their lives. I sit here and watch the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), who has a back.ground in the trade union movement, and I watch other honourable members opposite. I invite them as part of this debate to disprove the central claim that I am making: are they arguing that this Bill gives individual workers the right to apply for Federal award coverage? I notice that they do not nod their heads, because they cannot. They know that what I am saying is correct. This Bill is about one thing only: placating John Halfpenny, the surrender of Paul Keating to John Halfpenny, and overturning the decision taken by the people of Victoria on 3 October to vote into power a government that has been given an explicit mandate to legislate to change the industrial relations laws of the toria. Since the change of government in Victoria the industrial relations law of Victoria has been dramatically altered in accordance with the wishes expressed by the Victorian people on 3 October. The major change that has been made in Victoria is that, for the first time in over 90 years, individual men and women, subject to compliance with a number of minimum conditions, have been given the freedom to negotiate directly with their own employers and to enter directly into workplace agreements. This Bill seeks to overturn that freedom. This Bill is not about giving greater freedom; it is about circumscribing the freedom that has been given to the workers of Victoria. We have had this debate before and I see the same friendly faces opposite. Mr Courtice-And we're going to have it again.",191
256,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"And, of course, we are going to have it again. I say to the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), with the best of goodwill in this festive season-and I always have goodwill towards the honourable member for Hinkler-that I always feel a bit sorry for people who suffer from invincible ignorance when it comes to industrial relations. I say to the honourable member for Hinkler and to other honourable members opposite that this Bill is about one very simple proposition: are we, in 1992, going to support the proposition that it is trade union officials, and not the individuals concerned, who have the right to decide who is going to govern the enterprise and workplace arrangements of individual Australians? That is what this debate is about. I am glad the honourable member for Hinkler nods. I will be delighted to spend the next few months debating whether the men and women of Australia should have the freedom to negotiate on their own behalf if they want to. We are not saying to anybody opposite that people should not have the right to negotiate through a union if they want to. There is nothing in the Federal coalition's industrial relations policy that denies people the right to use a trade union. They can use State of Vic- anybody they like. But what we will not accept, and what I am sure the Australian people will not accept, is the proposition that the characters opposite advance every time: the men and women. of Australia are too stupid ever to negotiate on their own behalf. That is the essence of their industrial relations policy. They will never give to the Australian people. The Government talks about the pride and the independence of the Australian people but, when it comes to the crunch, it will never allow them to negotiate on their own behalfthey are too dumb; they are too stupid. We apparently allow people to make monumental financial decisions about the house they will buy; we allow people to decide who they are going to marry or live with; we allow people to make all sorts of decisions of that kind without some kind of paternal influence, but when it comes to entering into an arrangement about how much they are worth, we say, 'Oh, you can't do that; you can't actually allow people to make a decision on their own behalf; they might get it wrong'. So we are going to stop them doing it. We are going to bind them hand and foot and we are going to say in the good old paternalistic, totalitarian Labor tradition, 'You shall not be allowed'. Yet those opposite have the infernal gall to get up here and talk about choice over coercion. It is the exact opposite. Dr Theophanous interjecting",192
257,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I notice that we have finally been joined by another Labor member from Victoria. He ought to go and hide under a rock after what his mob has done to the State of Victoria over the last 10 years. He is the last bloke with any authority or warrant to enter this particular debate. This legislation attempts to reimpose the writ of John Halfpenny on the workers of Victoria. That is what it is all about. It has nothing to do with freedom; it has nothing to do with individual liberty or individual rights. It has everything to do with handing back control of industrial relations to John Halfpenin ny. Never let it be forgotten that the present Prime Minister of Australia owes more than he likes to admit to the socialist Left in Victoria. Government members-Oh, yes!",193
258,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"'Oh, yes', they go on; 'Oh, yes'. He was getting more support from Joari Kirner and Wally Curran when he was trying to knock off Bob Hawke than he was getting initially from the Queensland Right, wasn'the, Brian? The honourable member for Hinkler put his hand up. I do not think I ought to remind him of a few conversations I had with him on that subject. I will not be so uncharitable or so ungracious as to do so, and he knows exactly to what I am referring. When the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) was really struggling to knock off Hawke, about the only time people would talk to the honourable member for Blaxland, outside his mates in Sussex Street, was when he went down to see Joan Kirner. He had quite a thing going with the socialist Left down in Victoria, and Government members know very well that this is really quite a pay off. This has nothing to do with good industrial relations. It has everything to do with reassergreat ting the authority of the Trades Hall Council; it has everything to do with handing over to the union bosses of Victoria the right to decide that Victorian workers who, of their own free will, have gone into workplace agreements shall be dragged out of those workplace agreements and placed under Federal awards. There is nothing that can be pointed to in this Bill that disputes the simple, unassailable proposition that no individual Victorian worker has the right, under this legislation, to obtain Federal award coverage. Every time the Prime Minister or Senator Cook says that this Bill is to give Victorian workers the right to get Federal award coverage, they tell a straight out lie. They have done it repeatedly. They will go on doing it. I hope the honourable gentleman opposite will not fall into the same error. It is not about giving individuals rights; it is about giving trade union bosses rights. We believe that the changes that have been implemented Victoria by and large were supported by the overwhelming majority of the Victorian people.",193
259,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Rubbish.,193
260,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Calwell makes a wholly original interjection. I have to give him marks for originality. I have never had anybody interject on me in the past and say, 'Rubbish'. That really is a very origipal interjection from the honourable member for Calwell. Let me remind him of this: who ran those advertisements· in the Victorian election campaign featuring that bloke from New Zealand? What was that all about? That was all about Joan Kirner and the honourable member's mob in Victoria arguing that if Kennett were elected he would introduce industrial relations legislation similar to that in New Zealand. The whole focus of the Government's campaign for the last three weeks was about scaring the daylights out of what it regarded as its traditional voters in its heartland seat about Kennett's industrial relations policy. Yet the honourable member has the nerve to get up in this) Parliament and argue that· in some way Kennett did not have a mandate to introduce industrial relations reforms. With respect to the honourable member for Calwell, that is the rubbish that is being argued in this Parliament and not the statements that I am making. I make no secret, and I did say this from the very beginning, that there are three areas where our policy is different from the policy of the Victorian Government. The first area relates to the changes that are by the Victorian Government regarding strike action. We see no particular necessity for those changes, and they will not be enacted come the election of a Hewson-Fischer government on 6 March, or whatever the date is that may be decided by the Government. We make that perfectly clear. On this particular subject. I happen to share the view expressed by the former Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke. Remember him? In the wake of the pilots dispute in September 1989 he said that there was a right to strike in Australia, and that it was being exercised. He did not see any particular need to change the common law of Australia relation to the right to strike. That is my and that is the view of the Federal coalition. As far as we are concerned there will be changes made to the right of people to strike under Federal law under a future coalition government. In that respect our policy is different from the approach of the Victorian Government. I make absolutely no bones penalty about that at all.",193

I have almost woken up again. Let me spell out one thing with crystal clarity: under our policy, if people have entitlements to penalty rates or holiday loadings, they cannot lose those except by agreement. It is as simple as that. That is enshrined in our policy and it will remain our policy. I have made that perfectly clear, and I say in the forum of this Parliament to the Australian people that the word I give in relation to this is absolutely indisputable. If in anybody wants seriously to engage me in view, public debate on this, I will be absolutely delighted to do so. I will be perfectly happy no to match my track record of believability when I make a public statement against anybody in public life in Australia. As far as I am concerned, when I make a statement on this, what I say I mean: that is, rates and holiday loadings will not be unilaterally withdrawn; they will be matters of negotiation under workplace agreements. under our policy, if somebody is working like. under an award and that award includes The penalty rates or holiday loadings",194

278,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am certainly being provocative. I have never denied being provocative. If I may calmly return to a careful consideration of this issue, very clearly the situation is that under our policy, if there is a worker who is under an award that includes penalty rates and holiday loadings, and his or her employer and the person in question agree to stay under that award, naturally the employee will continue to enjoy the penalty rates. If the person agrees to negotiate a work place agreement, then the question of whether there are penalty rates or holiday loadings quite properly becomes a matter of negotiation. But in the third situation where the employer said, 'I want you to sign a work place agreement' and the employee said, 'No, I would rather stay under the award', in those circumstances under our policy the award conditions continue.",195
279,Mr GRIFFITHS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I don't believe you.,195
280,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong, the Minister at the table, said that he does not believe it. In a sense, it does not matter what he believes. What matters is what the Australian people believe. When it comes to the choice, the Australian people will believe me over him. They will believe me over the utterances of his duplicitous, deceptive Prime Minister, because nobody has a worse track record of misleading the Australian people than the current Prime Minister of Australia. Our policy in relation to this Bill is inscribed in stone. The position is absolutely unassailable. Under our policy, the enjoyment of penalty rates continues, except in circumstances where the individual concerned agrees to give them up.",195

282,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister can interject and the Government members can carry on and guffaw as much as they like. This piece of legislation is part and parcel of an attempt by the present Government to slow down the process that will inevitably occur in Australia of freeing and deregulating the Australian labour market. One of the things that I find most intriguing about this industrial relations debate is that the Minister at the table, the Prime Minister, Senator Cook, and no doubt my friends opposite have talked, and will talk, in absolutely shocked tones about the use of the dreadful common law. The Prime Minister talked about 'a master and a servant'. By using 'master and servant' he thinks that he might conjure up some dark notion of eighteenth century or nineteenth century arrangements between employers and employees. The Prime Minister condemns the fact that our industrial relations policy encourages people to enter into contractual arrangements with each other regarding their working arrangements, their pay and conditions. He said that that is absolutely wicked. He said that people should not be dragged into or encouraged to go to common law. Is it not strange that that same man three years ago, along with his predecessor, the former Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, and the Secretary of the ACTU, Bill KeltyMr Ferguson interjecting",195
283,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I can tell from the reaction by the honourable member for Reid that he knows exactly what I am about to say. The honourable member for Reid knows a few things about industrial relations. He has a reasonable memory. He would remember that three years ago Bob Hawke thought common law was the greatest thing since sliced bread when it came to industrial relations. Iri the wake of the pilots dispute, Bob Hawke encouraged Sir Peter Abeles and Ted Harris to get their airlines to sue the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots. He stood by and applauded while common law was used by the airlines of Australia to recover damages against Australian trade unionists. There is nothing that any of those opposite can do that will ever erase from the collective memory of the Australian people on industrial relations the fact that, when it came to the crunch and when it suited their political convenience, Bob Hawke, the then Treasurer and Bill Kelty embraced the use of common law procedures, common law arrangements and the recovery of common law damages with great zeal and with great gusto. Therefore, it is a monumental act of hypocrisy and humbug for the present Prime Minister of Australia and any of his acolytes, current or continuing, to argue that in some way there is something dreadful or nefarious about the use of common law . because, when it suited those opposite, common law was the thing to be used. The other peculiar thing about the common law and the Government's condemnation of its use is a very interesting comparison, so far as common law liability is concerned. It arises under the Opposition's policy according to whether one is under an award or under a workplace agreement. I wonder how many honour-ble members opposite know that under our policy if one continues under an award as an individual employee one's potentialliability, or exposure at common law, for damages is completely unlimited as the Federation of Airline Pilots discovered and as the honourable member for Brisbane by his nodding head acknowledges. If one goes into a workplace agreement one's liability at common law is limited to a total amount of $5,000 per individual. In other words, one's liability at common law is infinitely less under a workplace agreement than it is under the Keating-Kelty system that honourable members opposite are trying to defend and protect. Is that not an interesting irony? Yet, what do honourable members say about that? What they say about that is a very simple proposition: we limit the common law damages to $5,000 a head; they, with their twisted sense of respect for the truth, turn around in all of their publications and say that equals a fine of $5,000 if anybody goes on strike. Are those opposite seriously arguing that that is a truthful statement of the position? Those opposite want a serious debate on industrial relations in Australia, yet they are prepared to give their authority, warrant and support to that kind of deceitful misrepresentation to the Australian people. There are no fines in our policy and those opposite know that. There are no criminal sanctions in our policy and they know that. There are no criminal sanctions of any kind in our policy. Those opposite have an absolute nerveDr Charlesworth-Show us the legislation.",195
284,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I see the honourable member for Perth is getting agitated. There are no sanctions of that kind at all. Yet those opposite have an infernal gall, and a terrible disrespect for the truth. Why did those opposite chicken out on supporting Senator Powell's amendment relating to sections 45D and E? Do they not want to have an argument with the employers before the election? Is that something they might like to try to do after the election if they were to scrape back. Why did they chicken out on it? They do not want to confront the employers on that subject before the election. Those opposite are a mob of humbugs on the subject of industrial relation. When it suited the convenience of those opposite they were prepared to use the common law. When they wanted to bring a union to heel that they did not like, they said that they sooled the employers and said, 'Go get them'. They called Abeles and Harris in and said, 'Go and sue them, they're elitist trade unionists; they're not the real trade unionists'. That is what they did. There is no difference in principle between what happened in the airlines case and what might happen in another situation. It was. the Government's Prime Minister, its Treasurer and its mate who runs the Acru who were in favour of taking the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots to court. The Federation was sued and there were damages of $6m awarded against those pilots. It was the Government's Prime Minister that clapped and cheered while that that occurred. He rubbed his hands together and said, 'That's terrific'. He wanted that to happen. He wanted them to be made an example of. He was quite prepared to see them ground into the dirt and yet those opposite have the gall to get up here and say that they defend the rights of the individual worker and the individual employee. Those opposite are not representing the rights of the Victorian workers, they are representing the rights of the trade union bosses of Victoria. This legislation is about handing back authority to the trade union bosses of Victoria. It is not about giving individual Victorian workers the right of free choice. They have a free choice; their free choice is to go into workplace agreements. This legislation will authorise trade union officials to drag people out of those workplace agreements and put them against their will under the reach of Federal awards. Yet those opposite are seriously asking the. Australian people to accept that this is an exercise in free choice. What those opposite are about is running a completely dishonest fear campaign on the subject of industrial relations. What they are about is running a campaign of fear and loathing. They are not about a serious debate on industrial relations: They are not about lifting productivity and they are' not about recognising that productivity has been an abysmal failure under the industrial relations system that they operate. I saw the Prime Minister a couple of weeks ago on television. It was a Sunday morning, which is a bit much, I know, but I had had a reasonably early night so I was able to take it. The Prime Minister was saying, 'You know what these terrible Liberals are going to do? These terrible Liberals are going to adopt the failed policies of the Thatcher and Reagan governments'. The next morning I picked up the copy of the Economist that landed on my front lawn. There is a very interesting table at the back and it has all the economic indicia. I looked at the failed unemployment policies of Reagan and Bush which the Prime Minister says Clinton has inherited. Do honourable members know what the unemployment level is now in the United States? It is 7.2 percent. Do they know what it is in Australia? It is 11.4 per cent. In Japan it is about 3 per cent, and in Gennany it is about 6.2 per cent. It is 7.2 per cent against 11.4 per cent, and it is one per cent lower even in the United Kingdom. The Government gets zero out of five on that particular comparison. If those figures for the US and the UK represent failed policies, we can only say that what the Prime Minister has given this country has been a monumental catastrophe.",196

In fact, my aunt, who met him last year, was very impressed and thought that he was probably the best Liberal she had ever met. I have to tell him, as he probably knows, that her uncle was Clarrie Fallon, the State Secretary of the Australian Workers Union in Queensland and, of course, not a convert. At the end of the day, there is a recognition and respect on this side of the House for the honourable member for Bennelong for everything he says and does because he is an honest man and a decent person. We do not agree with his point of view, but we do agree that he understands the philosophy with which he pushes the argument. The honourable member for Bennelong is leading the charge on industrial relations because the honourable member for Wentworth h- wimped out, as he has on so many other occasions. Of course, he is not here today. Of all the issues that are so fundamental to the future of this country, industrial relations is one of the most important. To those of us on this side of the House, it is very important. It is interesting that the honourable member for Bennelong has to carry the weight and baggage of Reaganism and Thatcherism into this House in this debate. This Bill is about freedom, but freedom is couched in so many terms and so many terminologies. It was said over 100 years ago, when Abraham Lincoln put forward the emancipation proclamation, that he was destroying freedom. Some people in the south said that slaves were free to choose whether they would be slaves or not.· What we are fighting and arguing about today is the right and the benefit of working 1p.en and women in this country to sell their labour, argue their labour and have an independent umpire. There are many people on the other side of the House who refer to all this debate about freedom. It was perceived under the Eisenhower Administration that at that time in the early 1960s, at the beginning of the Cold War debate, America was a free country. Of course it was free. The people were free to starve, as they are today. They were free to miss out on education, health and housing, as they are today. A total of 38 million people in America are homeless. That is not the freedom that we recognise. The freedom that we recognise on this side of the House comes out of the coal mines, out of the factories of Manchester and Lancashire, comes out of the belief that working men and women of this country are entitled to have a go and are entitled to fight for a free go. It is interesting that those people on the other side get upset about working men and women fighting for their rights. The real difference is that workers do not have a Geelong Grammar school tie; they do not have a Melbourne Grammar school tie. They do not come from the yuppie suburbs of Vaucluse and Toorak. But they have more to contribute to this country than the hillbillies who come out of those suburbs and the blue rinse set who have never contributed anything other than the MCEwen monkey that rode on the back of Australian industry, the Menzies liability that we saw for so many years and, of course, the lack of courage in the war when they put that red line through Brisbane and said, 'We'll give it all away to the Japanese'. We saw the National Party do just that for 32 years. So never let it be said that we should have a history lesson, because the Opposition will lose every time round. My family was there, along with Chiff, and we know what it was all about. We were there. So if Opposition members want to reopen history, that is fine. We do not mind because they will lose every time around. The dignity of labour is what this debate and this Bill are all about. This Bill is all about the dignity of working men and women in this country and their ability to sell and bargain with their labour and have an independent umpire and union movement to defend and support them. The gutlessness and the cowardice on the other side of the House was demonstrated by the Kennett Government which, in the middle of the night, brought back powdered wigs and an $8,000 wage rise for its members and then said that the workers had to forgo penalty rates. That demonstrates equality under the Liberals. The good thing about those opposite is that they have never changed. My grandfather told me something once and I would like to tell honourable members, particularly the Victorians, because they have never come across this scenario. My grandfather said to me when I was a little boy, ISon, you should never kill a black snake'. I said to him, 'Why, Grandfather? Why shouldn't I kill a black snake?'. He said that there was always a chance it would bite a tory. I thought then that that was a bit harsh but now I have seen, today, the proposition that the Opposition has put forward. I said to him then, 'Why did you say that?'. He said, 'Son, I lived through the Depression and my father lived through the 1890 Depression, and they have never changed'. .We have seen today what the Opposition represents in Victoria, and he was right. I can tell honourable members this: there are a hell of a lot of black snakes running around in Queensland. There are not many brown snakes because we have killed them, but the black snakes are safe and free. If we ever walk into this House with a bag full of black snakes, the Liberals have a problem. At the end of the day, nothing changes. The perception does not change; the view does not change. It is a matter of whether we represent working class people or whether we do not. It is a matter of whether we care about working class people or whether we do not. It is a matter of whether or not we want to walk into a workplace such as a sawmill and say to those people, 'You have to bargain individually about productivity'. How can a sawmill worker increase his productivity without an increase in technology? He cannot. He has to bargain what he has and lose what he has-and that is freedom! That is not freedom; that is manipulation. That is exploitation. That is why the union movement was formed and that is why the union movement has been attacked and assailed for 100 years. It is the only thing that stood between working class people and those who would take advantage of working class people. i It is interesting to note in the debate tonight, in 1992, as will be the case in so many debates between now and the next election, that nothing has changed in 100 years. The only people who are standing in front of the working people of this country, defending their rights, are those on this side of the House, in the Labor Party. Those on the other side of the House are defending the free enterprise that they talk about-the freedom for exploitation, the freedom to take money out of the pockets of workers, the freedom to tell young people that they can work for $3 an hour, the freedom to abolish the CES, the freedom to abolish the TAFE system and the freedom to abolish the education system-the very thing that allows people to get up the ladder and to get equality. The freedom will disappear and ensure that only the wealthy and the lucky ever endure and ever succeed . That is what the debate is about. It is a philosophical debate. I am very pleased that this debate has finally hinged on the difference between both sides of this House. Over the last 20 years, both sides of the House have concentrated on panache, on scenarios, on dress and all the razzamatazz that has gone along with elections. But the election that is coming up will be based on the most important thing of all, and it will be the most important election since the war. It will be based on philosophy-not on clothes, not on charisma, not on all the things the other elections have been based on, when there have been only varying degrees of difference. There will be a clear distinction in this election between those people who support the view that working people in this country deserve a fair go and deserve protection, and those people who believe in a free market economy and who believe that people are free to starve, free to live in the streets and free to sleep in the gutters. That is the difference in this society. If those opposite want to parrot that line, why would they want to put a tax of 15 per cent on the very people they pretend to care about? It is because they do not care about them. They can personify and pontificate, but . they do not care about them-they never have and they never will-because they do not come from that area. They come from the people who have been the masters when it comes to wealth and privilege. At the end of the day, they are really talking about a division between Australians. That is what they are representing. I think it would be sad if this country went back down the tracks of what happened between 1929 and 1932 or 1891 and 1893. The real choice for Australia is not just a philosophy; it is a mind set. Nothing has really changed. The honourable member for Bennelong has demonstrated his passionate belief in the proposition in which he believes. He has articulated it very well and has been very honest in what he has said. There have been people on his side of the House who have been less honest, but he has been honest and consistent all the way along the line. What he really means is that working people do not have an independent umpire, do not have the protection of awards and do not have the systems that Australia created and has led the world in for 100 years. When I looked down the list of speakers on this Bill I saw that the first four speakers are Queenslanders. I thought: why would they be Queenslanders? The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) are on the list. Why would all of us be speaking? Mr Anderson-Because you're slow.",197
287,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased that the interjection has come from a National Party member. I will tell the House why. It is because for 32 years we had a National Party government in Queensland. I can tell those opposite why we are speaking. We never again want to see a corrupt, criminal, spivvy government, run by spivs and crooks-run by criminals. Four National Party Cabinet Ministers are in gaol. The Police Commissioner is in gaol. The worse person of alland I am sure the honourable member for Benne10ng will agree with me on this, and I am sure the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) will too-was an idiot and a hillbilly called Bjelke-Petersen who should have been in gaol. He was a lunatic into the bargain, as well as a supporter of the Ku Klux Klan. They are the characters who led Queensland for 32 years. It was the strength and courage of our great State that got us through-not the idiots who ran it for 32 years. I can tell the House why four members from Queensland will speak in this debate. We have lived through it. Other than East Germany, there is no place in the Western world that has come through such suppression as Queensland. That is why we are up on our feet defending the very rights of free enterprise, decency and integrity. Even the Liberal Party in Queensland can breathe a breath of fresh air. Even it is pleased that it has got rid of the hillbillies in the National Party, because after 32 years no-one would want to see them there. The agrarian socialists, the hillbillies, the throwbacks",200

289,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will get back to the Bill. I got carried away briefly. I was passionate about my belief in my beloved State because all of us Queenslanders love Queensland first and our country second. Mr Elliott-What about the Sheffield Shield?",200
290,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I acknowledge the honourable member for Parramatta, who mentioned the Sheffield Shield. That. is a sore point. Bill Tallon once said, 'The only way we'll ever win it is if we raffle it', but I think we have a show this year and we have a great cricket team. I know the honourable member for Barker would appreciate that, given that he was one of the best batsmen that we ever saw. He was a top cricketer. I wish to goodness he were playing for Queensland at present. I acknowledge that there is only one National Party member on the front bench, and he must be feeling pretty embarrassed. What it is all about is a philosophical view. This side of the House has a belief in decency; a belief that human beings have a right not only to argue and debate but to have an independent umpire and a union to protect them. If we take that away, we go back to the master and servant approach. It is not hard to use the pressure and the imposition on people by saying, 'There's 20 people here. You take . a $20 a week pay cut or else we'll sack 10'. That is the way the games are played. We know that. That is the sort of thing we are against. Mr Connolly-So are we. You should read our Bill. . Mr COURTICE-Of course those opposite are not opposed to that. That is what they are trying to support by virtue of their proposition. That is why we are so passionately opposed to it. The one thing that differentiates us from those opposite is the inherent belief that working men and women in this country are entitled to bargain their labour, to argue their labour and to have the protection of the trade union movement. Those opposite will not break that proposition. The honourable member for Bennelong mentioned unemployment rates. It is important that we look at unemployment rates and participation rates. Let us look at the United States and Europe and the social structures that exist there. Let us look at holiday leave loading and all the other things that exist across Europe. Those opposite have a very competent, very positive and very useful mind set when it comes to those issues. They have convenient amnesia when it comes to those issues. The fact is that today we have the lowest level of inflation and the third lowest level of taxation in the DECO. Mrs Bailey-Tell us why.",200
291,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The reason is that, in a world recession, we have put in placeMr Andrews-Tell us about. our foreign debt.",201
292,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"If we could wipe out all the graft in Queensland, we would wipe out all our foreign debt. The National Party could have funded it. If we look at the realities of economic structure, we see that we are doing better than most other countries. People are not queuing up here wanting to go overseas to England or to America; they are queuing in front of our embassies overseas wanting to come out to Australia. Those opposite talk about New Zealand. There are 288,000 New Zealanders here now. They voted with their feet. They are here because they do not want to live under a tory government in New Zealand. They are pleased to be here, away from a GST and away from voluntary agreements. When those opposite go back to their electorates, they can tell the people there all the nonsense they want but, at the end of the day, the Opposition has a credibility problem because it is going to lose.

296,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member for Calwell will not interject out of his seat.,201
297,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am delighted to rise to make my contribution to the hotchpotch of amendments to the Government's Industrial Relations Act 1988. I consider the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 to be in two parts. The first part of the Bill is the Bob Charles, member for La Trobe, vindication Bill; the second part of the Bill should really be known as the 'Attack Jeff Kennett' Bill. The first part of the Bill-the Bob Charles vindication Bill-is all about removing section 299(1)(d)(ii) from the Industrial Relations Act. I first brought that measure before this House in a private member's Bill on 4 November 1990. Three times I brought a Bill before this House to eliminate an obnoxious section of an Act that had carried over from the original Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 and which has been enshrined in legislation since 1904. I contended that it was a violation of freedom of the press and freedom of speech and was noxious to the Constitution of the people of this country. I remind honourable members that the High Court in its judgment said that I was right and the Government was wrong-wrong, wrong, wrong. Three times in two years I brought a Bill before this House to convince the Government that that section of the Act should be expunged. Three times I was denied. However, the High Court did not deny m-- the High Court said that I was right. I remind those opposite that that section of the Act has largely been used by that side of the House to attack the press in this country and to remove from it a basic freedom: to discuss public affairs openly and honestly so that we have free and fair discussion. The Labor Party does not like that and so it refused to remove that section. We have in this Bill, unfortunately, a removal of that section of the Act, but the substitution of other words, which provide some other form of protection to the Commission, and which treat the Commission as if it were a court of law-but it is not. The Industrial Relations Commission is a tribunal; it is not a court. We do not have a court of labour law in this country, and I hope we never will. This Government is determined to proceed with this legislation. That is why we are debating it in this House tonight. In April 1991, when the Industrial Relations Commission knocked back the ACTU and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) on a stitched-up deal known as accord mark 6, all those on that side of the House went into spasm: They attacked the Commission and the commissioners and some quite vitriolic things were said. As I recall, Bill Kelty said that it was a sickening decision and that the trade union movement did not have to eat the vomit. That did not offend section 299 and did not bring the Industrial Relations Commission into disrepute. I maintain that, by constant attack over the past few years, the Labor Party has brought the Industrial Relations Commission into disrepute. The Govelnment, through the second part of this Bill, intends to reinforce the powers of the Commission, to give it wider scope and to bring it under further union control in.order to recentralise industrial relations in Australia. Earlier this year the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1992 come through this place. It was known as the contractor's Bill. That Bill did three things to the Industrial Relations Act. The first was to remove the public interest test from the Commission's ability to look at so-called special deals. In this new found Labor philosophy of enterprise bargaining-rhetoric on the Labor side which, I might say, was picked up from our side of the House but without the substance-the changes to the Act made under the contractor's Bill removed the public interest test. The commissioners do not have to pay any regard to what is good for Australia or good for Australians, only what is good for the union movement. I remind honourable members that only some 40 per cent of the work force in this country are represented by trade union membership. Yet we continue to add to the regulation in this Act, giving the Commission the power to deal not with the 60 per cent of individual Australians who do not belong to trade unions but with all Australians only through trade unions. We give trade unions monopolistic powers through this Bill that are available to no other Australian under any other circumstances. We have legislation to make sure that companies do not achieve monopoly status. It is only trade unions which have monopoly rights in this country. The second part of the contractors Bill dealt with contracts of employment. It said that the Commission has the right to enter into legal contracts in the community and to determine whether or not they are fair. The conditions of fairness relate entirely to whether Qr not a contract of employment offers a contractor conditions which are different than had that individual been an employee. There are many instances throughout industry where contractors provide services because they want to work in a free and cooperative environment. They want to be their own small business people-not under union control, not under the control of the Industrial Relations Commission and not as employ- of a company who must report to work at one hour and leave at another. They like being contractors. The harder they work, the more money they earn; the more hours they work, the more money they earn. They like that provision. In the housing industry in the State of Victoria, a bricklayer who works as a subcontractor to build a house can expect to receive $360 or $370 per 1,000 for laying bricks. But if that bricklayer is employed to lay bricks at a school, a hospital or a church under the so-called 'no ticket, no start' regime of the major construction industry, he lays the same brick in the same order for about $700 per 1,000. Under the provisions of the contractor's amendment to the Industrial Relations Act, if a union comes along and says, 'That bloke laying the bricks on the house is being exploited', the Commission has the right to change the contract and make the contractor who is building the house pay the bricklayer $700 per 1,000. What is the difference between the brick and the mortar? The difference is, on the one hand, a freely operating independent contractor and, on the other hand, a contractor controlled by union regulations and rules, not by any requirements of the employer. The third part of the contractors Bill said that individuals have no rights before the Commission, that the Commission is to hear and make dispute resolution decisions based on applications made by trade unions-a recognised monopoly power given further credence in legislation denying any rights to individuals to decide what is best for them or what they might want. So we create this huge bureaucracy that sets up volume after volume of rule and regulation, which attempts to prescribe working conditions, payments and all manner of how an individual shall work at a job, depending on that person's classification, as decided by the union structure. The second part of this Bill is the so-called - Attack Jeff Kennett Bill'. The new part these amendments that will come into place if the Government has its way will move Victorians under State awards to Federal jurisdiction. I think that we really ought look at the fact that Victorians went to the polls on 3 October. Victorians made decisions of their own free will and volition: elected a new government to run the State of Victoria, pass laws, make rules and make regulations for their benefit. That new Government has done that. This Bill will strip the citizens of Victoria of the rights they exercised at the election on 3 October. The provisions of this legislation give the monopoly power unions the right now to to the Federal Commission, 'Look, we want everybody who works in a particular job classification that currently falls under a State award to be under a Federal award'. The Commission now will have to take account that application, because a union has brought it. No individual can make such an apthe plication; only a union can make that apthe plication. Whether or not the employees at workplace in Victoria are happy with their lot and whether or not they follow the rules and regulations of the new legislation, and if they freely enter into a new agreement that specifies their employment conditions and their rates of pay, a union outside that workplace will have the right to go to the Federal Commission and say, 'The deal is no good because it falls out of the award structure guidelines'. It is a nonsense. Government members know it is a nonsense and I know it is a nonsense. With these amendments we want to re-regulate the industrial relations system in Australia. We talk about flexibility and we talk about individual rights. Government members talk about the need to increase productivity in workplaces in Australia, but they do not mean it. What they really want is to regulate the entire system to give the unions complete power over every workplace in every circumstance, so that everybody is treated equally. It is the Jeff Kennett Attack Bill. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has gone mad with power and is determined that there of will be no more States rights and that individuals in a State who have the audacity to vote into power a Government not of his persuasion will be dealt with immediately and to harshly. In 1901 we agreed to a Constitution of federalism. We combined the States under one central body, but left the States their They individual rights. Within this well thought out system that has worked until now reasonably well-in fact, it has worked so well that I would say that, if . anything, Australia is a model for democracy and that our system of parliament in this country could well be echoed by others around the world, if they so had the desire to say create a good flexible system. But this Government is not happy with that, because this Government does not believe in States rights. This Prime Minister believes in only one thing: one man for one job to control one of nation and everybody in it. He certainly is making that obvious through the provisions of second part of this Bill, which take away rights of Victorians,. bring them under a federal control, and make sure that unions have the monopoly rights to control the entire system. It seems to me that honourable members on the other side of the House have a great desire to take us back to Fortress Australia. We know that if we are ever going to be internationally competitive, if we are ever to have any hope of creating new jobs, we have to deregulate the labor market, not re-regulate it, not bring in new inflexible controls and more bureaucracy. They know it and I know it; we all know it.",201
298,Mr LAVARCH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,What's your margin?,204
299,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Do not worry about my margin. I will be back here, no problem. The real difference in this debate is all. about Government's deal and its mateship with trade unions. That is what it is about. It is not about a fair deal for working men and women. It is not about a fair deal or a fair wage for a fair day's work. It is all about making sure that the .unions hang onto their power, so that this Government has the financial base to allow it to run television advertising at the next election campaign. Without that financial base,. the Government is finished. Government members know that they are finished. They have no hope of explaining what poor, miserable position they might have, and it would be nice if they actually had a platform and could explain to Australians out there what they are going to do to try to get us out of this horrible recession that they caused, that they brought on, and what they are going to do about creating an environment that business and industry will have the confidence to invest in, which is the only way we are ever going to have jobs. There is not much sense, is there, in building a bigger Government bureaucracy? There is not even much sense in building a bigger trade union monopoly and bureaucracy, because we will not provide any real jobs out of it. We will not create one dot's worth of wealth. We will not make one more widget that another country wants to buy. We will not sell any more intellectual property into Asia or South East Asia,· or even into Europe. Not one dot's more of wealth will we create, not one more job will we create so long as we continue to pad the bureaucracy and pad the trade union bureaucracy as well. The Government knows it. The only way we are going to get industry to invest is if we tell industry, 'Look, you do not any longer have to live by this great raft of prescribed rules. We are going to allow you and your employees to work in a manner that can provide real productivity improvement and which will give you the confidence and the ability to compete with other countries, so that you can sell your products in other places'. If we do that, we might actually earn a few dollars worth of income and quit feeding on this debt that the Government has built up from $23 billion to the $162 billion in just a little over nine years. That is a terrific accomplishment! That is an accomplishment th- Government really ought to be proud of. Government members should stand up and tell us about how proud they are of the debt that they have createdfrom $23 billion to $162 billion in a little over nine years. The Government has done a terrific· job of creating more debt, giving us bigger interest bills to pay, and we are now looking to borrow the money on Bankcard to pay the interest, are we not? We can borrow the money. We can borrow more. We can always have more debt, but all we are doing is feeding the number of unemployed. We are not creating jobs. The Government has no idea how to create jobs. The only way we are going to get industry to invest is if industry can be competitive. Industry is not going to invest unless it can compete with companies who make the same products in the rest of the world. ' I heard the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) denigrate New Zealand. At the end of November, Douglas Myers, a leading New Zealand businessman, came to Australia. An article from the West Australian of 26 November stated: ... Douglas Myers says Australia's economic and industrial refonns are moving far too slowly-so slowly they are a decade behind his country. It continued: Unless Australia altered its present tack, it would take 10 years to catch up to New Zealand's present position. He is probably right. That country has quit examining the fluff in its belly button. It has quit navel gazing and it is now charging around the world building a new base of production, actively selling its products around the world and creating employment. By the way, its wage rates are rising in real terms while ours are falling. The Government's regulated system is denying Australians a fair wage for a fair day's work. The Government's regulations and controls have reduced the living standards of all Australians and reduced the real wages of all working men and women in this country. Today one million of them cannot find jobs. Mr Myers continued: ... the WA and Federal coalitions' radical market refonns may not go far enough. (TIme expired)",204
300,Mr LAVARCH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Fisher) (2.16 a.m.)Probably the most incisive point in this debate and why the Opposition feels so passionately about it was well summed up when the knew Government first announced the proposal which has been incorporated in the Industrial Relatipns Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992. The night it was announced a debate occurred on the 7.30 Report between the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for nelong (Mr Howard). I watched that debate very closely because it was certainly the agitated and the most upset that I had the honourable member for Bennelong in five years in this chamber. I could see in his eyes and in his face 1987 again. He believes he was robbed of becoming Prime Minister of this country in 1987 by Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his mad 'Joh for PM' push. The honourable member believes that the great madness which consumed the conservative side of politics in 1987 stopped him becoming Prime Minister. . But in 1992-93 Joh Bjelke-Petersen has been replaced by Jeffrey Kennett. It is exactly same thing. Absolute madness is occurring the conservative side of politics. honourable member for Bennelong could see it then: history was repeating itself. Throughout this term and for the vast majority of this year the conservatives have been on automatic pilot-they were going to win the election; it was just a matter·of splitting up the spoils. They would make it into office; there was no problem at all. But all of that started to change. It started slowly, but it all came to a head and their support absolutely collapsed the day that Jeff Kennett became Premier of Victoria. Why did the conservatives' support collapse? Obviously a bit of it had to do with the unsaleability of the GST package and everything which went with it-for instance, the idea that one could actually cut government expenditure and pretend that labour would improve employment at a time when we need a greater financial stimulus in this economy. Obviously it had something to do with that. But what it all boiled down to was that people perceived in Jeff Kennett the future under a Federal coalition government. They what it would be like: the conservatives want to cut people's wages and conditions. The last speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), said that it was out of the mouths of babes. What was the great example he gave in terms of proving that the system and the Government's industrial policy were wrong? He gave the example of the Benbuilding industry. He said, 'Look at the terrible, shocking difference we have here. most We have award workers getting something seen like $700 per thousand bricks and yet we my have subcontractors running around getting something like half that-$360'. He said, 'This is terrible. Here we have this terribly regulated labour market and people are actually getting $700 per thousand bricks. If we did not have it they would be getting $360'. He thought that would be a great outcome: people would be paid less. All of a sudden it has dawned on the Opposition-or perhaps it has not-that maybe the Australian people are not terribly the keen on that. They do not like the idea of on their wages being halved as in the example The given by the honourable member of the building industry. We have only to look at the earlier debates about youth wages when those opposite said, 'We will cure unemployment by cutting people's wages. We will institute this new system whereby people will be paid minimum amounts'. But maybe people not really like that. Maybe young people thought there was some value in the concept of equal pay for work of equal value and fact that people were doing this work at age 18 or 19 did not mean they should necessarily be paid less. Maybe people did not like that idea. All of a sudden the wheels started falling off and support started plummeting. The white flag went up and we had all the meetings night to go through Fightback version 2, which will be launched tomorrow. But that will not save those opposite. The honourable member for Bennelong made it perfectly clear tonight that there will be no change to the industrial relations policy; it will stay place. He will not cop any chapges to his baby. He will see it through, come hell or high water. But he has seen in Jeff Kennett 1987 again and he knows he will never be given a chance. He is really between a rock and place. Some of his rhetoric is, 'The only difference between Jeff Kennett's industrial policies and mine are a few commas, dotted i's and crossed t's'. We hear that version where he is 100 per cent behind what Jeff Kennett is doing. But at other times his rhetoric is, 'Well, I'm not really happy with some of the things Jeff has done. It's not really that ethical to go aroUnd putting out your campaign literature and speeches saying ""We're not going to cut penalty rates or abolish leave loading or force you out of the award system"" and then get into government and do the exact opposite'. The honourable member may wonder why people may look at him slightly strangely when he comeS out and says, 'Well, we're going to cut penalty rates, abolish leave loadings or force people off awards. And you get nasty employers we will set up an industrial advocate for you to go to and get some independent advice'. The people saw what Jeff Kennett said·and then they saw what he did. It is a case of: do not read my lips, watch my actions. That is what the peOple will do to the honourable member for Bennelong and the Opposition. They will base their decisions on did actions. They have seen conservative government in action in Victoria and they know the truth of the situation. They know it the is no good relying on what those opposite say, they have to watch what they do. That is why Opposition support has plummeted. People are not stupid. They know that is the end of the line. What is so wrong with our current industrial relations system? Let us go through at the outcomes and ask: where is it so wrong that we have to attack it and destroy it? Firstly, if it were a bad system we would probably have huge .numbers of industrial disputes in this country. Literally thousands and thousands of working days would be lost in because our industrial relations system is bringing about great conflict in this country. But if we look at the figures, 10 and behold, that does not occur at all-Australia has one of the lowest levels of industrial disputation. In terms of our own experience, it is the a hard lowest figure in some 30 years. So we say: maybe something else is wrong. Maybe the industrial relations system is producing wages outcomes which are driving inflation out of control in this country. Maybe we can never be competitive because of our super high inflation rate contributed to by the industrial system. But when we look at the all figures what do we find? We do not have rampant inflation in Australia. In fact, we have one of the lowest, if not the lowest, inflation rates in the OECD-in the industrial world. We can cross that one off our 'what is so wrong that we need the radical surgery proposed by the honourable member' list. Then we might say, 'Let us have a look at not the wages, the profit share', and say that maybe the system is such that it is producing if an outcome which is completely uneconomic for this country; that wages are taking too great a share and profits are taking too little a share; and that is why there is not the investment that we need. But when we look at the wages to profit share, what do we find? The levels are equivalent to those in the 19608. There is nothing wrong at all with the wages to profit share. Unlike the recession that we had in 198283, controlled by the honourable member for Bennelong and his then adviser, the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the wages to profit share was absolutely out of proportion. It was smashed because of. the outrageous wages explosion which occurred during that period. We have had no such wages explosion during this period because the Government actually does have an incomes and wages policy. So we have to cross that one off. Then we come to this question of productivity, and that is the one that the Opposition is really hanging its hat on. It is saying that our industrial relations system is stifling productivity growth in this country and locking us into unrealistic practices, which is stopping us from harnessing all our initiatives and breaking forth and becoming far more productive. The Fightback document-at least the one we have seen; mark I-gives the average productivity growth over the last decade of about 0.9 of a per cent. Those opposite say, 'That is terrible. It is far too low; we have to do a lot better than that'. Then they give their modelling of the three scenarios under Fightback: the old high road, low road and middle road. Let us be charitable to the Opposition and assume that it gets the high road scenario and everything falls into place, everything works to perfectioll and the best possible estimates are achieved. What is the actual model productivity growth in Fightback, version I? In the high road scenario it is 0.8 per cent growth in productivity-in fact, lower than the productivity growth which its own document identifies was achieved during the 1980s. So its own policy, of which industrial relations was said to be the central plank, achieves a productivity outcome lower than what the Government achieved during the 1980s. Even at the moment we are seeing very high levels of productivity growth in this economy. We have to be realistic about these things. We can all get the catch cry 'productivity growth'. But at this time productivity growth means higher unemployment because firms are getting more productivity out of their employees and are requiring fewer employees as a result. So let us cut through some of the rhetoric and understand what we are really talking about. We do need higher productivity in this country, but we understand-and we have to be honest about it-'-that that comes at a price of some higher level of unemployment than we would probably like. But that is a consequence. Let us not just talk about the good side of these things; let us also talk about the other side. Then let us talk about employment. Obviously that is the No. 1 issue facing this country. In this Parliament the Government and the Opposition should always be focusing on policies which will improve employment prospects for Australians. We should ask: is the industrial relations system in this country holding back employment growth? Is that the reason why we should be abandoning the current system and being so critical of the proposals contained in this Bill? The fact is that, although Australia obviously has tragically and unacceptably high levels of got unemployment-and we must do everything in our power to address this problem-in the Australian economy today there are approximately 1.4 million more people in the work force than there were a decade ago. That is incredible. There are 1.4 million more people in the Australian work force than there were a decade ago. The 1980s was a period of incredible employment growth in this country. Did the industrial relations system hold back employment growth in the 1980s? Were we going backwards in the size of our labour force, as occurred in New Zealand-the Opposition's model-where today there are fewer people, in the labour force than there were a decade ago? The answer to that obviously has to be no, because there are 1.4 million Australians now in employment who were not in employment back in 1983. What is the reason for all this? If we have not had high levels of disputation, if we do not have high levels of inflation, if we have an appropriate wages to profit share, if we have reasonable levels of productivity growth, if we have a system which has not held back employment growth, then what is the problem, and what is the real motive of the Opposition? Again, it was made very .clear by the honourable member for La Trobe through his example from the building industry. At the end of the day, what was being said meant that someone getting $700 under the award was terrible, and if the award were destroyed and the market deregulated the equivalent worker outside award protection would get $360 for the same job. That is the Opposition's preferred outcome. That is, slash that person's wages in half and it is a better outcome. For whom is this better outcome achieved? Is it for that person and the wages being taken home? Is it for that person's family and the people dependent on that person? I would say the answer to that is no. But maybe the people employing the workers and paying them half are getting a little more: in fact, maybe they are getting a lot more of the cake. We have to be concerned with policies that are increasing the size of the cake and not with the sterile policies of the Opposition. policies are not about creating wealth and making the cake bigger, but about giving the owners of capital a bigger slice and taking away from the providers of labour. That is the core of the matter when the rhetoric is hunted through and decoded. Essentially, the Opposition believes that Australians are paid too much. It believes that Australia is a high wage country and that it should have a wage system which pays our people far less. It hopes through that that there will be employment growth, but that is not the difficulty with the Australian economy. Everyone knows, from any basic analysis of the economy, that wages are not the problem with the Australian economy: they are not high and conditions are not unreasonable. The basic problem with our economy at the moment is low levels of demand and people not being confident to invest. The problem is nothing to do with wages, and it is nothing to do with conditions. Yet the Opposition says that the essential focus of its policies, an essential plank of its Fightback-version 1 or 2 or whatever version it finally takes to the election-is industrial relations. It is no surprise that support for the Opposition has dropped; it is no surprise that there are 100,000 people on the streets of Victoria; and it is no surprise if people do not believe what the Opposition says. People believe what they see with their own eyes: they believe the outcome, not the rhetoric. That is why the wheels have come off the Opposition's cart and why its support has gone. It is wrong if it thinks it can solve the problem tomorrow by announcing a tarted up version of the GST that takes the tax off food, rejigs a few things and gives a nice new child-care policy. If it thinks that will make it a kinder and gentler alternative in the eyes of the Australian people it is wrong, because people know that the central issue is industrial relations. They know what the outcome of the conservatives' policies will be, because they have seen the same policies in operation in Victoria, policies which mean the taking away of basic conditions and paying people less. Cut through the rhetoric, decode it, and that Its is what the message is. The fact that the cat has been let out of the bag and people have seen it means that we are going to have a repeat of 1987: the election that it was said the conservatives could not lose, that not even the Liberals could lose. But they did and they lost the following one. They are going to lose in 1993 and that knowledge can be seen on their faces now because they have come to realise it themselves. This Bill is sensible legislation. It does not take away rights but extends them to people in Victoria. It improves the system there, and speeds up a process, which has always been available, for transferring from State to Federal awards. It does nothing new; it does not force any particular course of action: it simply opens up courses of action. It is sensible legislation and it should be supported by this House.",205
301,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Gwydir) (2.35 a.m.)The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) has put before us all sorts of basically invalid reasons why the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is sible. This legislation is about as sensible logical and defensible as some of the claims he made about life under the Labor the Government in 1992. He said, for example, that if our current system were no good people, in their state of dissatisfaction, would be on strike, protesting in and unhappy. It is patently obvious that, in the recession the Government have given us, people are going to put their jobs at risk by striking. They are not going to engender industrial activity. One hundred thousand people the marched down the streets of Melbourne. Thanks to the policies of the Government, 300,000 people are unemployed in Victoria. The Kirner Government was thrown out of government by the people of Victoria. They had the good sense to realise that the policies of that Government, which were largely determined by its mates in the trade union movement, were primarily responand sible for that State's becoming what is known as a 'rust bucket State'. The honourable member for Fisher said the Labor Government has beaten inflation. Of course it has beaten inflation. It has inflation by making the economy comatose. The Labor Government has not put into place any of the necessary structural reforms which would beat inflation by the only legitimate means of controlling inflation, which is by making sure that demand does not outstrip supply. If the profit share is okay, if it has returned to the magnificent levels of the golden era when Australia was a prosperous nation, delivering high standards of living and low levels of unemployment, why are businesses going broke at the rate of a new one every half hour, taking people's dreams and prosperity and, above all, their employees' jobs with them? The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) interestingly, and I think commeneconomy. dably, admires the leadership qualities of the honourable member for. Bennelong (Mr Howard). He says that the honourable memcapable ber for Bennelong is honest and trustworthy: sentiments with which I am sure everyone senthis House would agree. However, the and honourable member for Hinkler is right when he says that the Australian people will believe honourable member for Bennelong before they will believe the gross distortions and misrepresentations pedalled by honourable members opposite in both their political and the streets, restless union garb. The misrepresentation that this legislation is about freedom is not the only thing that is not offensive in terms of the current political debate about industrial relations in this country. The misrepresentation pedalled by Government that it looks after the interests of the working men and women of this Kirner country is also offensive. The Labor Government tells us that it is the one which delivers a fair go. Honourable members opposite say that they are the people who protect the interests of the working people of this country.. They say that the coalition wants to drive down people's wages entitlements. We do not. Honourable members opposite are wrong. The coalition has made the simple observation that that that process does not work. The Government has shown us that it does not work. Under the beaten accord, that is effectively what the Government has been doing for the last 10 years, and over the last 10 years what we have seen has been a continual slide into the worse recession for 60 years. After promoting growth by the convenient mechanism of debt financing for most of that period of time, there are some economists who now believe that the Australian economy has not actually grown independently of debt financing since the early 1970s. All we have, as a result of this process, is an unbelievable foreign debt, a debt which will hang around our children's necks like a millstone. Mr Barry Jones-It's largely private.",208
302,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It does not matter who has it; it still impacts on our living standards in the same way. It reflects an inefficient It reflects a set of parameters which do not allow the Australian people to deliver the productive outcomes that they would be of in a properly constructed economic environment. We have a massive level of in unemployment, despite debt financing of growth and of jobs. The official rate of unemployment is 11.4 per cent, but that is only the official rate.",209
303,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,There are all the underemployed.,210
304,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As the respectable consultants in this country state and as the honourable member for Bennelong reminds me, if on- adds in the underemployed with the unemployed in this country then there is probably about one in five Australians who are either not employed or else not able to find as much work as they would like. This is occurring in the country where no child was going to live in poverty by 1990. We have 600,000 Australian children living in a home where neither Mum nor Dad has a job at all. Guess who will grow up living in poverty? It will be a very disproportionate number of those children. ' Then, of course, we have the horrifying statistic that in some of the outer suburbs of our major cities well over 50 per cent of our young people cannot find a job. Even those people who still have a job in this land of plenty, where in theory we have everything going for us, from fresh water to clean open skies to a well-educated people in a stable politic;al system, are being squeezed out of jobs. hi fact, it is estimated that the living standards of Australians in real terms have dropped from being in the top third of the industrialised nations scale to the bottom third in just a generation. Imagine where we will get ourselves to within another generation with this sort of economic management. That is what our current working arrangements have delivered. Honourable members opposite want to tell the Australian people-they want to perpetrate the cruel hoax-that we can continue in our current vein. This low productivity, low wage, high unemployment approach is nothing more than a cruel hoax perpetrated against the Australian people. Some honourable members opposite are beginning to sound a bit like the pigs in George Orwell's Animal Farm. While the farm falls apart and while life gets harder for everyone, except for the pigs and their mates, the pigs keep on chanting that everything is okay, that everything is getting better, and that it will all be okay in this best of all possible worlds. The Prime Minister (Me Keating) tells us that micro-economic reform is complete. He says that the job has been done; that it is finished. That is part of the gross misrepresentation of the truth in this country. If the job is complete, why is it that the OECD in a major report released just a little while ago says that our telecommunications are amongst the most inefficient in the world? Why does the report say that our shipping, our transport and our public service are only 50 per cent as efficient as like services abroad? In New Zealand it once cost something like $12 to move a tonne of newsprint across a wharf from ship to truck or truck to ship but, after reforms were introduced, it now costs $4. In Sydney it still costs the best part of $14 or $16 and in Melbourne $16 or $18. Why is that the case if we have completed the job of microeconomic reform in this country? The job is not yet done. Australian living standards, Australian levels of eIllployment, the future of Australian children will not improve until we face the reality that the job is not done and that we cannot continue to walk away from it. While we are on the subject of freedom-a common theme in the debate tonight - let me say that the ACTO is running around saying that the honourable member for Bennelong is wrong when he says that trade union membership in this country is compulsory. The ACTO's claim may be true in the narrow sense, but try to get a jobMr Bevis-If it's compulsory why are there only 40 per cent in the unions?",210
305,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The figure is less than that, but I will come to that in a moment. It is a good point. Try to get a job without a union ticket in some of our key industries that have the capacity to determine whether or not our mining, agriculture or manufacturing exports will succeed on world markets. rry to get a job on the waterfront without a union ticket. Try to get a job in a classroom without a ticket. Try to get a job' on a building site in Sydney or Melbourne without a union ticket. Compare the productivity and the efficiency of the construction industry with the largely privatised contracting arrangements that apply in the private house building sector. The private house building sector is one of the most efficient building sectors in the world, whereas the construction industry is one of the least efficient construction industry sectors in the world. If it is not compulsory to belong to a trade union and workers are able to exercise the right not to join a union, why is it that ,we have just lost $6Om or $7Om worth of export income-at a time when this country just cannot afford it-because a miner in Western Australia decided that he would like to exercise his right in a 'free' country to not belong to a trade union? And all of this is happening when just 29 per cent of the private sector work force choose to belong to a union. Whenever they have the option, they will belong to a union only if they believe it delivers. Given that choice, they will opt out unless the union is perceived to be relevant and to be working in their best interests. Why should those unions have what amounts to a protected monopoly on the right to represent workers in this country? I will tell a very interesting true story about what happened about two weeks ago. A quite senior mining official in my electorate said to me, 'I would like you to come and talk to the miners out at the place where I work'. It happens to be a very big coalmine in New South Wales. He said, 'Your policy is exactly what my mine and the people I represent need. I have had a good look at your policy, but tax changes in terms of the impact on business costs, the abolition of payroll tax, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax will have a huge and positive impact on my workplaceMr Truss-Wait until tomorrow!",210
306,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes; wait until tomorrow. Then they will really see how good it can be. He said, 'It will make a huge difference to the viability and the productivity of , my mine and to the number of jobs that can be offered in it. We have had a look at the tax cuts as well. The people I represent are on good incomes and they will take home a lot more under the arrangements that yo,u are proposing, and that looks very attractive'. He went on to say, 'Best of all, we want to be able to engage, in a workplace agreement under your policy approach; but you had better come and argue the case, because my trade union colleagues are so grossly distorting the facts for their own purposes that my members are starting to doubt what I am telling them'. There we have a union official in this country accusing his own colleagues of distorting and misrepresenting the debate. We in the Opposition have no reason to drive down, and no interest in driving down, wages and entitlements in this country. It does not work. It would serve no purpose. We have seen that it does not work, and that it is not a productive way to go about things in this country after 10 years of Labor. The Labor Party is about trying to hide that reality for just a few more weeks, in the hope of falling over the line in a race that it has no right whatsoever to win.' This legislation just continues the attempt to perpetrate the hoax, and it ought to be utterly and totally rejected for the sham that it is. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned.

307,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"At nearly 3 a.m., with a couple of other Bills still to come before the House and a number of other speakers, I will keep my remarks much briefer than I had earlier intended. I have a couple of comments to make on some of the various economic points in the debate, although 'debate' is probably too kind a word to give some of the comments. In terms of what has happened with industrial relations and disputes as the economy has improved or worsened, I am afraid the assertions of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) are flatly wrong. I suggest to the honourable member for Gwydir that he have a close look at the figures for unemployment plotted against the industrial disputes through the 1980s. He will discover that, as unemployment fell quite markedly on the election of a Labor government in 1983 and through to about 1987, industrial disputes also fell quite substantially. The assertion the Opposition makes that of there has been a record low level of industrial disputation simply because the economy has in the last year or so been in a difficult period with the recession is not borne out by an examination of the facts. Those honourable members opposite who were at pains to talk about telling the truth in some of the earlier debates might like to have a look at the SENATE figures in relation to their own assertions. A focus in this debate, quite understandably given the nature of the legislation, is what in fact the people of Victoria mayor may not have been seeking to do when the Kennett Government was elected. The Opposition has really focused on two things: freedom of choice and States rights. Under the States rights umbrella, the Opposition has referred to the people of Victoria having made a decision to elect a Kennett government with a mandate to do the things it has done . It is about time that was put to rest. During the election campaign, the Liberal party distributed a pamphlet entitled 'Your employment rights'. That pamphlet said: No person in employment will suffer any loss of award wages or conditions. The promise of the Liberals to the people of Victoria was that no person in employment would suffer any loss of award wages or conditions. They got quite explicit later in the pamphlet. It said: ... every worker who does not voluntarily enter into a contract with his or her employer will not lose a cent in salary, overtime, penalty rates or rates or any other prescribed current award entitlement. They illustrated the point quite clearly and then, a matter of days after they got into office, introduced legislation to do precisely what they promised the people of Victoria in black and white, in the literature the Liberal Party distributed, they would not do. There is absolutely no doubt at all that the Liberal Party in Victoria conducted a fraud, a deceitful campaign, on the workers of that State. Put plainly, they lied to the people of Victoria through their teeth and they did it in black and white, and they have been cimght out. For any member of the Liberal Party in this place to stand up and try to tell us that the people of Victoria voted for Kennett believing that they were going to· get the industrial relations legislation he put in place is a nonsense. They know it and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) knows it. He was embarrassed by it the week after Kennett introduced the legislation and it is about time he stopped having a memory lapse or a bit of time warp activity and realised that we will not let him forget it. The people of Victoria certainly will not forget it. The other thing that has come out very clearly in the last month or so. is that people throughout the rest of Australia understand that pretty well too. Whether the honourable member for Bennelong likes it or not, he has the bell of Jeff Kennett around his neck and it is going to stay there right through until the election and after. I want to say a couple of quick things about the Liberal Party's policy on freedoms. We have had an excellent contribution tonight by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) on these issues. The OppOsition has made a big play about people's right to choose. The example of the bricklayer, referred to by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and expanded on by the honourable member for Fisher, quite clearly illustrates the point. This freedom of choice which the Liberal Party champions as the focus of its industrial relations policy is a freedom to reduce conditions of employment, to say to that bricklayer who works on a shift construction site, 'You are being denied the freedom to cut your salary in half and we are going to give you that freedom'. That is the Liberal Party's promise to those building workers fu Victoria. That is the example the honourable member for La Trobe gave when he . and the honourable member for Fisher were pursuing that point. There is no doubt that the freedom that the Opposition talks about in industrial relations is a freedom to reduce conditions of employment, because all other·freedoms exist now. The fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition in industrial relations boils down to a couple of things. We support and enshrine a safety net for all Australians irrespective of where they work, irrespective of what State they may live in and irrespective of what industry they may work in. We also enshrine the right of every worker in this country to have access to an umpire to settle disputes. Those two fundamental rights we will continue to enshrine as a Labor Party in this place and as a labour movement. Neither of them are supported by the Opposition in its policies. Both of them are dear to the hearts of all Australians. They have been fundamental not just to industrial relations butto the way of life in this - ountry since 1904, and the Opposition's efforts to remove them will rebound savagely upon it at the election in 1993. In view of the time, I will leave my comments at that. I thank the House.",212
308,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish to associate myself with this legislation before the House tonight because of its importance to the working men and women of Australia. It is a shame that this has happen but, when one looks at what is happening in Victoria, the Federal Government has taken a responsible action in pursuing this sort of legislation. It really concerns me that the Victorian Government's industrial relations legislation amounts to the greatest attack on basic trade union rights in Australia in over 100 years, as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) reminded us earlier. There have been a number of Queenslanders speaking on this Bill this morning. We all lived through the Bjelke-Petersen era, and the thing that comes to my mind is the great SEQEB dispute in 1985; I see similarities between that situation and the Victorian one. The legislation that the Victorian Government is putting forward is the same sort of stuff that Bjelke-Petersen put forward all the time. I do not know how the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) can get up and talk about freedom. They told us that we are trying to take people's rights away. But this is all about all about people being guaranteed minimum standards, minimum wages and equal payfor instance, we need to achieve equal pay for women, and there is a lot of work still to be done in that area, as well as with unfair dismissals and fair redundancy payments. They are basic standards that we, as a responsible member of the international community, have to uphold in this country. That is what it is all about. It is amazing that those opposite have the audacity to get up here and oppose this sort of legislation, when one thinks that they have obviously no commitment to the average worker in this country. I would have liked much more time to say a few more things about the legislation, but I just offer my full support for it and ask those opposite to have a really good think about what they are putting forward here. They are having a reshape of their Fightback package. .We are guaranteed here, by the honourable member for Bennelong, that there will not be any changes to the industrial relations package. The Opposition's industrial relations package is modelled on the Kennett had to model. The honourable member for Bennelong has made that admission. He has tried to skirt around the issue tonight, but he still comes back to the fact that his industrial relations package is modelled on the Kennett model. It would be bad news for every Australian worker if those opposite were ever to have the opportunity to implement such policies. But Australians are smarter than that and they certainly will not let the Opposition do that. I am very pleased to rise here to support this legislation and I commend it to the House.",214
309,Mr FERGUSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As with the two previous speakers, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), I will have to be very brief. A few matters have to be very quickly dealt with. Firstly, there has been the usual rhetoric from those opposite about the question of States rights-that there is a great attack on the constitutional foundations of the country. On that point, it is worth reading page 6 of the Opposition's document Jobsback/, where it choice. It is clearly makes this point: A future Coalition government will seek complementary legislative action from state and territory governments to achieve the objectives of this policy. It will, if necessary, use whatever constitutional power is available to it, excluding the external affairs powerMr Anderson-Excluding!",214
310,Mr FERGUSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Excluding that power alone. The document continues: . . . to ensure that the benefits of this policy are as widely available as possible to Australians. When we dismiss all this rhetoric here tonight about it being so dreadful that we are interfering with Victorians' rights, the reality is that the Opposition's industrial relations policy clearly articulates the intention to go down that same road. The other point that is well worth making is that this is not a departure from the Constitution's current practice. The Federal Industrial Relations Commission clearly already has this power. Until now, the Federal Government has chosen to restrict that power. It is simply implementing that power now because a clear intention of the legislation is that people should have the right to compulsory arbitration. That being departed from in Victoria, the Government is simply implementing the intentions of the Federal industrial relations legislation. I was interested in the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) coming forward with quotes from a rather self-interested source-I gather he is probably a member of the New Zealand round table-some businessman who said, 'The Australian industrial relations system has not exploited its workers quickly enough'. I am not as interested in that remark as in some remarks made on the matter of common law. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) .came in here again and said how dreadful it was that the Labor Government also utilised common law against the airline pilots strike. That might actually be correct I will cite a few more worthwhile comments in regard to common law and its clear use against workers. William Holdsworth--people who were far more successful at law school than I might have heard of him-in his book History of English Law, 1924 edition, said: In truth until political economists of the earlier half of the nineteenth century converted the legislature to the belief that freedom of contract was the cure for all social ills, no one ever imagined that wages and prices could be settled merely at the will and pleasure of the parties to each particular bargain; or that the contract between employer and workman could be regarded as precisely similar to any other contract. . In other words, the political dominant group in the nineteenth century suddenly decided that there had been a glorious history of freedom of contract up until then. Finally, I quote another source on the question of the matter of this law. Sir Ian Gilmour, a Minister in the Thatcher Government, admittedly on the liberal wing of that Government, in a very interesting book I read· this year titled Riots. Risings and Revolutions, had this to say: The greater unity of the ruling elite after midcentury and the new ideas of laissez-faire led government and Parliament to abandon any semblance of neutrality between masters and men and to take an increasingly stem view of industrial unrest. Laissez-faire was becoming the dominant dogma, and the duty to protect the weak was neglected ... Following Adam Smith when it suited and ignoring him when it did not. Parliament embraced the fiction that 'free contract' existed between a powerful employer and a poverty stricken workman, and nothing else was needed. There is a very interesting quote from a Minister of the Thatcher Government about the actual history of how this law developed. And that is the reality of what those opposite are trying to indulge in now-suppressing wages, suppressing conditions and diminishing people's working rights. As the honourable member for La Trobe said, this represents a tremendous opportunity to have the wages of people in the building industry and no doubt to have those on even worse conditions.",214
311,Mr RONALDSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Ballarat) (3.06 a.m.)I will speak briefly tonight If I for one minute thought that this debate was really about the rights of workers or about the concern of the Labor Party for the wages and conditions of workers, I probably would not have stood up tonight. The simple fact is that this whole debate is about protecting the privileged position of a very few people. That is really what it is all a1;>out. It is quite obvious to me from what we have seen over the last 10 years in this country that the trade union leadership could not give a tinker's curse about what happens to the workers on the factory floor. They have absolutely no interest' in and no concern about what happens to them; they are about protecting privilege, about protecting their own position. If they were really serious about the men and women of this country who simply want to get a job, who simply want to be in a position where they can properly provide for their families, where they can give their children a better standard of education than they had and they can put a roof over their heads, if they were really serious about delivering those three basic things that every man and woman in this country is desirous of, no matter where they are from, what their background is or what their employment or potential employment is, they would start addressing the very issues that the Federal coalition is about. The Federal coalition recognises the provisions relationship between employees and come employers, and that is a very special relationcountry, ship. It is not a relationship that in my view can be slammed here hour after hour, day after day, week after week by members of Labor Party. I think it is absolutely deplorable that they can stand here and put this division between two groups of people that have made this country work. Only under Labor Party over the last 10 years has that system failed, and that system has failed because it does not recognise that special relationship. It has sought to drive a wedge into that special relationship. If certain members of the Labor Party bothered to go out to factories and bothered to speak to employers and employees and bothered to have a look at what has happened historically before they started dividing this months. country, they would find that that very special relationship just happened to deliver a great number of things. It just happened to deliver productivity, it just happened to deliver and real wages and it just happened to deliver proper workplace agreements and a relationthe ship within the workplace. Most importantly, it happened to deliver jobs. That is what it delivered. That special relationship jobs, and the simple fact is that what we have seen over the last 10 years is the destruction of that ability to create jobs through that special relationship. Dr Theopbanous-What are you talking about?",215
312,Mr RONALDSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member member for Calwell interjects with a comment like that. That is the very thing I am talking about. I sometimes wonder whether deep better down there might not be some glee for honourable members opposite in the million unemployed. Perhaps they are getting has something out of this. Perhaps in the back their mind honourable members opposite but think there may be some advantage in a million people out of work. If that is what the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and his colleagues - they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. Why does the Government not recognise that relationship? Why does it not put in place to allow that relationship again to through industrial relations in this so that we can start delivering jobs and the standard of living that used to exist Under that special relationship? Honourable the members opposite essentially should follow what we are doing. They should not give me great this hogwash about Victoria. How dare honourable members opposite the mention Victoria in this House. How dare they mention a State that was devastated by the Victorian Labor Party. If honourable members opposite are worried about what is happening in Victoria, if they are worried about the tough decisions that are being made there, they should look at the state the State of Victoria was left in by their State ALP colleagues. They will see why som- of the decisions had to be made over the last two What really annoys me about what is happening in Victoria at the moment is that the new Government has absolutely no choice good but to make some pretty tough decisions because of the ineptitude of the people whom Australian Labor Party stood there and supported for 10 years. Let us get back to reality with regard to industrial relations in delivered this great country.",216
313,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made several comments tonight. He said that his policy had been misrepresented and that he wanted a genuine debate. I am quite happy for the honourable for Bennelong to have a genuine debate. The reality is that the more people who understand what this policy is about, the it is going to be, because we know how similar that policy is to the policy of the Kennett Government. The honourable member said tonight that it is slightly different of from the policy of the Kennett Government, he is also on record as saying that it is having about 80 to 90 per cent similar. No sensible worker in this country is going to support the policy that the honourable member for Bennelong has put forward. We only have a sketchy outline of it. The honourable member promised to deliver a draft Bill of this policy to the Parliament. We have not seen that draft Bill. There is a very important reason why we have not seen that draft Bill. We have had a contribution from three honourable members opposite on the very simple question of whether what is involved here involves a massive reduction in wages. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) afftrmed that. That is right. That is what it is going to be. There will be big cuts in wages. The construction industry was given as an example. Then the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said that there are not going to be any cuts in wages and that, in fact, there are going to be improvements in wages. What nonsense. The honourable member for Bennelong was trying to have five bob each way. He said that if a worker negotiated a reduction in his wages, or a reduction in his holiday leave, so be it. How is a working man going to negotiate with a big employer, especially in the current economic context, anything but a reduction in his wages and conditions? The honourable member's policy only allows a working man freedom to go into a reduced situation. This has been proven by the actions of the Kennett Government. I will conclude with this example. One of the first acts of the Kennett Government was to sack 4,000 school cleaners; After it sacked those school cleaners that were earning roughly $400 a week-not exactly a huge pay-it told them they could all be re-employed on an individual contract for $250 a week. Two hundred and fifty dollars a weeki That is the sort of industrial relations thuggery we are getting out of Mr Kennett. In addition to that we have had 4,000 to 7,000 other people sacked by Mr Kennett. This is his idea of helping to resolve Victoria's problems. Of course, Victoria had problems, but what Mr Kennett has been doing in industrial relations and in every other Grace, E. L. * area is making those problems much worse. The reality is that honourable members opposite have identified the Liberal Party and the Opposition parties here with that policy, and we are going to go to the election with that identification. Honourable members opposite might try to run away from it by saying there are small differences, but the people of Australia will be offered a very clear choice in industrial relations. They will be asking themselves whether they want to go begging to their employer, who will be in a position to tell them that they can have half the salary that they had before as well as a whole lot of condition changes. We know that there are cases of this kind already, so nobody is going to be better off with the proposals put forward by the Opposition.· The workers of this country-including those middle-class workers who previously thought about voting for the Liberal Party-are going to say that they do not want a bar of this system. That is why they are deserting the Opposition in droves. So this next election is going to be fought very much on this industrial relations policy. I can assure everyone, as several members have said earlier, it is going to be another loss led by John Howard. Question put: That the Bill be now read a second time. The House divided.

NA Long Term Strategies·Committee Report: Government Response Debate resumed from 16 December, on motion by Mr Smith: That the House take note of the paper.",216
314,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMITTEES,"Lalor) (3.28 a.m.)This is the last item on the Notice Paper on the last day of sitting for 1992 and what could be the last sitting day for the thirtysixth House of Representatives. The length of my speech will acknowledge the lateness of the hour and will be in inverse proportion to the importance of the subject. The subject is the Government's response to the first report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies entitled Australia as an information society: grasping new paradigms. The report was tabled in June 1991 and the response has been a very long time coming-probably a record. Nevertheless, the wait has proved to be worthwhile. Despite an occasional timidity and over anxiety in parts of the report, the Government has adopted the main thrust, the seven main conclusions set out on page xiii. In referring the 21 specific re<;ommendations to individual Ministers for action, the Government accepts the broad validity of the thrust of the Committee's argument and the need to come to grips with redefining 'iriformation"" while recognising that adoption of the terms set out in the report will obviously· be a matter of evolving community usage (ather than NA government decision. There is recognition that we are passing through an information revolution with a new social and economic paradigm-the information society. The report recommended the adoption of a national information policy, a set of broad principles governing access to information and recognising that the right to know is central to a democratic community, the divisions between the information rich and informatfon poor can be socially and cultural divisive, and that Australia should maximise the return from its heavy investment in information-research, teaching, communications, banking, insurance and related activities. The Government response acknowledges . that no broad operating principles in information appear to have been committed to paper. The response concedes that there is value in redefining such a policy as a broad set of operating principles-the rules of the road-indicating objectives, using agreed definitions and using it as an instrument for encouraging debate, while noting that rigidity could be counterproductive in an area marked by constant change. The response suggests that information policy, however defined, should be referred to an interdepartmental committee or to the science and engineering council of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for further work and advice. I hope the Government will press on with this, and take it seriously and urgently. The Committee found that Australia was already an information society in which 42 per cent of the Australian labour force was employed in the collecting, processing and dissemination of information, broadly defined, including not only all the people who work in this building but also lawyers, teachers, servants, journalists, bankers, scientists, librarians, communication workers, accountants, and the like. We also concluded that Australia was an information society of the passive variety. We had ignored the policy implication and overlooked the economic implications for using information more effectively. Indeed, we often confused information-that is, the content-with information technology, or IT, the medium. The report is a short one but of major importance about a vital, but inadequately discussed, issue. What we have in Australia at the moment is not so much an industrial society in decay, relying on traditional interventionist measures to restore it, but an information society which is under-perforining, and with a largely unrecognised potential. This report can help us grasp the essential reality. We conclude that the failure to develop a coherent response on information policy was due to the extraordinary degree of fragmentation within government in this area and that all the relevant departments, about a dozen of them, tended to define information in different ways. The Government response cautiously concedes the validity of this assertion and the 18-month delay confirms our point. Meanwhile, elsewhere the importance of information policy issues is increasingly apparent. Vice-President elect Gore raised it in the US election. The OECD is working on it and economic theoreticians, looking for a new theoretical model to explain what happened in the global economy in the 1980s, are increasingly emphasising the critical factor of information and are now defining it with capital and labour as a factor of production. Attempts to put information on the political and economic agenda were defeated in 1986, but the Government now accepts that, for a clever country to succeed in a context of global competition, far more emphasis will have to be put on our use of information. We must now accept that information policy and industry policy are inextricably linked. This is an area where the Australian Government public has lagged behind the States. Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland have all set up important committees on information policy, and Victoria made a major submission to the parliamentary inquiry. The Commonwealth must now take the lead. I am happy with the response. I regret the time lost since 1986, but it is not too late because Australia, with its strong research base, information infrastructure and use of the English language, is well positioned to take advantage of the information revolution. I thank the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) for his support and feel confident that he will push to ensure that the policy recommendations are followed up speedily.

319,Mr LLOYD,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"Honourable members want me to table my speech as well, do they? Mr Beazley interjecting",220
320,Mr LLOYD,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"At this hour of the morning, it probably would be far more sensible to do that, but I will speak, nevertheless. I will speak on the Imported Food Control Bill 1992, because it is very significant legislation for the food industry of Australia. Its purpose, as I am sure the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) would have said in his second reading speech-if he had delivered it-is to ensure that the same standards apply for imported food as for domestic food. I question whether the initial implementation strategy will completely meet that aim of having exactly the same standards. Even when that standard is achieved, the standards we will be requiring of food imported into this country will be less than many countries require of food that we export to those countries. I congratulate the Minister for his achievement, because this legislation has been a long time coming in this country. The reason for that delay has been that the food standards power is a Stale power or responsibility, and while we have had separate standards for each of the States, it has been impossible to have a uniform standard which 1992 we could apply against imports. I have been in this place for about 20 years, and in that time we have been debating, on and off, this particular requirement. I believe that one can go back many, many years before that, as I was told that the first attempt to bring uniform standards for food to Australia was a national standard in 1939. So it has been a long time. It was in the late 1970s, when the Federal coalition was in power, that the essential and necessary Federal legislation was passed. It took the States a number of years after that to pass the necessary State legislation. When that occurred by the mid-1980s, the Government established the National Food Authority. It then became necessary, if any progress was to be made, for a majority decision to be required rather than a complete consensus of the States. In the second reading speech that the Minister tabled, he indicated that the inspection of imported food began only in July 1990 at the national level, so that is a very recent situation. Mr Beazley interjecting",220
321,Mr LLOYD,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"I do not think that I should give the honourable member the benefit of that, since he is the cause for our being here at this hour. As far as I am concerned, we will be proceeding with this legislation and this debate. When this inspection commenced in July 1990, it was on the very narrow basis of the powers in the Quarantine Act where, for example, inspection could take place for listeria in soft cheese, a bacteria which each year kills many people around the world. However, with a substanc- such as· ascorbic acid-a preservative which cheese producers in a number of other countries are able to use, but which Australian cheese producers are not-this legislation could not be used. There is also the question of lead in soldered cans and the problems that that creates for food standards, particularly when food canned in Australia is required to be in welded cans. A recent study in Victoria showed that up to 60 per cent of imported food failed our packaging, labelling or health standard requirements. Another part of the legislation will allow the negotiation of certification arrangements with other countries to sensibly reduce the .inspection costs and compliance requirements or costs. Other countries require far more so forth. significant procedures to apply to many of our products than we require for theirs. lam particularly thinking of the absurd reas quirements of the European Community with regard to the abattoir standards in this country. The European Community is basicallabelling ly using this as a means to force Australia completely out of a very restricted access meat to those countries. The United States also has very tough requirements. It sends its USDA people to Australia to check abattoir standards here. my area of northern Victoria, fruit growers who want to export fresh fruit to the United States are required to pay for a USDAabout United States Department of Agricultureexporter to be resident in the Goulburn Valley for a time each year, so that access can be gained to that market. The point I am making is that the requirement costs for our exporters to many other countries are still far tougher than what will be required here. There are·also some very important related issues with this legislation, and this new procedure. The first of these is the cost inspection. It is a user pays system, as it should be. We will still be using AQIS lead poisoning. inspectors to inspect our export products. There have already been complaints from food importers-there are continual understand complaints from our exporters-that the cost of that inspection is too high. I agree, it high. The ,AQIS has a top-heavy adZealand ministration and that is loaded into the total cost. Take the case of meat inspectors: earn $30,000 to $35,000, but they are charged out at a rate of over $75,000 to cover that top-heavy situation . Mr Tim Fischer-A disgrace.",220
322,Mr LLOYD,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"I note the point of my Leader that this presents a very heavy unfair burden on our exporters. There are already complaints from importers and will be addressing that, when we are in government, to bring those costs down. There is also a problem with the gap in the labelling of bulk meat into this country. I think it was an oversight when meat was not included in the provisions that were established for the labelling of fish, fruit, vegetables, juice and The pig industry and the chicken meat industry are now very concerned with this gap it provides an unfair advantage for imported pig meat and chicken meat. Those products can come in until such time as that requirement is changed and, as I understand it, that procedure is under way. for There is also a threat there for consumers in Australia because they will not be given the safeguard or the information as to whether that meat is a product of Al-stralia or whether In it comes from some other country. The Minister, if he is replying at the end of this debate, might like to make some comment the state of that particular situation. Mr Hulls-It's in his speech.",221
323,Mr LLOYD,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"I have read his speech and, unfortunately, it is not in it. We still have the problem of incorrect and inadequate labelling. In order for the Australian consumer to know whether a product is Australian, the product must be adequately and accurately labelled. Another issue relates to standards of packaging and imported food. Cans, particularly of the older style and lower grade ones which some countries sell to this country, can cause If the Minister is replying, i: would like him to comment on New Zealand compliance. I that discussions and debates on that issue are taking place at present. I is too strongly support the requirement for New to meet the same standards as Australia. I have been told by people in the they dairy industry of the advantage that New Zealand has in being able to use ascorbic acid, which is banned in Australia because of its potential cancer forming properties, as a preservative. This leads to the general issue of imported and food versus exported food, particularly processed food. Last year the total amount of we our imported food and beverages was about $2.3 billion. About half of that amount was spent on beverages and types of foods that are not available in this country; therefore, they are imported and always will be. In respect of the other half of that amount, the figure is increasing. According to a recent release by the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Ltd, imported food and beverages increased dramatically by 21 per cent in the September quarter. That is the most significant increase that we have had in many years, which indicates the growing import bill for things such as dairy products, confectionery, apple juice and a range of other products. It means that Australia is in a very delicate position present as to whether or not the export of processed food will increase at a faster rate than the imports. It is quite certain that imports will increase, particularly from New Zealand, due to the GST reforms and labour market reforms. Mr Snowdon-Ha, Ha!",221
324,Mr LLOYD,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"This is no laughing matter, particularly in my area, which happens to have more food processing factories than any other place in Australia. New Zealand now .has a 30 per cent cost advantage in putting products through its factories and canneries. That is a tremendous advantage. In relation to abattoirs, New Zealand can now slaughter an animal-a steer or a sheep-for 50 per cent of the cost of slaughtering a similar animal in Australia because of its reforms. That country has a tremendous competitive advantage. Our exports should be growing at a significantly faster rate than our imports. But we have the problem of other countries not being able to access processed Australian foods. At last, a number of Asian countries are, to a greater degree, starting to open up their markets for these types of products. lack., nowledge that there are problems with some commodities at the farm leve1. I think of the progress that has been made in relation to processing tomatoes, particularly in my area. We are able to produce that product at· the same price as California or New Zealand can. We still have some distance to go before our potato industry is as efficient as that of the Canadians. Beyond the farm gate, there are great problems. We lose competitiveness once a product moves into the transport system, the processing chain, the cannery or whatever it may be and then on to the wharf. There is plenty of documentation to prove this. The first Eoston report was released about 12 months ago. Far more recently, the Meat Research Corporation released data which showed that it is now three times as expensive to slaughter a steer in Australia as it is in the United States and that it is twice as expensive to slaughter a steer in Australia as it is in New Zealand or Argentina. How can we compete when our beef producers receive at considerably less than their counterparts for the same animal because of the loss and inefficiency once that animal leaves the farm? The final point, and this is one that the food industries are very much aware of in Australia, is the hidden advantage for countries which have a goods and services tax or a value added tax system, because that removes the hidden export tax which all of our exporters pay at the present time. Treasury has indicated that that is equivalent to about a 5 per cent tax on all of our production costs, and it is removed under a GST system because exports are zero rated. New Zealanders in particular now have a considerable advantage in selling to Australia, and it is one of the reasons why New Zealand will be such a formidable competitor in the Australian market, as well as in third markets, against Australian product in the years ahead. We have to embark upon a similar reform process through a GST system and through labour market reforms, transport reforms, waterfront reforms, et cetera, so that our food producers and processors can compete equally, competitively and profitably with New Zealand and other countries to gain more exports for our products and compete more adequately in the Australian market. The coalition parties support the legislation as it is very timely and important for this country, even if the hour at which it is being debated is not at all timely.",222
325,Mrs JAKOBSEN,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"I shall take a note out of the speech tabled by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and make a very short contribution to this debate. I would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing the Imported Food Control Bil11992 into the House. It is overdue in the sense that consumers in this country have for quite a long time been asking for security on the quality and safety of food produce being imported into the country. AQIS has done an excellent job in vetting produce to date, but this will be now a much more unifonn approach to the inspection of food products coming into Australia. I believe that the contents of this Bill and the changes that it proposes will be welcomed by consumers in Australia. It should be welcomed by industry, and it deserves the support of this House.",222
326,Mrs BAILEY,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"I am aware that the hour is approaching 4 a.m. I will not delay the House unduly, but there are some matters which I would like to speak about on the Imported Food Control Bill 1992. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has said, the coalition supports this Bill, but there are just a couple of matters that I want to bring to the attention of this House. One of the main provisions of this Bill says that the applicable standard is defined by clause 3(1) to mean the national standard applying to particular food or a particular matter affecting food. I think it is a pity that this legislation has been rushed before the House because the standards that are going to apply to this Bill have not yet been determined. In fact, the National Food Authority has only just recently produced its draft report, a 360-page document. It is calling for submissions to be made, and people will have until 29 January next year to make comment on this report. In other words, we are actually being asked to vote on legislation in this place based on standards which have yet to be decided. I think that that is wrong and I think it is a terrible pity. We .do not know whether we are talking about a mandatory standard, a voluntary standard or a combination of both. We do not even know what sort of code we are talking about in relation to this standard. Under this legislation, will labelling provisions be adequate? Will they include ingredient labelling, additive labelling, country of origin labelling, the labelling of unpackaged foods, date marking, nutrition labelling, health claims, food production and processes? What sorts of potentially misleading terms will be addressed in these standards? I do not want to miss the opportunity of mentioning in the House that this legislation is based on standards that have yet to be determined. As I said, I think that is a pity and I think it is wrong. I also draw attention to another area of concern, to which the honourable member for Murray has already alluded: the cost of inspection by AQIS. It is all very well to talk about the efficiency and the increased role, but the cost of the charges is excessive. That cost can be borne by only one group of people: the Australian consumers. There is no getting away from that, and this legislation does not deal with that adequately. The third concern that I want to raise this morning relates to whether a statutory marketing board will be fonned as a result of this. Page 75 of the National Food Authority draft report states: . . . some food industry sectors have statutory marketing boards established which regulate the bulk sale of the commodity. Such laws do not impact on food standards provided they only seek to regulate such bulk sale. Statutory marketing boards may also play a role in relation to quality by requiring that commodities be of a certain grade or be classified into a variety of grades prior to sale. I place finnly on the record that I am totally opposed to the introduction of a statutory marketing board. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for building yet another level of bureaucracy. It is another effort at empire building. While this legislation does address very real concerns in this area-as I have said, the coalition is certainly supporting this legislation-there are aspects raised by this National Food Authority draft report which should have been addressed prior to this legislation ever reaching this place.",223
327,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"I would also like to welcome the arrival of this legislation into the Parliament, even though it is at this hour. There certainly has been a great deal of public agitation due to the belief that we should have had appropriate inspection mechanisms for imported food a long time ago. Whilst this legislation has its defects and inadequacies, at least it is a welcome step in that direction. In my maiden speech in this Parliament, I called for action in this particular area. Whilst I am not taking the credit single-handedly for the arrival of this legislation, I say that, as the Parliament draws to an end, I am pleased that at least one of the things that I felt needed to happen when I first came into this House is finally coming to fruition. There is no doubt that for a long time Australian food producers have been disadvantaged because their products have had to meet standards and health requirements that imported food products have not. That is a competitive disadvantage and it is also clearly unfair. It is bad enough that Australian food producers have to compete with imported products that are subsidised and dumped, but when we also have different standards our industry is put at a significant disadvantage. The amount of food imports into Australia has increased dramatically under this Government. Last year $2.36 billion worth of food was imported. This once wonderfully productive country that could grow everything Australians needed has been so destroyed, its infrastructure so damaged, its confidence so shot that we are now finding it necessary to import the basic things that we eat from day to day. I think that is very much to the Government's shame. Some of this food coming into Australia is of poor standard, perhaps with chemical contamination that is not acceptable in this country, produced by food processing standards that are not acceptable in this country, coming in, for instance, in lead-soldered cans which are banned for Australian food. The fact that these sorts of substandard practices occur is also a consumer issue. Australian corisumers have a right to expect that the food they buy in the supermarkets meets reasonable standards, and they particularly have that right to that kind of expectation when they know that high standards are expected in Australian factories, on Australian farms and in the Australian production system. So it is important for Australian consumers that they have some confidence that what they are buying is of good quality. There is the classic story that is repeated of the dried apricots that were imported into this country but then could not be re-exported because, although they met our import standards, they did not meet our export standards. That is the kind of double-talk nonsense that has made this whole matter one of public concern. Some concern was raised by previous speakers about the cost of the inspection system, and clearly there will be costs, particularly when AQIS is involved. Its record of charging is infamous. I suppose again there is some element of justice here in that at least the imported food will now have to wear the same unjust penalties, the same unjust AQIS charges, that domestic food producers have had to meet. But that is not really satisfactory. It is high time that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) came to grips with the outrageous costs of AQIS. I raised some of these issues in· this House a few weeks ago and my comments were reported in the South Burnett Times. The Minister, being an avid reader of the South Burnett Times, rushed off a letter to the editor complaining about what I said. In it he basically defended the charges of AQIS and said that the cost is expected to fall by one per cent in the next financial year. The obvious question we ask is: if the costs are falling, why do the charges keep going up, in' fact going up by several hundred per cent? There has been outrage throughout the Australian exporting community at the appalling cost increases-costs of thousands of dollars a day, even tens of thousarids of dollars a day, for AQIS inspection charges, which clearly cannot be justified. So it is not good enough for the Minister to just say, 'Well, we are getting better' or, 'We have reached satisfactory standards'. AQIS is still charging rates which are clearly unacceptable. AQIS must come to grips with the kinds of costs that it is imposing on Australian exporters. This Bill provides inspection· charges now for imports. It evens the equation, but that ishardly a fair mathematical result. The Bill is certainly a move in the right direction. It is great to see that Australian consumers will have the protection of some kind of inspection standards not only on domestically often produced food but now also on imported products.",223
328,Mr RIGGALL,IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL,"At this late hour, I will not take very long. I a couple of important things to add to the debate on the Imported Food Control Bill and, despite being drowsy, honourable members opposite might listen and learn something. I congratulate the Government on bringing in a Bill on food standards. The $2.36m billion worth of food that comes into this country will be subject to the national food standard, which is a welcome move, though long overdue. We might at last start to getdreadful term-a level playing field in the way that we test food. It has been an outrageous situation that. until now imported food has not been required to meet anything like the standards we apply to Australian food. The other issue that needs to be looked atit is an extension of this-is what to do with our own manufacturers when it comes to testing food standards. We not only test the food, but we put rigorous standards on how factories should be built, how much stainless steel ought to go into them and so on. We totally bureaucratise private enterprise in the production of food. This is an outrageous situation that adds imposts to our manufacturers without creating one productivity gain. The only test that we should have for our local producers is the standard by which food is produced. If the end product meets the standard, it should not be of any interest to government how it got there. It seems quite a nonsense that we allow State government bureaucrats to go around and do nothing but interfere with the efficiency of production. That is a' matter that ought to be taken up. I am also quite concerned about how our food reaches the supermarket shelves. The purchasing very much favours imports against local production, especially small local producers. I think honourable members in this place ought to be aware of the system of purchasing by supermarkets. Supermarkets charge for shelf space. The net effect is that small local producers do not get the opportunity of putting their produce onto their local supermarket shelves. One of my manufacturers was charged up to $4,000 to put one line on a supermarket shelf, and every line after that was going to have cost him another $4,000. Over and above that, there was some 17112 per cent in other charges-a 5 per cent case allowance, a 5 per cent warehouse allowance, a 2 per cent ranging allowance and a 5 per cent cooperative allowance. These were all charges that were built into the system. Because essentially of laziness and the monopoly situation that our major supermarkets find themselves in, Australian small manufacturers are not getting their produce onto the supermarket shelves. This is an outrageous situation. I call on the supermarkets to have a look at this situation. It falls into one of two areas. It is either a restrictive trade practice, in which case it ought to be outlawed-the Minister responsible, who is not in the House at the moment, ought to have a look to see whether this is restrictive trade practices at their worse-or it is just straight lazy purchasing habits by the supermarket chains. It is extremely serious and it is stopping small cottage industries getting a start. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. , Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Griffiths) read a third time.

329,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (4.12 a.m.)....:.I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill makes amendments to 11 Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio. Most of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent a fine tuning and clarification of provisions of various Acts administered within the portfolio. The amendments do not introduce substantial new policy schemes, although some of the amendments introduce minor policy initiatives. I will not deal with the minor technical amendments in this speech, but will instead concentrate on each of the more significant amendments in turn. Amendments of the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 The establishment of the National Rail.Corporation (NR), to ,trade as National Rail, will involve a fundamental change in the role of the Australian National Railways Commission (AN). Since the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the former South Australian Railways in 1978, AN has been responsible for a major transformation of rail services. It has changed from an organisation operating a variety of freight and passenger services throughout rural South Australia, much of which was unsuited to rail, to one with a strong focus on long distance, high volume interstate freight and bulk traffics where rail's strength in the marketplace lies. There is, however, a limit to how far AN could go to solve the problems of the rail industry in Australia today. Our legacy from the past has resulted in a disjointed approach to interstate rail freight which has meant that in the interstate market, where rail should be doing well, it is losing ground. What is required is a single organisation which would enable shippers to have their goods transported between Australia's major cities efficiently and reliably. This has been emphasised time and time again by the transport users. To meet this need, the heads of government of the Commonwealth and mainland States agreed in July 1991 to establish NR, to take responsibility for interstate rail freight from the existing systems over the next few years. The National Rail Corporation Agreement Act 1992 approves this agreement, called the Shareholders' Agreement. As over 60 per cent of AN's current activities are related to interstate freight operations, in time, AN will become responsible for a much more limited range of operations, focussing on interstate passengers, intrastate freight in South Australia and Tasmania and workshops. The protections under the South Australian Railway Transfer Agreement will be observed. The Shareholders' Agreement provides for the transfer over time of certain functions and assets from AN and the State rail authorities to NR once NR has been established. However, the obligation to ensure that the transfers occur lies with governments, which are required to 'cause' them to take place; the Agreement places no obligations directly on the rail authorities in this matter. This amendment to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 will put beyond doubt the Commonwealth's ability to meet its obligations under the Shareholders' Agreement. The establishment of NR will require AN's full cooperation and is likely to require of AN actions which it considers are not in its own commercial interests and therefore contrary to its obligations under section 18 of the ANRC Act. The proposed amendments remove any potential for cooperation to be inconsistent with the requirements imposed on AN by its existing legislation. Amendments of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 The Bill amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act to allow the ABC to carry corporate sponsorship and promotional material on its new international satellite service to South East Asia. The service will initially be provided on a free to air basis to enable the ABC to develop an audience. It will convert to an encrypted signal after the first one to two years, drawing income partly from subscriptions and partly from paid sponsorship announcements and promotional programming. There will be no spot promotional commercials carried on the service. The amendment applies only to the ABC's international satellite television service and its aSsociated audio channels. It will not enable the ABC to take sponsorship or promotional programming on its domestic services or on radio Australia. I believe that the satellite service will far reaching foreign and trade policy benefits for Australia and will improve Australian information and cultural penetration of the South East Asian area. The acceptance of sponsorship announcements and promotional programming on the service will enhance its financial viability. I applaud the ABC for this initiative. Amendments of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 On 24 November, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) announced the Government's intention to apply a uniform classification scheme to films televised by commercial and community broadcasters and to provide for restrictions on M and MA classified material. The amendments included in the Bill result from extensive discussions with the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Office of Film and Literature Classification and industry groups on the most effective way of giving effect to the Government's intention. The issues raised are not simple. Broadcasters have accepted the need for programs displaying the stronger forms of violence, sex and crude language to be shown after 9 p.m. and the codes they are currently developing will so provide. In fact, their main worry was that they should retain the right to modify those programs to ensure that they meet the stricter ideas of what should be shown on , television. So the amendments propOse that the codes of practice should allow for modification of films to ensure that they at least meet the OFLC classifications for the time slot shown, knowing that, in many cases, the versions of films shown as M or MA on television will have been modified to remove scenes which would be acceptable to the Censor under that classification for cinema display. Coupled with improved consumer advice, the system will enable viewers, and particularly parents, to have a better idea of the content of films. They can be confident that films shown on television are at least within the OFLC guidelines for cinema display. The restrictions, will be imposed by codes of practice, which must be developed within have the framework of the Broadcasting Services Act. The amendment in the Bill ensures that those codes apply the OFLC guidelines. The current provisions of the Act ensure that codes must take into account community attitudes to the portrayal of violence, sexual conduct and nudity, use of drugs and offensive language. A code dealing with the suitability of programs for broadcasting, the protection of children or the classification of programs which did not make adequate provision for these issues would not be registered. Under section 123 of the Act, the ABA will only register a code if it is satisfied of three things: First, and most important, that the code 'provides appropriate community safeguards for the matters covered by the code'. Second, that the code is endorsed by a majority of the providers of broadcasting services in the relevant section of the industry, thus ensuring a commitment to the code by broadcasters themselves. Third, that members of the public have had an adequate opportunity to comment on the code. This is no behind closed doors exercise, but a full, open and cooperative effort to protect important cultural values. The Standards of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on programming classification and timing will still apply under the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential, Amendments) Act until replaced. If they are not replaced by a code, they will be replaced by an, ABA standard under section 125 of the Broadcasting Services Act. The ABC and SBS are not subject to the Broadcasting Services Act, but are required by their own Acts to develop codes and notify them to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The ABC code has been approved by its Board and notified to the ABA and the SBS Board will consider a draft code on 19 December. Those codes will apply the OFLC guidelines. The ABA can deal with complaints about breaches of the ABC or SBS code. If a national broadcaster fails to implement recommendations made by the ABA within 30 days, the ABA may report that fact to the Minister, who is obliged to table the report within 7 sitting days in both houses of the Parliament. No further legislative sanctions are necessary. The Bill also amends the Broadcasting Services Act to re-impose the three-day blackout on broadcasting of political advertisements before elections which was previously imposed under section 116 of the Broadcasting Act 1942. Amendments of the Civil Aviation Act The Bill amends the Civil Aviation Act to provide greater flexibility in the method of determining charges under the Act and to provide a mechanism under which charges can be waived or remitted in appropriate cases. The Bill also amends the Act's regulation-making provision to expressly provide that regulations can be made under the Act which deal with the design and manufacture of aircraft. Amendments of the Protection of the Sea (prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act The amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act will significantly reduce the amount of oil discharged into the sea during the normal operations of ships. The amendments are a direct result of changes to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, known as MARPOL 73-78. This convention has been accepted by 70 countries representing some 90 per cent of world shipping tonnage. It is expected that the amendments included in the Bill will enter into force globally on 6 July 1993. The amendments have two main objectives. Firstly, the present standard for the discharge in near-coastal zones and special areas of oily wastes and residues from machinery spaces is to apply to all sea areas. The oil content in permitted discharges is not to exceed 15 parts per million. Secondly, the amendments will improve the standard for the instantaneous rate of discharge of oil or oily mixtures from cargo tanks of oil tankers outside special· areas by reducing the permitted rate of discharge from 60 to 30 litres per nautical mile. For existing ships, the new requirements will be phased in over a period of five years. The impact of these amendments on the shipping industry will be negligible. More than 86 per cent of all ships are already fitted with the required 15 parts per million filtering equipment and the manufacture of 100 parts per million equipment has been almost entirely discontinued. It. is clear that the will, technology and equipment now exist within the international shipping community to take this step towards 1988 the fundamental goal of MARPOL 73-78 which is the complete elimination of intentional pollution of the marine environment. The present discharge standards were formulated more than 20 years ago when the subject was new, concern for the environment was not as acute as it is today, and the technology was not available to achieve such low discharge levels. Amendments of the Telecommunications Act 1991 The Bill makes a large number of amendments to the Telecommunications Act. 1983· These amendments come within five categories. I will briefly summarise each of these categories. Details about the relevant amendments are found in the explanatory memorandum. (1) Access Agreements Part 8 of the Telecommunications Act gives telecommunications carriers rights of access to the networks and services of other carriers. The proposed amendments clarify provisions of Part 8 of the Act to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty in relation to the making of access agreements between more than two carriers. (2) Protection of Communications Section 88 of the Telecommunications Act deals with the protection of communications: Section 88 creates obligations on employees and former employees of carriers not to disclose or use confidential personal or commercial information for purposes other than those prescribed in the Act. The Bill amends section 88 to extend these obligations to suppliers and former suppliers of eligible services and their employees and former employees. (3) Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman The Bill also amends the Telecommunications Act to facilitate the creation and operation of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman by the telecommunications carriers. The proposed amendments will ensure that there are no impediments to the free flow of information between the TID, participants in the TID scheme and complainants, in the investigation of complaints, and will specifically enable Austel to refer complaints to the TID. (4) Rules relating to the general carriers' reserved rights The Bill contains some minor amendments to clarify the reserved rights of the general carriers. In particular, the amendments will ensure that, subject to certain exceptions, the general carriers will retain the reserved right to install or maintain line links on a property whose title is not defined by reference to geographical coordinates. (5) Amendments dealing with the industry development arrangements. The Bill contains minor amendments which make it clear that AUSTEL has authority to administer the industry development arrangements for customer premises equipment. The measures contained in this Bill are expected to have no significant effect on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. Details about the minor technical amendments in the Bill which I have not referred to in this speech are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",225
330,Mr SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Transport and Communication Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1992 is a quite important omnibus Bill. It is a pity that we· are dealing with it at the time we are, but it has been canvassed extensively in the Senate and it·comes from the Senate after quite some extensive debate, some of it quite contentious. I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard a brief schedule of the amendments that were moved on behalf of the Opposition in the Senate so that I will not have to go through those issues again at this hour. Leave granted. The amendments read as follows1. After clause 5, page 2, insert the following clause: ""SA. After section 31 of the Principal Act, the following section is inserted: Sponsorship guidelines '31A. The Corporation must ensure that any guidelines issued or authorised in relation to sponsorship concerning the Corporation's international television service and its associated audio channels outside Australia do not contain a provision prohibiting the acceptance of sponsorship for transmission of the Radio Australia audio broadcasts carried on the service.'."". 2. After clause 5, page 2, insert the following clause: ""SB. After section 31 of the Principal Act, the following sections are inserted: Parliament may require further research etc. '3IB.(I) If requested to do so by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament in the same terms, the Corporation must conduct or have conducted such further research to assist in determining community standards that may be relevant to issues of program standards as may be described in the resolution. '(2) The Corporation must provide to the Minister a copy of the results of any research conducted as required by subsection (1) and the Minister must cause a copy of these results to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the results are received by the Minister. .

(2) The Corporation must act in response to directives issued by the Senate and the House of Representatives under subsection (1) and such action may include the determination of a new standard, or the alteration of an existing standard, to give effect to the directive of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 3. After clause 3, page 2, insert the following new clause: Duties of the Board ""3A. Section 8 of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end the following subsection: '(4) In developing codes of practice referred to in paragrapb (1)(e), it is the duty of the Board to ensure that: (a) for the purpose of classifying films-those codes apply the film classification system administered by the Office of Film and Literature Classification; and (b) those codes provide for methods of modifying films baving particular classifications under that system so that: (i) the films are suitable to be broadcast; or (ii) the films are suitable to be broadcast at particular times; and (c) those codes require that films classified as ""M"" may be broadcast only: (i) between the hours of 8:30 pm on a day and 5 am on the following day; or (ii) between the hours of noon and 3 pm on any day that is a school day; and (d) films classified as ""MA"" may be broadcast only between the. hours of 9 pm on a day and 5 am on the following day; and (e) those codes provide for the provision of advice to consumers on the reasons for films receiving a particular classification; and (f) those codes will ensure that the Corporation will not broadcast films that are classified as ""R"" unless the films have been modified as mentioned in paragraph (b); and (g) those codes will ensure that the Corporation will not broadcast films that have been refused classification or are classified as ""X"".'."". 4. After clause 26, page 12, insert the following clause: ""26A. Mter section 98 of the Principal Act, the following section is inserted: Line links used by State or Territory Governments '98A. Despite section 90, a Government, an authority or an agency of a State or Territory may install or maintain a reserved line link for the purpose of using it to carry communications of that Government, that authority or that agency, or of anyone or more of them.' ."".",229
331,Mr SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"There are a couple of matters I want to raise quickly. One relates to the impact of the legislation on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to allow the ABC to carry corporate sponsorship and promotional material on the new international satellite service. Previously the coalition has indicated its support for the development of that service and most certainly its support for the sponsorship of that service. I note in recent remarks by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that he indicated there would be an opportunity for Australian business to participate in this facility. I hope that will be the case. I also visited Indonesia and talked with the relevant Indonesian Minister and people charged with providing a satellite service. I think it is a development of an ongoing constructive relationship with that country because we are going to be utilising a satellite on the Indonesian service operated by Palapa. One of the amendments that I proposed that was taken forward in the Senate was to ensure that the sponsorship guidelines that are attached to this proposed service by the Corporation provide that where Radio Australia provides an audio broadcast service the decisions about the prohibition or the acceptance of sponsorship on that service are not just a matter for the Corporation but a matter for others; that is, for this place. I obviously am signalling, as I did publicly some time ago, that I believe it is an inconsistency to have sponsorship on the television service and not to allow that to take place in a similar way on our other international service, our long standing and successful international service, Radio Australia. The second matter I want to make reference to is an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act. This Bill amends II-odd Acts. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) will talk about rail, and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) will talk about ships and seafarers, the discharge of oil from ships, the MARPOL-onvention and so on. I will talk about amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act. When the original legislation went through the Parliament there was a major debate relating to the rights or otherwise of journalists in what was construed to be an attempt to codify the common law in relation to journalists being able to protect their sources. There has been considerable debate about this issue for a long period of time. This Bill seeks to codify it in a more reasonable way, so that it is a reasonable excuse for a journalist to refuse to respond an ABA request if he wishes to protect a source. I have mixed feelings about this, and the coalition certainly does, but we will not oppose the passage of this amendment. The objections relate to the fact that, at the moment, if you can prove to a judge that it would be detrimental to reveal that source, then the common law is at .liberty to protect that source. But the case is judged on the circumstances at the time. We do not want to create a legislative arrangement· vesting in journalists significant rights that are not enjoyed by other people. This is a matter that we will monitor over time to see how it develops. There are amendments relating to the Radio Communications Act which I shall.not refer to. There are significant amendments relating to the Telecommunications Act. The details have been talked about by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon). One establishes the position of Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. We support that, because that is particularly important. Another relates to the situation in New South Wales. We moved an jpnendment in the Senate regarding this matter but it was· lost. That amendment is among those that I have incorporated in Hansard. The Government is trying to limit the capacity, of the New South Wales Government to utilise its own line links between places. For example, it runs a line from Sydney to Parramatta on which it might carry Elcom telecommunications traffic. What it wants to do is to access the excess capacity on that line link to carry, for example, New South Wales police traffic. It is not intended that that excess capacity be offered to commercial buyers in such a way as to fulfil the fear that the Government has-and indeed the other operators have-of duopoly. We do not support the duopoly and we do not believe the intention of the New South Wales Government goes to the extent of the fears that have been expressed by the Government and, therefore, we do not believe the amendment that the Government is proposing to is necessary. Our amendment seeks to allow the New South Wales Government to use those line links to the best capacity available to carry th- communications traffic of its public entiti-. I think that the bona fides of the New South Wales Government in what it intends to do can be seen in the recent appointment of a facilities manager of its communications needs, similar to what has taken place in Queensland. That is an office that is going to try to broker the best rates for the carriage of State government communications. I signal that the development of State government facilities advisers and carriers is an issue that is going to continue, and we will certainly be monitoring it very closely. I mention another matter of contention throughout the telecommunications and broadcasting area: the determination of content. We are quickly coming to the position where the issue of carriage is not so much a matter of concern. There are multiple ways to carry a signal that ought to be allowed and pursued. But the matter of content has developed· into some significant arguments which are the contentious issues that have been dealt with in the other place. The Parliamentary Secretary, in the second reading speech, related the decisions on violence on television which all of us in this place have now seen, and the passage of the Bill tonight is something that all of us would welcome. There has been some negotiation. We started with a 9.30 p.m. start time. That has gone to 9 o'clock in view of the impact on the industry. We have also now seen the development of a new classification system, which was endorsed by all the Premiers at the recent conference, and that system will be reflected in the State legislation in time. I have had talks with many of my colleagues, the film literature and industry people and so on, and I think we have come to a position which meets most people's concerns. I have talked with the Children's Television Foundation, for example. I think the churches are certainly much happier with the outcome that is in this piece of legislation. I certainly believe that these are issues, however, that are going to continue to be contentious. If the recent arguments in this place are any indication, that will certainly be the case. Finally, I make mention of some matters that I raised today in another forum relating to the privatisation of AOTC. We clearly indicated that we are pulling forward and we believe that the privatisation process should commence as soon as possible. I also signalled that there would be some inquiry into the national transmission arrangements as they impact on the ABC and the SBS. That is something that I have raised several times previously, and that work is yet to be completed. But there may well be some savings in that area. There. has been some contention about the capacity of the stock market to meet the challenges of early privatisation of AOTC. The Chief Economist of the Australian Stock Exchange, Michael Heffernan, said that he thought it could be absorbed without a great deal of difficulty. He continued: Australians are looking for good viable opportunities to put their funds and they must just switch from somewhere else into these good viable enterprises. He was talking about the prospect of Australians investing in this telecommunications carrier. It will be a very exciting time when AOTC commences the privatisation process. I do not believe it is, as the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) said, an horrific prospect. As I said today, it is something that the Government will have to face. It is a reality that has emerged in many countries, regardless of their political complexion, as the trend with which we need to proceed. That is something I will welcome. We also moved to bring the ABC and SBS formally under the Act that applied to commercial television. We felt that the public broadcasters should be treated in the same way as the private broadcasters. Unfortunate-. ly, that amendment was defeated. I have had a look at the ABC's code. It was quick off the mark and was the first one to put that code to the ABA. I hope it will have a speedy passage. On Saturday, SBS is going to deal with the codes issue as well. Violence in content is a problem which deeply concerns many honourable members on this side. We have often commented on it. The issue of Xrated videos is still a problem. These issues are going to continue to be of great moment and concern to parents in the community. On behalf of the coalition, I signal that, whilst the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made a concession and had it reflected in legislation-and that certainly is progress-it is reflective of broad community concerns about this issue. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) expressed this concern at a family conference some time ago. The community should understand that the coalition will continue in this place to monitor progress carefully and diligently to ensure that the material that is reaching our children is not deleterious to their future. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training for allowing me to incorporate those amendments so that those who take the time to read the Hansard will Understand what it it was that we were talking about and attempting to do, given that it is after 4.30 a.m.",230
332,Mr HAWKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Wannon) (4.35 a.m.)Given the hour of the morning, I am going to be very brief. I refer to the amendment to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. The Government sprung this on the Senate at very short notice. It is a· pity that this amendment was needed, even though we will not oppose it, basically because it shows that the Government has not developed the trust with the National Rail Corporation and Australian National to allow it to facilitate the movements towards the National Rail Corporation which it should have been able to do under existing legislation without the need which it apparently now feels for this additional amendment. That is a pity, but it is a reflection-as was the fact that the amendment was sprung on the Senate at such short notice-that the Government is very disorganised when it comes to reforming our railways.",232
333,Mr SHARP,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I conclude the Opposition comments on the legislation that my colleagues the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) have already spoken on. The coalition happily supports the amendments to the legislation which reflect my portfolio area, that is the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, as we have made similar changes to the Act over the last couple of years. We do it for the simple reason that this is an issue which is of great concern to people who are interested in the protection of our environment, particularly the marine environment. It is something that I think all honourable members on this side of the House are willing to participate in because we can see that, whilst there may be from time to time additional costs borne by industry in order to fulfil these ambitions, it is a cost worth bearing because of the need to protect our environment. The Opposition has ensured that, when every reasonable amendment to the Act is put forward by the Government, it will support it. In this particular instance, it is an amendment to the Act that has been brought on as a result of a movement by the international maritime community to reduce the amount of oily substances and residues that are put into the sea by ships in our waters. The coalition supports this, as it does all other reasonable measures in relation to the environment or the safety of ships at sea, as we heard earlier today in the House when the  Morris) and other members debated the report entitled Ships of shame that was tabled in the House today. It is a Bill that we support and I make the point that we are, from time to time, quite wrongly accused by honourable members of the Government of not being interested in this area. Our track record over the last 2 1/z years on this stands up to any test and we have a very sincere interest in these sorts of amendments to ensure that we protect our environment from any further pollution that we all know has occurred in the past and that we hope will not occur in the future.",233
334,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment,Education and Training) (4.39 a.m.)-in reply-I thank honourable members opposite for their contributions and make one point in relation to the contribution made by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). Of course, his comments in relation to Telecom need to be rebutted, at least in part. We know of the agenda of the Opposition in relation to the privatisation of Telecom. It has little to do with the efficiency of the telecommunications sector; it is all about plugging holes in Fightback. We know that and we know that is why it was being given the beat up that it has been given this week. We, also know, as he knows, that the telecommunications industry has undergone a great deal of refonn in a short time. We are now in a new, very competitive environment. We have seen unprecedented changes to the industry as a result of initiatives by this Government. In our view, this is not the time for further changes. It is absolutely useless as an exercise to pursue the course which is being proposed by the Opposition. We believe, very sincerely, that it is a direction which would not be supported by the mass of the electorate. Indeed, I am wondering what the honourable members of the National Party of Australia, sitting there so gleefully supporting this proposal, are telling the people in their electorates. I know what they will be saying in my electorate; I know what they will be saying in far North Queensland; I know what they will be saying in Western Australia. They will be giving this the supreme thumbs down, as most people in the Australian community will do. I commend the legislation to the House. Question resolved in the afftnnative.

NA Public Accounts Committee  Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report, incorporating a dissent-. ing report: 325th-The Midford Paramount case and related matters: Customs and Midford shirts-the paramount case of a failure of Customs. Ordered that the report be printed.  to: That this House, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908, authorises the publication of the report the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Midford Paramount case.  referred to the Committee by the Senate in December 1990 following a number of attempts by Senate Estimates Committee A to examine the circumstances surrounding the failure of a major Crimes Act prosecutions of a well-known importer and manufacturer of shirts. Because of the extremely delicate nature of the wide range of issues considered SENATE in this inquiry, it is necessary to speak to this report in the House tonight. I point out that I will not be commenting further on it outside. the Parliament. The Committee received almost 2,200 pages of transcript resulting from 14 public hearings, 11,600 pages of submissions, some S,OOO pages of exhibits and about 3,000 pages of confidential material. By any measure, this is an enormous task that has been undertaken with a multiplicity of complex issues to be addressed, and which are addressed in this 610-page report. The Committee has brought down a large number of recommendations concerning, as the subtitle of the report suggests, the paramount case of a failure of Customs. The Committee is well aware that its examination of the. ACS was confined to a review of part of only one of several subprograms within Customs. Furthermore, that examination was confined primarily to the actions of Customs officers in New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, the ACS Central Office. Consequently, and to enable a wider indeReport pendent perspective on the operation of the investigation subprogram to be obtained, the Committee has recommended that consideration be given by the National Audit Office to conducting an Australia-wide efficiency and skills audit of the investigation subprogram of Customs. Overall, the evidence before the Committee indicated that the Australian Customs Service was at best incompetent, or at worse conspiratorial and deceitful in this matter. In this regard, should further evidence emerge demonstrating that the Committee has been deliberately misled, appropriate action will be taken under the full No. 325 of powers of the Parliament. As indicated earlier, one of the reasons why the inquiry took much longer than originally anticipated was that the Committee received an unprecedented quantity of evidence. It discovered an excessive number of inconsistencies, inaccuracies and contradictions in the evidence provided by key witnesses from government agencies. In addition, many of the answers to questions posed by the Committee appeared to be evasive. Although the Comptroller-General cannot be held personalthat ly responsible for all of the actions of his individual subordinate officers, he must accept responsibility for the overall efficiency effectiveness of the performance of the laid. Australian Customs Service, for the prevailing culture in that service, and for the changes that must be made. To turn to the case itself: in June 1988, charges in relation to an alleged misuse of have suffered the same fate as the quota quotas involving fraud of $4.5m were laid against directors of Midford Paramount Pty Ltd and its tariff adviser. Committal proceedCustoms ings commenced one year later, but were for discontinued soon after when the Director of matter. Public Prosecutions withdrew the charges. In February of the following year, the magistrate awarded costs against the tained Commonwealth of around $365,000. In so the doing, he was highly critical of the manner in which the case had been prepared and pregot sented, and severely castigated the two princithat, pal witnesses, one from the Australian Cusattitude toms Service and the other from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Under cross-examination these two witnesses had departed significantly from their sworn statements which had been tendered to the committal proceedings. It was established that in a number of key areas the evidence tained in those statements was incorrect or insupportable. Despite the withdrawal of the charges against Midford and its tariff adviser, and the award of costs by the magistrate, the Commitwas tee noted that the defendants had suffered enormous financial losses through explanations. unreimbursed legal fees and diminution in the values of their respective businesses. Specific actions by the Australian Customs Service, particular, had resulted in the latter. In effect, the defendants had been severely punished, although they had not been convicted of any crime. As a consequence, the Committee has recommended that the defendants in the Midford case, and others, be their unrecovered material and legal costs. Examination of the quota matter and reasons for the failure of the committal proceedings revealed to the Committee that thi-, was only one of a series of prosecutions the Australian Customs Service had sought to bring against Midford. For various reasons, none of these other matters proceedand ed to the stage where charges were actually . The Committee discovered serious shortcomings in the investigatory work undertaken by the Customs Service in relation to these other matters and concluded that it, too, may I matter, had it progressed to the courts. Inadequacies in the investigation conducted by was also one of the primary causes the failure of the prosecution of the quota Constantly throughout this inquiry witnesses from the Australian Customs Service mainthat Midford had not been cleared of charges, that it was guilty of crimes and that the magistrate presiding over the case had it wrong. It appeared to the Committee in particular, Customs was displaying the of Boston street cops-instant justice. As the inquiry progressed, the Committee discerned an emerging pattern about the investigatory methods and abilities of the New South Wales based Customs investigators. All too often they, along with some Central Office based Customs officers, misconunderstood or misconstrued the evidence before them, jumped to insupportable conclusions and ignored or even deliberately suppressed evidence or explanations provided by those individuals subject to investigation. It also evident that at times the ACS actively sought to prevent the provision of such It was observed that not only did the Customs investigators lack understanding and in expertise in the matters they were dealing with; more importantly, these officers failed to recognise their limitations and seek appropriate assistance where required. It was the Committee's view that adequate management systems should have been in place to detect compensated for these problems. In examining the performance of other the government agencies, the Committee found that witnesses from DITAC had an unclear understanding of policy requirements in respect of quotas and that they failed to detect or correct misunderstandings of those requireBishop, ments by ACS officers responsible for the implementation of that policy. Deficiencies were also noted in the mechanisms used by DITAC to convey the intent of the quota policy to the ACS. The Committee was, in part, sympathetic to the DPP's position. As prosecutor of the case, case. the DPP had received sworn evidence from senior bureaucrats which purported to represent policy requirements, but which was later found to be unreliable. However, the Committee felt that the case could and should have been better prepared and managed. Evidence was dismissed as irrelevant at a relatively junior level within the offices of the DPP which, when tendered by the defence, discredited the prosecution's key witnesses and resulted in the complete withdrawal of the proceedings. An issue emerged during the inquiry which is of great concern to the Committee. Evidence was received from Midford's former customs agent that he had been threatened that he would be made unemployable if he gave evidence to the Committee that was unfavourable to the Australian Customs Service. The Committee views this matter very seriously and continues to consider it. In total the Committee has made 134 recommendations in this report. Any cursory reading of those recommendations would indicate that many of the improvements suggested by the Committee are simple, straightforward matters which could be described as either common sense or basic good management practice. That these motherhood statements had to be made in the report stands as a terrible indictment of the Australian Customs Service. It is a poor reflection on that organisation that many of the more fundamental matters raised in this report needed to be said at all. The Committee hopes that the Australian Customs Service will view positively the recommendations in this report and improve its operations so that it can regain the trust of those it protects. In concluding, I would like to thank all members of the Committee, particularly the Deputy Chairman, Senator Watson, who is always a great Deputy Chairman, Senator the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) for spending many long hours examining what has been a most difficult and complex I place on record my appreciation, and I am sure that of all the Committee, of our staff, including the inquiry secretary, John Carter, and our secondee from the Australian National Audit Office, David Spedding, who has had to live with this case, who has carried out a great deal of work on this inquiry and who has spent almost every waking hour on it. Our administrative officer, Lorraine Hendy, is also worthy of great praise. I commend the report to the House and I thank the House for its indulgence.

Both firms have provided services to the Department. (8) & (9)The information sought by the honourable member in relation to this and subsequent parts of his question is not available in consolidated form. Departmental records show the following.

(13) The Department's records do not necessarily indicate which employee/associate of the Moreland Group and/or Groundwork Pty Ltd performed duties arising from the contracts entered into with the Department on particular dates. However it is believed that Me Gibson performed duties arising from the following contracts approximately in/from: (vi) October to December 1990; (viii) January to June 1991; (ix) February to June 1991; (x) March to June 1991; (xi) April and May 1991; (xv) October 1991; (xvi) October 1991 to January 1992; (xviii) November 1991 to February 1992 (xx) April and May 1992. (14) The Department's Financial Management System contains no record of any contract or service payment to Me Gibson. (15) The payments were authorised by officers holding delegations under the Audit Act and Finance Regulations. (16) The contracts referred to in response to parts (8) and (9) which were below the threshold level of $30000 did not require the calling of public tenders. For those in excess of $30000, the process of seeking public tenders was as follows: (i) the consultancy was a Management Consultancy Service exempt under Finance Regulation 52AA(2); (viii) public tenders were called; (xvi) expressions of interest were obtained from three consultancy firms with relevant expertise and the Moreland Group was selected to undertake the work. A contract was let for a total estimated cost which was less than $30000·and therefore below the threshold for calling public tenders. Towards the end of the contract period, further work was identified as a result of delays by State and Territory authorities. The Moreland Group was engaged to undertake this further work on the same conditions as the original contract. The total cost of work undertaken therefore, was $41746.30. (xviii) five companies were invited to lodge exersubmissions. 1\vo proposals were received and were subjected to a selection process. (17) Information concerning payments made from 1985 to 1989 to firms identified in (n) above is not available. Payments made since March 1990 to those firms total $280679.37.

342,Mr BEAZLEY,AUSRAPID,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1)-(6) The attached table lists research and development projects undertaken for the Department of Transport and Communications by private and public sector bodies. The list covers only those projects commissioned by the Department since it was created in 1987. Information is not readily available on projects which were commissioned by the separate departments of Transport, Aviation and Communications before that date. While a fairly broad interpretation has been given to the term ""research and development"" the table does not include all consultants engaged by the Department; that information is available in the Department's Annual Report. (7) It is not possible, at this stage, to provide a response in relation to this question. As far as is practicable the Department relies on its own officers to perform its functions. However, on occasions it is more cost effective to engage external consultants, from either the private or the public sector to perform specialist functions. In selecting consultants the Department attemptS to promote open and effective competition wherever possible. When specialist skills are required, as is generally the case with research and development projects, tenders are called for where possible.

(2) Was any part of the sum referred to in part (1) held by the firm in Broker Deposits accounts; if so, can such funds only be invested in bank bills and government securities. (3) Was the stockbroking failure referred to in part (1) covered by the guarantee fund, National Securities Exchanges Guarantee Corporation. (4) Have any of the firms' clients been reimbursed from the Guarantee Fund for the money lost in the stockbroking failure; if so, (a) which clients, (b) what sums were they reimbursed and (c) on what basis were funds reimbursed. (5) Did the Commissioner of Taxation advise the Stock Exchange in 1991 to change its business rules to prevent the situation referred to in part (1) arising again. (6) Does the Stock Exchange publication, Your guide to investment 1986-90, claim at page 13 the existence of a no fault guarantee. (7) Has the guarantee referred to in part (6) been applied to all investors; if not, why not (8) Is the no fault claim misleading or deceptive; if so, will he take action.

343,Mr DUFFY,AUSRAPID,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that Byron Moore Journeaux Limited (In Liquidation) (BMJ) which was a broker and a member of the Australian Stock - xchange, was placed in liquidation on 9 August 1989 pursuObjective of Project Cost $ Assess cost-benefit analyses for Sydney third run- 15 154 way and Badgery's Creek.

Provide advice on EIS on the Sydney third runway. 8329 ant to an Orde- of the Supreme Court of Victoria, on the application of the company and following the Court's appointment of a provisional liquidator on 20 June 1989. The directors· of BMJ ran a separate investment company, Broker Deposits Limited (In Liquidation) (BDL) which also went into liquidation in 1989. I am advised further that: (a) 761 clients of BDL and BMI were involved. (b) The total sum unaccounted for is not available as litigation involving a professional indemnity insurance policy held by Byron Moore Journeaux Limited (In Liquidation) is incomplete. The Liquidator has received from clients of Byron Moore Journeaux Limited (In Liquidation) and depositors with Broker Deposits Limited (In Liquidation) proofs of debt totalling $7,883,819 and has advised that the total value of deposits by persons who have not lodged proofs of debt is approximately $2.4 million. (2) The Liquidator has advised that he has received proofs of debt for $6,200,300 relating to the shortfall of money invested by depositors with BDL. The Liquidator has further advised that the total value of deposit by· persons who hav- not lodged proofs of debt, based on the Report as to Affairs of Broker Deposits Ltd. (In Liquidation), is approximately $2.4 million. . According to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, BDL was not restricted to investment of funds in bank bills and government securities. (3) I am advised that some' clients of BM] were entitled to make claims pursuant to Part IXA of the Securities Industry (Victoria) Code (the legislation in force at the time) against the National Securities Exchanges Guarantee Corporation Limited (NSEGC). To the extent that the claims satisfied the criteria set out in that Part, the stockbroking failure referred to in part (1) was covered by the National Guarantee Fund. (4)(a) I am advised that the clients of BMJ who were entitled to claim against the NSEGC are: those who had supplied to BMJ securities or consideration for an uncompleted securities transaction (ie claims under Division 6 of Part IXA); and those who had entrusted money to,BMJ (and whose claim comes within the criteria set out in Division 7 of Part IXA). I am also advised that these clients have been reimbursed from the National Guarantee Fund in accordance with the provisions of the legislation. I am also advised that persons who were on notice or taken to be on notice that their monies were deposited with BDL have no right of claim against the NSEGC. Above I referred to the two relevant heads of claim against the National Guarantee Fund at the time of the default-Division 6 and Division 7 of Part lXA of the Securities Industry (Victoria) Code. A brief outline of these provisions follows: Contract guarantees (Division 6 of Part IXA) These provisions entitle: a selling client to make a claim when his dealer fails to complete his obligations in relation to a sale of quoted securities (s.122L); and a buying client to make a claim when his dealer fails to complete his obligations in relation to a purchase of quoted securities (s.122M). Claims in respect of insolvent members (Division 7). The NSEGC, subject to certain limitations, was required to pay compensation or purchase replacement property for clients of the member (of the Australian Stock Exchange) who suffer loss in the event of a member's insolvency. Such a loss must be suffered in respect of money, securities, documents of title to securities or 'other property which must have been entrusted to or received by (in this case) the member or its employee in the course of, or in connection with, the member's business of dealing in securities as provided for in s.122R of the Code. Section 122U of Division 7 provides that the Division does not entitle a person to make a claim in respeCt of money lent by a person to the dealer. (b) ,and (c) I am advised that the amount of claims following the default of Byron Moore Journeaux Limited paid from the National Guarantee Fund between 1 July 1989 and 24 September 1992 was: Claims under s.122L of the Securities Industry Code-$791,198.57 . Claims under s.122M of the Securities Industry Code-$29,681.57 Claims under Division 7 of the Securities Industry Code-$7oo,868.63 Total-$1,521,748.77 (5) The Australian Stock Exchange has advised that the answer is no. As to the Commissioner of Taxation, that is a matter for the Treasurer. (6) I am advised that the Stock Exchange publication Your Guide to Investment 1986-90 claims at page 13 the existence of a no fault guarantee where a party does not complete its obligations under a contract in a securities transaction. (7) I am advised that the 'no fault guarantee' has been applied in respect of those clients of the stockbroker, BMJ, where the stockbroker had nocompleted its obligations under a contract in a securities transaction. (8) Clients of BDL should seek legal advice if they consider they have a right of action against the Australian Stock Exchange for a misleading or deceptive claim in the Australian Stock Exchange pamphlet, Your Guide to Investment 1986-90. (9) The National Guarantee Fund stood at over $100 rpillion as at 30 September 1992. The interest income received by the Fund for the September 1992 quarter was $OAm from deposits under Part 7.8 of the Corporations Law and $3.2m from Fund investments. To my knowledge $90 million has not been transferred to the Stock Exchange for capital works comprising a computer system. However, I have recently approved in principle the transfer of $35 million over 3 years for the development by the Australian Stock Exchange of the Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System. This system will facilitate the transfer of securities electronically, without a physical document transfer, and will also enable the simultaneous exchange of valid securities for cleared funds. Corporate Insolvencies and Terminations (Question No. 1745)  upon notice, on 18 August 1992: What were the numbers of corporate (a) insolvencies and (b) terminations in each State in each year since 1980-81.",276
344,Mr DUFFY,AUSRAPID,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) has advised'that corporate insolvency and termination figures were not included in National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) ,annual reports prior to the financial year ended 30 June 1987. Although figures for the earlier years may be held by State and Territory archives, I am advised that they are not held by the ASC or by my Department. The following figures have been extracted from NCSC and ASC annual reports and ASC media releases. In the period to 31 December 1990, statistical information on Australian business was collected mainly by the Corporate Affairs Commissions of each State and Territory and collated by the NCSC. In the period after 1 January 1991, information has been collected by the ASC on a national basis. Data gathered by the ASC cannot be regarded as strictly comparable with earlier data as the operation of one national system facilitates more timely and accurate collection of data.

On page 6 of its report of the 24th session of the Unesco General Conference (1987) the Australian Delegation stated that ""The 23rd and 24th plenary meetings on 3 November were set aside for a special debate on literacy, in which 27 delegates took part. Despite the declining literacy among Australia's Melanesian neighbours, the Australian delegation did not have the numbers or a policy brief to permit it to participate."" (2) No. The report was commissioned by the Australian Advisory Council on Languages and Multicultural Education (AACLAME). . (3) Yes. (4) No. Officials from my Department are seeking clarification on the status of the Project's progression. Immigration (Question No. 181S) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Minis- Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: (1) How many persons have arrived in Australia since 1977 seeking refugee status. (2) How many of the persons referred to in part (1) were sent to (a) their country of origin or (b) another country. (3) How many people of each nationality have sought refugee status. (4) What was the cost of dealing with illegal immigration each year since 1987. Mr Band-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Statistics relating to the number of applications for refugee status in Australia lodged before 1982 are not readily available and would require a quite extensive search of statistical records and manual extraction of information. In the period 1 January 1982 to 30 June 1992 a total of 29,514 applications for refugee status in Australia were received by my Department. This figure includes applications lodged by persons who arrived in Australia by boat, without authority to enter, during that period. Table 1 provides detailed statistics relating to applications received since 1 January 1982. (2) The compilation of statistics cally to the number of unsuccessful on-shore refugee applicants who have had their departure enforced by my Department only commenced on 1 July 1992 when enhancements to the Compliance data base became operational. Figures prior to that date are included in statistics relating to all enforced departures from Australia. In the period 1 July to 30 September 1992, 105 unsuccessful DORS applicants had their departure enforced. 87 were supervised departures and 18 were deported. A breakdown by nationality is at Table 2. Information relating to the destination of persons whose departure has been enforced is not captured by data systems in place in my Department. Normally, such persons would be returned to the country of their nationality. (3) Statistical information relating to the nationality of persons applying for refugee status in Australia prior to 1 January 1989 is not readily available and would require an extensive manual extraction of information. Details of applications for refugee status received by nationality in the period 1 January 1989 to 31 July 1992 are at Table 3. (4) Expenditure by the Department of Immigmtion, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in the Compliance sub-program since 1987 is been as follows: 1987/88 $ 8.4 million 1988/89 $11.4 million 1989/90 $16.1 million 1990/91 $22.2 million 1991/92 $37.4 million Table 1 Refugee Applications Received (1 JANUARY 1982-30 JUNE 1992) 1982* 170 1983* 183 1984* 167 1985/86 315 1986/87 488 1987/88 439 1988/89 564 1989/90 3373 1990/91 14020 1991/92 9795 Total: 29514 * Figures relate to cases considered by the then Determination of Refugee Status (DORS) Committee rather than to the number of refugee applicarelating specifitions received.

NOTE: It is not the practice of the Government to publish specific statistics where small numbers are involved, as this may lead to the identification of individual applicants. This could result in harm to such individuals or their relatives in their source country and thus could be in breach of Australia's obligations under the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. Roads: IIIawarra Region (Question No. 1850) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 9 September 1992: With respect to the following roads in the Illawarra region that are used for export coal haulage: (a) the Appin Road forming part of Main Road 69 from Campbelltown to the junction with the Princes Highway near Bulli Heights, (b) the F5 Freeway from the junction referred to in part (1)(a) to the foot of the Mount Ousley Road including the recently completed overbridge near the top of Mount Ousley, (c) the road from Picton to the overbridge referred to in part (1)(b) including Wilton bypass and (d) any roads west of (i) Picton or (li) Campbelltown; what (a) was the budgeted (i) construction and (li) maintenance expenditure for 1991-92, (b) was the construction expenditure for each financial year from 1982-83 to 1990-91 in (i) current and (li) constant terms, (c) was the expenditure for each financial year from 1973-74 to 198182 in (i) current and (li) constant terms and (d) is the anticipated construction expenditure, including that for work committed or in progress, for (i) 1992-93 and (ii) 1993-94. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a)-(d) Figures for construction and maintenance are not available separately.

No decision has been made on when this upgrading will be completed as it will depend on future levels of funding and an assessment of its priority compared to works required elsewhere on the National Highway system. The estimated cost of works required to complete the highway to four lane standard is some $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Proposed funding for maintenance on the Hume Highway during 1992/93 is $44.6 million. It is estimated that approximately half of these funds will be spent on parts of the Highway presently constructed to four lane standard. Maintenance of a bitumen surface is approximately $15,000 per lane kilometre per annum, and maintenance of a concrete surface is approximately $5,300 per lane kilometre per annum (both figures in $1990/91). Yothu Yindi Band (Question No. 1953) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs upon notice, on 15 September 1992: Has the band Yothu Yindi received funds from (a) the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission or (b) any other Government source; if so, in each case, (a) what was the sum provided and (b) under what conditions was it provided. Mr Tickner-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (a) Yes (b) Yes (a) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission: 1990/91-$27,500; 1991/92$35,000.

Belconnen Naval Communications (Question No. 1956) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 15 September 1992: Has the CSIRO undertaken any research on the ecological significance of sections of the site of Belconnen Naval Communications Station; if so, what are the results of the research. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The CSIRO Division of Entomology has undertaken a limited survey of the Belconnen Naval Communications Station and has determined the presence on the site of the endangered moth Synemon plana. This site contains the largest and most robust population of the moth now known to exist. Other sites, where the moth is known to exist, are smaller and in these the moth is more vulnerable to elimination. It could be expected that there are other invertebrate species confined to this grassland but assessments of these have not been undertaken. It is understood that the Belconnen Naval Communications Station site represents one of the best surviving examples of the Danthonia carphoides (Wallaby Grass) grasslands in existence. These grasslands were once extensive on the Southern Tablelands. Migration: Adopted Children (Question No. 1983)",280
348,Mr RUDDOCK,USSR,"the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 17 September 1992: (1) Are children adopted overseas who enter Australia with a class 102 visa, before Australian adoption orders are granted, immediately eligible for Australian citizenship in all cases. (2) What is the role of State and Territory welfare authorities with respect to citizenship applications for the children referred to in part (1). (3) Can State and Territory welfare authorities impede the children's citizenship applications. (4) How many children, by country of origin, have been adopted in each State and Territory in each year since 1987. (5) How many of the children referred to in part (4) have been granted Australian citizenship. (6) In each State and Territory, how many (a) parents of the children referred to in part (4) have applied for citizenship and (b) children have been Station granted citizenship before an Australian adoption order was granted. (7) Is there any restriction on parents applying for citizenship, apart from the normal residency and character requirements, before a child is adopted from overseas. (8) Have any adoptive parents who did not have the Australian citizenship subsequently applied for it. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are two sub groups in Adoption Visa Class 102. One sub group involves children whose overseas adoption orders are automatically recognised under Australian State{ferritory legislation. Such children are immediately eligible for Australian citizenship. The other sub group involves children whose overseas adoption orders are not automatically recognised under Australian State{ferritory legislation. These children are covered by the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act (the IGOC Act). and are not immediately eligible for Australian citizenship. That is. they are not eligible in the sense that only their legal guardian, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, may lodge applications for citizenship on their behalf before adoption orders have been granted under Australian State{ferritory legislation. Before lodging any such applications the Minister would seek the views of the relevant welfare authorities. The State{ferritory welfare authorities have been given delegation under the IGOC Act to exercise many of the powers and functions of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs under that Act. These delegates can apply for Australian citizenship on behalf of children subject to the IGOC Act. (2) See the answer to (1) above. (3) See the answer to (1) above. (4) This is a matter for the State{ferritory Welfare authorities. (5) Statistics are not recorded for these categories. (6) Statistics are not recorded for these categories. (7) Yes. Only a child's legal guardian can apply for citizenship on the child's behalf. (8) Statistics are not recorded. Poverty Levels (Question No. 1984) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 6 October 1992: Has his Department prepared a study of the bases of the poverty level set by Professor Henderson; if so,will he release the study.",284
349,Mr WILLIS,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Limited analysis of the Henderson poverty levels has been done by the Department. Attached is the working paper that resulted from that analysis. However, sections incorporating policy advice provided to the Government are not available for release and have been deleted from the document. NA 3. There are two main approaches to measuring poverty. An absolute approach would calculate the minimum income required to maintain a subsistence standard of living. A relative approach would involve measuring poverty relative to the general standard of living of the whole community. Whichever approach is chosen, there are three features to any poverty line: first, a money amount must be nominated: if an income unit falls below the level of income represented by the dollar figure, it is considered to be in poverty; secondly, in order to apply this figure to families of different composition in different circumstances. ""equivalence scales"" are required to account for those differences; and finally, it is necessary to adopt a means for updating poverty lines over time to reflect changes in economic and social circumstances. 4. The selection of each of these parameters gives rise to difficulties and is likely to lead to debate as to the appropriateness of a particular choice. NA 5. Professor Ronald F. Henderson pioneered poverty line research in Australia. As a measure of poverty, he nominated an amount equivalent to the basic wage plus child endowment in 1966 for a standard income unit comprising working husband, non working wife and two' children. He adopted equivalence scales based on household expenditure data derived from a New York survey conducted in 1954. Finally he proposed that movements in before-tax AWE be used to· index the resulting poverty lines. 6. This work formed the basis of the poverty lines used in the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, the main report of which was published in 1975. These poverty lines have been regularly updated; however, since 1981, the National Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has used quarterly national account figures of the movements in per capita household disposable income (HDI) instead of AWE to index the lines. The ostensible reason for the change was that HDlfhead was considered more appropriate for reflecting changes in average income over time. However. it should be noted that: Henderson himself recommended that AWE should be used to adjust the poverty lines; the original poverty line was based on a gross income measure-the minimum wage-and therefore a before tax income indicator such as AWE is a more appropriate inflator than an after tax indicator such as HDI; the changes which the ABS made to the AWE series did not require its abandonment; and while the choice of HDI or AWE would have made little difference to the resulting poverty lines prior to the change, HDI has increased more rapidly than AWE since the change. 7. Any measure of poverty involves subjective judgements; in Henderson's case, however, these are accompanied by significant methodological flaws. 8. The Henderson benchmark was the basic wage plus child endowment in 1966. Such a measure attempted to relate poverty to both community levels of disposable income (a relative approach) and, by use of equivalence scales derived from a budget survey, to a measure of subsistence (an absolute approach). It was thuS, from the beginning, a hybrid poverty line. Moreover, the basic wage had by 1966 ceased to be a measure of the minimum income needed to support a family, and represented merely an ""acceptable"" level of income Table 1: Comparison of poverty lines updated with consumer price index (CPI) (September 1987) Single (not in workforce) Single (in workforce, 2 children) Married Couple (not in workforce) Married Couple (head in workforce, 2 children) * Benchmark Henderson Poverty Line 10. The equivalence scales used by Professor Henderson were derived from household expenditure data compiled for New York in 1954. Such data is highly unlikely to be appropriate for setting ning. Australian poverty lines in 1987 and beyond. For instance the expenditure patterns of Australian households in the 1980s could be expected to be very different from households in New York in 1954. 1L Various efforts to refine Henderson's work using Australian data have been generally unsuccessful. The variation between possible alternative equivalence scales has resulted in ongoing debate about which is the most appropriate. The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research is currently undertaking a major study into the costs of children, from which they hope to develop a current and relevant Australian equivalence scale. for an individual worker. It has been argued, and admitted by Professor Henderson himself, that this benchmark was almost entirely arbitrary although it was (and has continued to be) characterised as extremely austere. 9. The indexation of this benchmark was necessary to preserve its value. However, by using movements in AWE (and then household disposable income) for this purpose, the poverty line has increased in real terms corresponding with the general increase in standards of living across the community. With such indexation, the poverty line lost any remaining claim to represent an absolute or a subsistence income level (see Table 1 below comparing the poverty line updated by HDI as opposed to CPl). It has increased by about 19% in real terms between December 1973 and September 1987 using the CPI as the deflator-AWE has increased by 14 % in real terms over the same period. (The higher growth in HDI relative to AWE is due to the dramatic growth in the labour force participation rate of married women, which has increased by over 20 percent since 1981.) reference to household disposable income (HDI) and updated by HDI updated by CPI $123.1Opw $103.62pw $235.9Opw $198.56pw $ 174.4Opw $146.8Opw $285.2Opw* $240.06pw In the meantime, Henderson's line, being the only one regularly updated, has by default and ignorance achieved general community acceptance, notwithstanding its entirely flimsy intellectual underpin12. In particular, two little understood implications of updating the Henderson poverty line by movements in HDI or AWE are: (1) The Government's policy of indexing pensions by the CPI will in time lead to pensions falling below the poverty line, if, as expected, real incomes rise in the medium term. (2) except insofar as it affects the level of unemployment, economic growth cannot of itself achieve any reduction in the extent of poverty as measured; instead according to Henderson a reduction in poverty would require an explicit policy of redistribution through changed wage relativities or more probably higher taxation. The use of HDI exacerbates this problem since even a reduction in unemployment may not be reflected in the number of people in poverty, as following simplified and purely illustrative shows. Assume that initially 20 per cent of the labour force are unemployed and below the and 10 per cent of those employed have incomes below the poverty line. The poverty rate would be 28 percent. If the unemployment rate halves and the income distribution of those employed remains the same (ie AWE is unchanged) then using an AWE updated poverty line the poverty rate would drop by 9 percentage points to 19 percent (10 percent unemployed and 10 percent of the remaining 90 percent of the population in emStandard"", ployment). If, however, an HOI updated poverty line used, then a reduction in unemployment will result in an increase in the poverty line through the increased HOI and the number of employed people in poverty will increase as a consequence. It would be possible to have an income living. distribution for the employed population such that a reduction in the level of unemployment could result in an increase in the number of people measured as being in poverty. 13. The updating method used therefore impacts not only on the poverty lines but also on the measurement of the number of people in poverty. An analysis of the income distribution data from the 1981/82 Income and Housing Survey by ABS of suggests, for example, that use of a CPI updated line gives a figure of less than 2/3 of the estimate obtained using an HOI updated line. There are serious deficiencies in this data, particularly lower income levels, and the absolute numbers obtained should not be considered difference between the two results does, however, clearly indicate the sensitivity of the numbers to the poverty line used and the difficulties involved in objectively measuring poverty. The use of poverty lines should therefore be treated as indicative only-in relation to trends in the numbers persons in poverty-rather than as a reliable indication of precise numbers of persons living poverty. PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING EQUIVALENCE of NA 14. As with specifying a poverty line in terms income alone and so ignoring other factors that integral to the assessment of standards of living, equivalence scales provide a very narrow basis for determining the relative well being of diverse family groups. They make no. allowance for the non-financial costs and benefits derived from raising children. In fact, the degree to which an equivalence scale accounts for the direct financial costs and benefits deriving from the composition of the various families depends on the method used to analysis estimate the scale. 15. 1\vo broad approaches are used to define equivalence scales-the ""budgetary"" approach and poverty line the ""proportional"" approach. 16. The ""budgetary"" approach seeks to define a ""basket of goods"", or a budget, which would allow compositionally different families to achieve the same specified standard of living. The relative costs of these. budgets for different family types provide the eqUivalence scales. The greatest weakness of this approach is that it assumes that a specific poverty line standard of living can be defined. 17. Henderson used the 1954 ""Family Budget prepared by the Budget Standard Service of the Community Council of Greater New York to adjust his poverty line for differing family strucis tures. Since 1954 a number of subsequent New York budget studies have been undertaken. 1\vo of these-in 1962 and 1969-have been major studies which have reflected changing values as to what constitutes a ""modest but adequate"" standard of These changes illustrate the extent to which the budget standard is basically an arbitrary one. For example, the cost of TVs and cars were included in the 1969 standard but not the 1954 one; the 1954 standard allowed one suit a year but in , 1969 one suit was expected to last 3 years. 18. The inherent problem in the ""budgetary"" approach is that the scales are derived by a series of ad hoc judgements ,about an adequate standard living at a particular point in time. They are not based on any explicit theory or measurement of family behaviour. The relevance to Australian families of overseas derived budgets must be at considered dubious particularly as they do not reflect current Australian conditions or price reliable. The relativities. 19. The ""proportional"" approach seeks to estimate equivalence scales by measuring the relative proportions of total family income expended by differing family types to achieve the same standard of of living. There are a number of different methodological approaches to this analysis. The in ""Canadian"" method (used by Statistics Canada) sets an arbitrary level for the proportion of income expended on ""necessities"" and determines the level income at which families of differing composition expend proportionally less than this set level. of The income relativities so derived provide the are equivalence scales. The ""Utility Theoretic"" approach uses commodity demand functions as a !Deasure of the standard of living and, by estimatmg the parameters of the function for differing family types, derives equivalence scales by determining the levels of income at which utility for different family types is equal. 20. 'The ""proportional"" approach has the apparent advantages of limiting the number of judgementS involved in deriving equivalence scales and also of being based on the actual expenditure behaviour of hOl,lseholds 01;"" families. However, what constitutes a standard of living is not defined and the approach is purely empirical. It. is methodologically flawed in that to be reliable, studies undertaken to date have found it necessary to draw on sample data for the whole population, not just those near or at poverty level. In fact the utility demand functions used in the second approach assume the existence of discretionary expenditure on a range of commodities, a notion which may be considered inconsistent with the existence of poverty. As the analysis is based on averaging expenditure data it can make no allowance to any degree of substitution of consumption that occurs between families of similar income levels but different composition.

(7) No. Overseas Qualifications: Recognition (Question No. 2012)",285
350,Mr M,SCALES,"ore asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 12 October 1992: (1) What is the relationship between the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) and the (a) Architects Accreditation Council of Australia (AACA) and State and Territory boards of architects, (b) Institution of Engineers (IE Aust.) and State and Territory boards of professional engineers, (c) Australian Medical COuncil and State and Territory registration boards and (d) Australian Dental Council and State and Territory registration boards. (2) What involvement do private professional associations have in the assessment of overseas qualifications in Australia and how influential are they in the assessment process. (3) What involvement do the (a) Royal Australian Institute of Architects, (b) Australian Medical Association and (c) IE Aust. have in the assessment of overseas qualifications in Australia. (4) Is there potential for a conflict of interest where certain persons have multiple functions in the assessment process, such as being simultaneously members of or consultants for private professional associations, assessing authorities, councils and committees. (5) To what extent does the relationship between the AACA and NOOSR affect the review of assessments made of immigrant architects for registration in Australia. (6) Do the (a) IE Aust. and (b) AACA receive Commonwealth funding; if so, what sums. (7) Does NOOSR fund IE Aust. for the assessment of overseas qualifications. (8) In March 1992, did his office, in replying to a claim by Mrs Ursula Ebber, President of the Association of Overseas Trained Engineers, that IE Aust. was funded by NOOSR, state that IE Aust. was not sponsored by NOOSR but that NOOSR was working with IE Aust. to develop a project to facilitate the development of national competency standards for both overseas and Australian trained engineers. (9) Is he able to say whether Mr Graham Gordon, Chief Executive Officer of IE Aust., Qld, publicly stated during a seminar held in relation to the mutual recognition of standards in July 1991 that his organisation was sponsored by NOOSR. (10) IS he able to Say whether Mr Gordon's statement was confirmed by the Manager of the Skills Recognition Branch of the Queensland Department of Employment, Vocational Education, Training and Industrial Relations, a member of the Vocational Education, Employment and Training Advisory Committee; if so, does this contradict the statement referred to in part (8).",289
351,Mr BEAZLEY,SCALES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (la) The AACA is an independent incorporated body. AACA determines national minimum academic standards accepted for registration. Such standards are applied by NOOSR, when assessing overseas trained architects for migration purposes. There is no relationship between NOOSR and State and Territory boards of architects. (lb) IE Aust. is an independent private organisation. The relationship between NOOSR and IE Aust. is an incidental one of advice provision, if and when it is sought. The advice given by either party is not binding on the other. There is no relationship between NOOSR and State and Territory boards of professional engineers. (1c) There is no formal relationship between NOOSR and the Australian Medical Council, nor the State and Territory registration boards. (ld) 'Australian Dental Council' is taken to mean the Australian Dental Examining Council (ADEC). ADEC is an independent body incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory. ADEC provides assessments of overseas trained dentists and to this extent it receives some administrative support from NOOSR. There is no formal relationship between NOOSR and State and Territory registration boards. (2) For non-regulated professions, private profesaccess sional associations may take a role in assessing overseas qualifications. (3a) RAJA has no direct involvement in the assessment of overseas qualifications. (3b) As far as the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition is aware, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) is a professional association which is not involved in the assessment of overseas trained doctors. The skills of overseas trained general medical practitioners are assessed by the Australian Medical Council. (3c) IE Aust. independently provides assessments of overseas trained engineers. (4) There is some potential for a conflict of interest. Government organisations involved in the assessment of overseas qualifications are aware of such possibilities and seek to structure their arrangements to eliminate, or at least minimize them. Professional organisations are likely· to adopt a similar approach. (5) When AACA is reviewing an assessment made of an overseas trained architect for registration in Australia, AACA may seek advice from the NOOSR Panel in Architecture. It is not obliged to seek such advice and any advice given by the Panel is not binding. (6a) The Department of Employment, Education and Training has engaged IE Aust., under a contract, to develop competency standards for the profession. The contract sum is $119,700.00. (6b) The Department of Employment, Education and Tmining has engaged AACA, under a contract, to develop competency standards for the profession. The contract sum is $138,975.00. AACA also receives a fee of approximately $19,045.00 for advice provided to NOOSR in assessing overseas qualifications for migration purposes. (7) No. (8) Yes. (9) No. (10) No. Family Court: Access Orders (Question No. 2019) Mr Burr asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 12 October 1992: (1) How many warrants were issued to police by the Family Court to take possession of a child and deliver the child to the person entitled to access in each year from 1980 to 1992. (2) How many applications claiming failure to comply with an access order were made to the Family Court in each year from 1980 to 1992. (3) How many orders granting compensatory time were made by the Family Court in each year from 1980 to 1992. (4) How many (a) fines and (b) orders to serve community service were imposed on custodial parents for failure to comply with an access order in each year from 1980 to 1992. Mr DufTy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised by the Family Court that: (1) This information is not readily available and to collect it would require an unreasonable diversion of the Court's resources. However, a study was made in 1991 for the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act covering Registries which were on-line to the Blackstone computer system for the whole of that year. Those Registries had 39.5 % of all files opened in that year. From the sample of those Registries an Australian wide estimate for the Family .Court of Australia was extrapolated. On that estimate there were 322 warrants to take possession of a child issued. Of these, the applicant in 54 % of the cases was the wife, in 44 % of the cases the husband and 2 % were other parties. These figures do not show whether the warrants were issued against the custodial parent or the one having access. (2) This information is not readily available but an estimate made on the same basis as in (1) for the year 1991 is that 206 applications for summary enforcement were made. Of these, 84 % were filed by the husband, 14% by the wife and 2% by other parties. Of the 206 applications, 59% were dismissed, 29% withdrawn and the remaining 12% led to a recognisance, fine or other conviction. All applications that led to a conviction were filed by the husband. (3) Compensatory access orders were not available until section 112AJ of the Family Law Act 1975 came into force on 25 January 1990. The number of such orders is not available without a comprehensive file search. Although a number of Judges are understood to have made orders under section 112AJ, there are no reported cases in which such orders have been made. The Joint Select Committee in its report tabled on 24 November 1992 came to the conclusion that ""the Family Court has available to it a wide range of courses of action, which it does not appear to be using to their best, or even their intended, advantage. In particular, the Committee cites the introduction of new penalties for the enforcement of court orders, which the Court has not yet begun to use to their best effect."" (4) The statistical records do not contain sufficient detail to determine which fines and orders were imposed on custodial parents in access matters. Community service orders were not available until section ll2AG of the Family Law Act came into force on 25 January 1990 and by September 1991 all States except New South Wales were ""participating"" in terms of the section. There is provision in the agreements for the States to bill the Commonwealth for the services provided on a quarterly basis. I am informed that again there have been no reported cases in which such orders have been made nor have any bills been submitted for payment, indicating an apparent reluctance on the part of the Courts to make use of the. new provision in the Act. RAAF: Pilots (Question No. 2024) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 13 October 1992: (l) Is the RAAF sending two of its jet pilots to the National Test Pilots' School (NTPS) in Mojave, California, USA; if so, (a) what aircraft types will the pilots train on, (b) are jet aircraft included in the training, and (c) of what value is the course to jet pilots. (2) Is the RAAF sending at least one pilot to the more highly regarded military test pilots' courses conducted in England or the USA; if not, why not. (3) Did a RAAF pilot who was posted to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) at RAAF Edinburgh several years ago from a civilian test pilots' course in England take 18 months to achieve the same standard as pilots who had returned from the military test pilots' courses(4) Will pilots returning from the NTPS meet the standard required by ARDU; if not, why is the RAAF sending two pilots to the NTPS. (5) Is the Australian Army sending one of its pilots to the ETPS military test pilots' school in England; if so, (a) will it cost $1.4 million to send the pilot, (b) will the pilot be subject service obligation; if not, why not, and (c) will the pilot ever fly jets in the Army. (6) Are there sufficient funds to send only one pilot from the Australian Defence Force to a military test pilots' course; if so, why is the pilot to be sent not a RAAF pilot. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The RAAF is sending one FIll qualified pilot to the National Test Pilot School (NTPS), Mojave, California, and one Qualified Flying Instructor from No 2 Flying Training School to the International Test Pilot School (ITPS), Cranfield, England. (a) Aircraft types that will be flown are: NA PHatus PC7 Pilatus PC6 T-36 Pilatus PC-7/9 Merlin III Jetstream F-4 Islander T-38 Gyro Canard F-I04 Beechcraft Kingair Learjet, T-33 Learjet, Hawk (b) Training in all categories of aircraft is experienced at both schools. (c) The training will qualify the students as test pilots and the skills acquired will allow the pilot to contribute to the process of procurement, operation, safety and effectiveness of aircraft and aviation equipment. (2) For 1993, the RAAF is not sending students to the Empire Test Pilots School (ETPS) as the course is more expensive ($.950M) than the National Test Pilot School ($.450M) or the International Test Pilot School ($.630M). (3) No. The graduate of ITPS did not take 18 months to achieve the same standard as pilots who completed military Test Pilot (TP) courses. However, it is fair to say that, due to the syllabus content at that time and .lack of military aircraft types at the civilian school, the graduate of ITPS was not the equal of the military course graduates for about 12 months after graduation. While the civilian school trains pilots to an acceptable standard they cannot train a military test pilot to the same standard, for military test flying, as a military school. Nevertheless, no generalisation should be drawn from this one instance because differences can be attributed to the content of the course at that time, and the adaptability of the pilot. The syllabus is subject to continual revision and has subsequently been upgraded. (4) NTPS and ITPS graduates will meet the to a return of standards required by the RAAF. (5) Yes. The Australian Army intends to send one Army pilot on the ETPS Helicopter Test Pilot course to be held in FY 92/93. As such training is conducted biennially, and only one test post is established (at ARDU) for continuity the graduate pilot must be fully trained to military standards. (a) Indicative costing for the helicopter course is in the order of $.860M. Exact costs are yet to be provided by the Ministry of Defence, London. (b) Yes. Four years from completion of course. (c) No. (6) Army and RAAF manage and fund TP training separately. Army chose to use a military school while the RAAF, which has a need to train more TPs, chose to utilise its funding by sending two students to the civilian schools. The Army pilot being sent to ETPS is a helicopter pilot. On return from ETPS the pilot is posted to ARDU as a helicopter test pilot. Since the RAAF no longer operates helicopters, Army pilots provide the test pilot skills at the RAAF's Aircraft Research and Development Unit. Vietnam War: Official History (Question No. 2036) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 15 October 1992: (1) Did the Australian War Memorial (AWM) appoint an official historian in 1982 for a term of 7 years; if so, was the official historian, as a condition of his appointment, required personally to write one or more volumes of the 'Official History of the Vietnam War'. (2) Did the official historian inform the Director of the AWM in September 1986 that he was taking a principal role in writing four volumes, namely the first volumes of those works known as 'Home Front, Strategic and Diplomatic, Combat and Medical' and a concurrent role in the writing of the second volumes of those works known as 'Home Front, Strategic and Diplomatic', and 'Combat'. (3) Did the official historian (a) carry out a principal role in the writing of the 'Combat' and 'Medical' volumes and (b) write any chapters of the recently published volume on 'Politics and Diplomacy'; if so, which chapters did he write without the assistance of a co-author, research assistant or drafting assistant. (4) Has the official historian undertaken overseas travel at public expense since his appointment; if so, on each occasion, (a) where and when, (b) for what purpose and (c) at what public cost did he travel. (5) Did the official historian travel to the USA twice. (6) If the official historian travelled to the USA twice, did he use the trips to gather US archival sources; if so, (a) what were the sources, (b) what use did he make of them and (c) did he use them in the volume on 'Politics and Diplomacy'. (7) What sum did the official historian spend in translating Vietnamese official histories used to assist in the writing of the Australian 'Official History of the Vietnam War'. (8) Had a scholar at the ANU previously translated the Vietnamese official histories; if so, (a) was the scholar willing to make the translations available to the official historian and (b) was material from the tranSlation relevant to Australia published in the book 'Vietnam Remembered'. (9) Did Mr Kelson, Director of the AWM, state, as reported in the Weekend Australian of 9-10 May 1992, that the AWM had sought legal advice with a view to restraining former members of its Official History Unit from expressing views on the Vietnam War which contradicted the Official History of the Vietnam War; if so, (a) was the advice sought and (b) why was it sought. (10) Did the AWM call for applications for its C.E.W. Bean Scholarship in 1992; if so, (a) how many applications were received, (b) how many were accepted and (c) was the scholarship awarded; if not, why not. Mr Humphreys-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The official historian at the Australian War Memorial (AWM) was appointed in 1982 for an initial period of seven years. The advertisement for the position stated that ""The official historian . . . will assume responsibility for . . . writing one or more volumes."" (2) I am advised that the AWM has fourid no written record of such a statement on the date indicated, but this is broadly consistent with the approach being followed by the official historian at that time. (3).(a) NQ. (b) The official historian was solely responsible for writing chapters 10 to 19 inclusive of 'Crises and Commitments', using research material provided by research officers. . (4) and (5) The official historian has undertaken the following overseas travel at public expense since his appointment: To: UK and USA Date: December 1983-January 1984 Cost: $16,827.89 Purposes: 1. To investigate access to relevant records in archives in the United Kingdom and United States, including the Public Record Office (London), the National Archives (US), and the Kennedy and Johnson presidential libraries. 2. To conduct as much research in primary records as was possible in the time available. 3. To seek information on the various official histories being conducted in the United Kingdom· and the United States, in fields related to that of Australian official history. 4. To make contact with academic historians working in related fields. To: Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam Date: May-June 1985 Cost: This visit was paid for by the Cultural Exchanges program of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am advised that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is currently unable to identify the cost of this visit. The only cost to the AWM was departure tax of $20.00. Purposes: 1. To seek records and recent secondary sources relevant to Australian involvement in the Malayan Emergency. 2. To have discussions with historians in Vietnam working on the Vietnam War. 3. To interview former leaders of the enemy units faced by the Australian forces in Vietnam. To: Germany Date: August 1985 Cost: The cost of this visit was borne by the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am advised that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is currently unable to identify that cost. Purpose: 1. To give a paper on the history of Australian diplomacy to the International Congress of Historical Sciences, the major world historical conference. 2. To attend a meeting of the Commission for the History of International Relations. (The official historian was elected to the board of this Commission.) To: Singapore Date: October 1986 Cost: $3674.85 Purpose: To present a paper on 'Australia and the Origins of the Malayan Emergency' at the 10th Conference of the International Association of Historians of Asia, and to obtain information from historians working in related areas. To: USA Date: June-July 1987 Cost: $4004.17 Purposes: 1. To attend the annual conference of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations. 2. To have discussions with historians and archivists in Washington, DC, with a view to locating the certain records relevant to the Official History. To: UK and France Date: October-November 1987 Cost: $1764.82. The cost of the air fare for this visit was borne by the French Embassy in Canberra. Purposes: 1. To attend a meeting of the Board of the Commission for the History of International Relations. 2. To carry out research for the Official History in the archives of the French Foreign Ministry, Paris, and the Public Record Office, London. To: New Zealand Date: July 1988 Cost: $930.55. This visit was conducted at the request of New Zealand officials and academics. Most of the costs were borne by New Zealand departments. Purposes: 1. To have discussions with historians and officials involved in the establishment of the New Zealand official history of the Southeast Asian Conflicts. 2. To give a paper on the Australian official history to a conference on military history. 3. To carry out such archival research for the Australian official history as was possible in the time available. To: USA Date: June 1989 Cost: $4320.77. This visit was made possible by use of a scheduled RAAF flight, thus incurring no air fare. Purposes: 1. To attend the annual conference of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations. 2. To seek access to Province Senior Advisers' Reports and certain other primary sources held at the Centre for Military History of the US Army, and to gain information on other primary source material relevant to the Official History. 3. To maintain contact with historians and archivists working in areas relevant to the Official History. To: Spain Date: August 1990 Cost: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade contributed $1500. to the cost of the air fare. All other expenses were borne by the official historian personally. Purpose: To attend the quinquennial International Congress of Historical Sciences, including the general meeting of the Commission for the History of International Relations. (The official historian was elected Vice-President of the latter body for the period 1990-95.) To: Germany, Austria Date: April 1991 Cost: $4896.90. Purposes: 1. To give a paper on Australian foreign policy at a conference. 2. To attend a board meeting of the Commission for the History of International Relations; in particular, to discuss the Commission's involvement in a conference scheduled to be held in Canberra in 1996. 3. To give a lecture on Southeast Asian Conflicts at the Diplomatic Academy, Vienna. To: USA Date: August 1991 Cost: $3451.30. Purpose: To participate in a session of a conference of the American Historical Association dealing with US, Australian and New Zealand participation in the Vietnam War. (6) I am advised that the official historian's visits to the US were principally concerned with seeking information concerning the location and quantity of, and conditions of access to, archival material relevant to the Official History, rather than with conducting archival research. The information thus gained has proved most important for research on several volumes of the Official History, particularly those dealing with combat operations in the Vietnam War. For American source material, the volume 'Crises and Commitments' principally used published collections of documents and secondary sources based on extensive archival research. (7) The AWM spent $13,590.27 on the translation of Vietnamese official histories used in the preparation of the Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 19481975. (8) Copies of the Vietnamese histories, which were published in Vietnam in 1986, were made available to the AWM in late 1987. When quotations were sought for their translation in early 1988, the AWM had no information to suggest that any previous translation had been made. No offer to make available a previous translation of these histories was made to the AWM. The book 'Vietnam Remembered' (published in 1990) refers to translations of the Vietnamese histories, but does not indicate when these translations were made. (9) I am advised that the Director of the AWM did not state in the Weekend Australian of 9-10 May 1992 that the AWM had sought legal advice with a view to restraining former members of the Official History Unit from expressing views on the Vietnam War which contradicted the Official History of the Vietnam War. In the Weekend Australian of 2-3 May, a former employee of the Australian War Memorial stated that ""... it is understood (that) the War Memorial has sought legal advice over whether it could restrain members or former members of the Official History Unit from expressing views on the Vietnam War contrary to the views of the Official History even after they had left the Unit! This action suggests that normal academic freedom was not to be tolerated by the War Memorial-at least when it came to the controversial subject of the Vietnam War."" In the Weekend Australian of 9-10 May the Director of the AWM denied that assertion. The AWM had in 1989 sought advice from the Attorney-General's Department on a number of issues arising from private publications by employees of the AWM. Under the heading 'Conflict of Interest' the AWM asked: 6(i) Is there any legal or public service ethical obligation breached by a staff member of the Memorial if he privately publishes while he is employed as a member of staff, or after such employment terminates, views contrary to the views on the same subject expressed by the Official History to which that staff member has contributed? (iii) Can the Director of the Memorial lawfully require a member of his staff to obtain written permission from him in circumstances outlined in paragraph 6(i) ... above to ensure (a) there is no publication of classified material or material within the 'closed' period under the Archives Act, or material otherwise in contravention of the Archives Act (b) there is no infringement of copyright vested in the Commonwealth or (c) there is no publication of material which may be detrimental to the sales of the Official History (d) there are no views expressed contrary to the views on the same subject expressed by the Official History to which that staff member contributed? The AWM was seeking to clarify the extent of its rights to protect the commercial viability of the Official History, on which considerable sums would have been expended. Comparison may be made with the ""No Competing Work"" clause to be found in standard publishing contracts. No restraint on normal freedoms of speech or expression were sought or intended. (10) The AWM called for applications for the Charles Bean postgraduate scholarship for 1993 by placing advertisements in the Australian (twice), the Canberra 1lmes, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Campus Review Weekly, in March and April 1992. Details were also supplied to several international registers of research grants. By the closing date of 12 June three applications had been received. The AWM extended the closing date to 16 October and circulated to the heads of all university history departments an invitation to bring the scholarship to the notice of their colleagues. Three further applications were. received by the closing d8te. Applications will sqe,n be assessed and a recommendation made to the Memorial Council as to whether the 1993 Charles Bean Scholarship should be awarded and, if so, to whom. (Question No. 2041)",289
352,Mr MCARTHUR,NTPS ITPS,"the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 3 November 1992: (1) How many Hagglund motorised vehicles has (a) her Department or (b) the Australian Antarctic Division purchased for use in Antarctica in each year since 1982. (2) What was the cost of the vehicles purchased in each year. (3) How many of the vehicles are being used at each Australian base in Antarctica. (4) How many vehicles were .taken out of service in each year since 1982 and why did the Australian Antarctic Division cease using each vehicle. (5) Have any vehicles been lost as a result of crashing through thin ice; if so, in each case (a) in what year did the incident occur, (b) what was the cost of replacing the vehicle and (c) how old was the vehicle at the time of the incident. (6) Have any Greenland huskies been lost crashing through thin ice; if so, in each case (a) in what year did the incident occur and (b) how many dogs were lost. (7) Will (a) her Department or (b) the Australian Antarctic Division purchase any motorised vehicles in 1992-93 for use in Antarctica; if so (a) have tenders been called, (b) if a tender has been awarded, to whom and (c) how many vehicles will be supplied. (8) Have any restrictions been placed on the use of motorised vehicles, including Hagglunds, in Antarctica; if so, do the restrictions include a stipulation that more than one vehicle must travel to a research area. (9) Have restrictions on the use of motorised vehicles adversely affected Australian biological studies of emperor penguins; if so, what are the adverse effects.",295
353,Mrs KELLY,NTPS ITPS,"The answer to the honourable member'squestion is as follows: (1) The Antarctic Division has purchased the following Hagglunds vehicles: 1983-9; 1984-2; 1986-1; 1990-1; 1991-1 (2) The cost of the Hagglunds vehicles purchased each year is as follows: 1983 6 vehicles @ $117,511 1 vehicle @ $119,393 1 vehicle @ $100,966 1 vehicle @ $113,604 1984 I vehicle @ $114,088 1 vehicle @ $118,954 Antarctica 1986 1 vehicle @ $100,000 1990 1 vehicle @ $177,200 1991 1 vehicle @ $206,162 (3) The present distribution of Hagglunds is: Casey-A; Davis-3; Mawson-4; Head Office-2 (being overhauled). (4) One vehicle was taken out of service (1990) and traded-in on the purchase of a new model of Hagglunds. The remainder of the vehicles have been in service since their purchase. (5) In 1986 a vehicle broke through the sea-ice at Davis and the rear half of the articulated vehicle could not be recovered from the water. The cost of replacing the section is estimated at $40,000. Spare parts were purchased and a replacement section was put together in the Antarctic Division's workshop. The vehicle was three years old at the time of the incident. (6) Although there have been incidences reported of huskies breaking through sea-ice there is no record of huskies having been lost at Australian Antarctic stations in such incidents. While we have no specific details we have advice that dogs have been lost through sea-ice in Antarctica by other nations. (7) The Antarctic Division has co-pleted its vehicle purchase program for the 1992/93 financial year. Tenders were called by the Department of Administrative Services for the vehicle required and a contract· was awarded to Thtts Pty Ltd for a Grove RT528C Rough Terrain Crane. (8) Procedures for the operation of motorised vehicles in Antarctica are included in the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions' (ANARE) Operations Manual and the ANARE Field Manual. These procedures require a minimum of two vehicles for any trip over sea-ice. However, single Hagglunds vehicle operations are permitted under limited conditions at Davis and Mawson during specific periods of the year. (9) Restrictions on the use of motorised vehicles have not adversely affected the conduct of the research programs on emperor penguins. Attorney-General's Department: Bankruptcy Branch (Question No. 2043) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 3 November 1992: (1) Did the answer to question No. 5045 (Hansard, 27 May 1987, page 3454) state that the report of a review of the structure, organisation and methods of his Department's bankruptcy branch, presented to the Secretary of his Department on 20 January 1987, was under consideration: if so, what changes were made as a result of that consideration. (2) Did the Australian Law Reform Commission report on insolvency before the end of 1988: if so, what changes resulting from the report were made to bankruptcy law to protect the commercial interests of the public.",295
354,Mr DUFFY,NTPS ITPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Bankruptcy Branch was upgraded to a Division with the Official Receiver's Offices in the States becoming Branches, thus enabling better sectionalising to be able to more effectively and efficiently manage the workload. The Division is now known as the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. Extensive changes were made to the procedures for handling the administration of bankrupt estates resulting in a substantial reduction in the necessary work in approximately 60% of the estates. This was achieved through the application of cost effectiveness and risk management principles. Changes were also made to many other aspects of the operational policies and practices used, which whilst minor in themselves, amounted in total to a revitalised and forward looking bankruptcy and Official Trustee administration. (2) The Law Reform Commission did present a report about insolvency in 1988, known as the Harmer Report. The Commission examined all aspects of individual and corporate insolvency. The Commission considered that the Bankruptcy Act 1966 was working well, and should be left largely as it is, although it did make a number of recommendations relating to highly technical areas of the law. The Report endorses many of the changes made to the Bankruptcy Act by the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1987, particularly those relating to the provisons of Part X of the Act dealing with arrangements with creditors outside of bankruptcy. However, a number of problems did subsequently emerge in the operation of bankruptcy law which were illustrated by the bankruptcy of a number of former business entrepreneurs. These problems had not been addressed in the Harmer Report. The Government considered that some aspects of bankruptcy law needed drastic overhaul to deal with high-living bankrupts and to that end, the Government passed the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991. Those amendments made the most comprehensive and wide ranging changes to bankruptcy law since the present legislation came into being in 1966. They include: the introduction of a compulsory income contribution regime for persons whose income is above a statutory threshold. Under this regime, income includes the value of non-cash benefits received by a bankrupt and payments made to related third party entities in a case where the bankrupt diverts his or her income at source; new and strengthened grounds for prolonging bankruptcy by objection to discharge; a new administrative discharge system to enable consumer. bankrupts to obtain early discharge from bankruptcy; increased powers for Official Receivers to obtain on behalf of registered trustees information about the affaifs of bankrupts and to recover property and money for the benefit of creditors. These changes came into operation from 1 July 1992 and are significant measures in aid of protecting the commercial interests of the community as a whole. .The Government is committed to a process of ongoing review of bankruptcy laws to ensure that they adequately reflect community values and remain appropriate to protect the interests of the Australian community. Overseas Students (Question. No. 2049) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, 4 November 1992: (1) What funding was allocated to (a) sponsored training program and (b) Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme (EMSS) in (i) 1990-91, (ii) 1991-92 and (iii) 1992-93. (2) How many students are participating in the (a) sponsored training program and (b) EMSS and from which countries do they originate. (3) Have improved names for the program and Scheme been considered to boost their profiles. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Funding levels for the Sponsored )'raining Program (STP) are: (i) 1992-93-$69,053,391 (estimate) (ii) 1991-92-$69,878,422 (iii) 1990-91-$77,005,000 (b) Funding levels for the Equity and Merit Scholarship Scheme (EMSS) are: (i) 1992-93-$50,933,000 (estimate) (ii) 1991-92-$47,483,631 (iii) 1990-91-$27,083,975 (2)(a) A total of 2,955 students are participating in the STP as at 30/7/92 and their countries of origin are: Country Cook Is, French Polynesia, Federated Sts Micronesia, New Caledonia, PNG, Tonga, Vanuatu, Burma, Laos, Philippines, China, Bangladesh, India, Mauritius, Seychelles, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania, Zambia, Jordan, St Vincent, Barbados, Fiji, Palau, Kiribati, Niue, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Western Samoa, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Indo-China, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldive Islands, Botswana, Gambia, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Uganda, Sth Africa, Guyana, Belize and Malta (b) A total of 2,834 students are participating the EMSS as at 30/7/92 and their countries of origin are: Country Cook Is, Federated States Micronesia, Rep Marshall Is, Nauru, Niue, Solomon Is, Tuvalu, Western Samoa, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Mauritius, Nigeria, Fiji, Palau, Kiribati, New Caledonia, PNG, Tonga, Vanuatu, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, China, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri-Lanka, Kenya and Uganda (3) Yes; the Equity and Merit Scholarship Scheme will be known as the John Crawford Scholarship Scheme with effect from the 1993 academic year student intake. The name recognises the significant contribution of the late Sir John Crawford to development, especially in our region. Lead-soldered Cans (Question No. 2052) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 4 November 1992: (1) Did a study commissioned by the National Food Authority find that the level of lead is up to 19 times greater in soldered cans than in welded cans. (2) What action is being taken to (a) stop the sale of food in lead-soldered cans and (b) enforce the Australian maximum permitted concentration of lead in foods in imported cans. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (1) No. The survey was conducted by the Western Australian Department of Health at the request of the National Food Authority. The survey sampled 96 lead soldered cans, 84 welded cans and four aluminium cans. The cans which were selected were most likely to be lead contaminated i.e. soldered cans; older cans; and those containing acidic food. The study found that the mean level of lead in food packaged in soldered cans was almost nine times, not nineteen times, the mean level of lead in food packaged in welded cans. However, only six out of 184 samples exceeded the Maximum Permitted Concentration (MPC) of lead in foods. It should be noted that the proportion of lead soldered cans in the study is far greater than the proportion of lead soldered cans in the marketplace. (2)(a) The Australian Food Standards Code sets out the MPCs of lead in foods. The Australian MPCs for lead are strict by international standards. The State Departments of Health and the Australian in Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) enforce the Food Standards Code. (b) The AQIS is aware of those countries and brands of canned foods of concern. A high priority is being placed on ensuring that imported canned foods meet the Australian Food Standards for lead. Acidic canned foods, specifically peaches, tomatoes, and tomato products were in the medium risk category for lead and can integrity of the Imported Food Inspection Program prior to the WA. study. Since the study, pickled vegetables have also been placed in the medium risk category for lead and can integrity and accordingly are also subject to sampling on entry to Australia. The States and Territories are notified by AQIS if any consignments fail to meet the Standard in order that appropriate action may be taken. Roads: Deaths (Question No. 2053) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 4 November 1992: (1) How many persons conveyed by (a) motor vehicles, (b) motorcycles and (c) bicycles died from (i) head injuries and (ii) injUries other than head injuries in (A) 1987, (B) 1988, (C) 1989, (D) 1990 and (E) 1991. (2) What was the ratio of deaths per thousand persons conveyed by (a) motor, vehicles, (b) motorcycles and (c) bicycles from (i) head injuries and (ii) injuries other than head injuries in (A) 1987, (B) 1988, (C) 1989, (D) 1990 and (E) 1991. (3) What was the ratio of deaths by head injury to deaths from other injuries of children under 13 years of age in (a) 1987, (b) 1988, (c) 1989, (d) 1990 and (e) 1991 and in each case how were the injuries sustained. (4) What is the breakdown by causal factor, such as motorist, cyclist or environment, of all bicycle fatalities in (a) 1987, (b) 1988, (c) 1989, (d) 1990 and (e) 1991. (5) Is there a cost-effective bicycle helmet which has inbuilt protection from the sun for the rider. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the increase honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Office of Road Safety does not hold information on road fatalities for all the years asked, but only for the years 1988 and 1990. Therefore, all answers given below, unless other-· wise specified, refer only to 1988 and 1990. The data refers strictly to road crash fatalities. There are a number of fatalities that occur off the road by motorcyclists and bicyclists appear in road crash fatality data. Mandatory wearing of bicycle helmets was introduced first on 1 July 1990 in Victoria and later in all other jurisdictions. For questions (1), (2) and (3), deaths due to injuries are defined as deaths that have resulted directly from injuries sustained in the road crash where the head injury was the most severe of all injuries and was rated as ""severe"" or worse viated Injury Scale). Between 1988 and 1990 there were changes to the coding scales and procedures used to collect Motorcyclist this data. It is likely that the apparent increase in Bicyclist the overall proportion of deaths attributed to head Motor vehicle driver injuries in the tables below, reflect only this change Motor vehicle passenger in methodology. If so, the relatively small. apparent increase in the proportion of deaths due to head injuries among bicyclists may reflect an actual decrease in this proportion. (1)Table 1: Numbers* of road fatalities resulting from head injuries and non head injuries Road User and Injury 1988 1990 Motor vehicle occupant (head) 496 447 Motor vehicle occupant (non-head) 1300 873 Motorcyclist (head) 94 95 Motorcyclist (non-head) 218 142 Bicyclist (head) 34 32 Bicyclist (non-head) 48 37 TOTAL (head) 624 574 TOTAL (non-head) 1566, 1052 *Nurnbers reflect only those cases with known injury data It should be noted that 78 % of bicyclists killed in 1990 and 30% of motorcyclists killed were not wearing helmets. A recent detailed report was produced by the Monash University Accident Research Centre called ""Evaluation of Mandatory Bicycle Helmet Use in Victoria, Australia"". This report showed that, in the first year after the introduction of mandatory helmet wearing in Victoria, there was an immediate large in helmet wearing rates and considerable reductions in the number of bicyclists killed or admitted to hospital after sustaining head injuries. In both Victoria and New South Wales, the total number of bicyclist deaths recorded in 1991 was half of the 1990 figure. For Australia as a whole, the reduction was 27%. This difference is probably due to the later introduction of mandatory helmet wearing, or the less rigorous enforcement of helmet which do not laws, in other States. (2) Death rates per trip are not available, but a study based on a detailed analysis of travel patterns in 1985-86 (Federal Office of Road Safety head Consultant's Report CR 70) provided the following data on fatalities per vehicle kilometre travelled: Table 2a: Fatality rate per 100 million kilometres (Abbretravelled in Australia by road user Road User Fatality Rate 30.71 5.02 1.35 1.19 The study did not divide the data by cause of death, but using the rates of head injury fatalities and other fatalities in 1990, the following breakdown is obtained: Table 2b: Fatality rate per 100 million kilometres travelled in Australia by road user and injury (head or non-head) Road user injuries Motorcyclist 12.28 Bicyclist 2.31 Motor vehicle driver* 0.46 Motor vehicle passenger* 0.40 *Percentages used to estimate the head injury death rate are from the category ""motor vehicle occupant"" (see question (1». These figures reflect the fact that car occupants are much better protected in a crash than motorcyclists and bicyclists. Fatality rates calculated per hour travelled would emphasise even more the comparatively high fatality rate of bicyclists to motor vehicle occupants, as bicycles are a much slower means of transport. Helmets are the only feasible means of protecting the heads of motorcyclists and bicyclists in a crash, but other protection systems are available in pasl!enger vehicles. The Fedeml Office of Road Safety recently sponsored a major study of injury to occupants of passenger cars, particularly those in the front seats. That study identified a range of ways to reduce or prevent head and other injuries, including improved restraint systems, energy absorbing steering wheels, upper area padding and air bags. On 16 December 1992, the Government released a new Design Rule (ADR 69/00) called Full Frontal Impact Protection. This rule requires car manufacturers to meet higher safety standards, specifically, in terms of maximum allowable injury criteria. (3)Table 3: Ratio of deaths by head injury to those from non-head injury for children under 13 years of age* Transport Mode (how injury sustained) 1988 Motor Vehicle 0.67:1 Pedestrian 0.75:1 Bicycle 0.90:1 TOTAL 0.73:1 *Note: these figures are based on small numbers The change in the total (all children) ratio from 1988 to 1990 reflects the apparent overall change in the percentage of road fatalities due to head injuries (see introductory comments on changes to data collection methodology). (4)Table 4: Percentage of bicycle fatalities by road Rate for Rate for user at fault head non-head injuries Causal factor 1988 1990 18.43 Cyclist 64.6% 64.6% 2.71 Motorist 25.6% 25.3% 0.89 Both cyclist & motorist 4.9% 5.1% 0.79 No one at fault* 3.7% 5.1% Pedestrian 1.2% 0.0% *This includes vehicle defects and environmental factors (5)There are no helmets in Australia that incorporate sun protection for the wearer.. However, a Victorian company, ""Headliners"", makes a bicycle helmet accessory called a headliner which protects the wearer's face and neck from the sun's harmful rays and can be used with virtually any helmet. The headliner is made in Victoria and is available at most bicycle shops in Australia. The headliner costs between $15 and $17. Human Rights (Question No. 2054) Mr Mack asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 November 1992: (1) Has he consulted with his State or Territory' counterparts about making the declaration under Article 14 of the 1965 International Convention on the Eliinination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. (2) Which States and Territories have supported the making of the declaration and on what date and in what form did each indicate its support. (3) Did the Minister for Foreign Mfairs and Tmde write to him on 11 May 1992 requesting that Australia expeditiously pursue the making of declarations under (a) Article 41 of the 1966 1990 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1.16:1 and (b) Articles 21 and 22 of the 1984 Convention 0.62:1 Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 1.14:1 0.86:1 (4) What was the (a) date and (b) mode of consultation with each State and Territory on each of the matters referred to in part (3) and (c) on what dates and to what effect has each State and Territory responded.",296
355,Mr DUFFY,NTPS ITPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The States and Territories which supported the making of the declaration under Article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination are as follows: Australian Capital Territory - by letter of 5 May 1992 Victoria - by letter of 25 May 1992 South Australia - by letter of 28 May 1992 Queensland - by letter of 11 June 1992 Western Australia - by letter of 9 July 1992 (3) Yes. (4) The issue of the making of these declarations has been raised in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General over a number of years. I consulted formally with the State and Territory Attorneys-General by letter of 9 April 1992 concerning the declaration under Article 22 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and by letter of 29 September 1992 concerning the declarations under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 21 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The State and Territory Attorneys-General responded as follows in respect of the making of the declaration under Article 22 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment: Victoria, by letter of 25 May 1992, supported the making of the declaration; New South Wales, by letter of 18 August 1992, opposed the making of the declaration; South Australia, by letter of 28 May 1992, supported the making of the declaration; Queensland, by letter of 11 June 1992, supported the making of the declaration; Western Australia, by letter of 9 July 1992, supported the making of the declaration; Australian Capital Territory, by letter of 5 May 1992, supported the making of the declaration; Northern Territory, by letter of 30 April 1992, opposed the making of the declaration. My letter of 29 September 1992, concerning the· declarations under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 21 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, did not require an answer. Nevertheless, responses were received on this matter as follows: Queensland, by letter of 6 November 1992, supported the making of the declarations; South Australia, by letter of 2 November 1992, supported the making of the declarations; Victoria, by letter of 29 October 1992, indicated that the making of the declarations was primarily a matter for the Federal Government; Tasmania, by letter of 26 October 1992, opposed the making of the declarations; Australian Capital Territory, by telephone on 19 October 1992, indicated that the Territory had no new matters to raise in respect of the making of the declarations; Northern Territory, by letter of 12 October 1992, indicated that the Territory had no new matters to raise in respect of the making of the declarations. Russell Island Development Association: Grant (Question No. 2057) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 4 November 1992: (1) Did the Russell Island Development Association Inc. receive a grant of $10 000 under the Local Energy Efficiency Projects Scheme. (2) Was the Association advised of the grant on 22 Sep-mber 1992. (3) Has the grant been (a) suspended or (b) cancelled; if so, (i) when was the decision to suspend or cancel the grant made and (ii) why. (4) What consultation did he or the Department of Primary Industries and Energy undertake before determining the allocation of the grant. (5) Did the consultation referred to in part (4) involve the (a) Redland Shire Council, (b) Member for Bowman or (c) Member for Forde. (6) Was the grant suspended following intervention by the (a) Chairman of the Redland Shire Council, (b) Member for Bowman or (c) Member for Forde. (7) What will happen to the grant. Mr Griffiths - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On the basis of its application, a grant of $10 000 was approved for the Russell Island Development Association (RIDA) under the Local Energy Efficiency Projects (LEEP) Scheme. (2) Yes. (3) The grant was suspended on 19 October 1992. The Department took into account representations received from the Redland Shire Council, the Russell Island Progress Association and the Member for Bowman which provided information not previously available to the Department and, in the Department's view, called into question the viability of the RIDA project. The Department· then invited further, submission for the purpose of reviewing the future of the project. In light of the further information received, Department terminated the Agreement with RIDA on 2 December 1992 as it was not viable to proceed with the grant in the face of very considerable, and apparently irreconcilable, opposition from several parties. In the circumstances, it was the Department's view that it was highly unlikely that RID A's stated aims for the project could be carried out effectively and in accordance with the underlying aims and criteria of the LEEP scheme. The Department was also concerned that to proceed with the grant would have a reasonable likelihood of embroiling the Department and the scheme in wider issues which were of no direct concern to it. (4) None. Information provided in RIDA's application did not suggest that there was a need for the Department to consult further with any party prior to a decision being made. (5) See (4) above. (6) See (3) above. . (7) See (3) above. Antarctic Huskies (Question No. 2058) Mr Carlton asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 4 November 1992: (1) Does a formal contract exist between the Commonwealth and the prospective US owners of huskies from the Mawson Base in Antarctica; if so, what are the details of (a) any consideration to be received by the Commonwealth, (b) the conditions which necessitate the huskies' removal before the April 1994 Madrid protocol deadline, (c) provisions in the contract which protect the heritage value of the huskies and (d) other stipulations regarding the huskies' future well being; if not, is the Commonwealth under any contractual obligation to remove the huskies from Antarctica during the 1992-93 summer. (2) Do the Finance Regulations require her to obtain the permission of the Minister for Finance before offering the huskies as gifts to US citizens; if so, did she obtain the permission of the Minister for Finance. (3) Is she able to say whether the Auditor General has been asked to investigate apparent irregularities in the circumstances of her disposal of the huskies. (4) Has she followed recognised Government procedures for the disposal of Commonwealth assets through auction or tender thereby giving Australians the opportunity to retain the huskies; if not, why not. (5) Did an ethics committee examine the options for the future placement of the huskies; if so, did (a) the committee reach its conclusion to send the the huskies to the USA before two significant Australian proposals had been examined and (b) a member of the committee lead certain Australians to believe they were to receive the huskies. (6) Is she able to say whether the Commonwealth is under threat of legal action because of her decision to send the huskies to the USA. (7) Is she able to say whether the Australian Veterinary Association Ltd (Victoria Division) supports keeping the huskies at a facility in Victoria if they must be removed from Antarctica. (8) Did she state to Parliament in 1991 that she would consult widely with the Australian community on the future of the huskies; if so, did she consult widely. (9) Have the Friends of the Polar Sledge Dogs been refused the opportunity to discuss their point of view with her; if so, why. (10) Is she able to say whether the Victorian Alpine Resorts Commission has issued at least one licence for an operator to run a sledge dog team in the snow outside national parks in winter. (11) Are the huskies being sent to Minnesota USA; if so, is she able to say whether the (a) summer temperature in Minnesota rises above 25 degrees centigrade and (b) climate of Minnesota is similar to that of alpine Victoria. (12) Do environmental lobby groups support her decision to export the huskies after their removal from Antarctica; if so, what evidence is there for that support. (13) Is she able to say whether the British Government has decided to allow their huskies to continue to live in Antarctica. (14) Is she able to say whether the Australian Veterinary Association has reversed its original position on the need to export Australian huskies following the British decision. (15) Has she insisted upon the need to remove the huskies in November 1992; if so, does the insistence prejudice the maintenance of good order and conduct by members of the Australian Antarctic Expedition at Mawson and aboard Aurora Australis. (16) Does the expeditious removal of the huskies entail driving them out on to the edge of the Antarctic sea ice; if so, are the dogs' lives at risk and why should they be placed in that situation.",300
356,Mrs KELLY,NTPS ITPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1-16) There is a requirement under the Madrid Protocol for the huskies to be removed from the Antarctic Treaty area. The decision to transfer the huskies to operators in the USA was based on a judgement as to what was in the best interests of the dogs, including maintaining them as working teams, suitable climate and the operators' proven records of managing the dogs as working teams urider conditions similar to those at Mawson. Australian proposals were fully investigated before a decision was made to transfer the dogs to North America. The Antarctic animal ethics committee agreed that the North American option was the best in terms of the welfare of the dogs. The US operators have been advised that they will be sent nineteen dogs and three pups and have made decisions on the basis of this advice. The removal Of the dogs from Mawson is timed by reference to the circumstances for settling the dogs in North America. The provisions of the Audit Act have been complied with and the procedures followed are appropriate and proper. There is no formal contract which establishes specific conditions for the transfer, nor will the Commonwealth receive any payment. An inspection team, including representatives of the RSPCA, the Antarctic animal ethics committee and a veterinarian, further examined options for the placement in Australia of the pups and older dogs which were beyond working age. It was made clear to Australian operators during this second inspection that the purpose of the inspection was to consider options to place the three pups and the older dogs and I am advised that the members of that team consider that nothing was said or done which could give rise to an expectation that the huskies would be given to any particular kennel. It has been decided that the older dogs will be left in Antarctica for the present and at the end of the 1993-94 season the remaining dogs will be returned to Australia. A decision on the location and housing of these dogs will be deferred until closer to the time, but again it will be made in the best interests of the dogs' welfare in consultation with the ethics committee. I see no point in pursuing those options at this time and possibly raising false expectations. The British Government has advised that it is committed fully to the implementation of the Madrid Protocol and will be reviewing its position before the April 1994 date prescribed in the Protocol. As the honourable member is no doubt aware Argentina, the only other nation with dogs in the Antarctic, is already removing them. It is irresponsible and insulting to expeditioners to suggest that it could prejudice the maintenance of ""good order and discipline"" or that the dogs' lives would be put at risk in the manner suggested. International Organisations (Question No. 2059) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 4 November 1992: Since the answer was provided to question No. 2138 (Hansard, 19 November 1985, page 3175), has Australia paid its contributions to each of the UN specialised agencies on time and in full as requested by the agencies; if not, in each case what (a) sum was requested, (b) date for payment was requested, (c) sums were paid, (d) dates were the sums paid on and (e) were the reasons for late or smaller payments being made? Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes, except for contributions to the following organisations. United Nations Regular Budget (UN) 1987 Contribution (a) USDll,819,230 (b) 12 January 1987 (c) USDll,819,230 (AUDI8,279,044) (d) 21 January 1987 (e) The payment of Australia's 1987 contribution was delayed for a short period to enable consideration of the proposed 1987 UN regular budget by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) 1991 Contribution (a) USDl,439,531 and French Francs 15,345,443 (b) 1 January 1991 (c) USDl,439,531 and French Francs 15,345,443 (AUD5,162,871) (d) 22 July 1991 (e) The payment of Australia's contribution to , UNESCO for 1991 was delayed until the 1991-92 financial year due to domestic budgetary considerations. Accordingly, the payment was made as early as possible in July 1991. 1992 Contribution (a) USDl,776,063 and French Francs 16,253,767 (b) 1 January 1992 (c) USDl,776,063 and French Francs 16,253,767 (AUD6,690,523) (d) 14 July 1992 (e) Again due to budgetary considerations, the 1992 contribution was made as early as possible in the 1992-93 financial year. It is expected that this arrangement will continue in future years due to budgetary constraints. United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UNFAO) 1990 Contribution (a) USD5,233,920 (b) 1 January 1990 (c) USD5,233,920 (AUD6,927,756) (d) 16 May 1990 (e) The payment of Australia's contribution to the UNFAO for 1990 was delayed due to domestic budgetary constraints. 1991 Contribution (a) USD5,233,920 (b) 1 January 1991 (c) USDS,233,920 (AUD6,738,634) (d) 25 July 1991 (e) The payment of Australia's contribution to UNFAO for 1991 was delayed until the 1991-92 financial year due to domestic budgetary considerations. Accordingly, the payment was made as early as possible in July 1991. 1992 Contribution (a) USD5,797,074 (b) 1 January 1992 (c) USD5,797,074 (AUD7,764,632) (d) 23 - uly 1992 (e) As for UNESCO above, the 1992 contribution was made as early as possible in the 1992-93 financial year. It is expected that this arrangement will continue in future years due to budgetary straints. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 1988 Contribution (a) USD315,356 and Austrian Schillings (ATS) 24,410,892 (b) 1 January 1988 (c) USD315,356 (AUD443,165) and ATS 24,410,892 (AUD2,943,557) (d) 25 January 1988 (e) The original estimate for AuStralia's 1988 contribution to the IAEA was based on the actual 1987 contribution. The AUD equivalent of the contribution increased above initial estimates due to a 0.6% real increase in the IAEA budget, an increase in the ATS component in the assessment which appreciated against the AUD while the USD depreciated but comprised a much smaller portion of the assessment. Additional funding was sought from the Advance to the Minister for Finance pending Additional Estimates to meet the resulting increase in the AUD value of the assessment. Therefore, payment was delayed until additional funds had been received. 1989 Contribution (a) USD271,226 and ATS27,214,037 (b) 1 January 1989 (c) USD271,226 (AUD312,066) and ATS27,214,037 (AUD2,440,799) (d) 12 January 1989 (e) The original estimate for Australia's 1989 contribution to the IAEA was based on the actual 1988 contribution. Notwithstanding the decrease in the USD portion of the assessment, the ATS component rose by ATS2.8 million (rounded) necessitating an application to the Advance to the Minister for Finance seeking additional funds pending Additional Estimates. As a result payment of the contribution was not completed until 12 January 1989. 1990 Contribution (a) USD262,935 and ATS26,183,477 (b) 1 January 1990 (c) USD262,935 (AUD334,523) and ATS26,183,477 (AUD (d) 28 February 1990 and 29 January 1990 respectively. (e) The original estimate for Australia's 1990 contribution to the IAEA was based on the actual 1989 contribution. At the time payment of Australia's contribution to the IAEA was requested the AUD equivalent of the assessment had increased above the estimate due to exchange rate variations. The payment was delayed due to con- administrative processes required in obtaining additional funds through the Advance to the Minister for Finance. A cheque for the USD component of the assessment was forwarded by the Department of Finance Regional Office in Washington to the organisation's bank on 16 January 1990. It became apparent, however, that the cheque had not been deposited into the lAEA's account. A· stop was placed on the cheque and a second was issued on 28 February 1990. 1991 Contribution (a) USD300,347 and ATS 28,975,000 (b) 1 January 1991 (c) USD300,347 (AUD391,791), ATS22,448,858 (AUD2,800,496) and ATS6,526,141 (AUD800,372) being the outstanding ATS component of the assessment. (d) 18 December 1990,21 December 1990 and 28 January 1991 respectively. (e).The shortfall of ATS6,526,141 occurred due to exchange rate variations. Further funds were sought through the Advance to the Minister for Finance pending Additional Estimates to enable the completion of the payment. 1992 Contribution (a) USD 305,321 and ATS 29,246,892 (b) 1 January 1992 (c) ATS 28,811,636 (AUD3,403,OOO), USD305,321 (AUD405,527) and USD41,654 (AUD54,899), which represented the outstanding ATS component of the assessment in USD terms, respectively. (d) 23 December 1991,28 January 1992 and 29 April 1992 respectively. (e) The initial part payment of Australia's 1992 contribution to the IAEA was made at a weaker exchange rate than that used in estimating the 1992 assessed contribution. Additional funds were sought through the Advance to the Minister for Finance pending Additional Estimates in order to pay the outstanding amounts. Additional funds were sought from the Advance to the Minister for Finance as a Final Charge to make the third payment following a further depreciation in the AUD. Human Rights (Question No. 2060) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 November 1992: Further to the answer to question No. 1751 (Hansard, 6 October 1992, page 1501) and following his correspondence with his State and Territory counterparts and consultations in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General at Taupo, New Zealand, on 14 October 1992, has the necessary paperwork been prepared for a submission to the Federal Executive Council concerning declarations under (a) Article 14 of the Intemational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, (b) Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and (c) Articles and 22 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; if not, when will the necessary paperwork be prepared.",302
357,Mr DUFFY,NTPS ITPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have completed my consultations with State and Territory governments on all the declarations. A majority of States and Territories have supported the making of the declarations. I am at present consulting with Ministerial colleagues on the making of the declarations allowing for individual complaints. I expect that consultation to conclude in the near future. Once those consultations have been completed, the responsibility for preparation and submission of the necessary documents to the Executive Council for approval is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. RAAF: Pilots (Question No. 2063) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 5 November, 1992: (1) How many pilot positions were there in the RAAF in (a) 1989, (b) 1990, (c) 1991 and (d) 1992. (2) How many pilot positions will there be in 1993. (3) How many pilots serve in the RAAF (a) in total and (b) in operational positions. (4) What is the (a) name of and (b) number of pilots in each operational squadron. (5) How many qualified flying instructors (QFIs) serve in the RAAF (a) in total and (b) in operational positions. (6) How many (a) pilots and (b) specialist pilots, including QFIs, test pilots and fighter combat instructors, resigned from the RAAF in (i) 1989, (ii) 1990, (iii) 1991 and (iv) 1992 to 4 November. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The number of positions stated is for all ranks of WGCDR and below. There are no dedicated positions for GPCAPT and above that must be filled by a pilot. The number of pilot positions in the RAAF in the following years was (a) 1989822, (b) 1990-811, (c) 1991-765 and (d) 1992754. (2) On the same basis as above there will be 728 pilot positions in the RAAF in 1993. (3) For this part and following parts, GPCAPTs and above are included when describing strength statistics. In all parts of the question 'operational positions' is interpreted as positions at operational 21 squadrons. The flying schools have not been included. The number of pilots that serve in the RAAF (a) in total is 742 and (b) in operational positions is 389. (4) The (a) name of each squadron and (b) the number of pilots in each operational squadron are provided in the following table. (5) The number of qualified flying instructors (QFIs) serving in the RAAF (a) in total is 230 and (b) in operational positions is 35. (6) All pilots in the RAAF are considered to be specialists on their particular aircraft type. Therefore, the numbers provided relate only to those who were qualified QFIs, test pilots and fighter combat instructors. The number of (a) pilots who resigned from the RAAF in the following years is (i) 1989100, (ii) 1990-60, (iii) 1991-29 and (iv) 1992 to 4 November-39. The number of (b) specialist pilots, including QFIs, test pilots and fighter combat instructors, who resigned from the RAAF in the following years are (i) 1989-27, (ii) 199025, (iii) 1991-10, (iv) 1992 to 4 November-15.

(2) Has Australia assisted the PNGDF by supplying (a) helicopters and (b) patrol boats; if so, (i) what types and (ii) how many of each have been supplied. (3) If Australia has supplied helicopters or patrol boats, are they being used in or near Bougainville; if so, (a) how many helicopters or patrol boats are being used, (b) what roles are they performing and (c) have the PNGDF used them for offensive actions against the people of Bougainville or their vehicles, craft or positions; if so, (i) what actions, (ii) when did the actions occur and (iii) in what circumstances. (4) Is Australia supplying Papua New Guinea with high speed light boats; if so, will the PNGDF use them to tighten the blockade of Bougainville. (5) Does the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 prohibit Australians from enlisting as mercenaries in foreign wars. (6) Did the Hon. Lionel Bowen, as Attorney General, use a ministerial power in 1989 under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 to exempt Australians from the Act's prohibition in respect of operations by the PNGDF. (7) Are Australian-supplied helicopters operated by the PNGDF in Bougainville piloted by Australians; if so, are the Australian pilots' salaries paid from a special fund of $1 million provided annually by the Commonwealth. (8) Was the funding referred to in part (7) recently renewed. (9) Did the Commonwealth provide a total of $2.713 million to Papua New Guinea in 1991 and 1992 to meet contract payments to Australian helicopter pilots in Bougainville and for related expenditures. (10) Is he able to say whether the chiefs of the central region of Bougainville issued a joint statement about 1 November 1992 (a) claiming that by providing military aid to Papua New Guinea, Australia is helping to kill civilians and (b) calling upon Australia to stop providing the military aid. (11) Is he able to say whether (a) the Papua New Guinea Government or the PNGDF is preventing Guinea journalists from visiting Bougainville and (b) there are any journalists in Bougainville. (12) Is he able to say whether a PNGDF c9mmander recently required an Australian journalist to leave BougainviUe, if so, why. (13) Will he request the Papua New Guinea Government to assure entry to Bougainville and free movement there by journalists.",304
358,Mr KEATING,ATIONAL SQUADRONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The equipment and material provided by Australia to Papua New Guinea under the Defence Co-operation Program is to help maintain and develop the capabilities of the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) to carry out its nation-wide tasks, rather than for any specific situation. This includes, inter alia, PNGDF operations on Bougainville, where the PNG Government is dealing with an armed secessionist movement. Apart from the provision of the Iroquois helicopters, for which conditions of use were agreed between the two Governments, it is up to Papua New Guinea, as an independent and sovereign country, to decide where and how its defence assets are employed to carry out national security functions. Papua New Guinea understands that Australia expects the equipment we have supplied to be used in a way which is consistent with the purposes for which it has been given. (2) (a) and (b) Yes (i) Iroquois helicopters, Attack class Patrol Boats and Pacific Patrol Boats (ii) Four Iroquois helicopters were supplied to Papua New Guinea in 1989. A replacement helicopter was delivered in September 1992 for one of the four which crashed in the Highlands in March 1991. Australia handed over four Attack class Patrol Boats to Papua New Guinea at Independence in 1975. As these boats approached the end of their productive life, they were replaced with four Pacific Patrol Boats which were handed over to Papua New Guinea between 1987 and 1989. (3) I understand that the PNGDF has used its helicopters and patrol boats for operations on and near Bougainville. As I noted in my answer to (1) above, the PNG Government has responsibility for the conduct of operations by its security forces on Bougainville. Conditions of use have been agreed between the two Governments only in the case of the helicopters supplied by Australia. These provide for the helicopters to be used for troop transportation, for patrolling and surveillance activities, and for medical evacuation purposes, and allow for defensive fire from the helicopters for self-protection. We have sought, and received, assurances from the PNG Government that these conditions are being adhered to. (4) No (5) The Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 generally prohibits Australian citizens and residents from preparing for, or engaging in, hostile activities in foreign countries. Service in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign state does not constitute an offence under the Act. (6) Section 9 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 prohibits the recruitment in Australia of persons to serve in or with foreign armed forces, except where a declaration is made under subsection 9 (2) of the Act. On 20 July 1989, Mr Bowen made such a declaration to pefffilt the recruitment of personnel for the purpose of facilitating the use of 4 Iroquois helicopters supplied to the Papua New Guinea Government by the Australian Government. (7) As part of the agreement for the supply of the helicopters in 1989, Austmlia undertook to provide up to $1 million annually for three years for contract flying and servicing of the helicopters. The funds have been dmwn on by the PNG Department of Defence to contract a PNG firm to operate and maintain the helicopters. I understand that some of the civilians employed by the firm are Australians. (8) Australia has agreed to provide up to $1 million this financial year as the PNGDF does not yet have a sufficient number of suitably qualified personnel to take over tl}.e operation and maintenance of the helicopters. . (9) Funds of $0.798 milli-n and $0.970 million were provided to Papua New Guinea in 1990-91 and 1991-92 respectively to enable the PNG Department of Defence to pay for the contract flying and servicing of the helicopters. Up to $1 million is available this financial year for the same purpose. (to) I am aware of reports of such a statement, but I have not seen a copy of it. (11) Access to Bougainville by all persons, including journalists, is controlled by the PNG Government. This does not mean that journalists are prevented from visiting Bougainville; in recent weeks, journalists from the ABC, Channel 9 and 'The Age' newspaper have visited centres in North Solomons Province. I am not aware of any journalists in the Province at the present time. (12) I am advised that an ABC crew, after a stay of several days, was required by PNG security forces to leave Bougainville on 17 October 1992. I understand that this action resulted from a misunderstanding on the part of the PNG security forces in Bougainville about the permitted duration of the crew's visit. (13) The Australian Government maintains that the Bougainville issue, including travel to and from the island, is an internal matter for the Papua New Guinea Government. As noted above, a number of journalists and media crews have visited the island during recent weeks. I also note that a special position has been created within the PNG Prime Minister's department to facilitate media coverage of the Bougainville issue. During discussions with their PNG counterparts over recent months, my Ministers have consistently encouraged the PNG Government to keep open lines of communication on Bougainville. Academic Qualifications (Question No. 2077) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 10 November 1992: (1) Did Australia accept the 1983 Unesco Regional Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in Asia and the Pacific on 23 October 1985. (2) Did Australia accede to the 1979 Unesco Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees concerning Higher Education in the States belonging to the Europe Region on 6 August 1986. (3) Has consideration been given to Australia's accession to the (a) 1974 Unesco Regional Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean, (b) 1976 Unesco International Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in the Arab and European States bordering on the Mediterranean, (c) 1978 Unesco Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in the Arab States and (d) 1981 Unesco Regional Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Certificates, Diplomas, Degrees and other Academic Qualifications in Higher Education in the African States. (4) Has New Zealand acceded to the (a) 1953 European Convention on the Equivalence of Diplomas leading to Admission to Universities and (b) 1964 Protocol to the 1953 European Convention. (5) Has consideration been given to Australia's accession to the (a) 1953 European Convention on the Equivalence of Diplomas leading to Admission to Universities, (b) 1964 Protocol to the 1953 European Convention and (c) 1990 European Convention on the General Equivalence of Periods of University Study.",305
359,Mr BEAZLEY,ATIONAL SQUADRONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) (a)-(d)- No. (4) (a) Yes; (b) Yes. , (5) Consideration has been given to Australia acceding to the (a) 1953 ,European Convention on the Equivalence of Diplomas leading to Admission to Universities and to (b) the 1964 Protocol to the 1953 European Convention. Advice has been received this year by my Department from the Attorney-General's Department on the legal implications of accession for Australia should Australia be invited to accede to the Convention and Protocol. Serious consideration has not been given to acceding to the (c) 1990 European Convention on the General Equivalence of Periods of University Study. Contraceptives (Question No. 2079)",307
360,Mr MCARTHUR,ATIONAL SQUADRONS,"the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 10 November 1992: (1) What new (a) contraceptive drugs, (b) intrauterine devices, (c) implants or (d) other contracepARTG tives have been approved for use in Australia since 1984. (2) With respect to each product referred to in part (1), what was the (a) date of approval by either the Department of Health, Housing and Cpmmunity Services or the Therapeutic Goods Administration and (b) year it was authorised for use by (i) British and (ii) US health authorities.

(4) Is he able to say what contraceptive products having more than a one percent market share are in use in (a) Britain and (b) the USA but have not been authorised for sale in Australia. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since 1 January 1984 the following have been approved for use in Australia. (a) Contraceptive Drugs (listed according to brand name) (i) Nordette 50 (ii) Synphasic 21 (iii) Trifeme 28 (iv) Monofeme 28 (v) Logynon ED (vi) levien ED (vii) Diane 35 (viii) Diane 35 ED (ix) Marvelon 21 day (x) Marvelon 28 day (b) Intra-uterine devices (IUD) The Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) presently contains one IUD approved for supply. The Multiload Cu 250 was originally approved in 1981 following evaluation by the Drug Evalu c ation Branch (DEB), and has been available in Australia since that time. The product was reapproved in December 1991 following evaluation by the Therapeutic Devices Branch for safety and efficacy concerns. An interim approval was given to the sponsor Organon (Australia) Pty Ltd during the evaluation period. . (c) Contraceptives implants-Nil (d) Other Contraceptives Contraceptives, such as condoms and diaphragms, are listable therapeutic devices on the and therefore not evaluated before they can be supplied in Australia. However, new products of this type are checked for compliance to Standards and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). (2}Contraceptive drugs (a) Nordette 50-9 May 1986 Synphasic 21-28 April 1988 Trifeme 28-20 May 1992 Monofeme 28-20 May 1992 Logynon ED-29 May 1992 LevIen ED-29 May 1992 Diane 35-25 June 1992 Diane 35 ED-25 June 1992 Marvelon 21-18 November 1992 Marvelon 28-18 November 1992 (b) The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) requests details of foreign approvals from sponsor companies when evaluating applications for new chemical entities. The TGA does not require subsequent updates of such information. For applications to market generic versions of drugs already on the Australian market, sponsors are not required to provide information on foreign as. The first six drugs listed in answer to question l(a) were generic versions of drugs already available on the Australian market. Details of UK and US approval dates for the remaining four products are as follows: Diane 35-(i) UK: not approved as a contraceptive as of 10/9/91.

(b) (i) The product was granted a licence in Great Britain in 1979; and (ii) has not been sold in the USA. (3) The Commonwealth does not release details of the existence or progress of applications to market therapeutic goods as such information is commercially confidential. (4) The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services does not hold information on the market share of contraceptives in the UK or US. Roundabout (Question No. 2080) Mrs GALLUS asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 10 November 1992: Does the Federal Office of Road Safety publish a magazine entitled Roundabout; if so, (a) how many copies are published, (b) how often is it published, (c) what is the unit cost, including production and distribution and (d) where and to whom is it distributed. . Mr Robert Brown--.,.The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Roundabout is Australia's only national road safety magazine. Its objective is to provide a focal point for road safety in Australia by highlighting major activities, developments and initiatives both locally and overseas. (a) Circulation, by direct mailing, has risen from 14 000 for the first edition in 1990, to 28 000 for approv- the third edition in June 1992. (b) It is planned that as from the June 1992, the magazine will be published at six monthly intervals. The fourth edition will be published in December. 1992. (c) Costs are kept to a minimum by undertaking the design, layout and typesetting of the magazine in-house. Costs, therefore, are confined to printing, envelopes, address lists and distribution. For the as of last edition, Edition 3, these were: $ Printing (including materials) 24745 Envelopes 3924 Address lists (labels) 5085 Postage 20000 Total 53754 UNIT COST 1.90 Seeking to minimise these costs while continuing to produce a publication of sufficient quality to make people want to read it, is ongoing. To that end the December 1992 edition will, for the first time, carry advertising which will help defray costs. The extent to which costs will have been reduced will not be known until distribution of Edition 4 has occurred. (d) Distribution takes place primarily to all states and territories in Australia. A limited number of the magazines are distributed to road safety organisations in the United Kingdom, Europe, New Zealand and the United States. Within Australia, distribution includes general practitioners, some high schools, key members of the transport industry, university ries, police and members of the public who have asked to be placed on the distribution list. Migration: Country Report on Ethiopia (Question No. 2086)",307
361,Mr RUDDOCK,ATIONAL SQUADRONS,"the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1992: 1. Was a· country report prepared in response to queries about the possibility of an intercountry adoption involving Ethiopia before Mr Warwick Young's visit in October 1992; if not, why not; if so, (a) who prepared the report and (b) was it made available to interested parties. 2. Does any agency other than his Department assist in the preparation of the assessment of a country report or the decisions made in response to the information contained in a report. 3. What criteria are used in assessing whether an intercountry adoption program commences or continues on the basis of a country report. 4. Has he or his Department been made aware of any specific deficiencies identified by the assessment process using the criteria. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1. A report was prepared in 1988 by the Migration Officer based in Nairobi. The report has been made available to interested parties. Under the Protocols and Procedures for the Development of Programs for Intercountry Adoption with New Countries (the Protocols) agreed between State and Territory Welfare Ministers in September 1991, proposals to develop formal arrangements for intercountry adoption maybe made by, any individual, organisation or overseas country. A proposal to develop such arrangements with Ethiopia was presented to the Queensland Minister for Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs earlier this year African Children's Aid and Support Association. A copy of the 1988 report was included as an attachment to this proposal. 2. Under the Protocols, the views of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on new proposals for intercountry adoption arrangements, relating to Commonwealth responsibilities, are sought b- the relevant State Minister. A cornmitment to investigate a proposal formally is a State Welfare Ministers' decision. Each proposal will usually be investigated directly in the country of origin by a State officer. Resolutions whether to implement or not implement new programs will be made by the Council of Social and public libra- Welfare Ministers. 3. The criteria for whether to implement or not implement new programs for intercountry adoption are contained in the Protocols. 4. My Department is aware that there have been criticisms of the Protocols by some community groups. Migration: Overseas Adoptions (Question No. 2087)",309
362,Mr RUDDOCK,ATIONAL SQUADRONS,"the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1992: Does his Department have a representative on the Social Welfare Administrators Standing Sub-Committee of Overseas Adoptions; if so, what is the representative's (a) role and (b) influence on the sub-committee's recommendations. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) The role of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs' (DILGEA) representative on the Standing Sub-Committee on Intercountry Adoption is to contribute advice on immigration aspects of matters before the Sub-Committee. To date the representative hIlS acted as co-Chair - f the Sub-Committee for those parts of the agenda involving Commonwealth/State matters. (b) The DILGEA representative's advice is taken into account in the Sub-Committee's recommendations to the Standing Committee of Social Welfare Administrators. Straw Pulp Project (Question No. 2091) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 12 by the Australian- November 1992: (1) Did the Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) report for 1990-91 claim that the Moora straw pulp project in Western Australia would provide a multimillion dollar export industry for Australia. (2) What total sum has the AWB, through the Wheat Industry Fund, invested in the project. (3) How was the sum spent and who received it. (4) What is the current status of the project. (5) To what extent is the AWB currently involved in the project through investment from the Wheat Industry Fund. (6) Does the AWB have an ongoing contingent liability in respect of the Riverhouse Group; if so, what are the details. (7) Did the AWB commit $1.2 million to the project; if so, what are the details of the AWB's shareholding. (S) How does the price paid per share by the AWB compare with prices paid by other purchasers; including those associated with the WA Government. (9) Did the AWB pay a premium for its investment in the project. (10) Will the AWB provide wheat growers with details of a feasibility study paid for by their funds. (11) Did the feasibility study referred to in part (l0) indicate a chronic world oversupply of paper pulp and extremely limited value for straw pulp. (12) Was the marketing arm of the group associated with the project importing packaging from Indonesia, while the AWB was involved in the project, to sell to major local consumers at below local market prices. (13) Will projects such as the Moora project be eligible for the investment of further funds derived from wheat growers to promote value adding; if not, what criteria will apply before projects can be approved. . Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) An overview summary statement was made in the ""Business Opportunities"" section of the Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) 1990-91 Annual Report, to the effect that the project at Moora in Western Australia, in which the AWB had made an investment, would provide a multi-million dollar export industry for Australia. The more detailed description of the project and the AWB's involvement, which followed in the same section of that Report, suggested that the plant, when on stream, would produce 57,000 tonnes of dried pulp for annual export. However, there was no indication given of the likely value of those exports. (2) $A1,264,000 from the Wheat Industry Fund has been invested in share capital in Moora Pulp & Paper Co. (the Company). (3) The money referred to in part 2 was provided as equity capital in the Company and was used with other shareholders' capital to progress the Company through the initial feasibility and development stages. (4) The majority of the feasibility study has been completed and includes: compliance with environmental requirements completion of technical specification and project costing identification of target markets confirming the commercial viability of tqe proposal. Finalisation of the study is anticipated in early 1993. (5) In addition to the AWB 's investment in the Moora project (see part 2 above), the AWB nominates two directors to the Board of the Company. This level of involvement is consistent with the normal commercial situation where a large shareholder in a company has representation on its board. (6) No. (7) The AWB has to date committed $A1,264,ooo to the Company and holds a 33% shareholding. (S) There are three shareholders in the Company: the AWB, who purchased their $1 shares in 1991 and 1992 at a $3 premium River House Group who purchased their initial allotment of $1 shares in 1990 at par and subsequent allotments in 1991 and 1992 at a $3 premium Central Midlands Development Foundation who purchased their $1 shares in 1990 at a $1 premium. The Western Australian Government has no shares in the Company. (9) See part S. (10) All feasibility studies which were commissioned by the AWB remain commercial-in-confidence since they contain marketing and technical information that could be detrimental to the Company's competitiveness if released. In any case such findings need to be evaluated against other commercial information which would not normally be readily available. However prior to going ahead with its investment, the AWB consulted the Grains Council of Australia, which approved the project and the use of WIF moneys to finance the acquisition. Furthermore, the AWB and Grains Council hold quarterly consultative meetings at which the progress of business development projects such as Moora are discussed. . (11) I am advised by the AWB that the feasibility study looked at both the pulp paper industry as a whole and the particular industry segments in which the planned Moora project would compete. The supply/demand balance varied from segment to segment. It is intended that the Company will be producing a niche product for target markets rather than competing on the bulk market. The study showed that the identified niche sector could handle another entrant. (12) At no time have any marketing activities been undertaken by the Company which involve the importing and sale of packaging material into Australia. Box packaging has been imported by Riverhouse Packaging which is part of the Riverhouse Group but which has no involvement with the AWB or the Company. The Company is involved in the pulp paper business, not the box business. (13) The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 and the associated Wheat Industry Fund Regulations set out in broad tenns the purposes for which WIF monies may be used. The legislation also requires the AWB to manage the WIF in accordance with an Annual Business Plan approved by the Grains Council of Australia. Under this arrangement any future projects will be assessed against criteria which have been developed by the AWB. There is no Ministerial involvement in the development or approval of these Plans and this arrangement recognises that the WIF is an industry fund made up from a levy on wheat growers. The Government's main involvement with the WIF is the provision of a five y- (until 30 June 1994) $lOOm guarantee for WIF related born;-wings. Wheat Industry Fund Levy (Question No. 2099) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 24 November 1992: (l) Has he decided to maintain the Wheat Industry Fund levy at 2 per cent. (2) Does the 2 per cent levy represent a minimum tax of 24 per cent on the disposable income of wheat growers; if so, will this lead to net losses for wheat growers. (3) Has his Department estimated the reduction in wheat planting which will result from the decision to maintain the levy; if not, why not; if so, what are the figures. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 8 October 1992 I announced a package of initiatives for the grains industry which would provide a framework for growth to the end of the decade. One element of that package is the continuation of the Wheat Industry Fund (WIF) until June 1999 in order to: provide a capital base for the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) to .fund its future activities, in particular the making of advance payments to growers at the end of the build up period without the need for Government guarantees continue to fund the operations of the AWB 's Trading Division; and fund investment and participation in grains related .value adding activities. The WIF will continue to be largely funded by the Wheat Industry Fund levy which, subject to certain exemptions, is collected on wheat sold or delivered by a producer and on wheat which is processed by or for a producer. The current rate of levy to fund the WIF is 2 % of ""farmgate"" sales value, which is the minimum specified in the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. This rate will continue unless the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) representing Australia's wheat growers makes a recommendation to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for an increase in the rate. During the course of comprehensive discussions with the GCA on the elements and detail of the package, the GCA stated that the issue of raising the, WIF levy above 2 % was not on its agenda. (2) Since the levy is calculated on the sales value of wheat net of storage; transport, handling and f.o.b. costs, the amount of levy paid in any year will vary widely between producers. Similarly, the amount of levy paid as a proportion of farm cash income will depend on the individual farm business and in particular the contribution that wheat sales make to that figure. However, on the basis of data showing average levy per tonne paid on wheat delivered to the AWB (as published in the AWB's Annual Report); and figures for average wheat production per farm and Farm Cash Income (as published in the Farm Surveys Report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics) it is estimated that on average, total WIF levy paid is around 3 % of Farm Cash Income for specialist crop fanns in Australia. (3) The Wheat Industry Fund levy was introduced in July 1989. In the following year wheat plantings increased by 2.4%. This would suggest that it is unlikely that the continuation of that levy will lead to a reduction in the area planted to wheat. The area sown to wheat in any season is a function of many factors but it would appear that the expected price for wheat compared to that for other crops and livestock products has a major influence on growers' decisions. For example, a report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics in its June 1992 ""Crop Report"" shows that since 1983/84 there appears to have been a direct trade-off between cropping and sheep production. In respect of 199--93 winter crops, that same report also suggested that as a result of improved prices compared with what farmers expected prior to sowing' in the previous season (1991-92), farmers were increasing the proportion of cropland planted to wheat.

(4) The Army College of TAPE at present, has a maximum capacity of 520 apprentices. (5) Utilisation of the capacity of the Army College of TAPE varies during the year, depending on the number of apprentices and adult trade trainees undergoing training at the time. Gold Coast: Establishment of Office of Department of Veterans' Affairs (Question No. 2111) Mr Bradford asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 25 November 1992: (1) Does the Gold Coast region have the highest ex-service person population of any region in Australia. . (2) Will his Department establish a permanent office on the Gold Coast. Mr Humphreys-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Federal electorate of MCPherson, in the Gold Coast region, has the largest population of DVA beneficiaries as compared to any other electorate. The electorate of Moncrieff which is also in the Gold Coast region, has a substantial population of DVA beneficiaries as compared to many other electorates. (2) The question of a pennanent office on the Gold Coast is currently under active consideration. Migration Internal Review Offices (Question No. 2112) Mr Truss asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 25 November 1992: Further to the answer to the question No.1972 (Hansard, 4 November 1992, page 2662) regarding the closure of the Brisbane Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO) and the transfer of its case load to Adelaide, if the Brisbane and Adelaide MIROs considered 1144 and 814 applications, respectively, between 19 December 1989 and 14 August 1992, why was the Brisbane office closed rather than the Adelaide office. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The decision to close Brisbane MIRO was taken after detailed analysis of the workload of all MlRO offices and the staff resources available to handle ' that workload. The analysis took account of the declining workload (applications to be received are anticipated to fall from 7814 in 1991-92 to 6000 in 1992-93), increased productivity requirements and reductions in the overall MIRO staff level by 28 per cent in 1992-93. In deciding that Queensland should close and South Australia and Western Australia should obtained, continue, but with an increased workload from other regions, the availability of staff was an important consideration. Both South Australia and Western Australia had a number of staff available to be transferred to review work. Expansion of these MIROs allowed the placement of these staff who otherwise may have become surplus. By contrast, the re-deployment of staff affected by the closure of the Queensland MIRO was not difficult-three staff were already working in other areas. MIRO Offices are now located in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: Consultancies (Question No. 2114) Mr Aldred asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 26 November 1992: (1) Has the Minister's Department entered into consultancies by contract, subcontract or other means during 1991 and 1992 with Turnbull Fox Phillips: if so, in each case: (a) what sum was paid for the consultancy, (b) what was the purpose of the consultancy, (c) were any delegations exercised in respect of the consultancy; if so, (i) what were they, (li) who exercised them and (iii) when were they exercised, (d) what duties and functions were to be perfonned by the consultant, (e) when were the duties and functions perfonned, (f) what advice did the Department receive from the consultant, (g) did the advice confonn with the objectives which were the basis of the advice, (h) was the advice accepted; if so, why; if not, why not, (i) what criteria were used to establish the objectives which were the basis of the advice, (j) how were the objectives derived, (k) how was the conformity of the advice to the criteria of the objectives monitored and evaluated, (I) who established the objectives and the criteria, (m) what were the qualifications of those who established the objectives and criteria, (n) how did the objectives and criteria relate to the delegations exercised by the officers who that authorised or recommended that the advice be (0) did the Department get value for money from the consultancy and (P) did any finn of which'Thrnbull Fox Phillips is a member, shareholder, employee or subcontractor receive payment; if so, what sum.
