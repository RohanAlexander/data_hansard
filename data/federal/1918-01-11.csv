0,NA,Unknown,"#ouse of Eeptesentatibea. Friday, 11 January, 1918. MT. SPEAKER (Ho'n.^W.. Elliot Johnson) took the 'aijair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. NA EVICTIONS. MT. JOSEPH OOOK-In reply to the charges made yesterday by the honourable ' members f o t West Sydney and Dalley, regarding the evictions by the Sydney Harbor Trust, for which they blamed the Coal Board, I wish to say that that Board does not employ labour of any kind whatever.",20
1,Mr MAHONY,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,We did not say that.,20
2,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Then , What is the charge against the Coal Board?",20
3,Mr RILEY,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,That it prevents coal from being delivered to any place where these men are employed.,20
4,Mr JH CATTS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Thu s victimizing the men.,20
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,I am told that that is not so.,20
6,Mr MAHONY,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"We can prove it , if the Government will have an inquiry. MT. WALLACE - I understand that the Coal Board does not employ anybody; but the contractors, who aro under the direct supervision f the Goal Board, employ 0 men. MAINTENANCE OF ORDER. Mr SPEAKER . (Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) - It would be well, at; the beginning of our proceedings, to intimate that I do not intend to allow continual interruptions, nor .shall I permit my calls to order to he disregarded. I take this portunity to - remind honourable members that I shall see that the Standing Orders are observed, and I ask their co-operation in the maintenance of order. MOTION OF NO GONFIDENOE.",20
7,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Yarra) [11.5] - I move That the House protests against(a) the repuSiation of the pledges of the Prime Minister and other Ministers; (i) the political persecution of publio men and other citizens and the press under the War Precautions Begulations during ""the recent referendum campaign; (c) the deprivation, of statutory electoral , rights of Australian-born citizens by - regulation behind the back of Parliament; (d) the general administration of publie affairs, and wishes to inform His Excellency the Governor General that the Government does not possess, the confidence of the people of Australia. . I make no apology for moving this motion. If ever there was an occasion when such a motion was justified, this is such an occasion. A referendum on conscription has just 'been taken, and the majority which voted for the side which this party espoused was larger by 92,000 than the majority we gained on the last referendum. I cannot say from memory whether the number of votes cast on this occasion was as great as the number cast on the last occasion.",20
8,Mr BOYD,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"It was not. M T. TTJDOR - Then many who, at'the last referendum, voted with tihe Government party must be tired of those whorepresent them, and showed their feoliug by absenting themselves from the poll. The: motion will have the effect of clearing the political atmosphere. Honourable members opposite who think that* the Ministry has done wrong in breaking its pledge will have an opportunity of ""saying so, but if , notwithstanding,- they vote to keep the Government in office, they will endorse its action. Mr BAYLEY,-We like to choose our company. - Mr TUDOR - So do I . Honourable members opposite may say that they were forced either to keep this Government in power or to give office to members of the present Opposition, but that subterfuge will not shelter them from the censure of op- the electors. I propose to put into Hansard some of. the pledges that were made by Ministers and members 'of the Ministerial party, and I have reason to believe that the issue will not be seized under the War. Bre'cautions Act; that the military will not surround the Government Printstreet ing Office to prevent its circulation.",20
9,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Will the speeches all be printed' in the same type?,21
10,Mr TTJDOB,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I have never had the type of my speeches altered, though I lieve on one occasion, before the honourable member for Denison had fallen grace, the Postmaster-General had headings inserted in a reprint of a speech he had made. I believe that the. honorwere able member for Denison would' sooner on 'this side today than in the company of some whose convictions aTe the opposite of those which he has held for a lifetime.  - a big occasion ?",21
11,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"If I consider it right to do so, I shall reply to interjections, spite the intellectual giant from Echuca. I do not care whether honourable members interject or no.t. When I am reading the pledges to which I have referred I . shall not pennit the quotations to he broken the insertion of interjections.' It is well known that the holding of last referendum was decided on by the Government, which had completed ita arrangements for the ceremony to comsolute memorate that historical event, the existence coupling by rail of the western eastern States. Honourable members know why the holding of another referendum was decided upon, Every honourable memwould that have ? ber will give credit-if credit is the right word to use-to the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) for having forced the hands of Ministers this matter. He went throughout the country, and by his speeches compelled the Government to take action. If istershad not done something, he would have had them out.",21
12,Mr JJBEJSTNAW,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,He . thought that he the Age saidhad the crowd with him.,21
13,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"He had some persons Government with him. Ministers are influenced favourable largely by those with whom they associate, whom they are apt to asssume represent the opinion of Australia. On one occashould sion, when an. honourable member on this side, who has since passed away, was nouncing the Deakin Government, saying that every person he met was opposed the action it had taken, Sir. Thomas . Ewing, who - was' then a Minister, asked, "" Did you meet your informant in Collins^ or in Footscray?"" 'Everything depends on the class. of persons that one meets. The honourable member for Flinders met' a large number of persqns\ who were enthusiastic for conscription, and assumed' that they voiced the opinion of be the country. The Government listened to him, and to the noise made by the press from in favour of conscription. - In the first instance, when the holding that .of the referendum was announced, we not told that the Goveniment would be stand OT fall by the result. - Mr JH CATTS - It was stated in London, before the Cabinet meeting was held at which the referendum was decided for upon, that another referendum was to be taken.",21
14,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I was not aware of dethat. The honourable member will have an opportunity of putting the facts on record. 'On the8th November, the dayafter the Cabinet meeting, at - which the holding of another' referendum was deby cided upon, the Age pointed out that unless the Government pledged itself, to the stand or fall by the result, the appeal - tohurriedly the people would be uselessTbe Government should demonstrate the absincerity of its convictions by staking its. and the life of Parliament, on the and success of its appeal ",21
15,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"""Stakin g the life of Parliament""! How many supporters",21
16,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Thos e on this side do not owe their seats to the Age. I am well aware that I do.not, and I owe less to the in other rag that is published in Melbourne. We were informed that the Cabinet had! been divided into two sections, one to Minframe the question to be submitted, and the other to decide on the plan of campaign to be used, and the following day Undoubtedly it is the case that unless the is prepared to take a definite stand on the issue, and appealto the people for a vote which will involve its existence,, the referendum will run a serious risk of defeat. The popular view seems to be that Mr Hughesclearly and resolutely demonstrate^ that the issue is overwhelmingly important by declaring that if the policy of the Government bederejected he will not remain in office. And the same day the honourable memberto for Flinders, speaking in Sydney, saidThe strongest, most legitimate, and. patriotic course the Government could take was to bring;. ita measure for conscription, when it was pared, down to Parliament, duced to a form such as would be acceptable to the people, and go to the country upon it. and stand or fall by its issue. The next day the Age, still sticking to point, saidMinisters decline to make any comment on the agitation throughout the Commonwealth calling upon them to make conscription a vital issue. ffihen on the 12th, the day on which the Prime Minister opened the campaign at cepted. Bendigo, the Age in a leading article reinforcements statedBnt not yet has the Government given required proof of its sincerity to the people by he saidstaking its existence and the existence of the present Parliament on the issue. If the Prime Minister-as every patriot most earnestly hopes-doe s this to-niglit at Bendigo, we not fear the result of the campaign. That was prior to the Bendigo speech. 'The Government then decided-o r they may have decided previously-that the same speechreferendum issue should be made vital. At the meeting at which that decision tempt was arrived at every member of the Gogive vernment except the righ t honourable sponsibility member for Swan (Sir John Forrest) was present. If we are to believe the press, our men at the Pront will be abandoned, but he was not in favour of that decision, how and he stated to the newspapers a few days ago that if the Government were to asking. resign the resignation would be purely of a formal character-ou t and in again.",21
17,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I denied that yesterday. Mr TUDOR, - I did not see the deA nial, but the right honourable gentleman Minister said-said, "" out again, in again."" presents the .policy of this Government. They are willing to do anything to hang on to office; they will not be sacked. A f t e r the Age had screwed them up to definite point, they pledged themselves be bound by the referendum results. In The Case for Labour the Prime Minister wroteAn honourable man is bound by action. A dishonourable man cannot be bound, even though his pledge be engraven on steel. Does the Prime Minister believe today that an honourable man should be bound people, by his pledge] His declaration ""Bendigo wasI tell you' plainly that the Government must have this power; it cannot country without it, and will not attempt to do so. preA t the Sydney Town H all , on 14th Noand let it be revember, he saidThe Win-the-war Government will not, and cannot, attempt to govern this country unless the people give us that power. its In his manifesto, issued to the farmers on 26th November, he saidThe Nationalist Government was elected on a definite policy' which an overwhelming majority of the electors of the Commonwealth approved. The * safety of Australia imperatively demands that Australia should do its duty, that the proposals of the Government should be acUnless it has the power to secure the as set out in its proposal, the Government cannot carry on, and will not attempt to do so. the At the Exhibition Building, Brisbane, He asked them to give him the powers which the Government sought. If they did not he, need for one, would not attempt to govern the country. Without, that power it was impossible to govern the country. The Argus of 28th November reports him as having said, apparently in the The Government cannot, and will not. atto govern this country unless the people us this power. Theirs will be the reof choosing their Government when they vote on this referendum on December 20. They will decide then not only whether or not % Australia will be governed at home, for 1' repeat that the present Government will not carry on without the power for which it is now At Tamworth, on 1st December, he saidThe people were beginning to realise that by their vote on December 20 they will have to 'decide who should govern them. t Armidale, on the same day, the Prime That re- If the Government proposal was agreed to the Government would be bound by all the pledges he bad made, but if it were not agreed to he would refuse to carry on. a In reply to a question at TJralla, Mr . to Hughes repeated that If the Government proposal were agreed to the Government would be bound by all pledges he had made, but if it were not agreed to he his word or would refuse to carry on. i At the Millions Club in Sydney, on 4th December, he said I have said that this Government goes to the and puts its fate in their hands. By at whom will you be governed? Well, it is for you to decide. At His Majesty's Theatre, Sydney, on the govern the same day, he said I also declare that unless the Government has this power, it will not. attempt to-it cannot-gover n this country. If it has not this power, you will choose the manner of men you wish should govern. Your duty has to be done. You have to do it. At Hurstville, ou the 5th. December, he saidIf you reject these proposals, I wash my hands of all responsibility. I shall not attempt to carry on. At Goulburn, on 6th December, he saidIn effect what the people of Australia have to determine on 20th December is by whom they intend to be governed.",22
18,Mr BOYD,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Fro m what paper are you quoting ? ' Mr TTJDOK - Fro m the Worker, and there is no doubt about the accuracy of these statements, because if they were inaccurate the newspaper would be prosecuted. But I can obtain the same material from other newspapers. At Junee, on 7th December, the Prime Minister said I 'have said that this Government will not retain office unless you approve of these proposals. At Albury, on the 17th December, he saidAs far as this Government is concerned, I repeat that unless it has the power it seeks it will not attempt to govern the country. Those are the pledges of the right honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Hughes). Is he in office today, or is he not ? Is the vision of honourable members right when they see him still in occupation of the Treasury bench? "" I will not attempt to govern the country unless this power is given "" he said, and previously he had laid down the principle that ""an honourable man is bound by his word or action; a dishonourable man cannot be bound, even though his pledge be engraven on steel."" I turn now to the pledges given by the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook). Speaking at ""Willoughby, on l l t h December, he saidWe are deliberately taking the risk. It is really we who are making the sacrifice, and we mean to return with a triumphant majority, and we say, "" Unless you do that, somebody else can have the chance of carrying on the Government."" We say we are doing this, even if it involves our own destruction. At .Summerhill, on the 15 th of December, he saidIf our proposal is not carried, we will ask to be relieved - from the responsibility of conducting the war. At Annandale, on 16 th December, he saidThe Government can get nothing out of this - w e have nothing to gain. We will decline to hold ofiice. At Manly, on the same date, he saidThe Government will not attempt to carry on the government of the country if "" No"" is voted. Senator Pearce, the Minister for Defence, speaking at Maryborough, is reported by the Age as having said- ° The.alternative was not merely a change to a Labour Government, as it was at the outset of the war, when the last man and last shilling had been pledged. The alternative was Australia's withdrawal from the war. The next pledge of interest is that of the honourable jnember for Flinders, Si r William Irvine.",23
19,Mr BOYD,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,He is not a member of the Government.,23
20,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I know he is not, but I am putting him in to make weight. The honourable gentleman said at Wagga Wagga on 27th NovemberThe Government has declared in language which admits of no shadow of ambiguity, that it will not attempt to continue governing this country without the powers asked for in this Referendum. That is a clear, definite, and welcome assertion of the principle of Government responsibility in an issue vital to our national honour and safety. No other course would have been possible. The Government says in effect, "" You must choose between our party with conscription and the official Labour party without conscription."" On this pledge the Government must not now be allowed to stand alone. AH members sitting behind the Government are bound by it in honour or they cease to be Government supporters. - At ' No r t h Sydney, on 29th November, he saidThe choice now before the people of Australia is the choice which, in my opinion, should^ have been before them on 5th May last, namely, you have to choose, not between conscription and no conscription, but between the Nationalist party with conscription or the Labour party without conscription. At Bathurst, on 1st December, he saidThe issue was 'the National Government with conscription against the Labour Government without conscription. I come next to the Postmaster-General, Mr Webster. The honourable member is not present; apparently he is making up the sleep he lost when he rose at 3 o'clock in the morning to write out a character for the Prime Minister.",23
21,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,I did not see that.,23
22,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I shall quote that later. The Postmaster-General said at Yass, on 5th DecemberIf the Referendum were not carried the Ministry would resign in twenty-four hours. He proceeded to say that if the people voted "" No "" they would hand the Government over to Sinn Feiners and disloyalists. Are the 90,000 soldiers who voted ' ' No ' ' in the trenches to be classed as disloyalists? Speaking at Brisbane, on 13th Deiceinber, he saidIf you vote "" No "" on the 20£li the Government will nol! remain in office twenty-four hours. We are'not going to carry the responsibility of office unless we can carry it out successfully. Senator Millen, at Bathurst, on 17th December, when asked what would happen if "" No "" were carried, declared, amidst applause, that the Government would get out of office. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Watt) said at the M i l lions Club, Sydney, on 12th DecemberWe have asked you to take heed and counsel with us. If you do not you must get some other men to govern you. We cannot. Here we had another member of the Government declaring that they could not continue to govern the country if conscription were turned down. But they still remain in offioe. The next on my .list of quotations is a statement made by the Government Whi p (Mr Greene). Speaking at Alstonville, on 27th November last, he, too, fell into line with his Prime Minister. I have here the statement that Mr Greene added that Mr Hughes had stated that if the referendum was defeated the Government would resign. !The pledge given by Mr Hughes to the people had been gazetted by proclamation That is news to meand this he (Mr Greene) had never heard of being done before. He emphasized the fact that the pledge would be absolutely kept. The pledge was that unless the power sought by the Government was given them they would resign. According to the Minister for the Navy, it was the Government who were making the sacrifice. Adcording to the Postmaster-General they would not carry on for twenty-four hours if the referendum were not carried. According to Senator Millen in that event the Government would go out of office. According to the Minister of Defence if the people voted "" No "" they would put in a Labour Government. pledge mean anything, or was it merely made for party political purposes? Did the Government mean merely to make it and then to ru n away fro m it? I did think, and I still believe, that some of their supporters considered that it should be honoured, not in the breach, but in the observance-that the Government should stick to the .pledge they had definitely given, even if it meant another party coming into power.",24
23,Mr JH CATTS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,O r a dissolution.,24
24,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"O r even a dissolution. This motion will help to clear the atmosphere. It will give these honourable members an opportunity to come into the broad light of day, and to say whether they intend to support a Government every member of which holds exactly the same office that he held in the Government that gave this pledge. Other M in i sters made pledges similar to those I have read, but I think I have put before the House sufficient to show that the Cabinet as a whole was absolutely pledged to-resign if the Conscription Referendum were not carried. What is more, in the words of the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine), 'ejvery Supporter of the Government was also bound by that pledge.  heard of sulch a thing.",24
25,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"T he honourable member for Flinders stated distinctly, that the pledge made by the Government applied not only to the Cabinet, but to its supporters. I agree with that view.",24
26,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,On e correction. The honourable member ought to add that I said it applied to the supporters of. the Government unless they expressly disclaimed it .,24
27,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,I was not aware of that qualification.,24
28,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,B e fair.,24
29,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I am fairer than is the honourable member. Only yesterday, when he thought we were tricked-whe n he thought that my notice of motion was to be placed at the bottom of the notice paper, so that we should not have an opportunity to bring it forward-h e was to be seen grinning with satisfaction. He thought we were side-tracked, and that we would not have an opportunity to place before the people the actual facts. He knew we had been prevented under the War Precautions Act by the censorship, Did this and the press, from giving publicity to 'owe views outside, and he thought we were to be prevented by the majority on the Government benches from doing so in this House. I always endeavour to be fair. The honourable member knows that is so. If I had known that the honourable member for Elinders made the qualification he has just stated I should have given it .",24
30,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I did, in fact, make that qualification in every speech in which I referred to the matter.",25
31,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I freely accept the honourable member's assurance, and shall say, then, that the honourable member declared that, not only the Government, but every one of its supporters was bound by this pledge unless he expressly disclaimed it. But how many did disclaim it?",25
32,Mr MATHEWS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Not one.,25
33,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,That is the point on which we should like some information.,25
34,Mr CORSER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,A large number disclaimed it .,25
35,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I am not going to follow the example of the Prime Minister who, on one occasion, acting like a schoolmaster before his class, called on all his opponents who had not done a certain thing to stand up. I should like to know, however, how many supporters of the Government specifically disclaimed this pledge from the platforms of the country. If they choose to avail themselves of the opportunity afforded them by this motion they will be able to tell us what stand they took up. They will be able to tell ua whether they did not say with the Government, "" Heads we win, and tails we do not lose."" That was the attitude of the Government. They were playing with a two-headed penny.",25
36,Mr WATT,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Is not the honourable member a trifle mixed? There could be no tail on a two-headed penny.,25
37,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"TE e honourable gentleman knows more about the "" two-up school "" form of gambling than I do. This pledge having been given by Ministers, they returned to Parliament House, and helda meeting up-stairs. When we were in offioe it used to be said by an honourable member who was then leading the Opposition, that we always adjourned to the vaults ,to determine what should be done in the Souse. The Government and their supporters on this occasion, however, met upstairs, and decided upon a policy of "" Hush and smother!"" They said, in effect, ""Hush! Not a word about these pledges! Smother them up. Keep them dark! We have the press with us. Ninety-nine per cent, of the press of Australia backed us up on the conscription issue. The press will keep our pledges dark, and the people will not learn anything of them.. The Labour press will not have a chance of reaching the people. We shall take care that they are carefully censored, and keep out of the Labour journals anything .that does not suit us."" That is the position today. A double censorship is going on. The Government and their supporters can secure the publication of anything that suits their party, and friendly editors carefully suppress anything that does not suit them. When it comes to publishing anything in favour of the Labour party, these newspaper editors ruthlessly use the blue pencil. And so the Government and their supporters said, "" Smother up the Ministerial pledge. The people of Australia returned us with a triumphant majority after Ready had been got out of the way. They took no notice of that incident, andthey will take no notice of this. Let us again adopt the policy of ' hush and smother,' and the people will forget this pledge."" I warn honourable members opposite, however, that they are mistaken. Some of the people will remember the pledge. .The people who support the Government may have an undying hate for our political programme, and for our policy generally, but a lot of the respect they had for honourable members opposite has been lost as the result of the doings of the past week. They despise the Ministry and the supporters who keep them there. The Government cannot get away from that fact. They say, "" We are prepared to take the chance."" Of course they are. We have all to accept the responsibility for our political actions, and everything we do in this House must bear the light of day. No one knows'better than do the Government and their supporters themselves that they have lost the respect of a great section of the community who supported them at the last general election, and who, on that occasion, were among their best workers. They may think that they may fool the people by this transparent device of resigning Irom office and .coming back again, but I warn them that the people will not be so deceived. The definite pledges made hy Ministers remain on record. I come now to the conduct of the campaign.",25
38,Mr RODGERS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The honourable member ought to mention that between the resignation of the late Government and the - coming into office of the new Administration, he was sent for by the Governor General.",26
39,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I do not mind mentioning that fact. Mr ""WATKINS - That was only part of the programme.",26
40,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I do not say that. As Leader of the Opposition I was sent for by His Excellency with the object of ascertaining whether I could form an Administration. I told' his Excellency, - truthfully, that there were on the ment side of the House a number of honourable members who were not satisfied with the Ministry, and that any reshuffle that might result in the Government going back to power would not be satisfactory to a great many of them. I believe that'many honourable members opposite would have preferred to see the labour party come into office, even if it had been met with a "" sudden death"" motion, or allowed to remain on the Treasury bench for a little time. They would have preferred that rather than that they should participate in the farce that has been enacted, and in which they will be participants unless they vote for this motion. They may go on the public platform, and ask,-as the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) did, ""How long will the people of Australia permit to rule over them this calamitous mountebank? """,26
41,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw those words.,26
42,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Certainly , sir. I was merely quoting a statement reported to have been made by the honourable member for Perth- a supporter of the Government-concernin g his leader.",26
43,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,It is not permissible for an honourable member to quote a statement made outside which he would not be in order in making in this House.,26
44,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The Leader of the Opposition does not think that the Prime Minister is a "" calamitous mountebank."" leaflet.",26
45,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"No. I do not think that of any honourable member. We may disagree politically, and honourable members opposite may do their best to bring about my political defeat, just as I shall endeavour to defeat them politically, but there is no reason why we should resort to personalities. In submitting this motion to the House, I am speaking in a strictly political, and not in a personal, sense, so far as any honourable member is concerned. I have always made my attitude perfectly clear, and would not be a party to attacks such as have been made on the Prime Minister by men on his own side. I would not be a party to such attacks either inside Parliament or out of it. The attitude adopted towards the Prime Minister by some men on his own Govern- side is absolutely unfair. When interrupted I was about to deal with the conduct of the campaign. Honourable members are well aware that any publication representing the views of honourable members on this side of the House was carefully scrutinized by the censor, that prosecutions were instituted, and that some members on this side were bound over not to make certain statements; in fact, we hardly dare open our mouths.",26
46,Mr MATHEWS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,We were not allowed to tell the truth!,26
47,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The honourable memSer was one of the public men the persecution of whom forms part of my case. At present, however, I am dealing with the literature that was issued on behalf of the honourable members opposite, and the Reinforcements Referendum Council, and I ask whether, if we on this side had issued to the public such statements, we should not have been, denounced, particularly in the one case, from every pulpit in the country as guilty of blasphemy. I refer to the pamphlet.which contains the words, "" But for Gawd's sake don't send me."" A pamphlet, as I say, authorized by the Reinforcements Referendum Council, and signed by Claude MCKay, publicity secretary, of 38 Collins-street, Melbourne. Do Ministers approve of that leaflet, for which, had we published it , we snould 1I have been rightly denounced?",26
48,Mr LAIKD SMITH,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,The honourable member is quoting only a part of the,26
49,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,The honourable member may see the whole of it.,27
50,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,What is the rest of it?,27
51,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,The leaflet is as follows :THE SHIRKER SPEAKETH. Send the Russians. Send the Japanese. Send the Americans. Send the Hindoos. ° Send the Chinese. .Send the Brazilians. Send the South' African Negroes. Send the Kanakas. Send Anybody. But for Gawd's sake don't send mel 1 say that that is absolute blasphemy.  have to say about us?,27
52,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"No , I have a lot to say that is wqrse. Do the bishops and other ministers of religion, who supported the conscriptionist platform, approve of language of that sort? I have another leaflet here which is called "" The Anti's Creed,"" and this does not mean the. creed of some, but all of - those who are opposed to conscription. In spite of the character of this leaflet there was, so far as I am aware, no prosecution.",27
53,Mr RODGERS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,This is a regrettable publication.,27
54,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Now we have an admission ; and I wish to place the leaflet on record as representing the views of the Reinforcements Referendum Council.,27
55,Mr BOYD,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,I know that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) repudiated that leaflet during the campaign.,27
56,Mr RODGERS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,And the leader of the largest women's organization also repudiated it.,27
57,Mr BRENNAN,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Some of the men some of the women repudiated the leaflet,"" but the great majority of the party opposite stood by it ",27
58,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Such a leaflet ought never to have been printed, and the party which descends to such methods of advocacy deserves to lose. The leaflet is absolute lies from beginning to end. The programme of the massed meeting held in the Melbourne Cricket Ground was printed on the back of that leaflet, and among the speakers at that meeting were many ministers of religion. Did they object to this leaflet? I have never heard of any of them objecting. This ""creed"" is set forth as the one in which all anticonscriptionists are supposed to believe, including the 90,000 soldiers who voted ""No."" The leaflet is as follows:THE ANTI'S CREED.

59,Mr BRENNAN,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The Prime Minister refused to prosecute. and. Mr TUDOR - I do not know whether that is so or not, and it is for the Prime Minister to say; but, if it be true, then the case is made so much the worse. In the face of such a leaflet the Reinforcements Referendum Council continued to employ Claude MCKay as publicity secretary. We know that on occasions a man may be called upon to do work in which he does not absolutely believe, or does not approve; and I can hardly believe that any one could approve of such a publication, or of such work as Claude MCKay was put up to do, and compelled to do, by the Reinforcements Referendum Council; no man could honestly say that he believed or approved of the murder of Nurse Cavell, or in the murder of the children on the Lusitania. Greater untruth than that represented by this leaflet was never uttered in any part of the world, so far as I know.",27
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"It sounds almost as bad as that "" blood vote "" of yours!",28
61,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The honourable member will have every opportunity to present what documents and arguments he desires during the course of this debate, although some honourable members opposite were very anxious that I should not have equal facility to place my views on record. Of course, I am not now speaking personally of the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) ; but there are honourable members opposite, though not a majority, I think, who were anxious to have no discussion on the question before us. They were prepared to use all the forms of the House to avoid giving a vote which would decide whether the Government should honour their pledges, and be held responsible for the conduct of the campaign. Honourable members are aware that the Government's views during the campaign had e\'ery publicity so far as the news columns of the newspapers were concerned, but they may not be aware of the fact that they also had the advantage of the advertising columns as well. When I was returning from Brisbane, I had, of course, ample time to read the newspapers in the train, and I looked at them more carefully than I am otherwise able to do. It was then that I saw that the Argus of Wednesday, the 12th December, had over three columns of reports of meetings on one page, in addition to a leading article, "" Campaign Notes,"" "" Points - Voters,"" and other reading matter amongst the general news all in favour of the Government proposals. A l together, there were about nine. columns devoted to the advocacy of the conscription proposals, while there was not a line in support of those who were against them. We, on this side, at any rate, represent the views of, I think, 1,178,000 of the people of Australia on the question, including a majority of the people in the State of Victoria; and yet we had not the advantage of any space at all in the columns of the general daily press.",28
62,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,How much space would the Labour papers give the other side?,28
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,What space did the Labour papers give me?,28
64,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Speaking from memory, I should, say that there were only two morning Labour daily papers in the Commonwealth, the Daily Post of Hobart, and theDaily Herald of Adelaide. Then there is the Evening Standard of Brisbane.",28
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,The Worker was issued as a daily. ',28
66,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The Worker was issued only ""three times a week. If the Labour papers did not give the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) any publicity, I may tell him that, apart from the Sydney meeting at which I spoke, the Labour papers did not report any meetings at all, even on their own side. And in the case of that one meeting the Labour report was cut down by the censor; in fact, the Labour paper was not allowed to publish parts of my speech, although those parts appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. The Age of the same date, 12th December, had about six and a half columns devoted to the affirmative side.",28
67,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The honourable member, in order to be fair, ought to compare the two daily Labour newspapers of the same date with the Melbourne newspapers.",28
68,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The honourable member can do that for himself. I have not the Labour newspapers here. Against the six columns and over in the Age on the one side, there was published about a 6-inch report of a meeting which the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) addressed on my behalf at for Richmond during my' absence in Brisbane.  of the Melbourne newspapers?",28
69,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"So far as I am aware, the other issues of the Melbourne newspapers show a similar apportionment of space. I have already explained that the reason I select the 12th December is that during my journey from Sydney, I had ample opportunity to peruse the newspapers of that date.  picked date. 1",28
70,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"That is not so. As to the advertising phase of the question as distinguished from the news, I may refer to the case of the Herald, Melbourne. The Political Labour Council of Victoria, being in charge of the anti-campaign, had, of course, to advertise their side, and they sought to have inserted a halfpage advertisement in the Herald. The man in charge of the advertising department of the Herald said he could accept the advertisement, and it was arranged that it should appear on the Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday with an offer for Tuesday as well. The representatives of the Labour Council offered to pay a deposit, but the advertising man told them it was not necessary, because their name was good enough-as , I say, it ought to be, representing, as they do, the responsible officers of a responsible body. The half-page advertisement, which was a very attractive one, appeared in the Saturday issue, but on the Monday the Political Labour Council representative received word from the Herald that there was no space for the advertisement that night-au d this in spite of the fact that practically a contract had been entered into for three insertions. At ' any rate, although it was said there was no space for this half-page advertisement, there was, on the Monday, space for a two or three column article on the front page by Mr Theodore Eink in reply to the advertisement. The management of the Herald evidently got "" cold"" feet, and was afraid of the advertisement doing the paper an injury, seeing that it was so drafted as to, perhaps, give rise to the idea that it represented the views of the newspaper. However' that may be, the management of the Herald intimated to the Political Labour Council that there would be no room on the Wednesday for any big advertisement, * though on that day a full page, taken by some one, was devoted to giving the result of / the returned soldiers vote, or, rather, I should say, the alleged vote by returned soldiers, because if that was - a true vote the returned soldiers altered their minds when it came to a general vote, and from being a majority of 150 to 1 in one place the voting was never more than 3 to 1 for "" Yes "" in any State. It must have been a faked vote, or the soldiers were compelled to vote "" Yes.""",28
71,Mr MATHEWS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"They were intimidated. Mr Tudor. - ,",29
72,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Yes' , intimidated. Men in the hospitals were told, ""Unless you vote 'Yes,' we will not bring you any more comforts.""",29
73,Mr CORSER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Shame !,29
74,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I know what I am talking about. If necessaiy, I will get sworn declarations as to the matter if the Defence Department will promise that the men will not be victimized.",29
75,Mr GREGORY,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,The honourable member's assertion is a grave and dirty insinuation against men who did their duty.,29
76,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Le t the honourable member make no mistake. It is not a grave v and dirty insinuation against the men, but it is against those people who intimidated them, those who went to men lying on sick beds, or men who were there convalescent, when there was practically open voting.",29
77,Mr GREGORY,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,If the honourable member made that remark in Perth the men would tar and feather him.,29
78,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Order ! Several honourable members interjecting,",29
79,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I intimated at the beginning of the sitting that I expected honourable members ;to obey the call of the Chair. I will not have the call to order disregarded. If honourable members will not obey the call, I shall have to ask the House to take certain action. I address myself to honourable members on both sides of the House. I expect them to support the Chair in maintaining order. - Mr TUDOR - l l was endeavouring to show that a full page advertisement in the Herald displayed this alleged ballot of the returned soldiers, while an advertisement which it had agreed to insert was refused. - MT. WATT - Would the honourable member mind saying who made the suggestion in the hospitals to which he has referred ? MT. TUDOR - I am informed by soldiers that the statement was made. The honourable member can rest assured that unless I was sure of my ground I would not repeat the statement here. Mr Watt!-Does the honourable member know by whom the statement was made?",29
80,Mr MATHEWS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"""It is safer to vote ' Yes' than ' No.'"" That was the statement.",29
81,Mr WATT,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,But by whom?,29
82,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"i do not say that the statement was made by officers. It waa made by people wbo were in the habit of going into the hospitals and visiting the soldiers. I honestly believe in what I am aaying, or I would not repeat the statement here.",29
83,Mr LAMOND,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,The honourable member said that he would get sworn declarations in regard to the matter.,30
84,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I said that I would get ' sworn declarations, provided that I had a guarantee that the men would not be penalized. Men who went out to advocate the "" No "" side have been punished.",30

87,Mr BKENNAN,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Me n have been insulted and threatened by f i e i r officers. Mr SPEAKER, - Order 1",30
88,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The Political Labour Council of Victoria approached the other newspapers of Melbourne. The Age informed them that they could have a page advertisement, and accepted money m payment for it , but at the last moment turned it down, and merely gave a 12-inch double column advertisement, making a refund afterwards. The Argus, the newspaper that professes to be fair, and professes to have a high standard, was also approached, and asked whether an advertisement could be inserted, but the reply waB, "" We have no space'; we will have no space until the Saturday week after the referendum."" That is, until about ten days after the referendum, they could find no space fian "" anti "" advertisement. DtSf ' ,r answer deceive any onef 'A pap*., that would take such action is absolutely despicable. Can the other side point to any case where they took an advertisement to a Labour newspaper, and space was refused, even after the money had been paid, and where the advertisement - was cut down to about a quarter of what was paid for? On the Sunday on which I was to speak in the Sydney Domain an advertisement was taken to one newspaper, and they said, "" We will insert the advertisement only if we are per' mitted to write it . "" There was no chance for the Labour party to put forth its - views. There is no doubt that the words which I cabled to Warrant-officer deceived. MCGRATH, M.P., "" That the Labour members, Federal and State, were unanimously opposed to the Government proposals:"" that there was no chance of expressing their views in the news columns of the newspapers; and that advertisements, even if they were paid for, would not be accepted, correctly expressed the position. This is the fair play that we received from the press. If we take every copy of the newspapers circulating in Australia, the Labour party control probably not more than 1 per cent., the other side controlling 99 per cent.; yet we had the majority of voters. What would the majority have been if we had had at least half of the newspapers with us, or if the press had accepted our advertisements as they should have done? However, I leave the matter there. We had to,fight against extraordinary odds, and we have won through in spite of everything-in spite of pledges that are now dishonoured, and, like a bad cheque, returned to the drawer as "" not negotiable -"" That is the position. When honourable members', pledges are presented for payment they are marked ""return to drawer,"" though they were not pledges made in the heat of platform discussion, but were made by honourable members - calmly and deliberately considering them as a Cabinet. They gave the pledge that they would stand or fall by this referendum. Did it ""mean anything ? Yet, with that advantage, they failed, and with all the other advantages which they thought they possessed-for instance, by reducing the number of reinforcements required! from 16,500 per month. "" Things are worse,"" they, said; ""worse than they have been since the battle of the Marne, yet we are only going to ask for 7,000 a month."" Were they fooling the people in October, 1916, when they asked for 16,500 each month, and was it their idea to sugarcoat a political pill for the people to swallow when they brought down the number to 7,000 each month, and said, ""These are only reinforcements?"" Why did - they not have the common honesty to put into the question submitted to the people the words "" compulsorily reinforcing our men ?"" They practically arranged the question to be submitted to the people, and they arranged who should vote, and they did it all behind the back of Parliament; but the people were not If time permits, I propose to refer to some of those who have objected, to being struck off the roll, and who are just as loyal as is any honourable member in this House. I met one man in another State. I did not ask him how he proposed to vote- I have never asked any man that question-bu the asked me what I thought of things, and told me that he was prohibited from voting. I pointed to certain battalion colours that he was - wearing, and asked him what it meant. He said, "" My son has just returned after serving for nearly three years; he is almost blind. I am entitled to vote, yet I have to go to some officer, and explain this, and ask him whether I can vote."" Even had he-been going to vote upon our side, I would not have asked him to appeal to this officer to be allowed to vote. In another case, the right to vote of a married man with five children, and whose only brother had been killed at the Front, was challenged. His father was born in Germany, but came to Australia as a child. As a matter of fact, he had volunteered for military service himself. Yet he was denied - a vote merely because his father was a German. Similarly, a lady in Adelaide, who has sent five sons to the Front, two or three of whom have been killed, was refused the right to vote. Mr ""WATT -'Sh e was not rightly refused. MT. TUDOR - I am not saying that she was, but persons were denied the right to vote merely because some of the electoral officers did not know as much about the electoral law as did others.",30
89,Mr BRENNAN,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,""" Rightly refused "" comes very well from the Minister for Works and Railways. MT . HEITMANN - That sort of thing might happen at any election. MT. TUDOR - But it was more likely to happen, consequent upon the introduction of this system, on the occasion of the recent referendum than it is at ordinary elections. People did not know whether they were entitled to vote or not. Indeed, many persons, whose parents had been born in .Sohleswig-JJjolstein or one of the border provinces, perhaps, of Germany or Austria, or in the Trentino, outside of Italy, consulted me as to whether they were qualified to vote. They were eligible to vote if they could prove that their parents had been born in 'these provinces before a certain time. Now, I submit that it is a very difficult matter for many persons to prove where their - parents were born.",31
90,Mr BOYD,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,In some cases it is difficult to prove that they were born ait all.,31
91,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"We must take that circumstance for granted. But while some people may be able to say that their ..parents were bora in certain places, owing to the entries contained in the family Bibles or in other books Which they have in their possession, it is extremely difficult for others to prove where their - parents were born. As a matter of fact, honourable members know that there are - many applicants for old-age pensions who cannot prove either the date or the place of their birth. I say that it was absolutely unfair to impose such a prohibition on a certain section of - the community at the last moment. I can cite still another case in which a man whose name is apparently as British as is my own, was allowed to vote, whereas his wife was denied that right. This man writesThe facts are as follow:-""Sh e was born in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, and has never left the Commonwealth. Her mother was born in Sydney, and her ancestors, as far back as can be traced; are all English. Her father was born at sea on the way to Australia, and his parents are all English. I am at a loss to understand how it was possible to bave made such a cruel blunder, and can assure you that she feels the showing up at the polling booth very much.""",31
92,Mr BOYD,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Was she a married woman ? - Mr TUDOR - Yes .,31
93,Mr BOYD,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,'Was she married to a German?,31
94,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"No . Seeing that the husband was allowed to vote, why was his wife denied that - privilege?",31
95,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"There are fools to be found everywhere. They may be found in an election booth, as well as elsewhere.",31
96,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The action that was taken by the Government enabled these fools to have their own way, and to challenge the votes of certain persons whose votes ought never to have been challenged. In this connection I intend to cite just one other case. Not long ago a man wrote to me from the Western District. His name, which I do not desire to disclose, is undoubtedly English. He has two brothers, one of whom is a Master of Vrts in this city, whilst the other is associated with a university elsewhere. Upon attending at the polling booth his wife's vote was challenged, and her ballot-paper was set aside. Yet her maiden name was Jones, and her parents were born in Wales. Case after case of this description might be mentioned. Only yester< ay I read the following in the Age news-5'per : DISFRANCHISED ELECTORS. THE - "" GERMAN ORIGIN "" QUESTION. PROTESTATIONS OF LOYALTY. ALBURY - Bitternes s has been engendered i.mong the large number of people of German pxtraetion in this district through the operalion of the provision in the late referendum disfranchising people whose fathers were born .n Germany. The matter was brought up on Wednesday at the meeting of the Hume Shire Council, some of the members of which are effected by sec. 25. There is no doubt about the loyalty of these people, and yet they were disfranchised. The Minister for the Navy desires to know what I said during the referendum campaign upon the question of the disfranchisement of aliens in our midst. I made a pronouncement upon that question from several platforms, but the newspapers did not publish it. I said that if any doubt existed as to the loyalty of any alien in the community such alien should be interned. It was the duty of the Government to act thus, but they had no right to disfranchise persons against whom there was not a whisper of suspicion. That was the statement which 1 made, and the fact that the newspapers did. not publish it was not my fault. I come now to the action of the Prime Minister which was, apparently, prompted by his visit to Queensland- I refer to the establishment of a Commonwealth police force there. To my mind, the right honourable gentleman's action in that connection was one of his worse during the campaign. I know that disturbances did occur at political meetings which he addressed there. But they were not of such a character as to warrant the establishment of a Commonwealth police force, and I hope that, though we now have the same Government in office again-the Out-again-in-again Government-the y will say that if Commonwealth police are necessary in Queensland, they are equally necessary in other States, irrespective of whether there is a Labour Government in power there or not. Not only did the press as a whole keep our speeches out of its columns, but we were also subject to a censorship. I have here the proofs of the reports of speeches which I delivered in Adelaide-on e at the Trades Hall in the afternoon, and the other at the Exhibition Building in the evening of the same day. To show the absurdity of the censorship, let me inf OTm the House that things which I said in both speeches were Icut out of the report of the afternoon's speech and allowed to appear in the report of the evening's speech, and vice versa. The proofs of the speech had to be furnished to the censor by the Labour daily paper, which had to wait until it had received them back from him before it could publish the reports. Apparently, the object of honourable members opposite wai to put every difficulty in the way of the Labour newspapers.",31
97,Mr BOYD,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,The honourable member is talking rubbish. What had we to do with that?,32
98,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I speak of the action of' the Government. I do not know whether the honourable member, when the vote on this motion is taken, will cross the floor, or whether he will remain a humble follower of the Government, endorsing its action in the breaking of its pledges, and its conduct of the referendum campaign. He is one of those on whom 1I have my eye. The officials of a Department run that Department much as the Minister at the head wants it to be run; they take their cue from him. With a keen Minister, the officials will be keen; with a slack Minister, slackness will develop. When officials tliink that the Minister wishes things to be cut out of a newspaper report, they will see that that is done. That great paper, which was afraid to publish our addresses-the Argus-sai d that my attack on Major Smeaton, the Adelaide censor, was unfair; but that gentleman, who is the chief censor for South Australia, was photographed with the Prime Minister, as one of his principal supporters.",32
99,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Surely this is a free country.,32
100,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Yes ; but a censor should not be a political partisan. It is his business to hold the balance of justice even. I have not the time to draw attention to all the passages that were cut out of the reports of my speeches, but this is one statement that was cut out. The Minister for Defence had said in Sydney that there were five divisions on the'Western Eront, and the equivalent of a division in Egypt. I repeated that statement, but the censor cut it out of the report of my speech.",32
101,Mr SAMPSON,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Were the proofs which the honourable member has supplied to him from the newspaper office?,33
102,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"It is sufficient for the honourable member to know that I have the proofs. If he wants to make a victim of any newspaper, he must remember that he is not yet in the Ministry, though we were told that he was one of the probables.",33
103,Mr SAMPSON,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,The honourable member cannot answer a question without making a personal attack. He is a man who has to obey the instructions of outside organizations; he is a mere puppet.,33
104,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The honourable member will have a chance, in speaking on the motion, to say what he likes. never taken exception to anything he has said about me.",33
105,Mr WATT,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"-Surely , as a pressman, the honourable member for Wimmera was entitled to ask the question.",33
106,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"It is sufficient that I have the proofs. How, when, and where I got them concerns me, not the honourable member for Wimmera.",33
107,Sir WILLIAM IKVINE,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,But the honourable member imputed a motive to the question.,33
108,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I am sorry if I was taken to do that. I decline to say how I got the proofs. It would not be fair if those who supplied them to me were victimized. We have a right to' know what is taking plaice. I have here three passages which were not allowed to appear in the report of the evening speech, but were allowed to appear in the report of the afternoon speech, and another passage which was allowed to appear in the report of the evening speech and not in the report of the afternoon speech. Perhaps the two reports were censored by different persons, though the initials on the proofs look to be the same. In Canada, iabout six months ago a Bill was introduced f to amend the Chinese Immigration Act, and Mr Roche was asked in the Canadian House of Commons, by Mr. MCDonald;-no t a very German namewhether requests had been received from coal-mine proprietors in British Columbia to be allowed to bring in Chinese labour. Mr Roche replied that there had been several requests for the importation of Chinese labour by employers in British Columbia, in the central provinces, and in the eastern provinces. The question and answer were published in the Canadian Hansard, a publication which is accessible in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library-it has not yet been seized. I quoted that passage in my speeches, but the censor cut it out of the report of the afternoon speech, though allowing it to appear in the report of the evening speech. Let me refer to another instance of the way in which the censorship was exercised. About a week before the referendum was taken, I had possession of a cablegram, which was sent from Great Britain, to say that Warrant Officer MCGRATH had distributed the statement that I had made, advising soldiers and I'have munition workers, nurses, and others, to Vote against conscription. That cablegram came to Melbourne, and was received by the Argus newspaper. It was repeated to the other States, and then was withdrawn.",33
109,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Does the honourable member say that we stopped his message?,33
110,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,No . The message which I sent to Great Britain was delivered. I made that fact known on every platform from which I spoke. .,33
111,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Then , of what does the honourable member complain?",33
112,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"When the - honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) published that statement in England advising the soldiers to vote "" No,"" and accompanying it with a diagram, I cannot for the life of me understand why, after .that statement was cabled out here, and arrived at the Argus office in Melbourne, and the Argus 'had apparently ibeeh lallowed by the censor to send it to the other .States, the censor should hold the cable up.",33
113,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,How do you know he did hold it up?,33
114,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I have proof that he did. It is distinctly endorsed on the message that cable number so-and-so, starting at such and such a word, and finishing with three words specified, must not be published. Another cable, I think No . statement ? 79, starting "" G i l m o u r "" and finishing "" Townend,"" stating that since Passchendaele the soldiers had had an easier time, that they were having a good amount of furlough, and that a good number of them were going to London and Parisand, by the way, General Birdwood self said they were in an easy sector and Creed"" not prosecuted? - were likely to have a rest for some time come-wa s disallowed for publication here after it had been sent away f London. It stated also that footballRugby, Australian rules, and soccerhad become an obsession with the soldiers, and that they were taking more interest in the inter-battalion contests than were in the latest wireless ex Cambrai. Why wias that cable held up ? The censors were instructed to give a. fair there anything in that statement of adcensor replied, "" No . "" vantage to the enemy? If there was, the British censors had no right to let it London; and had there been any doubt as to its helping the enemy I do struck not think it would have gone away from the Argus office. But here is <the political significance of the ter. The idea, apparently, was, not let the people of Australia know that the soldiers are having an easier time. Do not let them know that ' they are on f u r l o u g h ."" I believe cable was posted up on the board outside the Argus and Age offices that day, after it appeared there was withdrawn order of the censors. Why ? Simply cause they thought it would be a disadthe heading! vantage to them during the campaign, and of advantage to us, as showing the soldiers were having an easier time. I wish, before I close, to refer to the prosecution, or persecution, as it was, of public men on one side alone during the campaign. One side only was picked out tionists. for these prosecutions. The Postmasterwon General (Mr Webster) could say what liked. He could say I was the leader the Industrial Workers of the World , 164,000 but there was no prosecution for Is there one other honourable the Ministerial side who will say that I am the leader of the Industrial Workers of the World?

124,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [2.15] - I wish I were able to offer to the Leader of the Opposition those formal congratulations which are quite common in circumstances such as these, but I feel myself quite unable to do so. The speech of the honourable gentleman ha.s disappointed me. Had a turn of the wheel of destiny placed me where the honourable member is today, and had I succeeded no better than he has done, I should then consider myself to be gibbeted for ever by public opinion, and to have lost all claim to be regarded as a leader of men in this country. For the honourable member's own speech furnishes conclusive evidence why his motion should be rejected, and of his own unfitness to lead the Commonwealth in this critical hour. I ask honourable members to be good enough to review with me the actual situation as it now confronts us; I ask them to turn their eyes from those comparatively petty and insignificant details of the recent campaign to which the honourable gentleman devoted his whole attention, and regard that tremendous and tragic spectacle upon which the civilized world has been compelled to gaze, those awful agonies it has been compelled to endure for over three and a half years. Of this, the greatest tragedy in the world's history, the honourable member has said not one word. He has made no reference whatever to the fact that a great war is in progress, that it has now reached its supremest crisis, that our liberties and our existence as a free people hang literally by a hair. One would have imagined from the honourable member's speech that by some hocus pocus, or by the vote of the people, we had abolished war and its consequences, whereas in reality we stand now on the very brink of a precipice over which tomorrow we may topple headlong. Sir, the honourable member by his motion invites this House to declare, in effect, that it has no confidence in the Government, and he and those who are associated with him should govern the country. Yet he avoids all mention of those things that fill the minds of all thinking men... Not only has he passed over without a word' the war and deadly peril in which we stand, but he has made no reference whatever to the effects of the vote of the people upon the Commonwealth-; not a word has he said of the referendum as a means whereby Democracy expresses itself, and proves its competence and fitness as a means of government. Yet there is something about the result of the referendum and the situation with which we are now confronted at once tragic and sad beyond the power of words to express. When we contemplate the circumstances in which the referendum,, that supreme achievement of Democracy-governmen t of the people for the people directly by the people-to which we of the Labour party had pinned our faith, called upon to just if y itself, has failed, and failed abjectly, who amongst us can doubt that this, is a blow at the very foundation of democratic government ? The Leader of the Opposition has said nothing at all about the consequences of the referendum, vote to Democracy, to Australia, to the world, to civilization, and to the cause of peace. He has made no reference whatever to the present position of the war, the Italian situation, the darkening shadow on the Western front; no reference to Germany's attitude towards the Russian peace proposals. Every man must admit, extremist though he be, that the Bolshevik peace proposals did not err on the side of demanding too much from Germany. Yet today we see Germany contemptuoitsly evading these proposals of a Democracy run mad, a great nation now dismembered and in a state of anarchy, awaiting the hour when Russia, incapable of further resistance, will be at her mercy. He has made not one word of reference to the fact of 'the mask having been torn from the face of Germany, her hypocritical peace proposals exposed, her war aims clearly revealed. Instead of proving the fitness of his party to govern by dealing with a great situation in a great way, he has regaled us with statements about Mr So-and-so having said something and his remarks not appearing in the press; that a number of persons of German extraction were not allowed to vote, and so on; but not one word of the fact that Germany intends, if by any means she can accomplish it,' to Prussianize the world,, and retain her hold on all that territory of which she is now in occupation, and that she intends to dismember the British Empire-the greatest guarantee of the world's security and peace that history has ever known. Every phase of the titanic struggle in which the civilized world is engaged is ignored, and we have been obliged to follow the honourable gentleman through a maze of the infinitely little and petty. We have heard nothing of the great and tragic situation that presents itself to us and the world today. What is the present position of Australia ? Who shall say that Democracy has emerged triumphant from its trial? History will write its verdict on what Australia has done. Posterity will judge whether we, who declared that in no way can Liberty be retained by a people who were not prepared to fight for it, were right or wrong. I have no doubt what that verdict will be. We have not failed. The honourable member did not even say that the Government had failed. He was concerned more with the question of who shall sit on the Ministerial benches rather than with the fact of what the referendum vote means to Australia. He has not even done that which he might legitimately have done, holding the views he does, namely, acclaimed the fact that Australia has escaped from conscription. All he is concerned with is as to who shall sit here, and who there, that Mr So-and-so said something and ' was prosecuted, while Mr So-and-so said something else and was not prosecuted, and that The Antis' Creed hurt the tender feelings of some persons and no prosecution followed. I ask the House and the country to look at the existing war situation and to consider what the referendum vote means to Australia, and - what the war means to us. To-day we stand within a hair's breadth of a precipice. Armageddon is at hand. The legions of the enemy are massing for the great attack; forty-one German divisions have been detached from the Eastern frontier and concentrated at Cambrai. What is to happen on the battle-fields of Europe is to us the great thing that matters. How do those things of which the honourable member has spoken affect this fact? How do they lessen our danger? How do they help us to meet it? How would they avail if the Germans broke through the line at Cambrai ? Will any man tell us that we have a right to ignore a situation which may involve the nation in destruction? I had hoped that the honourable member would have let us and the world know that he realizes his responsibility towards the people of this country, and that he has some solution to offer of these tremendous problems which confront us. By not a word did he suggest to the House that he recognises the situation in which the country finds itself today. We heard not one word, either by way of approval or condemnation, of Mr Lloyd George's declaration of the principles for which Great Britain drew the sword, and upon which she stands today. The Prime Minister of Great Britain and President Wilson have set out clearly the terms upon which the Allies are prepared to make peace. He uttered not one word of commendation of those great pronouncements, consistent as they are with the cause for which Britain and the Allies drew the sword, and with a most sincere and earnest desire to bring lasting peace to the world. The most ardent lover of peace must surely commend these plain and definite declarations of the Allies' war aims, and of the terms upon which they are prepared to make peace; yet by not even a word have honourable members been privileged to learn the honourable gentleman's mind on 'this vital matter. May I be permitted to remind the House and the country of the circumstances that led up to the referendum? Let me recall to honourable members the circumstances in which this House was elected, and the pledges by which every honourable member on this side, and on the Opposition side also, is bound. Much has been said about pledges, and I say here and now that I am one of the men who, in 1914, subscribed to the manifesto upon which the Labour party was given a majority by the electors, without which we N would never have been returned to Parliament. It was this manifesto; setting out as it did clearly the war policy of the Labour party, that induced the electors to say, "" This is the party we want."" That manifesto was redolent of patriotic determination to wage this war to a victorious finish for those great principles which Mr Lloyd George and President Wilson but yesterday reiterated again to the world. It pledged every member of the party to a definite policy. Those pledges were given by honourable members oppesite, but they did not keep them. Yet they talk about honouring pledges. Every man on the Opposition side was elected upon the pledge that we would stand behind the Empire to the last man and the last shilling, subordinating all things in any and every circumstance to the carrying on of the war. Did they do so? Sir, .they did not. They were not allowed to do so by the outside organizations; but honourable members, at the behest of persons outside this Parliament, repudiated the pledges upon which they were elected. I was elected, together with the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) and every one of those honourable members who were returned to Parliament in 1914, upon the pledge to fight, this war to a victorious finish. That - was the policy of the Labour party in 1914; what is its policy today? If we contrast the elections of 1914, when the Labour, party, then united, went to the country upon that manifesto which secured our triumph, with the fate that overtook them on the 5th May last, when, at the behest of men outside, they set aside their former pledges for a mean and narrow creed which brought them deservedly to destructionthen we shall see by what means they have fallen from grace, and how richly they deserve the fate that has overtaken them. The party which was given an overwhelming majority in 1914 received in 1917 the greatest defeat in the history of the Commonwealth. It was victorious because it put country before party; it was defeated because it put party before the country. It is true that honourable members speak now as though they were today the representatives of the majority; but they are not so. The Nationalist party has failed, if like to put it so, to arouse the democracy of this country to a sense of its duty, but it Is not we who have failed, but the people of Australia. We have failed to make disloyal men loyal; we have failed to make cowards brave men; we have failed to make lip-servers of loyalty loyal in their hearts; we have failed to make selfish men forget their selfishness. There are tens of thousands who urged us on, yet went to the ballot-box and, for the sake of their pockets, voted "" No."" would infinitely rather stand with men Mr Hughes. . . . . -. i . : I have denounced-wit h the Sinn Feiners, who have an ideal although it is one with which I cannot agree; which I think indeed is calculated to hinder rather than promote the object they have in viewthan with these men who sold their country to put money in their pockets. - I can understand a man giving a vote to save his life, although I cannot applaud his action. I cannot forgive it , but I can understand it. I can understand men who are attajched to an organization following that organization out of a mistaken sense of party loyalty. I can understand all these things although I cannot applaud them. But I cannot forgive those men who, grown fat on this war, pretended that they desired Australia to do her duty, and went to the ballot-box and voted against her doing it . Let us review the situation. Honourable members interjecting, May I ask, Mr Speaker, that there may be no interjections. I cannot hear them, and therefore it is not fair to me that should''be made.",35
125,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Since the Prime Minister has specially drawn my attention to interruptions I ask that they cease. Since there is. a time limit to speeches it is specially important that the Standing Orders be observed, and I expect the House to observe them.",37
126,Mr MAHONY,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,We made no interjections.,37
127,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Order ! I shall name the next honourable member who interjects immediately after I have called for order.,37
128,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I come now to the circumstances that led up to the election of this Parliament. In 1916 a referendum was taken on this very question at you a time when I was Leader of the United Labour party. By a majority the people of this country rejected the proposals then submitted. But within six months of their rejection the Nationalist party was returned to office by the largest majority ever accorded to a party in Australia. It was returned to ofiice upon a platform clear and unambiguous, and which set out unmistakably the differences between the two parties. Those differences still divide us. I declared in my Bendigo speech, that it was for the people ""to choose I by what men and what ideals they snould be governed. The ideals of out, 1 party were set out quite clearly and distinctly. This party was elected on the policy set out in my Bendigo speech prior to the elections of 5th May, 1917. It s attitude towards conscription was set out in the following words: This Government will not enforce nor attempt to enforce conscription either by regulation or statute during the life of the forthcoming Parliament. If , however, national safety demands it, the question will be again referred to the people. That is the policy of the Government on this great question. Speaking at Benalla on 26th April-dur ing the same campaign- I saidWe shall not find a ready excuse or pretext for putting this question to the. people. We shall put it only if the tide of battle which now 'flows strongly for the Allies turns against In that case we shall put it before the people. That was the policy of the party I have jthe honour to lead on this"" great question. It was upon that that the National party were elected. It in volved a double pledge- a obligation. The one was that we would not introduce conscription behind the backs of the people; the other, that if national safety demanded it-and the test of whether national safety did demand it was that if the tide of battle which then flowed strongly for the Allies turned against them-the n we were in honour bound to submit the question to the people either by way of election or .referendum. It was upon this distinct understanding that the electors ' returned the party to power. Our position on this matter was quite clear. What was the position of the war immediately preceding the date on which the Government decided to launch the second Referendum campaign ? Never in the history of the world has there been a change more tragic, more catastrophic than that which overtook the Allied cause in the months of October and November last. Russia, that great All y , had completely collapsed. It a l y had been overwhelmingly defeated. In the history of the world there is no defeat that can bear comparison with that of the Izonzo. Two hundred and f if t y thousand- I quote, of course, from the newspaper statementsof the' Italian Forces had been taken prisoner, and at least 200,000 casualties had occurred. Great armies no longer continued to exist. That line which seemed to be not only impregnable against the attacks of the Austrians, but on the verge of sweeping down on to the plains of Austria, was in a moment sent reeling over the Tagliamento, u n t i l it was driven back on the Piave to the very gates of Venice. Tha.t was the position. Will any man dare to say that, in the face of the Bendigo speech, and the circumstances in which we were elected, we as a Government and a party ought not to have consulted the people, ought not to have told them plainly what the position was, and have asked for that power without which it seemed to us we could not fairl y do our duty to the Empire? At that very time, as honourable members well know, General Birdwood, who has had the them. honour of being hooted in this country by some gentlemen who were very prominent in the "" No "" campaign, but whose name will live in the history of Australia as that of a man who has served the cause of civilization, of the Empire, and Ausdouble tralia, had declared that one division of the Australian A r m y had to be withdrawn. He set out in plain terms the number of reinforcements required. Do honourable members think that we could in honour have remained silent, that we could have retained office, without going to the people and telling them these f acts ? Will any man say that with any of the means at our disposal we could have hoped to get voluntary recruits to fill up the gap? There was no l>or>e; at least so it seemed to us. I said at Benalla if the tide of battle turned against the Allies we should again put this question to the people. The tide of battle did turn unmistakably against the Allies, and we put the question to the electors. Upon them rests the responsibility. Time will . write its verdict on the decision of the Australian electors on 20th December, and I feel confident that when the verdict is given it will not be we who put the question, but the people who rejected it , who will stand condemned. Those were the circumstances under which we took the referendum. My honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, after having been my colleague for many years, and ' therefore knowing me very well, indeed, has said that the referendum was taken because the honourable member for Elinders (Sir Will i a m I r v in e ) had been campaigning throughout tihe country on this question. I intend to say but one word on this particular point:; I have been a colleague of some of my honourable friends opposite for many years, and if they pretend to believe that in the Caucus or on the floor of this House, or anywhere else, they know me as a man who can be driven by any man, I will say no'more than that I do not agree with them. The Government took their own view of the responsibility in regard to the referendum, and the honourable member for Flinders quite properly took his own course. For that he is responsible, and can answer. We did what we considered proper and absolutely essential. We felt we could either go to the country on the issue or put it before the people by way of a referendum. We adopted the latter course. The battle of the Izonzo, the collapse of the Russian armies and of the Russian nation, were ample justification, and provide a reason that is so full and complete as to close the mouths of all save those who come, not to be convinced, but to condemn. I come now to the circumstances under which the Government took the referendum. It is said that we sugarcoated the p ill , and that we ought to have asked for more. Indeed, it was freely stated during the campaign that if we got this power we would not stop there. I shall read shortly some of the statements made in the literature of my lionorable friends on the other side, who urged that we would introduce industrial conscription 1",37
129,Mr BRENNAN,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Hear , hear! .",39
130,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Who stated that we would take the married men.,39
131,Mr FINLAYSON,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,We say so still.,39
132,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I want to make it perGovernment fectly clear that when the B ritish A r m y Council told us that 16,500 recruits per month were necessary, we asked for 16,500. Likewise when we are told that 7,000 were necessary we ask for that number. Will any honourable member say that we could have done our duty to the Empire in any other way? Some one must have the responsibility for carrying on the war, and by common consent it was placed in the hands of 'the War Cabinet, in whom the outer Dominions have every confidence. The War Cabinet declare how many men are wanted, and it is for us to say whether we shall grant them or not. The Cabinet' asked for 7,000 men per month from Australia, and we stated the conditions under which we hoped to secure that number. W;e exempted married men, and we said also that we would provide the labour necessary for the industries of this country. The proclamation issued by the Government, and containing its proposals to meet the requirements of the War Cabinet, will stand as a monument of a democratic Government and party, endeavouring, in: the most critical juncture of the country's history, to do their duty as men intrusted by the people of a free country with the reins of government in the greatest crisis in the world's history-to Australia and the Empire. The Leader of the Opposition has spoken about this pledge or statement made by me at Bendigo, and he has said a lot ahout honour and the obligation cast on men in regard thereto. Now, let me speak plainly. As I understand the statement made at Bendigo-if honourable members like to call it a pledge I shall be glad to do so, too, but I call it a threatI said to the people, "" If you do not do so and so, then, for my part you get some one else to govern the country.""",39
133,Mr BLAKELEY,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,And the people have got some one else.,39
134,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,I was elected on the distinct understanding,39
135,Mr BRENNAN,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,Why all EEese excuses? Get on with your speech.,39
136,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST, Order ! I ask the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) not to interject.,39
137,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I was elected on a distinct understanding contained in my Bendigo speech of 5th May, and every other supporter save, I believe, one or two, was elected on that policy also. Those statements bind me, because the people, in consideration of such undertakings, returned me to Parliament an'd this Government to ofiice. When I made that pledge at Bendigo, what did the Government stand to gain? Did we stand to gain ofiice? No. Did we stand to gain anything? No. We were in office with a great majority behind us; we had been elected upon a war policy that gave us a free hand to give effect to our policy on all matters except conscription. That was and still is the position. I come now to the pledge or threat. What did it mean? If my pledge meant anything, it meant that the people must choose whether they would have a National party or an Official Labour party. If it did not mean that, it was a mere idle phrase. It meant, "" You must have either conscription and us or no conscription and the honourable member for Y a r r a and his party."" , The honourable member for Flinders has put the case in ithat way, and that is what it meant, and what the Government put before the people. The loss of a referendum itself has never been regarded in this try as a reason why a Government should go out of office. I shall come to the pledge afterwards, but, in itself, the loss of a referendum has never been so regarded. When the referendum was introduced by the Fisher Government . in 1911, and was defeated by an overwhelming majority, I never heard-and I was then in a position to hear a good deal-the faintest whisper of a suggestion from the honourable member for Yarra, theu colleague, that he should give, up office. Indeed, my late right honourable leader, Mr Andrew Fisher, now H i gh Commissioner, said that he would immediately introduce another referendum that would make the people f all down with f r i g h t ! Mr Ryan, the Premier of Queensland, has said that the present Government ought to leave office and allow the Official Labour party to come in . B he has never paid: the slightest attention to an adverse referendum vote. will be remembered that recently Mr . Ryan introduced a referendum with a view to abolishing the Upper House in the State of Queensland. It was defeated, but he never suggested for one moment that he should vacate office. On two occasions I have had the honour, as leader or lieutenant of the leader of the party opposite to assist in introducing referenda. On each occasion the referendum was defeated, and on neither was there a suggestion that the Government should vacate office. The only reason, then, for the Government vacating office lies in its own rate statement made to the electors at Bendigo that, if the people did not agree to the proposal made, we would not govern. The declaration at Bendigo was put forward as an inducement to the people to accept the. Government proposal. effect, we said this : Grant the power asked for by us, or else my friend the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Tudor) and his colleagues will govern this country. It would have been no inducement whatever to the people of the country to say that we, the members of the present Government and of the late Government, would go out and allow eleven other men of the National party to come in and govern the Commonwealth - that would not have turned one solitary vote. The issue was-Conscriptio n and counthe Nationalist party or no conscription and the Official Labour party. Well, the electors rejected the proposal of the late Government, and the other day I tendered to His Excellency the Governor General the unconditional resignation of the Government. H is Excellency sent for my .honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition. As is set out in the memorandum by the Governor General, His Excellency had no advice whatever my from me. If His Excellency had. chosen to entrust the Leader of the Opposition with a commission, it would have been for this House to determine whether a Government led by the honourable gentleman had the confidence of the House. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman would have accepted a commission, but, whether he would or not, unless he had a promise of a dissolution, it does not, on u t the face of it , appear probable that he would have lasted very long. The honorIt able gentleman was not given a commission. H is Excellency, in a way, I think, almost unprecedented, exhausted every effort to obtain information as to the state of the House and the prospects of stable government, and he came back to N me, and asked me to accept a commission. What I meant by the pledge was-Tudo r or me. What my colleagues meant was-the Nationalist party or the Official Labour party. There is no way by which the Official Labour party can govern in this House while there are fiftythree men on this side not prepared to support.them, while, at the outside, there are only twenty-two men on the benches delibe- opposite! Then His Excellency, untrammelled by advice from me, declined to give the Leader of the Opposition a commission, either with or without a dissolution. Therefore, the only way in which that pledge could be carried out in In a way satisfactory to my honourable friends'.was impossible for us. We had done on our part everything that could be done, and I venture to say that if eleven other men of the Nationalist party stood here in office, their position would have been no different. We should have been supporting them instead of them supporting us. Several honourable members interjecting,",39
138,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST," I have two or three times called order, and I ask the honourable member for Maribyrnong to cease his very audible conversation when I request that order shall be observed.

140,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Order ! Mr - HUGHES - What I have said is the view of the members of the Nationalist party, and I venture to say that it is the view of the great majority of the people. In view of the fundamental differences of policy, ideal, outlook, and circumstance between the two .parties in this House, there is only one way by which the honourable Leader of the Opposition can secure a majority in this House, namely, by an appeal to the people. But His Excellency, the Governor General, in the exercise of his tion, has, most properly, I think, refused to agree to dissolve a Parliament barely eight months old. If any man will say honestly that it is in the best interests of the country that we should have an appeal to the people-that there should 'be more turmoil and more confusion-well , then, I do not agree with him. Several honourable members interjecting,",41

No Confidence.",41
145,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"-In the last sixteen months, we have had two referendums, a general election, and the greatest strike in the history of the Commonwealth. It is now, I think, up to - us to see if it is not possible for men representing the people of Australia to come together and try' to do some work on behalf of Australia. When the Nationalist for party was formed, or before it was formed, the Leader of the Opposition was asked to join the party, and endeavour to create a truly National Government by including all sections of the House. He declined to do so; he would have none of it. If my friend will say to me now that he is prepared to work with this party, I , for one, will be prepared to help him. If I am the man who stands in the way, and he will only work with the National party upon the condition that I am not Prime Minister, I will stand - aside if he is prepared to agree to a policy acceptable to the Nationalist party, But I adjure him, as a representative of the people-and I appeal to every man on the opposite side-to find a modus vivendi whereby we can do the work we were sent here to do, and help Australia to perform her duty during the war. Honourable members oppositeresent discresome of the statements made by conscriptionists during the campaign. In what better way could they confute all those who Have declared them to be disloyal, to be in favour of turmoil, to be collaborateurs of the Industrial Workers of the World, than by declaring that they are willing-to let bygones be bygones, and are prepared to put Australia first.' Now that we have submitted this question of conscription to the . people, let us prove, however we differ on this one point, we are united in our determination to win the war and serve Australia . It is to my honourable ; friends opposite"" I make this appeal in 'the most public, definite, clear, and unambiguous way. Let them now say what they will do. And in - the fervent hope that they will work with us for the common good, I do not intend to indulge in personalities, recriminations, or say anything that will reflect upon my honourable friends. I am here to deal with great I principles and causes, and not with individuals. I invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition to join hands with us either in the Government, or outside it , and help us to serve the best interests of Australia and the Empire in this great National crisis. I turn now to the second paragraph of my honourable friend's motion - whic h relates to the prosecution of public men. The Leader of the Opposition has endeavoured to persuade this House and the country that the Government has misused its great powers to prosecute individuals because of their opinions, that it has stifled freedom of speech, and that it has prevented honourable members opposite and others who tliink with them from freely putting their views before the public. What are the facts ? There is not a . country in the world in which a man may say - what he can say in Australia today. In the words of Archbishop Kelly, which I quoted - several times during the referendum campaign, I again say-and I say it without reference to the gentleman referred to at all-that "" if he had been in any other country where there was not so much liberty as in - Australia he would have been imprisoned long ago. And it would have been for a very long time, too. If he had been in Russia, France, or It a l y , there is no doubt he would have been condemned long ago."" There is no country in the world which has been given the opportunity of freely expressing its opinion on peace and war that is afforded in Australia. The very soldiers in the trenches, the man in the street, our women-al l sorts and conditions of people-hav e been consulted; have been given the fullest opportunity of expressing their views, and determining the policy of the country. The people have spoken, as I think, most unfortunately. They have failed; but that failure is not due to the Government. It is a reflection on Democracy, and a complete condemnation of the referendum as an instrumentality of democratic government. Now let me come to the censorship, about which the honourable member complained - The honourable member for Yarra affirmed that his party had not been given a fair chance. I propose to read the instructions which I issued to the Chief Censor, and which that officer carried out, and I venture to say the Leader of the Opposition can find cause for complaint with them, he is exceedingly difficult to please. On the 24th November, the day on which I reached Sydney, I met the editors of the Sydney press. They put before me certain complaints, and I said that I would rectify them, and issue instructions which they declared would be quite satisfactory. I will read the memorandum which was forwarded to me by the Chief Censor in Sydney, Mr C. G. Nicholson. It is as follows:Enclosed are also the following proofs, showing deletions made in pursuance of instructions from head-quarters :(1) ""Married men, beware! "" (Worker, 20.11.17.) (2) "" Can you trust this man? "" (Worker, 20.11.17.) (3) 'Hughes' fatal admission."" (Worker, - 23.11.17.) \ (4) ""Factory Employees Union's conscription circular."" (25.11.17.) (5) "" Is conscription democratic?"" (No Conscription Council, 23.11.17.) I . understand that you instruct me not to continue to make similar deletions. My record of your instructions is:The Prime Minister instructs me(1) to cease deleting matter contravening War Precautions Regulations (including matter prejudicial to recruiting) unless it would convey true or false naval or military information te the enemy. (2) to pass false figures and false statements, such as, "" Enougb men have already left these shores to keep the five divisions at a strength for over three years ahead."" The Prime Minister rules that the statement quoted is purely political, and defines ""political matter"" as all matter not of naval or military benefit to the enemy."" There is to be no censorship of "" political matter."" All the foregoing instructions are to be applied to all newspapers, without discrimination, and to all leaflets, pamphlets, and other matter submitted for censorship. Will it not be necessary to advise printers and publishers that the passing of matter by the censorship does hot protect them from liability under the War Precautions Regulations, or any other law? I understand that you do 'not instruct me to pass for publication:- I. (1) Disloyal statements; or (2) Matter likely to offend an allied or neutral power. As your instructions contradict the written instructions of the Minister for Defence, will you please confirm my record by initialing the duplicate of this letter. That was minuted by me, and those in that if structions were carried out. This memorandum was read at a subsequent meeting at which the editors of the Sydney newspapers were present, - and those gentlemen were perfectly satisfied with them. All the prosecutions which were instituted were prosecutions for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, and the majority of these prosecutions were for offences committed before these instructions were issued. I venture to say the memorandum I have just read is a complete answer to the charge of political censorship. It leaves no room whatever for hostile criticism, and completely sweeps away the charges that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. Now for another matter. The honourable gentleman has complained very bitterly of statements made by advocates of the "" Yes "" side, and has declared' that I declined to prosecute the persons who made them. I say that, in the face of the instructions which I have read, nobody was prosecuted for statements other than those calculated to mislead the elector in the exercise of his vote, and for reflections upon our Allies. Outside these two restrictions everybody - had a free hand.* The statements which are alleged to have been made by conscriptionists, and which are printed on the anti-conscriptionist leaflets, do not fall within either of these restrictions. They are statements which may be offensive to my honourable friends. When they were brought under my notice, I said that I did not approve them, and that I would give permission to anybody vvho so desired to institute a prosecution of the authors of them. I treated both sides alike. So far from, preventing my honourable friends from saying whafc they desired, I erred - on the other side, allowing many things to be published which were grossly offensive, full of lying misrepresentations, and statements calculated to affect recruiting to pass unchallenged. I allowed leaflets called "" The Lottery of Death,"" '""The Blood Vote,"" "" Billy's B u l l e t in ,"" "" Conscription and its Attendant Curse,"" and another which is headed "" The Curse of Cairo,"" some excerpts from which I propose to read, to circulate freely. Everybody could say what he wished to say. Tf he made a false statement was the law to punish him. If any one can bring forward the charge that I have not prosecuted any on the "" Yes"" who made false statements, I will prosecute them now, even though they be memifr. Hughes. bers of this Government. Here is one statement made in this "" L o t t e ry of Death,"" a tissue of vile falsehoodsWhen Hughes was reproached last year with ignoring his pledge not under any circumstances to send men out of the country to fight against their will he answered with a thoroughly Prussian disregard of the binding nature of any honourable understanding "" What does it matter what we thought yesterday?"" I have never sent a man out of this country against his will , though I have bad the power to do it . I have not broken that pledge, if it was a pledge. I have never in my-life said, "" What does it matter what we thought yesterday ?"" It is a lie. The whole thing is a lie. But I let it go. The censor brought the pamphlnt to me and said, "" It is full of lies;"" but I said, "" Let it go."" Here is another statement prejudicial to recruiting and full of lies. It is signed by S. A . Glover, Cairns, and saysWorkers of Queensland, Married Men. Nowhere is there any express exemption of married men. Married men must come forward eventually. Do not fall into the trap laid for you. Vote "" No."" Yet hundreds of thousands of proclamations were circulated throughout the country saying that married men were expressly exempted. That statement was brought to me, but it was allowed to go out. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition says that I did not give the other side fair play. Every man knows that, in the north of Queensland, the "" Yes "" side never had a chance to make itself heard. There is now a reign of terror in No r t h Queensland.",41
146,Mr FALKHTER,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,And elsewhere.,43
147,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Yes , and elsewhere. There is a boycott. In certain districts, no small shopkeeper dare say that he was for ""Yes."" No man on the wharf dare say that he was ^ for the "" Yes "" side. Means were resorted to by the "" No "" side which prevented an expression of opinion. I was denied a hearing several times. I was met at Darlinghurst by a howling mob of men. I venture to say that there was two months' supply of recruits there, but I was not allowed to say one word. Yet there these gentlemen talk about freedom of speech. Do they say that there is no other - way of closing mouths except by side censorship? In the face of the instructions that I gave the censor, in the face of those lying and infamous statements issued by their side, and issued freely, will they still say there was any political censorship? Do they say it , in the face of this vile statement, which was issued in the Cairns Times, in black type:The awful toll paid in Egypt, in the wrecked and wasted human life, owing tain diseases, was worse than the casualties of the Dardanelles; and tb ask any Australian women who realise the mystery and iniquity behind the world tragedy tovote in favour "" Yes"" in the face of these facts, was liberately to ask them to elect to go down to hell with their eyes open. I let that statement be published. I doubt need for a referendum. very much whether I did my duty in doing so. But I did it . Yet honourable bers say that I exercised the censorship unfairly against them. The honourable member says that some of his speeches were held up. My Adelaide speech was held up four hours, and did not reach bourne u n t i l too late f o of the press.",43
148,Mr JH CATTS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,For what purpose?,44
149,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I do not know. zens, It was delayed; but, whether by the censor or by the telegraph department I do not know. Surely the honourable member does not propose to hold me responsible for the actions of any individual as the way in which he carries out liis duty. 1 gave my instructions and expected them to be carried out. They were clear and explicit, and no man could misunderstand or criticise them. If they were do. not carried out how could I help it? The honourable gentleman tried to make the line at Cambrai? the country believe that the "" No "" side was handicapped by the censorship, that i its supporters were without money, denied opportunity of setting out their views. What are'the facts? In this campaign honourable members opposite had more money behind them than we had. They had more posters than we had. For three or four days in the Sydney press they had half pages of the Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph fully displaying certain secret memoranda written by Mr Holman. Their dodgers were scattered about in hundreds of thousands. They had more that canvassers. They closed our mouths whenever _ they could get a chance to do so. Yet they come here and talk about freedom. They used the boycott. Collins-street one day I saw a soldier kicked because he wore a '.' Yes "" button. There was a reign of terror. No man could call his soul his own who dared to say he was for the ' ' Yes ' ' side. In the face of all these things honourable members talk about not having a fair shape of show. They had every show, and they to cerhave had their way, and they have dragged Australia down. They said that industrial conscription would follow if of this referendum were carried, bufc today dethey cannot stand up here and say it , because they know that industrial conscription could be imposed without the The power to impose it has been with us for years. memEvery one knows ""that we could impose industrial conscription how.

151,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"However , the people of this country, some declining to accept their proper responsibilities as free citiothers to take responsibility through sentiment, fear, selfishness, cowardice, or through failure to visualize the tremendous nature of this titanic struggle, have failed Australia in her hour of need, and to now we have to make the best ol things as they are, and du onr duty to the Commonwealth and the Empire.

Will you do that?""- I tell my honourable friends opposite plainly if they will get 7,000 recruits per month their place is where I stand, and I will support them or any one else who will get them. They have secured the reI n jection of compulsion. Well, what is their policy in regard to raising men forreinforcements? The following resolution was adopted by the Official Labour party on the 3rd of this monthThat this Council endorses the preamble of the peace proposals adopted at the last Political Labour League conference, and demands that the Allied Governments Immediately initiate negotiations for peace. Are we to entrust the government of the country to a party with such Honourable members' opposite say that they can get recruits, yet it is notorious that, taking the party by and large, the leaders of the movement outside-thank God there are exceptions-instead helping to gain recruits by voluntary means, it has thrown its weight us. The conscriptionist movement ing failed, .are we, on being thrown back on voluntarism, to resign the administration to men controlled by outside bodies which have declared that the Allied Governments should immediately initiate negotiations for peace? with Germany whilst her military is still in the ascendant? Peace with the Hohenzollerns? .Upon what Russia has initiated peace negotiations: what is her position ? The so-called peace negotiations are still dragging on, but as Germany's military power remains, and that of Russia no longer counts, will be no peace satisfactory to Russia and the Allies. Now that Russia's have melted away into a disorganized rabble, Germany is waiting home. She is not making an arrangement with an equal, but dictating as a conqueror, her proposals being designed, not to bring about a lasting peace upon the foundation of the recognition of .the rule of law, of national rights, of liberty, and of true civilization, extend Prussian domination over ania and Poland. Germany demands the free entrance of German goods Russia for a period of fifteen years. If Germany were to offer us peace the annexation of any part of Australia, but on the condition should allow her goods to enter country free for the next fifteen years, would one member of this House propose acceptance, of the offer? one! Sir, to give effect to resolutions such as that to which I have means the destruction of our liberties,' of our very existence as a nation. only way in which we can secure peace and safety and the Mr Hughes - just after to make our own laws, and 'develop this country in our own way, is by breaking the power of the Hohenzollerns. Mr . Lloyd George and President Wilson have voiced the opinion of the Allied nations. It is not against the German people, sane and clothed in their right mind, that we wage war. It is against the accursed militarism in which they are enmeshed. views? Let us break that. Let us have a sane political system in Germany, under which the people govern, and there wil l be some guarantee for the world's peace; but today, when the legions of Germany are of massed for a desperate attempt to break through to Calais and Paris, to dictate against terms to France and to Great Britain, havis not the time to talk of peace.

196,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"When this incident took place I was dealing with the third point raised by the honourable member for Yarra in his motion, namely, the disfranchisement of Germans and the descendants of Germans. I do not for a moment assert that there are not in Australia many loyal Germans. It is a very obvious thing that we were not defeated by Germans in this campaign. If they had all voted for us their vote would not have altered the result. I entirely agree with the Leader of the Opposition that disloyal persons ought to be interned, but there are various ways of manifesting disloyalty. We were, unfortunately, faced with a situation in which the German propaganda in this country had done its work cunningly and only too well. There being a life and death struggle between Britain and Germany, we had to deal with the situation as we found it, and, while penalizing very many loyal Germans by our action, we thought that it was only right that this vote should be decided by persons of British descent. I make no apology for that. I say, again, that in no country in the world has tliere ever been such an opportunity given to the people to say whether they were for peace or for war as there was in this country, and in no other country is there such freedom of speech and action. I have dealt with the various points raised by the honourable member for Yarra in his motion, and by way of conclusion I shall briefly refer to them again, but I now come to the present situation. I find the Parliament constituted as it was upon the result of the last general election; parties in the House of Representatives stand 53 to 22, and in the Senate 24 to 12, or, as the actual results of the last Senate election showed, 18 to none. Without a fresh appeal to the people there is no possibility of a Government being carried on other than by the party commanding the majority of the Parliament. The late referendum has not and cannot, alter the state of parties in this House. We [108] » are now where we were on the evening of the 5th May. We were elected on the 5th May upon a policy, the particulars of which I shall remind honourable members of by reading an excerpt from a speech of my own on that date. I had already set fprth the position in regard to conscription which we took up at the general election. I said that we accepted the verdict of the people given on 28th October, 1916. We said that we would not introduce conscription behind the backs of the people, and, further, that. if the national safety demanded it we would bring the question before them again. I said that if the tide of battle turned against us we certainly would do so. All these pledges have been faithfully kept. We have not brought in conscription behind the backs of the people. We were , pledged, if and when the tideof battle turned against us, to bring the question of conscription again before the people, and we have done.so. We pledged ourselves to resign if the referendum was carried against us, and we have done so. Nothing will satisfy my honourable friends opposite but that they shall take possession of the Treasury benches. The pledge would have been utterly meaningless if we had said that we as an Eleven would go out and that another Eleven selected from exactly the same party, and having exactly the same policy, would come in. What sense would there have been in making such a pledge as that to the people? It was evident that the pledge as given was intended, as I repeat, to induce the people to realise the gravity of the position, and to choose between the Official Labour party without conscription or the National party with conscription. The people have chosen. The Government has resigned unconditionally. It has done all witliin its power to give effect to its pledges. The government * has to be carried on. I stand here having carried out my part of the pact; it is for this Parliament to carry out its part, and do that which it was returned to do on the 5th May. We are now in exactly the same position as we were then, having been defeated on conscription, yet having been deputed by the people to carry out a war policy. I said, on the 28th March, 1917„ It is our duty to help the Empire in the struggle. Indeed it is imperative to do so, for only by helping the Empire can we save Australia. As I have said, tliere are many ways in which we can help the Empire-wit h men, .with money, with onr. products. As to men, now that the people have decided against compulsion, the call of duty, of patriotism, of tralia, of Empire, must reach the ears of all our young men. Let them go forth and strike a blow for the land that has bred them. Let them draw the sword in defence of those liberties with which this country has so richly endowed them. Now, let me turn to other means by which Australia can aid the Empire. This war is not as other wars, merely between the armed forces of the belligerents. It is a war between nations. Every man and woman is or ought to be a fighter, struggling for his or her life. Every resource of the Empire, the services of every man' and woman able to do some useful work, are needed in order that we should be victorious. Now the most effective means by which Australia can' help the Empire, apart from sending .men to fight, is to send from her great storehousemetals for munitions and products to feed and clothe the Imperial and Allied armies and the people of Britain. I set for t h then the policy of the Governists ment. As we were then so we are now. Again we have asked the people for power to raise reinforcements hy conscription. It may be that long before this Parliaby ment reassembles it will be no longer with in our power to do anything at all the way of self-government, for I say liberately that when we consider that with the greatest difficulty have the forces made their way step by step in some France, progressing so slowly that in and a half years they can hardly be to have advanced at all against those forces Germany was then able to muster, how can it be said, with the German legions already reinforced by forty-one divisions from the Russian front , that Allied line is safe? And if the Allied armies fail, what then is to become and of our self-governing institutions, our liberties, of the Australia we love? In the meantime, we are to do our and this Government and Parliament aro to go on with the work which the people elected them to do. We are to get men, and if we cannot get them we mu3t face the position. It may be that peace soon come. God knows no more sincere <»r earnest evidence of peace was ever made than the recent pronouncements Lloyd George and President Wilson on lasting peace must fail. successive days. If Germany is in earnest in desiring peace she can have it. But the true voice of Germany, is heard not in those honeyed accents,, censored Mr lluglies. ments, and cunningly devised emanations from the Wolff Bureau which are circulated throughout the world ; it is not heard through those agents who have poisoned Aus- the minds of the people of Australia; but in the cable message I shall quote we have Germany in cxcelsis. According to this morning's ArgusSpeaking at a Conservative Congress held at Halle, in Prussia, General von Liebert declared:"" VVe hold that might is right. We must know neither sentiment, humanity, nor compassion. We shall incorporate Courland and other provinces with their 60,000,000 Russians. The Slav nightmare will ride us no longer. We must have Belgium and Northern Prance. The curse of God is upon the French people. The Portuguese possessions must disappear. France must pay until she is bled white."" There we hear the voice of Prussian m i l i tarism. If the voice of Socialism in Germany can make itself heard; if the Socialw ill pluck up root and branch that cursed Hohenzollern tree, and speak to the people of the w o r l l as a civilized nation, the three conditions of. peace laid down Mr Lloyd George-(1 ) the sanctity of treaties must be re-established, (2) a terrii n torial settlement must be securely based on dethe right of self-determination or the only consent of the governed, and (3) Allied we must seek by the creation of international organization to two l i m it the burden of armaments, and said to diminish the probability of war - offe r terms that no nation truly desirous of peace can reject. Those are the terms which the Labour party at the last Inter-State conference in Adelaide promulthe gated. They are terms to which all lovers of liberty and peace can subscribe. Mr . of us Lloyd George has stated the means by of which we can < obtain peace, and 1 President Wilson has repeated in greater best, detail the very same principles. The world longs for peace, but we must not live in a paradise of fools. There is only one way by which we can get peace-w e must destroy that dynasty and its m i l i will tarism which has made the world a bloody shambles. Until that is done there can be no peace and no security. Until miliof Mr tarism is crushed, all attempts to secure We shall be as the Russians are today, endeavouring to set up an ideal Democracy while the tiger is unleashed and waiting to strike down its prey. stateI appeal to honourable members opposite to help the Government, to co-operate with it during this war, and to stand by our side in the attempt to solve those difficult and complex problems that confront us. I say again, if they desire to completely collaborate with this Government let them say so, and I forone will 'go more than half way to meet them. For the rest, I say the honourable member's motion is one which ought not to, and will not,"" receive the support of this House. His claims to govern this country are such as not to merit the consideration of the people. He is not supported by a majority in this House or in the country. The only proof ' of his claim to have a majority in the country is that the referendum on conscription has been defeated; but on 28th October, 1916, conscription was defeated, and with in - five months, by the greatest majorit y in the history of Australia, the National party was returned to power. We are back in the position we were in before.. The Government is in office constitutionally. The honourable member for Yarra has had his opportunity. We freely resigned Avithout any conditions. Now we are again in office, and intend to carry out the policy upon which we were elected. Mr J.' H . CAT TS (Cook) [3.57] The ordinary hour for adjournment having been reached, and the Government having arranged to adjourn this afternoon and resume on the ordinary sitting days next week for the consideration of this motion- ",48

200,Mr JH CATTS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"The honourable member knows that, owing to the agreement made yesterday, a number of us who return to other States each week have made our arrangements for the week end. The Government, by the personal action of the Prime Minister himself, as stated in the Law Courts in Sydney, has taken action against me in regard to a number of speeches I made, and I am bound under six different headings which practically make it impossible for me to deliver a speech outside this House. I desire an opportunity to deal with the actions of the Government, and I shall not have that , opportunity if the debate is proceeded with today, and I , owing to an arrangement made yesterday, have agreed to be in my electorate at the week end.",50

(B y leave)- I have sent for a copy of the Hansard record of yesterday's proceedings in order that we may know exactly what was - said last night. Speaking from memory, what I said was that we should finish next week. My honourable friend was unable to give me an assurance that we would.",50
204,Mr JH CATTS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"He said that we would probably finish next week, but he arcould not guarantee that we would.",50
205,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Obviously , the proof our finishing next week will five be considerably increased the longer we l l sit this week. If the Leader of the Oppow ill say on what day next week he and his party are prepared to finishlet it be Friday or Saturday next ab any hour- I am willing to agree to the House meeting either on Tuesday or Wednesday next at any hour the Opposition pleases. The sole condition' is that we should finish the whole of our business I , too, afc a particular hour next week.

206,Mr FENTON,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,No .,50
207,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Honourable members cannot have it both ways. If honourable members say that after the no-confidence motion has been settled we are to have another wrangle over Supply, I am opposed to that course. If they will agree to allow a month's Supply pro forma, and then deal with the no-confidence motion upon the condition that it be decided next week",51
208,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,I do not specify any time within which the motion shall be decided.,51
209,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I do specify a time; otherwise, we might be discussing it for a month. Will not the honourable member see that, whilst on the one hand he says we are denying him an opportunity to state his case, on the other hand, when we offer him five days in which to challenge the Government, he says the time is not enough ?",51
210,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,There are only three sitting days in the week.,51

If the Opposition will undertake to dispose of the no-confidence motion and of .Supply, and finish the whole of the business at any time before 11 p.m. tomorrow week, I am prepared to agree to the adjournment of the House now and ' to th© re-assembling of the House on any day next week that they choose to 'mention. Otherwise we must go on.",51
214,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST," I induced our party last night to agree to the granting of :a ^month's Supply without debate on the understanding that the no-confidence motion should be brought on today, and that in the discussion of the next Supply Bill we should not mention any matter relating to the referendum. I said, as reported in HansardI am willing that the Government shall have Supply for one month without debate, provided that tomorrow the no-confidence motipn is permitted to come on. How long the discussion of that motion shall last is a matter within the determination of the. Government, which has a majority, and can closure the debate at any time.. iTbe no-confidence motion having been disposed of, Ministers can say what business shall be taken. Apart from the referendum, and the things that were done in connection with it, honourable members may desire to criticise the conduct of various Departments. I have heard dissatisfaction expressed regarding the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department, the Defence Department, and other Departments. We have a right to criticise the administration of Departments generally.",51
215,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Once the no-confidence motion has been disposed of, honourable members should confine their remarks purely to matters arising out of the Supply Bill.",51
216,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"If on the no-confidence motion we have a fair discussion of the referendum and kindred subjects, if each honourable member on this side is permitted to speak for an hour and a half, sbould he so desire, on those subjects, 1 do not think any one of us will raise those questions again on the Supply Bill ; and the Government can please itself as to what it asks the House to do.",51

219,Mr TUDOR,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"I am anxious that we should arrive at an agreement, but some honourable members opposite, judging by their constant interjections, desire that we should not. The Government, apparently, are anxious to close up Parliament.",51

I remind the honourable gentleman that an undertaking was given to the farmers that a full supply of sacks would be available in time for the harvest. From private knowledge I can assure honourable members that, while in many'cases the contract has been f a it h full y carried out, there has been wide-spread failure, involving dual purchase of sacks-on e - I have purchase of old sacks at even a greater cost than new-and the dumping of wheat on the ground; indeed, in some cases there has been a complete cessation of harvesting operations. I blame no one personally, but the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. All sorts of excuses for the failure of the contracts have been made, and there' is, in consequence, great agitation throughout the farming community. I ask the Prime Minister to cause some inquiry to be made; and I suggest that the Prices Commissioner, who is doing his utmost under the tryin g circumstances to adjust supplies, should have within his knowledge most of the facts, and be able to place - valuable information at the disposal of any Committee of Inquiry. I ask the Prime Minister to have some inquiry made, so that the responsibility for the failure in supplies may be placed on the righb shoulders.",53

259,Mr HIGGS,SYDNEY HARBOR TRUST,"Capricornia) [ 4 . 4 2 ] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence the case of the Mount Morgan Pony Racing and Trotting Club. This is a purely benevolent institution. Nobody connected with the club receives any personal gain from it . The whole of the proceeds, after some necessary expenditure-whic h other honourable members, who seem to be amused, possibly know more about them than myself-is devoted to charitable institutions. The Defence Department has decided to permit the club to have only twelve meetings in the year. We all appreciate the desire of the Government to curtail unnecessary amusement, and understand that the> Treasurer hopes by means of this curtailment to induce people to put money intowar-savings certificates or loans. I am inclined to believe that very little money that goes to. the patronage of the' club would find its way into war certificates. I hope honourable members will permit me to point out the particular 'objects to which .this club devotes the proceeds of ita meetings. The figures I give relate to the period between March, 1916, and December, 1917, and the donations, were as follow:-Wa r Committee, £52 3s.; Am bulance Brigade, £68 14s.; Benevolent Society, £22 3s.; General Hospital, £72 10s.; Miners' Health Committee, £40; Clermont lielief Fund, £15 10s.; private donations, £15 9s.; Rod Cross Society, £60 8s. l i d . ; Young Men's Christian Association, £5 5s - a total of£352 2s. l i d . It will be seen that those who patronize this pony club do. t ry to make some kind of-slial l I say ?-re paration for their amusement; aiid they ask to be permitted to have twenty meetings per annum, the number allowed to the Rockhampton Racing Club. This, I think, is a modest request, . which I hope will be taken into earnest consideration by the Minister. I .could adduce further arguments in support of my request, but as honourable members are anxious to catch their trains for other States, I shall not, at this stage, do so.",53
