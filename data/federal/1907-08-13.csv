0,NA,Unknown,"- Mr CROUCH - I think so. . Perhaps ?Bouse of Iteptmntatibes. Tuesday, 13 August, 1007. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. TARIFF. NA TRANSIT-NOTIC E or NEW DUTIES I N - TASMANIA - DUTIES ON HATS AND CAPS - DUTIES ON BRITIS H MANUFACTURED GOODS-TARIF F COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND REPORTS.",14
1,Mr CROUCH,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"Will the Treasurer make an announcement to the House in regard to the practice which, I understand, he has declared likely to be adopted in regard to the cargoes of vessels which had unloaded at one Australian port before the new Tariff came into operation, but had nor landed the rest of their cargo at their remaining Australian ports of call ? I understand that in such cases it is intended hot to give to the importers at the first port of call an advantage over their fellows at the other ports. I have received a letter from Mr W. R. Anderson, of Geelong, who says that he has goods on board the steam-ship Kent, which reached Adelaide last Monday week, and on board the steam-ship Narrung, which reached that port last Tuesday. He points out that the Adelaide importers .by those vessels will obtain an advantage over him unless he is allowed to land his goods at the rates provided for in the old Tariff. I have also had a similar request fiom Messrs. Bright and Hitchcock, importers, Geelong.",14
2,Mr WILKS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"If any concession is to be given, should it not apply to Sydney, as well as to Geelong ? the Minister will make a statement covering the whole ground. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I have received a telegram in which reference is made to the case of four or. five steamers.",14
3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"Personally , I think that, unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary, consideration should be. given to importers whose goods are in vessels which had touched at an Australian port before the new Tariff was imposed, although they may not have put out their cargo at all their Australian ports of call.' Those importers, are in a position very different from that of merchants who, on Thursday last, had goods in bond, because bonded goods can be cleared at any 'time, and those who kept their goods in bond until after the new Tariff came into operation did so on their' own responsibility. If a vessel had touched at Fremantle, or any other Australian port, before the new Tariff came into operation, but had not visited all her Australian ports of call, the consignees of goods at the ports which she had not' visited would not have had an opportunity to take possession, of them on paying the old rates of duty. - Mr Frazer - Is not what the honourable member is saying now contrary to what he said on .Friday last ?",14
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"No . I am repeating my statement of Friday last, and am not in the habit of saying one thing and meaning another. The matter is one for the Minister of Trade and Customs to deal with; but, as I have been asked a question with regard to it, my reply is that I do not think it fair to differentiate between shippers by any vessel which had touched at one Australian port before the coming into operation of the new Tariff, but had not visited all her Australian ports of call. ' If means can be devised for treating all such shippers alike, I hope they will be adopted: Of course, I ' leave the matter entirely in - the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs; but I should advise him to try to meet consignees at ports other than the first port of call, who could not land their ^oods before the introduction of the new",15
5,Mr GLYNN,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,It is a very dangerous thing to do.,15
6,Mr MATHEWS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"When importers are allowed to land their goods onpayment of the old rates of duty, will the Government see that the goods are ear-marked, so that the public shall not be called upon to pav"" more for them ? Sir. WILLIAM LYNE - When the last Tariff was being discussed in this Chamber, it was found that it would be difficult to return over-payments of duty in cases: in which packages had been broken, although it is possible where packages have not been broken. If repayments were made .in' the first case, importers would obtain a double profit.",15
7,Mr WATSON,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,No refund at all should be given.,15
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I th'ink.that, as a general rule, refund's should not be given; but the position of consignees circumstanced like the gentleman mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Corio is distinct from that of other' shippers. ' Once a vessel has called at any port of Australia, she must be regarded as having entered the Commonwealth, and ought to be able 'to ' land her goods at all her. Australian ports if payment is made on them in accordance with the Tariff rates prevailing at the time of her first reaching Australia. Therefore I think that the position of importers by any vessel that had touched at one Australian port at the date of the introduction of the new Tariff,, should be taken into consideration.",15
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"Will the Minister expedite the decision of this matter as much as possible? ' ' Sif WILLIAM LYNE I shall do nothing without consulting the Minister, of Trade and Customs; but I have a'dvised him on this subject, and I hope that, if he can, he will act on my advice.",15
10,Mr WILKS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if he is prepared to admit, under the old Tariff, all goods which, on the day on which the new Tariff was imposed, were in vessels then off the coast, or sighted?",15
11,Mr CROUCH,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,O r in vessels which had touched at one Australian port? ' Mr Wilks - Yes . Will the Minister . allow the goods in all such vessels to be landed on payment of the old rates of duty?,15
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"There is a great difference between the position of vessels which weresighted or off the coast on the day when the Tariff was imposed, and that of vessels which' had touched at one port, and landed part of their cargo; they do not come within the same category. I have advised the Minister of Trade and Customs to place in the. same position all importers by vessels which, on'the day of the introduction of the new Tariff, Had touched at an Australian port', and landed cargo there; but I have nothing to say in regard to goods in vessels which had been . sighted or were off the coast on that date,* because no part of those cargoes could be landed under the old Tariff, and all - who were shippers by such vessels are in the same position:",15
13,Mr WILKS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,I point out that' my question is directed to the Minister of Trade and Customs. I should like that Minister to answer it. I do not believe in sweating the Acting Prime Minister.,15
14,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I recognise the importance of the question, and, if the honourable member will give notice of it, I shall be pleased to answer it at a later date.",16
15,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I - understand that when the Tariff was brought into operation, on Thursday last, no copy of it was available in Tasmania, so that the Customs authorities there were in complete ignorance as to the rates of duties to be levied next day.",16
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,I am informed by the Minister of Trade and Customs that that is not correct; that the Tasmanian Customs officers were informed of the proposed changes. This information was given by telegram on the night on which the new Tariff was brought down.,16
17,Mr LIDDELL,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I wish to draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the observation of the manager of the Denton Hat Mills in regard to the proposed new rates of duties on hats and caps, reported in Saturday's Melbourne Agethat competition is very keen, and that a higher duty than that previously ruling was essential.. "" We expected a great deal more,"" he said. The proposed duty on hats, caps .and bonnets has been fixed at 35 per cent., and at 30 per cent., against Great Britain. Mr Geo. Bruce, chairman of the Denton Hat Mills, observed that a duty of 30 per cent, barely covered the difference between wages here and in competing countries-if it did cover it. In some cases the proposed duty was not sufficient. In considering those statements will he bear in mind the following extract from the report of the Chairman at the last annual meeting of the Denton Hat Mills CompanyThe year had been more successful than he had anticipated. The last alteration in Tariff, as regarded hats, was a reduction, but the effect of this was more in shifting trade from one source to another than towards any diminution. Trade had really been better.",16
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"The honourable member has asked rather a long question, but I happen to know a good deal about its subject-matter. I am rather pleased than otherwise, in view of all the statements which have been made, to find that the Tariff has not given satisfaction to some manufacturers. Though we received some communications from persons as to what they thought the duty on hats, caps, and other articles should be, the Minister of Trade and Customs and myself adopted the duty which we thought should be im[ 6 l ] -2 posed, and if it has not given satisfaction to the manufacturers we are very sorry. At the same time, I have nothing whatever to do with their profits or their losses, and I think that the honourable member cannot reasonably accuse me of putting on duties in the interests of any particular manufacturers.",16
19,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it is a fact that goods of British manufacture which are passing through the Customs House are charged at the rates specified for foreign goods?,16
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I do not know. If the honourable member will give notice of the question to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I dare say that he will receive an answer. Air. MATHEWS - I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister when he can hope to get the promised return showing in parallel columns the old duties and the new duties ?",16
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"An instruction for the preparation of the return was given on Thursday or Friday. I have not had time to make any inquiry as to the progress made with it, but I shall get the return for honourable members as soon as possible.",16
22,Mr TUDOR,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I desire to ask. the Acting Prime Minister whether he will have the return referred to compiled so as to show, in separate columns, the old Tariff, the new Tariff, the recommendations of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission, and also those of the free-trade membess of that body, so that we can have all the information in a compact form?",16
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"The suggestion of the honourable member is worthy of conthe sideration, because I consider that honourable members should know what the free trade section of the Tariff Commission .did recommend.",16
24,Mr GLYNN,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether, if he allows importers, who could have landed their goods at Fremantle, to clear them at any other port in the Commonwealth at the old rates, he will make the provision by Bill since it involves an alteration of the Customs Act?",16
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,If the honourable and learned member will give notice of the question I shall be pleased to afford him the information which he desires .to get.,16
26,Mr FULLER,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"As the reports of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission were issued this morning, I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister when the reports of the free-trade section of the Commission will be issued?",17
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I desire to have all the reports placed in the hands of honourable members at once and simultaneously; I am not aware of what has taken place. All I can say is that I laid the reports on th%s table of the House* the other night and moved that they be printed, and that the motion was agreed to.",17
28,Mr HUME COOK,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,Some reports of each section of the Tariff Commission were issued today.,17
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,No .,17
30,Mr WATSON,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether, if any importers are allowed a refund of duties, he will take steps to insure that the customer is allowed to get, at reduced prices, the goods in respect of which the refund is made ?",17
31,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"If the honassistance orable gentleman will give notice of the question I shall be very glad to give him an answer. The point which he has raised admits of a great deal of discussion, and is surrounded with difficulty; because I am advised that although some of the manufacturers have not raised their prices, there is strong evidence that the retailers have raised theirs.",17
32,Mr SPEAKER,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"In "" reference to the question of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, I may inform the House that several reports of the Tariff Commission were in type when they were tabled on Friday, and of course, it was possible to distribute copies of them immediately. The other reports were not in type, but they will be printed and issued as speedily as possible.",17
33,Sir JOHN QUICK,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I desire to ask the Treasurer whether in order to facilitate the consideration of the Tariff he will have prepared for the use of honourable members a list showing the recommendations of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission with which the Government have disagreed, and also the substituted and new proposals of the Government?",17
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I desire to afford the fullest information to honourable members, but whether I can get a return prepared exactly in the form suggested, I am not prepared to say. If the honourable and learned member will give notice of a question for tomorrow, I shall find out whether it can reasonably be done, and without undue delay. I have a great deal of information to get ready this week.. I do not want the discussion on the Tariff to be commenced without honourable members having all the information I can place before them.",17
35,Mr TUDOR,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,I desire to ask the Treasurer why the Excise duty on harvesters was not included in the Excise proposals which were laid on the table the other night?,17
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I hope to have, either on the basis of the Excise duty on harvesters or on a basis which may be simpler, the principle of what is called the new protection carried right through the Tariff. It would have been useless for me to bring in the Excise principle in regard to harvesters, strippers, and other articles if I am to deal with the whole of the Tariff under the system referred to, afterwards ignoring what I had proposed in the Tariff in the first instance. I have asked for, and I hope that I shall get, in devising means which may be somewhat simpler than the Excise duties. I intend to make those means, whatever they may be, applv to all the main items in the Tariff.",17
37,Mr TUDOR,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,The position today is that the manufacturers can sweat their employees as much as they like.,17
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"All I can say is that if I find, before the Tariff is made law, that such is being done, I shall take immediate action.",17
39,Sir JOHN QUICK,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"As you, . Mr. Speaker, have control of the printing and issue of ' the reports of the Tariff Commission I desire to ask whether you will take steps to see that they are issued in a form which will be convenient for reference ; that is to say, that the reports of the free-trade members and of protectionist members shall be put together and issued as one document, instead of .separately ? Only today I saw some reports by the protectionist members, of the"" Commission grouped together instead of being connected with the reports of the"" free-trade members of that body. As a matter of convenience, I think that the reports of both sections of the Commission should, in each instance, constitute one document.",17
40,Mr SPEAKER,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"Of course, I have only one anxiety in connection with this matter, and that is to afford honourable members the utmost possible convenience. If the honourable member for Bendigo will confer with me at a later stage this afternoon I shall see how far his wishes can be met. Up t ill the (present, the plan which has been followed has been that all reports signed by certain members of the Commission have been placed together, and all reports signed by other members of the Comimission have also been placed together, whilst reports which have been signed by the whole of the members of the Commission have been similarly grouped. If the suggestion of the honourable member be practicable, I shall be pleased to give effect to it.",17
41,Mr CROUCH,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I wish to ask you, sir, whether it is any part of your duty to distinguish between' those, members of the Commission who are protectionists and those who are free-traders, seeing that the so-called free-traders themselves do not now appear to know whether or not they are free-traders?",18
42,Mr SPEAKER,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I did not say that the reports had been grouped according to the free-trade or protectionist leanings of members of the Commission, but that those reports which had been signed by certain members of that body had been placed together, whilst those which had been signed by other members had also been placed together. PATENT MEDICINES.",18
43,Mr THOMAS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he has laid upon the table the Departmental papers regarding patent medicines in accordance with the promise which he made to the honourable member for Corangamite last week?,18
44,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I have 'laid so many papers upon the table that for the moment I cannot answer the honourable member. If , on inquiry, I find that the papers have not been tabled I shall table them at the earliest possible moment. ORDER FOR WA R VESSELS.",18
45,Mr KELLY,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I desire to draw the attention of the Minister of Defence to the following statement in today's AgeSome doubt still exists as to the precise action - that Commander Colquhoun has taken in England with regard to the calling of tenders for several torpedo craft and destroyers, to constitute the nucleus of an Australian coastal defence navy. The Minister of Defence yester day received information that tenders had been ""invited in the London press. Mr Ewing thereupon cabled to Commander Colquhoun that if he had called for tenders he has exceeded his instructions. The Minister also asked for further information on the subject. Commander' Cblquhoun's reply may be expected to-dayand to ask whether a reply to the Minister's cablegram has been received?",18
46,Mr EWING,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,I have not stated that I expected a reply. One has not yet been received. COMMANDERCOLQUHO UN AND* ENGINEER CLARKSON. ALLEGED TENDERS FOR TORPEDO BOATS..,18
47,Mr KELLY,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence whether-if the statement which has appeared in the press that Commander Colquhoun has invited tenders for the construction of torpedo vessels in England, and has to that extent exceeded his instructions be true-the Minister will consider the advisability of his immediate recall?",18
48,Mr EWING,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I do not think that I will consider the advisability of his immediate recall. In the first place, I would point out to the honourable member that before we censure him we must be perfectly clear that Commander Colquhoun has done wrong. I have no objection to telling the honourable member-I - really did not think it worthwhile to make a statement to the House upon the subject",18
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,It is a matter of no consequence.,18
50,Mr EWING,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,I do not think it is of very much consequence.,18
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,The defence of Australia is a small matter.,18
52,Mr EWING,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,I do not wish to discuss that question with the honourable member. The facts are these,18
53,Mr SPEAKER,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I would point out to honourable members that a question has been put to the Minister of Defence, whois now giving information to the House. It is to"" the interests of all that that information should be heard by honourable members, and that conversations which prevent it being heard should not take place in the. Chamber.",18
54,Mr EWING,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"The facts of the matter are that some considerable time ago the Government sent Commander Colquhoun 1 and Engineer - Clarkson to England in order that the information which we have in our possession might be supplemented on the spot by two intelligent and capable 7 officers who were deputed to inquire into defence matters generally and to collect all the information which could be obtained from the Admiralty authorities, so that ultimately we might Le able to lay definite proposals before Parliament. These officers went to England, and, apart from private letters, I have heard nothing from them, but I read in the newspapers a statement that chey had invited tenders for the construction of torpedo boat destroyers. Knowing that they are sensible men, I am inclined to believe that they have not taken the responsibility of doing what has been attributed to them. I am rather disposed to think that some misunderstanding has arisen, and that probably in the course of their investigations they have asked for quotations for the construction of these vessels, or something of that kind. Consequently I merely cabled asking them what are the facts of the case.",18
55,Mr WILKS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,They have ignored the Minister's cable.,19
56,Mr EWING,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,They have not. honourable member fenows that nobody can ignore the Minister.,19
57,Mr WILKS,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"Has the Minister received areply? . Mr EWING - No , but we must give them sufficient time to reply. Honourable members do not wish to find fault with these officers unnecessarily. They are just as entitled to fair treatment as we are ourselves. Later on, I will tell the House the full facts of the case, and honourable members willfind-as they will always find, so long as the administration of the Defence Department is in my hands-that they need not worry about this or any other similar matter.",19
58,Mr KELLY,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"Seeing that it is the privilege of this House to vote Supplies for everything ordered by the Commonwealth,' I desire to ask the Minister whether, in the event of it being proved that these cers have exceeded their instructions, and, so far, committed the Commonwealth to an expenditure which this House has - not authorized, he will consider the advisability of their immediate recall?",19
59,Mr EWING,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"In'answe r to the honourable member's question, I wish to say that it is not possible for two officers to compromise this House. Before anything can be purchased, the House . must vote the necessary Supplies. I assure the honourable member that I will keep him - ait fait with this matter. As I obtain the information I will let him know all about it. Mr= JOHNSON - I wish to ask the - Minister whether he will be good enough to inform the House when the cable asking for an explanation of the facts as related in the newspapers was despatched?",19
60,Mr EWING,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,It was despatched yesterday morning. AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY: EXCISE DUTY.,19
61,Mr HUTCHISON,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"When will the Minister be in a position to supply the promised return showing the rates of wages paid under the operation of the Excise upon the manufacture of agricultural machinery ? Will it be ready before the Tariff discussion, takes place ?",19
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I hope to have it ready today, but it has not yet been, placed in my hands. I shall take care that there is no undue delay in the giving of information in regard to this or anyThe other question affecting the Tariff.",19
63,Mr HUTCHISON,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether Excise has been collected from the manufacturers of agricultural machinery who are* not complying with the"" award of the Arbitration Court?",19
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"Without knowing definitely the full particulars of the case, I may say that I gave the necessary instructions.",19
65,Mr HUTCHISON,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,Has the Excise been collected?,19
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,Excise is not collected unless manufacturers commit a breach of the regulations.,19
67,Mr HUTCHISON,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,But some of them have never complied with the regulations..,19
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I cannot say. whether any manufacturers have committed a breach. Before I relinquished Minisoffiterial control of the Department of Trade and Customs I gave instructions that all manufacturers should be kept up to their undertaking. Whether that has been done,, I - do not know. In one of the newspapers I read a report stating that the decision in a number of cases which had been heard by the Arbitration Court had been deferred by Mr Justice O'Connor. I am not aware whether any of these come within the category of those referred to by the honourable member, but I will ask the Minister controlling the Department to make inquiries and to let him know the result. WOMEN'S WORIC EXHIBITION. .",19
69,Mr MAHON,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it is true that the sum of ;£i,ooo has been paid to the Women's Work Exhibition, and, if so, upon what authority? If there has been no authority for the payment will he be good enough to lay upon the table of the House any correspondence in connection with the matter ?",19
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"In reply to the honourable member's question, I may say that this is the first time. I have heard of the matter.",20
71,Mr MAHON,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,The money is provided on the Estimates.,20
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLLECTION OF DUTI ES ON GOODS I N,"I do not know whether the amount mentioned has been paid. I do not know every item which appears upon the Estimates, but I will make the inquiries which the honourable member desires. NA OF TRAWLER .",20
73,Mr MATHEWS,TENDERS FOR CONSTRUCTION,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister, who, I understand, represents the Minister of Home Affairs, whether in the tenders called for the construction of a trawling steamer, provision was made for paying the standard rate of wages ?",20
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TENDERS FOR CONSTRUCTION,"I may tell the honourable member that a general instruction has been issued that that provision shall be inserted in all contracts. I have not been called upon to deal with the special contract which he mentions. It is in the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs, but I feel quite sure that the provision to which the honourable member refers has been made. NA TRANSMISSION. MEDICAL QUACKS' CORRESPONDENCE.",20
75,Mr JOHNSON,PROHIBITION OF POSTAL,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Has his attention been directed to the action - taken by the New Zealand postal authorities in reference to the transmission - by post of the pamphlets and other printed matter of medical ""quacks""? 2. Is he aware that most of the firms against - whom the prohibition has been directed in New Zealand are Australian firms, having their offices - either in Sydney or Melbourne? 3. Will he issue necessary instructions in ference to correspondence dealing with all such firms throughout the Commonwealth, so as to prohibit the transmission through the post-offices of any such correspondence?",20
76,Mr MAUGER,PROHIBITION OF POSTAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Since notice was given of these questions, my attention has been directed to the action referred to. 2. I am aware that in the order published in the New Zealand Gazette, most of the firms against whom the order has been made are said to have their offices or places of business in Sydney, and in three cases, in Melbourne. 3. I have given instructions that inquiries are to be made into the nature of the business of those persons or firms against whom the order referred to has been made, that I may satisfy myself whether similar action should be taken here. NA FOR HONOURS.",20
77,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN RECOMMENDATIONS,"the Acting Minister of External Affairs, upon notice I. Whether the recent grant of Knighthoods and Orders to Australian citizens was made on the recommendation of the Governor General and his Advisers? 2. Were they consulted at all in this matter? .. Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The replies to the honourable member's questions are:r. Ministers are aware that recommendations for the honours mentioned are made through the State Governors, but have no knowledge of their number or nature. For this reason, among others, it is impossible for me to reply further to the first question. 2. Any suggestions for the conferring of honours made directly from the public to the Governor General, are referred by him to the Prime Minister. It may be added that the general method of dealing with recommendations for honours employed by the Colonial Office, has been the subject of several express protests from this Government. During the recent Conference in London, the Prime Minister, after consulting his fellow representatives, personally pointed out some serious defects of the existing method to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies. So far, there has been no promise of any amendment. CHEAP WEEKLY TRAINS: MELBOURNE AND SYDNEY.",20
78,Mr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN RECOMMENDATIONS,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeIn view of - Workmen's Weekly 2nd Class fares in Melbourne and suburbs eaualling 240. miles for 3s. ad., see page 150, Victorian Railway Guide, and in Sydney and Newcastle 408 miles for 5s., see page 169A, New South Wales Railway Guide, and in order to produce greater comity and friendship between the two large re- - centres of population in Sydney and Melbourne (nearly one million of people), will the Acting Prime Minister request the Commissioners of Railways of Victoria and New South Wales, to consider the desirability of running a weekly train between Melbourne and Sydney on somewhat the same basis, viz., a return ticket, equalling 1,165 miles, for 20s., which would even then be an increase of 28 per cent., if the same rate as the said New South Wales Workman's Ticket were charged ?",20
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN RECOMMENDATIONS,"It is somewhat difficult for me to reply to the honourable member's question, in view of the fact that it deals with railways, over which we have no control.",21
80,Mr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN RECOMMENDATIONS,The Government might make a polite request.,21
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN RECOMMENDATIONS,"I never care to make a request that may be refused. In the particular case to which the honourable member refers, if circumstances arise which would warrant me in making a recommendation to any of the States Governments I shall be very glad to do so. NA GOODS IN AUSTRALIA.",21
82,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice-Whether he will take steps so that, when the Tariff is before the House, information may be available to members, approximately, as to1. The quantity consumed in Australia of the goods on which the proposed duty is to be levied, as compared with the quantity of such goods produced or manufactured in Australia, as the case may be? 2. Whether the production or manufacture of such goods is being carried on at a profit or otherwise, and to what extent?",21
83,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The answers' to the honourable member's questions are as follow - 1 1. The approximate quantities or values of imported goods consumed in Australia are set out in the Trade Statistical Return, - published by the Commonwealth Statistician. It is not practicable to"" readily ascertain the quantities of such goods produced or manufactured in Australia. 2. This cannot be stated without a knowledge of the financial affairs of the producers and manufacturers, but it is presumed that the industries are not generally carried on at a loss. LIEUT . RUSSELL.",21
84,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"the Minister of Defence, upon noticer. Why has Lieut. Russell, of the Perth Highlanders, not been charged before a military tribunal with conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman, he having been expelled from the Perth Stock Exchange, of which he was a member, after being charged by the Stock Exchange Committee with dishonourable conduct, in that he, when sued for balances due by him to H . L . Conran, a member of the Adelaide Stock Exchange, did, in an affidavit dated 4th September, 1905, make oath and say that "" the transactions between him and the said H . L . Conran were gambling transactions, and were illegal by section 12 of the Police Act Amendment Act of 1893 (No. 1),"" although the transactions between H . L . Conran and Lieut. Russell were ordinary ""bear"" or other share transactions, so that he was unanimously expelled from the Stock Exchange at a special meeting held on 22nd May, 1906? 2. As the military regulations provide that ""every officer whose character or ""conduct as an officer and gentleman has been impugned, must submit the case within a reasonable time to hisCommanding Officer or other competent military authority for investigation, and officers of all ranks will so act as not only to insure respect for authority, but also to foster feelings of selfrespect and personal honour so essential for military efficiency,"" have the regulations beec ignored or suspended in Lieut. Russell's case. If not, why has he not been dealt with under same? TARIFF. 3. Is the standard of personal honour for commissioned officers of the Australian Military Forces such that an officer who has been expelled from a Stock Exchange for dishonourable conduct, is nevertheless deemed by the military authorities worthy to wear His Majesty's uniform. If not, why is Lieut. Russell permitted to wear that uniform and retain his commission?",21
85,Mr EWING,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as followIn March last a Military Board of Inquiry, the members of which were militia officers who are also members of the legal profession, was assembled at Perth to investigate the case of Lieut. Russell, whose character had been impugned. The Commandant reported that, after perusal, the evidence taken, the accusations against Lieut. Russell had not, in his opinion, been substantiated, but recommended that the papers be referred to the Crown Solicitor for his opinion on certain legal technicalities. The whole of the papers were then referred to the Crown Solicitor for advice, as to whether any charge lies against Lieut. Russell under M i l i tary Regulations, and, if so, what. In his reply, the Crown Solicitor reviewed the case, and stated as followsThe question I understand submitted to me is whether, if the above facts are found . by the Board of Inquiry to be true, they constitute charges against Lieut. Russell, under the Military Regulations (for which he could be punished), and, if so, what? I am not advising as to whether the charges are, in my opinion, proved or not-o r what effect raising the defence in the affidavit referred to had on the action-bu t am confining this opinion to the above questions submitted for advice - I am also taking it for granted, the word dishonorably evaded payment by pleading the Gaming Act, only means that it was dishonourable because it was pleaded at all-no t because of any other act proved to the Board which was dishonourable. I am of opinion that the charges do not constitute an offence under the Regulations. The only one it, I think, could be considered to come under if any would be 23 of 236. "" Being an officer, behaves in a scandalous manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman."" I 'am of opinion that the Regulation was not intended to include any act unbecoming a gentleman, such as evading a debt of honour by pleading the Gaming Act; but something that is, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, behaving in a scandalous. manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman. The Crown Solicitor was then asked whether - the Department had any power under.the Defence Act to. take further action, and his reply was that any further action could not be taken under the Act or Regulations, because Lieutenant Russell had not committed any breach of same; and, further, that, in his opinion, evading the payment of a debt by pleading the Gaming Act is not an offence against the Regulation quoted, although no gentleman would be likely to do it. The question of - amending the Regulations with a view of providing for cases similar to that under notice is now under consideration. SUPPL Y OF RIFLES .  the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is it in accordance with fact that, as stated by Lieut - Colonel Reay, while we could in case of necessity muster a force of 80,000 men, there are in the whole of Australia 60,000 rifles, 21,000 of which are obsolete? 2. If this statement be correct,' has vernment any intention of taking action to supplement the supply?",21
86,Mr EWING,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The answers to the honmerely orable member's questions are as follow1. At the present time, there are 36,000 zine Lee Enfield rifles in the Commonwealth, and 19,530 on order, and expected from land in the course of the next six months. here or on order, 55,530. In addition, there are also in the Commonwealth 26,000 MartiniGeneral Enfield rifles, which, although single loaders, use the same ammunition as the magazine rifle, and would be effective weapons in time of gency. 2. Provision is made on this year's Estimates for a further supply of magazine rifles, will be seen by the Estimates that it is tention of the Government to provide for local manufacture of small arms. QUARANTINE BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 9th August, vide page 1742): Postponed clause 53(r.l A quarantine officer shall make a careful inspection of all imported animals before they are delivered to the importer. (2.) If the imported animals are accompanied by a certificate of an approved veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment, certifying that he had examined the animals prior to their shipment, and that they then were in good health and free from disease, and the quarantine officer is satisfied that during the voyage they have not suffered from any disease or been exposed to infection, and were free from disease at the time of landing, and that there is no danger of their introducing any disease, he may, subject to the regulations, give to the importer a certificate to that effect, and may allow them to . be delivered to the importer without being required to perform quarantine. (3.) In all other cases, the quarantine officer shall order the animals into quarantine. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) by leave withdrawnThat after the word "" animals,"" line 4, the words ""other than horses or dogs"" be inserted.",22
87,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Corangamite) [3.37] I move That after the word "" officer,"" line 1, the following words be inserted, "" who shall be a qualified veterinary surgeon.""",22
88,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,We have dealt with that matter.,22
89,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"No , this is a different matter altogether from that with which we have already dealt. This relates entirely to imported animals, and the question involved is one of great moment. It is absolutely impossible for any quarantine only officer who is not a qualified veterinary surgeon to.make a careful inspection of the Goimported animals, and give any valuable opinion as to whether they are or are not diseased. The amendment would apply to imported animals, and would require the appointment of a qualified vetermagainary surgeon only at certain fixed ports. I can quite believe that no Minister would Engattempt to administer this Act without the Total services of such an officer. The Attorneymust admit that it is essential that the quarantine officer, whose duty it will be to examine imported animals, should be a emerveterinary surgeon, as otherwise his inspection would be valueless. In view of the and it amendment foreshadowed by the Minister,, the init is still more necessary to secure the the services of a qualified veterinary surgeon for this work. My amendment would not apply to the inspection of animals transferred from one State to another. Anyhonorable member who knows anything about diseases of stock will agree with me that this work of inspection of imported animals can be properly done only by a qualified veterinary surgeon.",22
90,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [3-39]--The principle of the honourable member's .amendment has alreadv been discussed several times. The Committee has been assured that every effort will be made to secure the appointment of qualified men for all these positions, but it was pointed out that there is not in every State machinery provided for the training of qualified veterinary surgeons. - Mr WILSON - They could always be obtained.",22
91,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"They might not. There ' is also to be considered the injustice which the amendment might involve to existing States officers, many of whom are thoroughly competent men. It would probably lead to the exclusion of some officers in the States services at the present time who, as a result of their experience in quarantine work, have become thoroughly competent for the purpose.",23
92,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,In every State a qualified veterinary surgeon is employed for this work.,23
93,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"In every State there are competent officers performing work of this nature, but they are not all legally qualified veterinary surgeons.",23
94,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,They are.,23
95,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,That may be the case in Victoria.,23
96,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"It is also the case in Queensland, New South Wales, and South s t rill 1 ^",23
97,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I am not aware of it. In some of the States there is no means of obtaining a certificate as a legally qualified veterinary surgeon. I would ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. The question has already been fought out. Every time that a Department is taken over by the Commonwealth, we are urged not to do an injustice to States officers. The amendment, however, would probably, have the effect of excluding competent men.",23
98,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Not at all.,23
99,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I think the amendment would have that effect, and I therefore ask the honourable member not to press it . . Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [3.41 - ] - When this question was previously under - consideration, I took up the position that it was properly one of Executive responsibility. Having closely examined sub-clause 2 of clause 53, however, I find that, in the light of that provisort, there is much to be said for the amendment. In the first place, that sub-clause provides that if the imported animals are accompanied by a certificate of "" an approved veterinary surgeon"" at the port of shipment, a certain procedure shall be adopted. Why should we apply to the port of shipment certain essentials which the Minister says we are incapable of applying to the port of landing? The Minister tells us that in some of the ports the services of a legally qualified veterinary surgeon could not be obtained.",23
100,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"What I said was that I was not aware that there was in all the States a means of providing for the registration of a legally qualified veterinary surgeon. ME . KELLY - Then the sooner there is the better. I admit the justice of the Minister's contention that there are States officers who are as competent as are veterinary surgeons to examine stock; but the honourable gentleman's wish to safeguard the rights of those officers can be very easily observed, whilst at the same time we agree to the spirit of this amendment. All that is required is a slight verbal alteration, or the granting of a reserve power to the Minister, if he wished it , to keep in employment States officers possessing "" approved "" qualifications. In reply to the honourable member for Corangamite, the Minister laboured the injustice which he said would be done to States officers if the amendment were inserted. I should be very sorry to think that we should be so sensitive to the rights of States officers as to expose to the risk of infection the now healthy flocks of Australia. This amendment is really a safeguard against the introduction of disease which might prove absolutely destructive to the numerous stock upon which the prosperity of the country depends. If we are to consider existing rights, let us, at any rate, give first attention to the right of the people of Australia to keep their stock as free as pos sible from disease. If the amendment!, r haying that object in view, is sound in principle, a consideration for the rights of this or that officer should' not weigh for a moment with the Committee as against a desire to insure the safety of the stock of the continent. In the light of sub-clause 2 of clause 53, I shall have to review the decision at which I arrived at an earlier stage, when I took the view that the appointment of officers was properly a question of Executive responsibility. In. view of the provisions of that sub-clause, and for other reasons that have been submitted! I think it might be wise to insert the amendment. I therefore earnestly suggest to the Minister the desirabltness of his adopting, at all events, the principle of the - amendment, even if he cannot accept it ??? to to. . Mr Glynn (Angas) [3.46] - When we - were dealing with clause 57, a similar discussion arose, and as this provision is associated with that clause, it would be wise to keep them in line as regards expression. We modified clause 57, by providing that the quarantine officer therein named should be one prescribed by the regulations, and, - as the officer under this clause will have a similar duty devolving upon him, I should like to know whether the honourable member for Corangamite would not be satisfied with a like amendment.",23
101,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I should be satisfied with the amendment providing that qualified veterinary surgeons are prescribed.,24
102,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"We should leave the selection of the officer to the Minister. We amended clause 57 by inserting the words "" as prescribed,"" thus indicating the view of the Committee that it was desirable to have appointed officers possessing qualifications as experts. Under clause 57, as amended, the officer must be of sufficient competency. He might not be a veterinary suigeon, although, perhaps, in most cases he ought to be. I have not such a high opinion of the qualifications of some veterinary surgeons that I should like to put a ban on the employment of other competent persons available.",24
103,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I am quite prepared to accept an amendment similar to that made in clause 57.,24
104,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"There is a great difference between providing that the officer examining stock at the port of shipment shall be a veterinary surgeon and leaving to the Minister the option of determining the capacity of the person appointed for such a purpose at the port of entry. If we provide that the person who.examines shall be a veterinary surgeon, we shall lose all control of the question of competency, whereas, by allowing the Minister some latitude in this respect, we shall not do so.",24
105,Mr STORRER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Bass) |\V49]-- I am rather surprised at the attitude of honourable members opposite who are so ready to raise the cry of "" States rights,"" and to declare their implicit faith in the capacity of the States to manage their own affairs. If the amendment be carried, the inspectors of stock in Tasmania will be shut out; we shall not be able to take them over. Such officers as Mr Tabart, whose certificate will be accepted in«any port of Australia, as well as Mr Curtin, the inspector at Launceston, and others, who are not veterinary surgeons, but know as much about stock as some of those who are, would be excluded. The Minister is anxious to work in harmony with the States, but the amendment would not permit him to do so. Tasmania is quite satisfied to have as inspectors of stock the men to whom I have referred, and I hope that the amendment will be rejected.",24
106,Mr JOHNSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Lang) [3.50] - I do not think that the proposal of the honourable member for Corangamite is necessary. He is naturally anxious, as every one of us must be, that competent men shall be appointed to make the necessary inspections under this Bill . I gather that what is in his mind is that there is a possibility of officers being deputed for work of this kind who may not have the qualifications essential to enable them to express an authoritative opinion upon the soundness or otherwise of animals which they are called upon to examine. But when he proposes that a duly qualified veterinary surgeon shall be appointed for the work, I can appreciate the difficulty with which the Minister may be faced in not being able, at a moment's notice, to secure the services of a' duly qualified veterinary surgeon for the purpose.",24
107,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,It is never a question of appointing a man at a moment's notice.,24
108,Mr JOHNSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,There might be difficulties in the country districts.,24
109,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,What difficulties?,24
110,Mr JOHNSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I would suggest that the honourable member .should withdraw his amendment, with a view to substitute the words "" duly qualified"" after the word "" A . "" The clause would then read- A duly qualified quarantine officer shall make a careful inspection of all imported animals before they are delivered to the importer. I take it that the desire is that an officer appointed for work of this kind should have the qualifications which would enable him to express an authoritative opinion, but, as has been pointed out, there are many men acting as stock inspectors who have not qualified as veterinary surgeons, but who, nevertheless, have all the qualifications necessary f o i discharging their duties. As long as an officer possesses the necessary qualifications, he need not necessarily be a veterinary surgeon"".",24
111,Mr ARCHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Capricornia) [3-5 ]-The point that is novy under review was threshed out last week,' whilst the honourable member for Corangamite was absent. I proposed that the officer should be a duly qualified veterinary surgeon, and a compromise was arrived at to the effect that the officer should be "" duly prescribed.""",25
112,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I am prepared to accept the words "" as prescribed. """,25
113,Mr ARCHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That means that there would be a regulation prescribing the qualifications of the officers. As representing a good many stock-owners, I naturally feel responsible for safeguarding their interests. I consider, however, that if the officer had to be duly prescribed for the particular work by regulation, it would be as great a safeguard as is really required for efficiency's sake. I suggest to the honourable member that he should amend his amendment to make it read that the officer must be specially prescribed for the particular work of inspecting stock.",25
114,Mr WILS ON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Corangamite) [3.55']- It is an unfortunate fact that throughout Australia we are at present behind the times with regard to veterinary work. Let me quote my own experience. After I had had eight years of close study in London hospitals, devoting myself during that time to pathology, I came out to Australia and went in for farming. I considered that my knowledge of pathology might be of some advantage to me in working amongst animals. But I felt that it was necessary to get further instruction in veterinary work. I therefore came to Melbourne, and went through a course of instruction at the Veterinary College, under Mr. Kendall. I devoted myself to a special class of study designedfor farmers, and passed through that course. Since then I have had hundreds of horses and cattle, thousands of sheep, and a great number of pigs through my hands. But notwithstanding all the experience I have had in one way and another, publicly and privately, I always call in a qualified veterinary surgeon when any difficulty arises in connection with my own stock. As that is what I do in private life, surely I am only faithfu l to my trust to the people when, in dealing with a matter of great public importance, I insist that the Government shall avail itself of the assistance of properly qualified veterinary surgeons for work of the kind contemplated under this Bill . Australia has been, is, and will be, so long as the temper of honourable members and of mem2 bers of the States Parliaments throughout Australia remains as it is with regard toveterinary science, behind the times. But the question is of very great moment to the country. The honourable member for Bass has lectured the Committee, as he usually does, for differing from him, and from the Minister.",25
115,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,He merely expressed his opinions..,25
116,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Ye s ; with the' addition of a little lecture, which we all enjoyed. But if Tasmania has been behind the times in the matter of veterinary science, she w i ll continue to be so unless she recognises that to become an efficient veterinary surgeon a man must be qualified not only by practica? experience, but also by a course of study. Without both study and experience a man cannot undertake veterinary work to the satisfaction of the public, and the advantage of the country. It is unfortunately the case that in some States, Victoria being one of them, some inspectors of stock have been appointed who know nothing whatever about stock diseases.",25
117,Mr STORRER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,There would have been no Victoria except for Tasmania sending over sheep and cattle in the early days.,25
118,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"We all admit that. Tasmania also sent over fathers and mothers for. our people. We are grateful to Tasmania for many things, though we are not always grateful to the honourable member for his lectures. The point at issue is that my amendment simply asks the Government to say that at all times, when imported animals have to be inspected, the work should be done by men who know something about the diseases of stock, and about' the business of examination, and who do not proceed merely by rule of thumb. Take the case of a man who is qualified as a veterinary surgeon, and who is a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons of London. Such a man is a scientist. A man who has gone through the course of instruction that is prescribed at the present day, and who is finally turned out as a M.R.C.V.S., commands respect on account of his science in any part of the world. I am well aware that we cannot' get a sufficient number of members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to carry out the work under this Bill. But, nevertheless, there are sufficient men in Australia, some of them excellent veterinary surgeons, who have had practical experience, and who have gone through a course at the Melbourne Veterinary College or elsewhere. They command respect as professional men of high standing. What is required in Australia is that when such men have qualified themselves they shall have a chance of employment in this class of work - No man, no matter what his experience with stock may have been, is qualified to discharge functions under this ""Bill unless he has studied the diseases of stock pretty deeply. It has to be recollected that the quarantine officers who will have to examine stock will require a knowledge, not only of the ordinary diseases of animals which occur from dav to clay on a farm, but also of the diseases of imported stock, some of them of an obscure character. Unless a man has studied veterinary science he is not qualified, and any certificate that he may give is not worth the paper upon which it .is written. A veterinary surgeon need not be always employed, but may be paid a retaining fee, so that he may be called in at any time to make an inspection.",25
119,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,We must have a quarantine officer.,26
120,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That is so; all that I am suggesting is that a qualified man should be paid a. retaining fee to examine imported animals. There would then be security throughout Australia that all imported animals had been examined, and that, so far as up-to-date veterinary science was concerned, those animals pronounced free from disease. would be a standing disgrace if we permitted the present position in regard to veterinary science in Australia to continue. This is the national Parliament, and we ought to do something to encourage the States Parliaments to take some steps in the direction I have indicated. It would never do to permit, on sentimental considerations, unqualified men to continue to examine stock; we ought to be brave enough to say that qualified men must be employed upon such work. In the case of human beings, we regard all unqualified men as "" quacks "" ; and, in my opinion, unqualified inspectors, in the case of stock, are ""quacks,"" and, therefore, a danger. For example, the other day, in a case quoted in the newspapers, an inspector declared an animal to-be suffering from the bot fly, whereas, on examination, the animal's liver was found to be disintegrated, and it was shown to be suffering from pleurisy. There was a beautiful diagnosis !",26
121,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I have known veterinary surgeons make quite as ibig a mistake.,26
122,Mr WEBSTER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"And medical practitioners, too.",26
123,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"It is quite possible that mistakes are made by both veterinarysurgeons and medical practitioners; but the chances are always that, in 90 per cent, of the cases the medical man is right, whereas, in an equal percentage of cases, the "" quack "" is wrong.",26
124,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"But the honourable member would not surely say that competent State officers are "" quacks,"" because they are not veterinary surgeons?",26
125,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I would put all inspectors who are not qualified in the category of ""quacks,"" if they undertake to examine an animal and give a certificate as to its freedom from disease. Why, we have known of State school teachers being appointed stock inspectors. What sort of live stock could' they have examined previously ? Then we have known of butchers being given similar positions. What knowledge can a butcher have of the diseases of stock? He may occasionally have come across a cow or other animal with tuberculosis, and may have acouired a knowledge of the appearance of diseased lungs after death; but the Bill deals with diseases before death. We want to safeguard a great and important industry, which can be safeguarded only in the way I have suggested. I have no other desire were than to serve the best interests of the It people. Many of the diseases introduced in animals are communicable to man-; and - many of those diseases have never been seen by our stock inspectors, because, fortunately, the diseases have not been introduced, or, in any case, only in very rare instances. Any carelessness on our part might result in the introduction of a disease communicable to man, and its ravages might be widespread. And the blame for any such outbreak would f all on us who are responsible; for that and the other reasons I have mentioned. I submit the amendment.",26
126,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Barker) [4.5] If the amendment be carried, we shall lose the services of all our Chief Inspectors of Stock.",26
127,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Not at all.,26
128,Mr LIVINGSTO N,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,We have had the services of these gentlemen for many years; and Australia is today freer from disease than is any country in the world. Veterinary surgeons are not always right in their diagnosis ; and I should be very sorry to see all the power taken out of the hands of our Chief Inspectors.,26
129,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The amendment would not do that.,27
130,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,But a beast could not be landed without the certificate of a veterinary surgeon.,27
131,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That is right. . Mr LIVINGSTON - If the honourable member will so amend his amendment as to provide that the certificate shall be given by the Chief Inspector and a veterinary surgeon, I shall support it, but I do not like taking away the power from our Chief Inspectors. I do not know that there is a legally qualified veterinary surgeon in any of the States.",27
132,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,In every State there are veterinary surgeons.,27
133,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I am not quite sure that those veterinary surgeons have diplomas; and if they have not, they would not be able to pass stock. I hope the honourable member will not press his amendment unduly.",27
134,Mr LIDDELL,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Hunter) [4.7] - In order that honourable members might satisfactorily discuss this Bill, the Attorney General was good enough to place in our hands certain papers, which I understand he has collected for our inspection. One of these papers is a communication from Mr S. W. Moore, Minister of Mines and Agriculture, New South Wales, and in it there is the followingFurther, there is no provision in the B i ll as to the status of the quarantine officer to carry out the inspection of imported animals. Ob-' viouslv this officer must necessarily be a qualified veterinary surgeon, but, evidently, so far as the provisions of the Bill go, a Customs House officer could legally carry out the inspection if authorized. The absence of any reference to the veterinary staff which will necessarily be employed for the satisfactory administration of the provisions of the Bill , detracts value, as the manner in which the provisions of the Bill are given effect to becomes optional, and is, therefore, an unsatisfactory substitute for the excellent system which has been so successfully adopted in this State for some considerable period. I point out to the Attorney-General, who has had a legal education, much in the same way as the honourable member for Corangamite had had. a medical education, that all legislation of this kind should be guided by scientific principles. One of the first questions which a. medical man is asked when he enters the witness-box is, "" Are you a qualified medical practitioner ? "" If the answer is in the affirmative, the evidence ' of such a witness carries considerable weight. And we would apply the same principle to the administration of this law. Enormous responsibilities will be placed in our hands if this Bill is passed. We propose to take from the States certain of their responsibilities, and necessarily it behoves us to discharge them satisfactorily. If an imported beast were condemned and killed, and action brought against the Commonwealth for damages, and if the Minister had to tell the Court, "" This man, who is an excellent officer, has been looking after cattle, sheep, and pigs,"" he would be asked, ""Is he a legally qualified man?"" He would have to reply, "" No ; he is not."" The Court would say, "" Oh ! then oh his evidence you destroyed the beast?"" In such circumstances, any jury would, without hesitation, give a verdict for the plaintiff. On that ground, I suggest to the Minister that he should adopt the amendment of the honourable member for Corangamite.",27
135,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Wentworth) [4. n ] - I should like to supplement what I have already said on this subject on one point. The Minister appears to consider that we are now rediscussing a matter which was settled in Committee some days ago. He evidently thinks the same principle is at stake, but he will find it is not so if he looks at this and the adjoining clauses. The last time the question was touched upon, the honourable member for Corangamite sought to provide that every quarantine officer who might be called upon to perform any of the duties under this Bill must be a duly qualified. veterinary surgeon, but he was beaten. A majority of honourable members thought it would be tying the hands of the Executive too much to take such a step. The Minister will find that the present proposal applies only to this clause. It declares that before animals from its are handed over to the importer, and left free to mingle with the herds of Australia, they shall be declared clean from disease. Surely that is a very fair safeguard. Had it related to the previous clause, which makes it necessary that a quarantine officer should order stock into quarantine, I should have regarded it as unnecessary. The question before us is not that of ordering stock into quarantine as in clause 52, or of examining and ordering into quarantine as in clause 55, but is a question of allowing stock out of quarantine, and the least we can do, having due regard to our responsibilities, is to impose some such safeguard as has been recommended by the honourable member for Corangamite. The medical fraternity seem to be agreed on this point, and the report read by the honourable member ber for Hunter appeared thoroughly to substantiate our position. I therefore urge the Minister to insert this provision one clause. It will not tie his hands with, regard to any other clause of the Bill . If Bill? he wishes to safeguard the rights of existing and qualified State officers by exemptthere ing them from the amendment of the honat orable member for Corangamite, I am that honourable member will be only too ready to meet him half way, if , by so doing, he is not sacrificing the public terests. I know the Minister is skilled drafting amendments, for I have often seen him suggesting them from almost the same fications ? place as that now occupied by the honourable member for Corangamite.",27
136,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The Minister might suggest a bridge now.,28
137,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"If the honourable member of it. will accept it, I will propose one.",28
138,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I think the Minister be able to suggest a compromise, which could readily be effected.",28
139,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Darling Downs-Attor- . ney-General) [4.14] - The honourable memthe oer for Angas made a suggestion on a previous clause which I think will aptly fit this one, and which I think, apthe pealed to the honourable member for Capthey ricornia at the time as meeting his dereturn sires. It was to insert the words, "" prethem. scribed for the purpose."" That means for the purpose of importing stock it will be necessary to prescribe certain specified officers to do the work.

I know it has left a feeling of gratitude in their hearts towards Melbourne institutions, and Melbourne people generally, and that have tried their best to make some for what Melbourne has done for It would be unjust to insert the that words which the honourable member for Corangamite suggests. I am quite prepared to accept the previous suggestion of' the member for AngaS, - to insert words "" prescribed for the purpose."" That is a bridge which will carry into Australia very few stock other than, those we want here. The honourable"" member for Corangamite might accept those words. This is undoubtedly a serious matter when one comes to deal with a country like Queensland, with its enormous coastal area, extending as it does from Normanton, embracing all the ports down the eastern The coast. It might be desired to land stock at any of these places, and it would be a terrible thing if , simply because there was not a qualified veterinary surgeon at Normanton, we had either to delay the ship Instead and detain the animals until a veterinary the surgeon reached that port, or else send Bass the ship right down to Brisbane in order the that the stock might be pjassed there.

149,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Then does not the honourable member see that if he requires us, in States like Western Australia and Queensland, with their wide coastal areas, to have at each port where it is desired to land stock a veterinary surgeon who is a quarantine officer, we may be doing a very serious injustice? If there are State officers who are admittedly competent, why should not their services be retained for the purpose? I do not know how manyveterinary surgeons there are in the Queensland Public Service at the present time.

155,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The men appointed to these positions will be competent for the duties required of them. There may be a test of competency.,29
156,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Then why not include it in the Bill?,29
157,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"We are going to prescribe it. The honourable member for Corangamite regards, as the only evidence of competency, the possession of a veterinary surgeon's diploma; but if that were insisted on, men like Mr Tabart, and others who are admittedly competent, would be excluded. The appointments to positions of this kind must in future be made more and more from men who have had a scientific training; but we ought not to do an injustice to State officers, or make the measure practically' unworkable'by providing only one or two ports for the landing of stock, which would be the effect of requiring the appointment of veterinary surgeons at all such ports. To require the appointment of veterinary surgeons at such ports as Townsville and Rockhampton, behind which there is country carrying a large number of stock, might unduly hamper the working of - the measure.",29
158,Mr SPENCE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Darling) [4.25] - It has not been complained during the debate that diseases of stock have been admitted into Australia under the present system, which is evidence that the work of the existing quarantine officers has been satisfactory. The honourable member for Corangamite spoke of the existence of diseases unknown in Australia. Probably even veterinary surgeons are acquainted with such diseases only from their reading of the text-books. We have a number of stock inspectors who would not find it difficult to pass as veterinary surgeons.",29
159,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Then why do they not Chief do so?,29
160,Mr SPENCE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"There has not been the inducement. I know one inspector who is a very capable man in regard to diseases of horses, cattle, and sheep, and an excellent bacteriologist. He has mads such a close study of the diseases of animals that he is equal to any veterinary surgeon, and in advance of such as have only just passed through the veterinary colleges.",29
161,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Does the honourable member regard the non-unionist as equal io the unionist?,29
162,Mr SPENCE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Othe r considerations, such as those to which the Minister has referred, arise in this instance. I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that we should have the best officers obtainable; but we can get efficient officers without insisting on the appointment of veterinary surgeons. If we require that only veterinary surgeons shall be appointed for this work, we shall be making positions for persons who have only just passed their examinations, and who, although theoretically qualified, have little practical experience. I prefer the man of much experience to the man who has only just passed his examinations. When we imagine that we are ill , we go, not to the young doctor, however brilliant his university career may have been, but to the practitioner of experience. We could not obtain the service's of veterinary surgeons of long-standing at out-of-the way places, and therefore if we insisted on the appointment of veterinary surgeons to such ports, we should Gave to take men who had only just qualified. There is this safeguard against the introduction of disease, that, if Parliament were sitting - when diseased animals were admitted, the Government would very soon be asked for an explanation. What we need are men who have a practical acquaintance the diseases of horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, fowls, geese, and all kinds of animals and birds likely to be imported; and we shall do better by appointing men of long experience than youths who have only just obtained their diplomas.",29
163,Mr ARCHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Capricornia) [4.28] The Minister told the Committee that 1 was satisfied with an amendment already passed, though, as a matter of fact, in that case I took rather what I thought I could get than what I thought was needed. I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that it is highly desirable that we should, where possible, employ veterinary surgeons. There much in the contention that, if veterinary surgeons were* employed, the present State officers would lose their positions; because the only occasions upon which veterinary surgeons will be absolutely necessary will be when certain beasts have to be examined. I recognise that we could not have a veterinary surgeon always on the spot at every port of landing; such men would not be always available at places like Normanton and other ports of large stock districts. If the honourable member would amend his amendment so as to provide for a quarantine officer "" as prescribed, to be a qualified veterinary surgeon where available,"" that should meet the case.",30
164,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"If such an amendment were agreed to, existing State officials would have to be set aside where veterinary surgeons were obtainable.",30
165,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The appointment veterinary surgeons should certainly be insisted on in connection with a port like Sydney. It would not be creditable to us to provide for the appointment of any other men.,30

168,Mr ARCHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I am not quite sure, but I think that there is a veterinary surgeon at that port. If my suggestion be adopted, it will mean that if such a man be available he will be detailed to examine and pass a beast. It will not involve the dismissal of one man and the appointment of a man who is a veterinary surgeon. If the Minister will amend with his amendment in that direction I shall support him very heartily. My suggestion removes the .only difficulty which he has put forward, and that is that we should be displacing well-tried State servants. Our quarantine officers and stock inspectors will not be interfered with in any way.",30
169,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Wentworth) [4.31] - I think that the honourable member for Capricornia, although he is a novice,' deserves the thanks of the Committee for providing a far stronger and safer bridge than the Minister has done. I - should be very loath to indict the latter's engineering capacity, but I cannot see that his bridge provides a safe passage for quarantined animals into is not Australia. To provide, as the Minister desires, that the animals have to be passed by a quarantine officer as "" prescribed "" merely inserts the intention of ' the Committee in the Bill , and that ' is that the Government shall have power to prescribe who is to do all these things. It does not give any .indication to the - Executive in the future that we intend that only the most highly-qualified officers shall do the work. For the Minister to provide that the officers are to be "" as prescribed"" is to give the Executive an even greater discretion in choosing their officers, whether qualified or not, than it would have without his amendment. I think that his bridge is a very unsafe one. It is one over which I should not like to send a dog, let alone all the stock we hope to see passing across it. The suggestion of the honourable member for Capricornia meets every objection which has been urged. of Therefore I earnestly impress upon the Minister the advisableness of safeguarding the stock, the stock-owners, and the material interests of this country in the way now suggested.",30
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Parramatta) Go- [4-33]--The suggestion of the honourable member for 'Capricornia seems to me to be a reasonable one, and it meets with my approval. While I think that there should be some elasticity in the Bill with regard to Inter-State quarantine and the passing of stock across the borders, still I should relax no precautions so far as the ports are concerned, because, in my view, the safeguards there ought to be of the strictest possible character. Only the other day I read that in New Caledonia there are diseases, particularly a disease which is rapidly decimating dt>gs, which has not - yet obtained a foothold in Australia. With these unknown and uninvestigated diseases in contiguity to Australia, it becomes a matter of the highest moment that the duly qualified officers under this Bill shall be officers who are certified as possessing the requisite knowledge and skill to perform the duties which it assigns to them. I hope that the Minister will consent to waive his amendment in favour of the course which has been suggested by the honourable member for Capricornia, and which provides the requisite variation in practice by the insertion of the words ""where available."" Of course, if there-is none of this skill available, then the next best skill must be obtained. Everything is provided for. But, so far as the main ports of Australia are concerned, I think that, in spite of the Bill, it ought to 'be a very solemn obligation on the Government to see that no one but a duly qualified veterinary surgeon shall take the oversight of the importation of stock. We cannot be too careful in our efforts to keep out diseases. There are some diseases which have not been introduced yet. When diseases are introduced, it seems to me that they thrive.here in a way in which, perhaps, they do not thrive in any other country. One reason why we ought to have prohibition of diseases as far as possible is to be found in the ravages which they make, and in the facility with which they seem to spread and multiply once they get through the quarantine which we impose. With regard to the necessity of having the requisite skill for investigating these matters at the port of entry, we ought to 'remember that very often diseases are latent for a great length of time. I quoted here the other day the case of a dog which developed hydrophobia seven months after the time when it was proved that he took the disease into his system. That is a disease that we want to keep out of Australia if possible. That case, I think, occurred in the Island of Corfu, off the coast of Greece. One cannot imagine what would be the result to our stock if a disease like that broke out amongst our dogs.",30
171,Mr SALMON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,But a veterinary surgeon would not have discovered that the dog was diseased at the moment of entrv.,31
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I do not know who discovered the disease in the dog, but it does not take much to discover it after it has broken out. When once disease breaks out in that way, it does not require any "" discovering,"" but we do need; the requisite skill to detect, these diseases ire their latent forms, and to prevent the possibility of their gaining a foothold in Australia. Therefore, we should leave something to the discretion of the Minister in regard to Inter-State quarantine, whilst 'rigidly insisting upon the maintenance of a proper standard of skill and ability, so far as the main ports of Australia are concerned.",31
173,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Corangamite) [4.40] - I wish to endorse all that has been said by the honourable member for Capricornia. I think that quarantine officers should be qualified veterinary surgeons where the latter are available. Such a provision would meet the objections which have been raised in regard to our northern ports. I regret that the Minister will only agree to the insertion of the words "" as prescribed,"" because those words have already been in.serted in clause 57. m",31
174,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Thei r insertion here is necessary for the sake of consistency.,31
175,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The Attorney-General's desire for consistency is not a sufficient reason for the rejection of the amendment.. The honourable gentleman agrees that it is necessary to have our veterinary science brought up to date. The work of examining imported animals for blood diseases is of a special character. It is very important work, and it is only certain officers who can perform it with any degree of satisfaction to the pubfic. I ask leave toamend my amendment by adding to it the words "" where available."" Amendment amended accordingly.",31

178,Mr WILSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,That is a ridiculous supposition.,31
179,Mr STORRER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I have been accused on a former occasion of delivering a lecture here, and, therefore, I do not propose to reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite, who has cast a slur upon Tasmania. That State may be slow; but it has, at least, succeeded in excluding from its shores all infectious diseases i i i stock without the employment of veterinary surgeons. To my mind, it is a pity that honourable members cannot address selves to this subject without being personal. We should be very careful before rests with us. we insert the words "" where available "" in this clause. It is quite easy to conceive stances in which only one man's services might be available, and he might, therewords fore, be in a position to levy whatever charge he thought fit.

In answer to the honourable member, it was pointed out that the reason why the clause was drafted in its 19 present form was that there were one or 24 two countries free of diseases of stock with which a trade in stock could be carried on without the necessity for putting every, AYES. animal coming from those countries into quarantine. The honourable member was reminded, at the same time, that the clause provides that all animals imported shall be very closely inspected. However, in order to. meet the honourable member's objection, and carry out more effectively the intention of the Government, it is proposed that the ' principle adopted should be N.OES. that animals coming from all countries should come under these provisions. An exception is made only in certain specific cases. If we are satisfied that a country is free from disease, it may be so declared. Where that is done, the onus will be on the Administration in every instance of making inquiries, and finding out whether the country declared to be free from disease is really free from it. As a case in point, if it were found that New Zealand was free of particular diseases affecting partiPAIRS."" cular animals, the provisions of sub-clause 2 of this clause would apply.",33
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Why are camels, horses, and dogs the only animals excepted ? (Mr GROOM - I think the honourable member will find that exception in the New South Wales Act. I believe it was pointed out by the New South Wales authorities that the animals mentioned are peculiarly susceptible to diseases, and it is found advisable, even though they should be imported from countries declared to be free from disease, that they should not be allowed to enter the Commonwealth without undergoing a period of quarantine.",33
201,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I believe that in some of the States the period of quarantine provided for is very long.,33

205,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Darling Downs-Attor of ney-General) [5.1] - The honourable member for Angas made a further suggestion - whic h I promised at the time to adoptthat an officer admitting animals into Australia should be required to make a report to a responsible officer in the State in which he took action. We have, at present, no such complete organization of the Department as would enable us to specify who shall be the "" responsible officer""; but I have overcome the difficulty by framing - an amendment requiring that a report shall be made to the "" Minister,"" who, under a previous clause,"" has power to delegate any functions under the Bill to different officers. It will thus be competent for the Minister to appoint the officer in each State t'o whom such a report shall be made.'",33
206,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The Minister is named in some similar measures.,34
207,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That is so; but the Minister administering a measure applying, as this does, to the whole of Australia, will often be so far from the port of landing that we have of necessity to give power to him to delegate certain functions to officers in outlying places. I move That after the word ""officer,"" words "" has reported to the Minister that,, he be inserted. Amendment agreed to.",34
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Parramatta) [5.3] - This clause gives rise to the whole question of whether or not quarantine should be imposed in respect of all stock entering Australia, and whether or not it should be conditioned. The provision as it stands will, if passed, mean a very radical departure from the practice hitherto adopted in New South Wales. Camels, horses, dogs-in short, stock of every kind-o n entering New South Wales, must undergo six months quarantine irrespective of whether or not they are free from disease. There is a long standing grievance among the people there regarding the way in which quarantine is evaded by resorting to practices obtaining in some of the other States. When we were last discussing this matter, I pointed out the difference between the treatment of dogs entering New South Wales, and that of dogs entering this State. Here, there used to be private quarantine, and I am assured that dogs intended to be imported into New South Wales were often put ashore at Melbourne, where they went into private quarantine, and were subsequently taken quietly across the border. If the clause be passed, it will mean, to say the least, a very radical departure from the quarantine system in force in New South Wales. There we do hot accept, any one's certificate as to the health of an imported animal. It is put into quarantine the moment it arrives, and has to remain there for six months, so that any latent disease may have time to develop. I do not discuss for the moment the question of whether such a system is, in its entirety, a wise one. Perhaps it is a little severe, but, at any rate, it is safe, and our first obligation, with regard to the quarantining of animals is to insure security from disease. Shall we have sufficient security under the Bill as proposed by the Minister? We are told that it will be within the discretion of the Minister to permit imported stock to forego quarantine.",34
209,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,That course would be followed only in the case of - animals that had complied with the provisions of sub-clause 2.,34
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I was about to say that it would be conditioned. In the fiist place there is to be a certificate of an approved veterinary surgeon at the port of line 9, the shipment certifying that"" he had examined the animals prior to their shipment, and' that they then were in good health and free from disease. How can a veterinary surgeon, at the port of embarkation, certify that when they land they will not have in their system the latent germs of some epidemical disease ?",34
211,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,There is also the condition that animals so treated must have been imported from a country declared to be free from disease.,34
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That is' a very material and necessary condition. I confess candidly that I should prefer some automatic quarantine of all stock entering Australia. Let it be a short period, if honourable members desire it.",34
213,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That is the practice in South Australia, where the period of quarantine is prescribed, and in some cases is very short. Mr GROOM. - We can do the same under this measure, and it probably will be done.",34
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I hope it will be. It is of the very gravest importance that we should prevent the introduction of new, and, indeed, old diseases, so far as lies within our power. An animal examined by the most expert and skilful man obtainable at theport of embarkation, and declared by him to be free from disease, might still develop some latent disease on the voyage, or after landing on our shores. That is what we desire to avoid, and the only safe course to adopt is to require that all stock, irrespective of where it comes - from, or of the certificates of those who have examined it at the port of shipment, shall go into quarantine. After sufficient time has elapsed to prove beyond possibility of cavil that there is no danger of any latent disease breaking out, then, and only then, should they be admitted into the interior of Australia. Had such precautions been taken years ago, Australia would have avoided losses amounting to millions of money in respect of stock that have fallen victim to various fel l diseases. I am, therefore, glad to learn from the Minister that the Government do not contemplate opening wide the door generally in respect to importations of stock, but that on the contrary, they propose that all animals shall be ordered into quarantine for at least a sufficient period.",34
215,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.9] - I can assure the honourable member for Parramatta that our object in inserting this clause was not in any way to remove all necessary restrictions in regard to the importation of stock. Our intention is that it shall be used only in very exceptional cases. In the first place, it must.be certified that animals dealt with under it have come from a country declared to be free from disease. That, in itself, 'will necessitate an investigation. there must be a certificate by a veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment that the animals are in good health, and free from disease, whilst on arrival here they are to be subjected to a further examination by an officer, who must report to the Minister. I can assure the honourable member that if I am in anv way responsible for the administration of this measure all stock otherwise - will go into quarantine for periods which will be prescribed.",35
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Parramatta) [.f.io] - The more I examine this clause the more I am satisfied that it is contemplated under it to allow some imported stock to be admitted without going into - quarantine. That is clearly the intention of sub-clause 3. It is clear that under that provision the relaxation of the stringent provisions in force in New South Wales is contemplated. I very much regret that it is so. 1 do not see the use of the clause at all. The Bill would be very - much stronger in every way without it . If the matter were left to the responsibility of the Minister without any such directions as these-becaus e they are directions only in the way of leniency, not of greater strength-it would be preferable. 1 should like to see the clause eliminated from the Bill . We cannot be too strict with regard to the introduction of imported stock.",35
217,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Angas) [5.11] - In support of what has been mentioned by the deputy leader of the Opposition, I may say that a fear has been expressed by competent quarantine oiticers in South Australia in regard to this clause. It is an exceptional provision, and these officers are very much afraid that animal diseases will be allowed to creep in under it.",35
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Is there any necessity for it?,35
219,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I do not know why the clause was inserted at all. I do not think that it is really necessary, because without it the period of quarantine in regard to any particular animal could be prescribed. Where there is very little danger, of course the regulations could prescribe the shortest period possible. But if there were such a likelihood the quarantine could by regulation be extended. The Bill will work automatically in the ratio of the increasing fear. But unless the Minister is very cautious, and provides for regulations to neutralize the clause in respect Then of some animals, it may very well be that diseases will be imported which will be disastrous to our flocks and. herds. In Western Australia camels have been allowed to land which are spreading one of the direst diseases to stock. I dare say that the Minister over there would have said beforehand' that there was not the slightest danger. But it has occurred, and it behoves us to be very careful that fresh diseases are not introduced.",35
220,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Franklin) [5.12]. - I think it is very necessary that stock .from abroad should be put into quarantine until in the opinion of officers of the Quarantine Department it may safely be withdrawn. A little while ago, in Tasmania, some animals freshlv imported from England developed warbles, which is a well-known disease of cattle, after they had been in auarantine for some time. That stock was apparently clean and healthy when it landed. Had the animals been liberated the disease would have been spread throughout the State. Animals from outside Australia should certainly go into quarantine until after a very rigid examination. If this precaution be not taken, all sorts of pests will be introduced, which will simply decimate our flocks and herds. I agree that the clause is not required at all. Every provision has been made for the free interchange of stock between States, and we do want if we can to stop the importation of diseases such as that which the honourable and learned member for Angas has indicated as having been introduced by camels into Western Australia. I fear that if the clause remains in the Bill it will be a distinct source of weakness, and may have a serious effect.",35
221,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Fawkner) [5.14]-It is most important to keep out stock diseases of every sort. Considering our vast interests in stock, the. utmost precautions should be used. The Minister should be very careful indeed, even when the country from which stock is imported is supposed to be clean, to quarantine imported animals until all possibility of danger is removed. The honourable and learned member for Angas has mentioned the mischief occasioned by the introduction of disease in Western Australia through the medium of camels. I urge the Minister to take the most ample precautions to insure that our large Commonwealth interests in this respect are safeguarded to the utmost extent. Clause, as amended, agreed to.",36
222,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.16] - I move That the following new clause be inserted"" 13A. Where the Governor General is satisfied that any laws or regulations of a State, or of an authority constituted under a State, with respect to the introduction of animals or plants into the StateJo) are in part or in whole unnecessary for the purpose of preventing the intro1 duction of disease into the State, and (i) have the effect of interfering with freedom of trade or commerce among the States, the Governor General may, by proclamation, direct that those laws or regulations shall cease to apply, or shall apply subject to such restrictions, limitations, or modifications as he directs. This clause affects"" the introduction of animals or plants from one State to another. Where plants or animals are being introduced into a State, and the regulations of that State, which are in whole or in part unnecessary for the purpose of preventing the introduction of disease, have the effect of interfering with the freedom of trade and commerce amongst the States, the Governor General is given power by proclamation to direct that those regulations shall cease to apply; or, if they do apply, he may direct that they shall apply with such restrictions, limitations, or modifications as he may direct. The object is to prevent the unreasonable use of such powers by a State. They may be used not merely to prevent the spread of diseases, but practically to stop trade. The honourable member for Brisbane submitted an amendment, which honourable members opposite preferred at the time, in which he endeavoured to provide that certain powers should not be exercised unless the Governor General certified that the execution of such powers by a State operated in a manner prejudicial to the interests of any other State of the Commonwealth. What we have done, in this case, is to confine ourselves .to matters with which we have power to deal. The power now sought has already been exercised in the case of the Post and Telegraph and the Defence Acts.",36
223,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,There was a great debate on that point;' and there was a strong opinion against allowing the States laws to be neutralized at the discretion of the Minister.,36
224,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I am afraid that the Government are only creating a row.,36
225,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Not at all ; what we are doing is with the object of preventing a row. For instance, if one State were exercising powers, as against the other five States, so as to exclude the goods of those five States, the Commonwealth would have power to make regulations. This is really only an exercise of that power. The Defence Act and the Post and Telegraph Act contain sections setting forth when the States Acts shall cease to apply; and the power sought is a necessary power, which, however, will not be exercised unless the necessity arises.",36
226,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,It may be a dangerous power.,36
227,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I do not think it a dangerous power. It will be a power exercised only in such cases in which the Governor General is satisfied that there is an undue interference with trade and commerce between the States. If we have the power to make our own regulations as to the importation of animals from State to State', there is the power to make our law override State legislation; this is practically giving a supremacy of our regulations over State regulations. We have the power to make regulations,- and our regulations prevail. The desire is not to take away from States any power which we can leave with .the States; but this reserve power is desirable, so that it may be exercised if necessary.",36
228,Mr BAMFORD,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Ha d the Minister fruit business in his mind when he drew this clause?,37
229,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,There has been trouble about the fruit business.,37
230,Mr WILKS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The fruit business?,37
231,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,We had in our mind such a case as a State seeking to exclude the produce of other States in such a way as to interfere with the freedom of commerce.,37
232,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,We have power - without this clause.,37
233,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"We have power to make regulations, and I take it that this is an exercise of the same oower.",37
234,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Angas) [5.28] - In my opinion, the clause will lead to a great deal of dissatisfaction. No doubt the Minister - will have power, from time to time, to suspend the operation of a State law if he so pleases; and he may do that in the case of one State, and not of the five other States. If trouble arose, after a time, on pressure being brought to bear, the Minister might settle the question by stating that the particular law of' the State had-obstructed the passage of animals from one State to another. This is not saying that the Federal law should be substituted for a State law. That question has already been dealt with; and we twve settled how our regulation shall be substituted for those of the States. While not forgetting States laws, we are taking power from time to time, as occasion requires, to suspend the operation of the laws of a particular State in relation, not only to animals-the . dealing with which has been left to the Federation-bu t in relation to plants, the dealing with which has not been left to the Federation. In clause 13, we have recognised a desire that, for the present, we should not altogether supersede the laws of the States in respect to plants; and we declare that our regulations shall not be called into operation except in the case of a State not exercising the power which it possesses. But we are now interfering with a State by 'declaring that, not only in regard to animals, but also in regard to plants, the law of that State shall-not operate any longer. In the first place, is this expedient ? I do not think so, because it means the suspension of the law of a particular State for a particular purpose. That may place the Commonwealth in rather an invidious position. For those who do not wish to go the full length of throwing out the whole clause, it might be as well to start with the an amendment to strike out the words "" or plants,"" so as to make the clause consistent with the Bill. The object of that would be to prevent this interference taking place with the fruit regulations of the States. I received a letter last Friday on this point from South Australia, expressing the opinions of the Fruit-growers' Association, which is a very representative body there. They particularly asked that for the present, at all events, the State laws should be left absolutely unfettered as regards plants. This is a very wide power of interference.",37
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Coul d we not bind ourselves in connection with this clause, as we did.with a previous one?",37
236,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That might-be done, but it is not so easy to condition the exercise of a discretion by the Governor General.",37
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,We did it before.,37
238,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"What we did before was to put a limitation upon the operation of the law. We said it was not to come into force until the Governor General dida certain thing. What the honourable member suggests in this case is to impose a condition on the exercise of the power given by the clause to the Governor General. In the other case, power was given to. the Governor General to condition the operation of the Federal law. . It really was to the effect that the Federal law was not to supersede the State law, except in a certain event, to be declared by proclamation. This clause says that when a proclamation is issued, the State law is to go. The honourable member for. Parramatta asks whether we'cannot insert the qualification that the power of the Governor General to issue the proclamation should itself be conditional. That could be done, but it would be somewhat anomalous. I would prefer to test the feeling of the Committee towards the clause by an amendment to strike out the words "" or plants,"" so as to limit it to that extent at any rate. Very likely, however, if that were done, the dlause would not be supported by those who wish it to be passed, because it seems to be directed chiefly against the plant laws of the States.",37
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Jus t as the other was last week. The other 'was directed against plants in the way of greater re-, pression. This is directed to plants in the way of relief, if need be.",38
240,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I do not think so. I think the other was put into allow whatever laws existed to remain as they were.,38
241,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The other clause was an indication that we do not intend to interfere with the internal administration of any State.,38
242,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The other clause was chiefly directed against the ineffectiveness of the State laws to protect against diseases. This clause is not directed against that at all. Its object is to enable the Governor General to say that the State, laws are not required for the purpose of preventing disease, that they are causing friction between State and State, or that they are unnecessary. In clause 13 we put the words in for greater caution, the State laws were inefficacious, for quarantine purposes, to prevent disease, we could then bring in the necessary provision to render the law effective. This, however, is for quite a different purpose; that if a State law, although considered by the State to be required for local purposes, is working so as to promote dissent on the part of another State, the Minister may step in and suspend its operation, thus settling a dispute between two States by suspending the operation of the law of one. If that is done it will lead to a good deal of friction. I do not know that we have power to do what is proposed. When the Defence Bill was before the House in 1903, it was questioned whether we could, expressly repeal the laws of the States. There was a fairly long debate on the point, and, as usual, some sort of working compromise of opinion was come to, under which power was taken to declare that at a particular time, or for particular purposes, the Defence law of a State was not to operate. In that case the question of the validity of that reservation would - never be tested, because ou'f power of legislation as regards defence was practically exclusive, and the States had, therefore, no need for any of their local laws. The administration of the local law passed holus-bolus to us on the transfer of the Department to the Federation. All that was said by that Act was that the law that we, as a Federal Parliament, wanted to apply for the future, was the law as it existed upon the statute-book of the Federation, or on the statute-books of the States until the date when we had determined that the State laws should no longer apply. That was a matter purely concerning ourselves, but' this is quite' different, because, in this case, we shall be modifying, or attempting to some extent to repeal, the operation of the State laws, which, otherwise, would be concurrent with the law of the Federation. An attempted repeal, - pro .tanto, in the Defence Act-and the same applies to the Post Office Act-is therefore essentially different from the position we are now asked to take up in attempting to repeal the State laws, instead of allowing the repeal to be brought about through the principle of inconsistency. Whether we have that power, I do not presume to say. Some very competent authorities thought that there was an exceedingly great doubt as to its existence. Consequently, I do not think that 'from the very start we have ever expressly reso that if pealed an Act of a State.",38
243,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,No ; we have simply said that they shall cease to apply.,38
244,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That was so-in the particular cases mentioned, but we know that they are not at all analogous to this. In those instances the law of the future wasto be purely a Federal law, and all-that we did was-instea d of administering the laws as passed by the States, which stood without any provision in them inconsistent with the Federal Act-to declare the particular time at which those laws would no longer apply. That, however, would be purely for Federal purposes, because the administration for the future would also be purely Federal. The clause says that if the Governor General is satisfied- That any laws or regulations of a State (b) have the effect of interfering with freedom of trade or commerce among the Stateshe may, by proclamation, direct that those laws or regulations shall cease to apply, or shall apply only subject to such restrictions, limitations, or modifications as he directs. If the State law or regulation does interfere with trade and commerce, it is bad under section 92 of the Constitution, and this express provision is not required to declare it so. The Minister says that it is intended to enable a litigant to rely upon the express declaration of a Federal Act-whic h he thinks would be conclusive, and probably it would-instea d of challenging the interference on the ground that it was against section 92 of the Constitution. In the latter event, the litigant's proof, instead of being a Federal Act, would be simplyfacts showing that there was such an interference, and that procedure, of course, might be more expensive for him. That is the only possible ference that can be made if paragraph b is passed. It may perhaps facilitate the proof of an offence against section 92 of the Constitution by having the fact that it did occur evidenced by a proclamation, although, of course, that it actually did occur would be no more sure' because the Governor General had said so. There might be no offence at all. The Courts might, if this clause were passed, have to take our fiat upon the matter as conclusive in a case where no jury would accept it or. the evidence. That possibility might perhaps outweigh the advantage of the greater facility given to a litigant to assert with conclusiveness that such an interference did exist. I prefer to leave section 92 of the Constitution-whic h is exceptional here, and is not in the American Constitutionunfettered in its operation, without having it safeguarded by the power we possess under paragraph 1. of section '51 of the Constitution to make this further provision under the trade and commerce clause. On these grounds, I have great doubt as to the desirableness of passing the clause. At all events, I am inclined to vote against it, and, before doing so, to test to what extent it should be applied by moving the excision of the words "" or plants."" For the present, however, I merely indicate the possibility that I may move in that direction.",38
245,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Franklin) [5.39]. - The amendment inserted by the Minister the other day gave general satisfaction, both to the Committee and those particularly interested. It enabled them to retain all the power they require, and it allowed us to exercise especially the power we desire to prevent the importation of diseases into Australia. This clause gives the Government power to lift any local quarantine.",39
246,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Onl y in cases where a State regulation is unduly interfering with freedom of trade.,39
247,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"It giyes the Commonwealth Government power to lift a quarantine in defiance of a State law or regulation. There is given to us by the Constitution all the power that we require, and the Government have- I think properly-exercise d it in an instance in which a State was going too' far. I urge the - Minister to leave the Bill as it stands. It portation, is unnecessary to insert in it a provision such as this, whose effect will ""be to bring into conflict the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States, which we should guard against. We should endeavour to dif- secure a fair acceptance for the measure without making it too complicated, or extending its provisions beyond what is necessary for its immediate purpose. Seeing that control in quarantine matters has, in - the. past, been well exercised by State authorities, common sense should teach us not to rush at matters like a bull at a gate, at once asserting the whole power given to us by the Constitution. I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Angas to leave out the words "" or plants,"" and if there is a division, I shall vote against the clause, because the Bill would be better without it. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. (Parramatta) [5.44] - It is difficult to know what it is best to do in this matter. I should prefer to deal with an extreme case under the provisions of clause 13. This is a proposal to allow the Commonwealth Government, where circumstances seem to justify, such action, to lift a quarantine imposed by a State.",39
248,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,A State might be totally prohibiting the importation of goods. The clause would meet a case of that kind.,39
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Apparentl y this is intended as a reserve power, though there is nothing to show that it is a reserve power.",39
250,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The Governor General must be satisfied.,39
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"As the honourable member for Angas has pointed out, ""the Governor General"" means the Commonwealth Executive. In another clause, the Bill distinctly limits the exercise of a reserve power of this kind, prescribing the conditions under which it shall be exercised ; but here there is no limitation or restriction. This provision would have been more workable if introduced at the end of paragraph // of clause 13. We have already taken a reserve power to, if need be, reinforce the repressive aspect of State quarantine.",39
252,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,And the proposal which is being discussed gives the Commonwealth power to remove State restrictions.,39
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,We have already empowered the Commonwealth to step in where a State is not doing what is required in the direction of prohibiting im-.,39
254,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Where there is danger of disease spreading from one State to another.,40
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"As a corollary, it is now proposed that we should take a reserve power to lift a Statequarantine which is unnecessary, or unusually harsh, or undesirable, for some other reason.",40
256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,This provision was drafted in accordance with a suggestion made by the honourable member. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It has not been drafted in a way which meets my views.,40
257,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Will the honourable member look at paragraph g of clause 13 ?,40
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,We have agreed to a provision which provides that the reserve power conferred by clause 13 shall be exercised only in certain cases; but there is no such restriction in the proposal under discussion.,40
259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Can the honourable member suggest an improvement?,40
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"It is very difficult. If the clause is passed in its present form, it will be an unrestricted clause..",40
261,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"r-No , it will be a limitation.",40
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"It will be subject to none of the limitations which are now imposed by clause 13. It will be remembered that in clause 13 we put in an amendment to the effect that paragraphs g, h, and i shall be put in operation only as a reserve act. In that clause we take the power, if necessary, - to step in and reinforce the quarantine which may be imposed by a State. Originally, clause 13, in paragraphs g, h, and i , provided that in certain cases the Governor General may prohibit and declare. Then we passed an amendment which provides that the Governor General shall prohibit and declare only in extreme and urgent cases. In other words, where the States are not doing their duty' in the way of repressing certain' diseases we shall have power, under that amendment, to step in and do the work for them. This new clause, I take it, is one which will enable the Federal Government to step in and give the States relief from each other. The normal condition of the Bill is that it ' is to leave in operation the State inspection laws as regards plants and animals. In that respect we do not contemplate interfering with the powers which the States exercise today. It is only in respect of the prohibition of diseases and the prevention of their spread from State to State that we take power, if necessary, tp step in and reinforce their quarantine. The Attorney-General .submits today a new clause, providing that in cases where the Governor General has satisfied himself that the State quarantine is harsh, he shall have the option of stepping into relieve thatquarantine. My trouble is that it is not conditioned in the same way as was the repressive amendment which we passed last week. If the Attorney-General can put ir> a condition which will make it clear that the clause is only to be used as a reserve power, and not under the ordinary operation of the States Acts, I shall be very glad.",40
263,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I think that the provision really does say that in paragraph a.,40
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"An ordinary reading of the provision seems to contemplate an interference at any time when the Governor General shall deem it necessary to step in. I want an amendment to the effect that it is not to be used ordinarily in that way, but as a reserve power, which is to be exercised only in most extreme cases ",40
265,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Bendigo) [ 5 . 5 2 ] -! So far as I can understand the new clause,' it seems a new method of annulling State inspection laws. In section 112 of the Constitution there is provided a distinct method of dealing with such laws. It says- . Any 'such inspection laws may be annulled by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. , The' new clause seems to be so designed as to empower the Governor General to repeal State inspection laws. It seems to be very doubtful whether that is a properexercise of the constitutional power. The new clause as it stands must have reference to State inspection laws. I submit that there is only one way of repealing objectionable regulations relating to inspection,' and that is by a distinct Act ofParlian:eu(. I doubt whether the Parliament can delegate to the Governor General a general authority to annul State inspection laws.",40
266,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,But surely we can pass regulations inconsistent with them.,40
267,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"This Parliament can pass' laws, or the Federal Government can pass regulations, based on Federal laws, which, if inconsistent with the States laws, will prevail over the latter. But I contend that the operation of State laws can be displaced only by inconsistent Federal laws, and that we cannot enact a clause repealing in so many words existing State laws, without passing legislation of a substantive character to take their place.",40
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Unde r section 112 of the Constitution, have we power to put this authority in. operation without a Bill ?'",41
269,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I do not think that under that section this Parliament can give to the Governor General power 'to annul State inspection laws. I believe that they must be expressly annulled by Act of Parliament.,41
270,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,What about a resolution?,41
271,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I think that the words "" annulled by the Parliament"" mean that the State inspection laws are to be annulled by an Act of this Parliament passed in the usual way. There is a great deal of force in the view presented by the honourable member for Angas. I hardly realized the significance of the new clause before I beard his address, and that has been appropriately supplemented by the deputy leader of the Opposition. I concur in their arguments. The new clause involves a method not contemplated by the Constitution, and the Minister ought to seriously consider the propriety of not pressing it.",41
272,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Is there any authority for this course of action ?,41
273,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"No . I felt quite astounded at the proposition. Certainly, it is news to me that we can give to the Governor General a general power to repeal State inspection laws. In other words, the clause hands over to the Executive the general authority of repealing such laws when this Parliament alone has the right as well as the duty to review, and, if necessary, annul State inspection laws.",41
274,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Besides , inspection laws are not quarantine laws.",41
275,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"No . If the clause is passed, it will certainly operate on inspection laws, because it contemplates laws which are passed for the purpose of keeping out disease.",41
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,It will operate no more in that direction than will clause 13 of the Bill as passed - I do,41
277,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Clause 13, of. course, limits the operation of Federal laws, but this new clause purports to limit the operation of, and to repeal and supersede by an Executive act, State laws. That, I contend, would be a very dangerous power to place in the hands of any Government. It is not contemplated by the Constitution, and probably the effect of the proposition is hardly realized by the Government at the present stage.",41
278,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Boothby) [6.0] The framers of the Constitution seem to have had a sufficient reason for placing in the Parliament the power of annulling State legislation - of a particular kind, because in the Parliament the States are represented. In the Senate, the States are equally represented. The words "" Governor in Council "" do not necessarily imply parliamentary approval, they may mean merely the approval of this House. The other branch of the Legislature, which represents the States, may be altogether opposed to the action of the Ministry as represented by the Governor in Council. I can see sufficient reason for giving this Parliament power to annul a State law which interferes with freedom of trade, but I can see no reason why we should delegate that power to the Ministry of the day. When we come to look at the matter from the stand-point of freedom of trade as between the States, we cannot fail to remember that the framers of our Constitution decided upon the establishment of a special tribunal, namely, the Inter-State Commission, to deal with it. The Commission was to be a non-political body, which wpuld be free from bias, and which would not need to look for the support of a parliamentary majority. This tribunal was to view the matter from an all-round stand-point, in the interests of the whole of the States. The words "" Governor in Council"" really mean a parliamentary majority for the time being, and I do not think the power of dealing with the question of Inter-State free-trade should be delegated to such a body. I do not think that a parliamentary majority is the right tribunal to deal with these matters. I admit that by the method laid down in the Constitution their decision would rest with a parliamentary majority, but it would, at least, be a majority of both Houses of the Legislaturej which is a very different thing from the decision of the Ministry of the day. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [6.3]. not agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby regarding the power of delegation, because if we have power to pass legislation of this kind, I think it - lhas been sufficiently decided that we have power to delegate our authority. Upon the main point raised by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I think there is the gravest doubt as to whether this Parliament has power to annul any State Act which it was within the power of the State Legislature to pass. I ask the Attorney-General whether there is any authority for the adoption of the course which is proposed ? The same question arose in Canada, where the Supreme Court decided that such power was not vested in the Federal Parliament.' In Lefroy's Legislative Power in Canada, one proposition which the author says is established by authority isThere is no power given by the Confederation Act to the Dominion Parliament to amend or repeal an Act passed by a Provincial Legislature within the limits of its authority nor Provincial Legislatures to amend or repeal a Dominion Act. I may say that the State Parliament has just as much right to repeal a Commonwealth statute as the Commonwealth Parliament has to repeal a State statute. Under the Constitution, we have power to make laws covering a certain area, and if those laws are inconsistent with any laws passed by the States Parliaments, to the extent to which they are inconsistent, the State laws are overridden. By our substi. tuting other provisions for those which exist under State legislation, we can secure an - effective repeal of such legislation. Chief Justice Dorion, in the case of Dobie v. Temporalities Board, which is reported in /. Cartright's Reports, puts the position thusBut it is important to remember that though - the Dominion Parliament has no power directly and tolidem verbis to amend or repeal an Act passed by a Provincial Legislature within the - limits of its authority, there are many cases where its legislation may have the pending the operation of valid provincial Acts. .So it is with us. If we choose to pass any legislation upon the subject of quarantine - which conflicts with any State law upon the same subject, the latter will, to the - extent of the inconsistency, be rendered in- 'Operative. But we have no power beyond - that. Here, however, we are simply attempting to annul the Acts which the States Parliaments have passed within the limits - of their own authority. I urge the Attorney-General to give this matter his earnest consideration, because every step that we - take which improperly overrides the legislation of the State authorities can only - lead to vexatious litigation, to uncertainty, and ultimately to the humiliation of this Parliament. If the Attorney-General has - any authority to cite in support of this proposition, I think that he ought to inform - the Committee of it.",41
279,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [6.7] - Perhaps the honourable ttnd learned member for Flinders is not aware that the question of the power of the Commonwealth to deal with this matter in the way that we are dealing with it, has been previously considered. Bills introduced into this House contained clauses which provided for the repeal of certain State Acts. They were discussed very fully. It was recognised that we had not the power to expressly repeal any State Act, but if the honourable member noticed the wording of the quotations which he made, he will observe"" that they refer to matters to the within the limits of the authority of the respective Legislatures. Whilst it was recognised that we had no power to repeal a State Act, it was pointed out that we had power to declare in our Statutes that certain State Acts should cease to apply.",42
280,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,What is the authority for that?,42
281,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The honourable member will find the provision to which I refer embodied in seccion 6 of the Defence Act, which readsThe State Acts and the Act of the Federal Council of Australasia specified in the first schedule shall cease to apply, &c. The authority for that action is based upon the legislative power of the Commonwealth to pass Acts which are inconsistent with State Statutes.'",42
282,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,That we can do.,42
283,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Therefore , when we declare by a Statute that certain State Acts shall cease to apply, it is equivalent to a declaration by this Parliament of inconsisteffect of susency with the Commonwealth Act.",42
284,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Oh , no.",42
285,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I submit that it is so. That is the view that has prevailed here. In the Postal Act we declared that the States Statutes should cease to apply. The honourable member will observe that the subject with which' we are dealing in this Bill is one entirely within the competency of the Commonwealth Parliament. We have power to pass laws dealing with the question of quarantine and Inter-State trade. .,42
286,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"And in so far as those laws are inconsistent with State laws, the latter are superseded.",42
287,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The honourable member admits that. Here we are simply declaring that under certain conditions, if certain laws' are passed which interfere with freedom of trade, the Governor in Council may declare that those laws shall cease to apply. The matter with which we are dealing is entirely within the purview of this Parliament. We might go so far as to say that these provisions, and no other, shall prevail. Instead of setting out everything we desire in detail in the Bill, we can declare that the Governor General might, by proclamation, direct that States laws dealing with the subject shall cease to apply. The matter dealt with in the clause is quite within our powers, and it is sought to exercise them accordingly.",42
288,Mr GLYNN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Angas) [6.11] - When the Minister last spoke, I tried to draw a distinction between the provisions of the Defence, and, I think, also of the Post and Telegraph Act, and those contained in this Bill . With all due respect to the honourable gentleman, I still consider that the distinction is very well founded. In con- nexion with the Defence Act, it must be remembered that the moment the States Defence Departments were taken over the whole administration of whatsoever defence laws were in force in the States at the time passed to the Federal Government, and there was no longer a concurrent power vested in the States. They had absolutely no power afterwards to pass an Act relating to defence. The position is altogether different in connection with the exercise by the Commonwealth of. its powers in respect to quarantine, because in connection with this subject there is a-concurrent power in the States, as well as the Federal power, embodied in paragraph i x . of section 51 of the Constitution. We covered the whole field in our defence legislation. We took over the Defence Acts of the States, and administered them; we added something to them, and we declared that ""after a certain time certain provisions of. the States. Acts should no longer be in force. In view of the fact that not only the legislative power, but also the administrative power, was vested in the one authority, it might have been competent for the Federal Parliament to pass such an Act as that. In this case, however, we allow the concurrent legislation of the States to continue. That is recognised by the general terms of this Bill , and by the proposed clause itself. This clause presupposes the existence of a concurrent power in the States, otherwise the Governor General would be unable to say that the provisions of a State Act are working in restraint of Inter-Stata trade and commerce. We recognise the existence of the States Acts when we authorize the Governor General to interfere with their operation. I do not wish to repeat what I said on that point, but I do think that inasmuch as we have from the beginning refrained from expressly repealing Acts of the States, that fact indicates some doubt as to our power to do so. With the exception of the proposed clause, no attempt has ever been made to directly repeal a State Act either by Federal legislation or by the delegation of power to the Governor General, and I doubt whether it is constitutional. - The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, in his lucid speech, referred incidentally to our power to annul inspection laws of the States.. I do not think that quarantine laws canbe considered as amongst those inspection laws. Looking through the matter from time to time, I - find that distinctions are drawn between quarantine laws and inspection laws. Section 112 of the Constitution, which is the section giving the power to annul inspection laws, deals only with exports and imports. The commentary in Quick and Garran upon this section is confined to inspection for purposes connected with the operation of iocal trade laws, anddeals with such mattersas the size of parcels, and so on. I do not think that the power to annul inspection laws given by section 112 gives us any power to directly annul States quarantine laws. To test the question'; I propose to move a limitation of the clause, Ibut, even though it should be amended in the direction I am about to suggest, I still think it would be better to negative the clause altogether. I move That the words "" o r plants',"" line 4, be left out. I propose this amendment, because in clause 13 we have already declared that the power of the Federation in respect of Inter-State quarantine, as - regards plants and goods, shall not be put in force unless upon evidence of neglect to take proper precautions under the States laws. I think it would be most unwise to take power under the proposed new clause to destroy States Acts by the delegation of a power to do so to the Governor General.",43
289,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [6.15] - I shall not press the clause on the Committee. I may say that it was drafted for the Minister in accordance with suggestions made by honourable members, who, apparently, do not entertain, the same view when they see the proposal expressed in black and white. Though I do not press the clause, I am - still of opinion that it is quite within our competence to enact a clause of this description. ' A desire was expressed by certain honourable members that while the States laws were to be left to the administration of the States authorities, if it were found that they were being administered in such a way as really to amount to a prohibition of trade and commerce under the guise of inspection or quarantine, there should be a reserve power in the CommonAvealth to deal with the matter.",43
290,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The reserve power - of the High Court.,44
291,Mr GROOM,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"No ; a reserve power to be exercised under a regulation taking the matter out of the hands of the States, and giving it into Federal control. That was the. idea expressed. I was not in charge of the Bill when the matter was previously referred to. The Treasurer had charge of the Bill then, and he had this clause drafted to meet the views expressed by honourable members. I am of opinion that it complies with the requirements of the Constitution, and would meet what was desired. However, as there appears to be some objection to the form in which the provision is expressed, I am prepared to withdraw the clause. It is only fair that I should say that it was drafted after careful consideration of the constitutional position, and those who are responsible for it are quite satisfied that it is a provision that is clearly within the competence of this Parliament to enact. I wish that to be distinctly understood. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Proposed new clause, by leave, withdrawn. Title agreed to.

But for that reason it is probable that I should not have asked to-night for three months' Supply. I desire the consideration of the Tariff, whatever the result may be, to be expedited, for I think that the. interests of the public. and more particularly of the commercial community, require that it shall be dealt with as early as possible. In submitting this motion, I am laying the foundation of a course that will enable the consideration of the Tariff to proceed without undue interruption, and I desire to emphasize the point that the vote for which I now ask is based on last year's Estimates.",45

That being so, I shall offer no can. very serious objection to the granting of Supply. I wish, however, to point out irregularity of the whole proceeding. This is a proposal to grant three months' Supply, in addition to one month's Supply already voted in respect of the current financial year. I venture to. say that the voting a third of a .year's Supply before even Budget has been considered has never ocThat curred in the history of the Federal Parnot'vouchsafe liament, and I doubt if an instance of a thing can be found in the history of any of the States Legislatures.",45

304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"That is a very different procedure.

This, I presume, is a step towards clearing the decks before we plunge into that tremendous fight which seems to be looming up. and' which, no doubt, the Treasurer will heartily welcome, if only in the interests of the Tariff itself. The one reason why we are asked to agree to this proposed vote is that the Minister is preparing for honourable members some information with regard to the Tariff.

Therefore, we must look to the schedule itself for all that we want to know about this precious Tariff. By this time, the Treasurer himself is. probably convinced that it is not that perfect piece of workmanship lhat we might have expected from the Government after they had been cogitating over it for two years. I hope that next week we shall be supplied with some explanation of the principles underlying it , and what have been the guiding motives in the minds of the Government in introducing a Tariff which departs so radically from the recommendations of the expert Commission which has been sitting to inquire into the subject.",45

315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I am not anticipating it . With regard to the Minister's statement that he intends to give us all the information he can between now and next week, I suggest that he should prepare a statement for the Committee as to what has prompted the Government to make their recommendations, and to depart from those of the Commission. He should tell us generally what has been in the minds of Ministers in preparing the Tariff in the way they have done. In regard to the Bill before us, I have to say that, in my opinion, it is entirely unnecessary to ask for three, months' supply at one time.",46
316,Mr FISHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,What would the honourable member say to granting two months' supply ?,46
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I do not see any necessity for granting more than one month's supply. What is the objection to obtaining supply every month as has been customary ? However, the circumstances are exceptional; and in the hope and belief that Ministers do intend to devote all their energies to the consideration of the Tariff, allowing no other business to intervene between the commencement of the discussion and its reasonable completion, [62] I consent-and I do so on that ground only-to this extraordinary and irregular procedure of asking 'for one-third of the total supplies of the year without adequate consideration by the Cornmittee..",46
318,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Indi) [7.58]. - I know perfectly well that we cannot take effective exception 'to a Supply Bill of this character, but I must join with the deputy leader of the Opposition in saying that this procedure is unprecedented. We must recognise that we have before us business which will require all the attention and ability of this Parliament. One cannot, however, overlook the fact that expenditure is being increased. That is a matter that calls for our serious the consideration. It is remarkable that while there .are 195 divisions in this Bill , there are at the same time 195 votes for contingencies. Honourable members have not perhaps, as I have done, reckoned up what these contingencies amount to. I find that we . have whilst the total amount which we are asked to vote by this 'Bill is .£1,103,744, no less than £ 2 4 2 , 6 5 0 is absolutely set down under the head of "" Contingencies."" I venture to say that in view of the increased expenditure, on account of Federation, these honourable votes for contingencies . demand attention. To me they appear to be quite exceptional. The Minister in his Budget speech took a good deal of credit to himself, and to the various Governments of which he has been a member since the establishment of the Commonwealth, for having exercised the strictest economy. I venture to say that when the Budget comes to be discussed and examined, honourable mfembers will find that, not only has there been no economy, but that expenditure has increased by leaps and bounds.",46
319,Mr THOMAS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,When we realise what we might have spent we are amazed at our moderation.,46
320,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Of course, I quite understand the influence of the power behind the Government. The honourable member who interjects represents a very intelligent section of the community who mean to carry out the principle of spending all they can, and then coming for more. When the Minister talks about economy, I should like to draw his attention to one striking fact. In the year 1901-2 the Commonwealth returned to the Statesno less than ^7,300,000. In 1906-7 it returned only j£6,900,000. Much ' has been said about the surplus returned to the States in excess of the 75 per cent, Customs and Excise Revenue required by the Constitution. But when we have bea Supply Bill . fore us a three months' Supply B i l and we find that ,£242,000 is set down obtaining Supply? for contingencies, I urge that this mittee ought, for its own credit's and in the interests of the people whom we represent, to "" take a pull "" of expenditure of the Commonwealth. I am no prophet, and even if I were, a prophet, as the Scripture says, has "" no honour in his own country,"" but I venture to say that, unless we do what I have said ought to do, an expiatory period will port it . come upon us in 1910, when the time for the expiration of the "" Braddon B l o t section arrives.

This question does not concern members of the Opposition so those others who have been so long posturing upon the public platform as being alone keenly in favour of old-age pensions, and determined, return for the support which they have been consistently giving to the Government for several years past, to get policy enacted without delay.

This is a slightly important question than the Minister of Defence seems to think. Two or days ago a statement appeared in the lic press that two Commonwealth officers, who are, no doubt, excellent in cheir - I am willing to give them every credit for their professional knowledge and ability-ha d invited tenders in England the construction of certain vessels which of this Parliament has noc yet authorized.",49

The Minister repliedI do not think that I will consider the advisathree bility of his immediate recall. pubThe honourable gentleman, therefore, will not even consider the advisability of recallway ing a man who would so far exceed his instructions as to invite tenders, I presume on behalf of the Commonwealth, because for I do not suppose Commander Coiquhoun's financial standing is such as to enable him to pay for the vessels himself.",49

369,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I am not saying that it has happened. If it has not, no harm has been done. I based my whole question on the possibility that Commander Colquhoun might have done what the press said he had done.",50

And the MinisteraddedI do not think it is. of very much consequence. That is the statement to which I take exception. A question of this character must be of the greatest consequence.",50
372,Mr EWING,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"At all events, it cannot bind the Government. I shall put it all right in any case.",50
373,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"If two Commonwealth authorities, commissioned to make inquiries in England; 'actually did call for tenders, and the Commonwealth went back on them, should we not be damaging ourselves in the eyes of the shipbuilders of England?",50

375,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Nobod y would be better pleased than myself to learn that they had not done it. The question I asked today was not directed against them at all. My object was to see that proper discipline was maintained in the Defence Department. That can only be achieved by firm Ministerial control. I asked the Minister practically whether he was prepared to exercise that control, and he at once replied that the question of calling for tenders for the construction of ships without the authority of Parliament to the extent of about £-750,000 was a matter of very little con- sequence!",50
376,Mr FISHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The Minister cannot avoid having a joke now and again.,50
377,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The honourable gentleman was not joking. He was quite serious. I think the honourable member does him an injustice when he says he was joking on this occasion. I am sure he would see that the matter was too serious for jest, even when the jest is carried out with such singular success ! This Supply Bill is the last real opportunity we shall have of discussing the Ministerial policy.",50

379,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"If the honourable member for Flinders advanced his views on the financial question, and the honourable member for Gippsland, or some other agile mind, immediately drew a red herring, across the track in the shape of a speech about duties, does the honourable member for Flinders think the Committee would discuss so dry a matter as the financial question after the brilliant and distracting speech of the honourable member for Gippsland?",50
380,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,There is something in that.,50
381,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"There is a good deal in it. The honourable member would have no opportunity whatever of arriving at any conclusive result as to any particular item of Government policy in the debate on the Budget. I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, in considering the coastal defence policy of the Government, he intends to take the advice of Lord Tweedmouth, and - if he must have floating coastal defences - pa y first consideration to submarines? I understand that the instructions' given to Commander Colquhoun and Mr Clarkson were to inquire more particularly into torpedo-boat construction.",50
382,Mr EWING,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Thei r instructions were that they were not to limit themselves to that question. Submarines and submersibles wereincluded.,50

385,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I am glad to hear it, because a statement recently appeared in the Age that the amount on the Estimates was to carry out the Prime Minister's policy, as announced to this House in September last. In that case, it would be for the construction of torpedo craft.",51

391,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Like the honourable member for Wide Bay, I feel powerless at the present time.

392,Mr KNOX,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Kooyong) [8.26] - I am not prepared to resist the request of the Government for necessary Supply, because I agree with the Minister that it is desirable to clear the decks for action in connection with the Tariff struggle; but I hope that the honourable member for Wentworth was not correct in saying that this is the only opportunity that we shall have to criticise the financial programme of the Government.",51
393,Mr KELLY,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The only real opportunity.,51
394,Mr KNOX,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I trust that the Minister will assure the Committee that, in giving him Supply to-night, we shall not lose the opportunity to fully discuss the financial policy of the Government in dealing with the .Budget that we have had on previous occasions. It is because I believe that we shall have that opportunity that I assume an attitude of non-resistance in regard to the Supply Bill. I trust that an opportunity will' also be given to discuss the Government policv on general lines in connection with the Tariff.",51
395,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The carrying of the motion before the Chair will not prevent honourable members from doing so.,51

397,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Hear , hear.",51
398,Mr KNOX,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"In the circumstances I am willing to assist the Government in obtaining the Supply that is asked for. I wish, however, to use this occasion to refer to a reply given to me on Friday, to the effect that the Minister could not agree to hold in suspense the revenue paid under the present Tariff, and to refund any difference between the rates now in force and those which may be adopted in Committee of Supply. That was the practice under the first Commonwealth Tariff. At the present time great hardship and serious loss is likely to be entailed on a large number of importers by the Tariff alterations. We are now, especially in connection with the soft goods trade, at the. period between two seasons. Large bulks have to be broken for distribution throughout the country, and probably by the time that the goods have been sent away, and the invoices forwarded to the country storekeepers, there will be an alteration in the rates of duties. Very serious loss will have to be borne by the importers if the ""difference between the present and. the permanent rates is not returned to them. It cannot be the desire of Ministers, or of honourable members, to do more than protect the revenue, and I take it that, where possible, the Government desires to prevent unnecessary loss to importers.",51
399,Mr FISHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Is there any better . or more logical rule than to say that duties must be paid from the date of the imposition of the Tariff, and the rates reduced from the time of their subsequent reduction in Committee of Supply ?",51
400,Mr KNOX,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"The practice in Victoria, and I believe in the other States, has been to refund the difference between the rates, first imposed and those subsequently agreed to by Parliament. There need be no difficulty about making a refund of duty in connection with unbroken parcels of goods. This notice was posted up at the 'Customs House to-dayIn all cases where the rates under the new Tariff proposals are lower than the rates previously in force, the difference between the higher and the lower rates is to be taken on deposit. That will involve book-keeping, and it' seems to me that, in the present exceptional circumstances, greater consideration might have been shown to the importers. Considerable dislocation of commerce has occurred, and I credit the Department of Customs and the Minister with a desire not to cause more inconvenience or loss than is necessary for the adequate protection of the revenue.",51
401,Mr FISHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Does not the honourable member know that in some cases the retail prices of goods have already been raised?,52
402,Mr TUDOR,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,In some instances as much as 150 per cent.,52
403,Mr FISHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,How could refunds be made to consumers?,52
404,Mr KNOX,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I do not know howwe can deal with retail traders who are not doing an honest and legitimate business, but the importers of whom I speak are prepared to submit invoices, and to assist the Government in every way. Their position now is a very serious and difficult one.",52
405,Mr BAMFORD,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Would they be willing to return to their customers the due proportion of any money refunded?,52
406,Mr KNOX,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,They say so.,52
407,Mr TUDOR,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Coul d the retail storekeepers make similar refunds to purchasers ?,52
408,Mr KNOX,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"If refunds are made, the storekepers ought to be placed in the same position as the importers, and I am advised that the latter have no desire to charge their customers more than the duty which they themselves are required to pay. But the duties may be altered during the next month or two. At this period of the year-betwee n the two seasons-the introduction of a new Tariff is very awkward and inopportune. On behalf of many honourable importers here, I wish to put on record their protest against this effort to place them in a position of financial loss, and one in which it is quite unnecessary to place them. In all the circumstances, however-havin g made my protest, and with a distinct promise from the Minister that we shall have the usual latitude of debate on the first item in the Budget, and another opportunity to deal with the Tariff proposals generally- I do not propose to offer any resistance to the desire of the Government to obtain Supply for three months.",52
409,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Flinders) [8.36]. - I cannot see that, in present circumstances, the request which the Treasurer has made for three months' Supply is at all unreasonable. I think it would be undesirable to have the debate on the Tariff interrupted by an application for further Supply, and I welcome the promise from the honourable gentleman that once we enter upon the debate he intends that we shall go right through with it. I desire information on one or two points. The first I regard as of vital importance to the discussion of the Budget proposals next week. The honourable gentleman stated-of course it was apparent from the figures which he placed before the Committee-that the revenue fromCustoms and Excise duties * during the current financial year will exceed by a very large sum that which hitherto has been derived from that source. We can all understand that that must result from the imposition of higher duties on almost all articles. I ask the Treasurer if he can tell the Committee whether an estimate has been made of what the normal revenue from the new duties will be when things have settled down ? During the first year the revenue will be far greater than the ordinary amount, but the honourable gentleman has stated that in succeeding years there will be a very serious diminution.",52
410,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,It is estimated that there will be.,52
411,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Naturall y the revenue will be less in subsequent years. Can the honourable gentleman give the Committee even the roughest approximate estimate of what the normal revenue from, the new duties will be?",52
412,Mr MAHON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The honourable member is looking for a prophet.,52
413,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Of course, all estimates are more or less in the nature of prophesies. If the Treasurer says he has not attempted to make an estimate of that kind, I am quite prepared to accept his statement. But if he or his officers have arrived at any estimate, I for one shall be very glad to know what it is. I quite admit that it is a very difficult estimate to make. It depends entirely upon the extent to which the duties are protective.",52
414,Mr FISHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Can there be any settling down under a protective Tariff?,52
415,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Yes ; in Victoria we had a protective Tariff for many years, and the Treasurers were able to estimate the revenue with very considerable accuracy.",52
416,Mr FISHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Wit h no alteration for years ?,52
417,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"W it h no alteration for more than ten years. It was always quite possible to estimate with very close approximation what the revenn- would be. At the nresent time, I admit that it is a matter of greater difficulty. We are now creating a new protective Tariff, and it is impossible to say with accuracy what the result may be. The officers who have assisted the Treasurer in preparing the Tariff have had the future revenue in their minds, and may have arrived at an estimate or a conjecture of what it will be. If they have, I , for one, shall feel grateful to the Treasurer if he can give me the information. A statement has been made that a schedule of Excise duties for the purpose of the "" new protection "" the protection of the workers in the protected industries-is to be brought before the Committee. I desire to ask the Treasurer when it will be submitted, and what opportunity we shall have of considering the effect of it in connection with the Budget proposals. In present circumstances, I see no reason for objecting to a grant of Supply for three months, but I think it would facilitate the debate which lies before honourable members if they had the information for which I have asked.",52
418,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Hume-Trea surer) [8.38] - I have had placed in my hands only an estimate of what the new duties are expected to bring in during the current financial year. If an estimate were made at the present time it could not be accepted as being very reliable.,53
419,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,It could only be barely approximate.,53
420,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Quite so. Of course, I shall try to get all the information I can for honourable members. In the short time. I had to deal with the Budget. I was only able to get an estimate 'of the probable revenue for the first twelve months. Further information I shall try to obtain before the debate is completed; but, as the honourable member says, it must be very unreliable.",53
421,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,It must be conjectural to a large extent.,53
422,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Yes . reference to the Excise duties, I want to find, if I can, a method of dealing with the "" new protection ' ' that will be easier than, and yet as effective as, Excise duties. Last year Excise duties were imposed under a short Tariff. I recognise that to extend them - to the full Tariff, or to the main items in the full Tariff, might make our legislation. very cumbersome. Therefore, I am trying to ascertain whether it is not possible to devise a scheme which will be quite as effective, and yet not so cumbersome. But I wish honourable members clearly to understand that before the Bill dealing with the Tariff is completed, there will be either Excise duties or an improved provision under which there shall be protection insured to the employees, and, if possible, to the public, in order to prevent the reduction of wages, and the increase of prices unduly.",53
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Before the Tariff is passed ?,53

425,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"It is essential to the consideration of the financial proposals' of the Government. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I do not want' to be bound down to any particular time, but it may be dealt with at a very early date. The honourable member will see that at present it would be hazardous for me to make a definite promise as to when it can be done. We have not yet entered on. the debate.",53
426,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Will the Treasurer permit me to explain my question?,53
427,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Yes . Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [8.44]. - If a system of Excise duties covering most or a large number of the articles which are included in the schedule to the protective Tariff is brought in, that will entirely change the financial position in connection with the Tariff so far as those articles are concerned. Therefore, if we are to have a discussion on the financial position, we ought to ""know whether such a schedule is to be brought in or not. But the Treasurer has stated that he is not yet prepared to say definitely what will be done.",53
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"No . I said that I , am going to deal with the matter, but that it was questionable whether it should be done by means of Excise duties, or by With some.other method.",53
429,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"But whether it be done by means of Excise duties, or in some other way, may very materially affect the position.",53
430,Mr FISHER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Not if it be merely of a penal character.,53
431,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"If it be brought forward in the form of a schedule of Excise duties, that, of course, will be an element which will completely vary the financial position. We are entitled to ask - if a new schedule of Excise duties be brought forward subsequently-that we shall be afforded an opportunity of debating the Budget proposals in connection with it",53

I believe that the Opposition have lost opportunity. I do not think that there is slightest chance of defeating the Government at the present time, but, nevertheless, I say that they should have been challenged as soon as this Bill was brought forward.

457,Mr WILKS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I have said that honourable members returned in support of a high Tariff will naturally desire to have the proposed new Tariff passed into law as quickly possible, but I object to those who were returned to support a low Tariff taking this down.

If honourable memtion, bers do not view the Tariff in that lifht they might just as well give the Government Supply now as at any other time.

462,Mr JOHNSON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,What do they want three months' Supply for?,56
463,Mr WILKS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Because the Acting Prime Minister desires that the consideraprotest tion of the Tariff shall not be interfered with by other business. I do not believe that honourable members are prepared to pass the Tariff in There will certainly be 'discussion and quite apart from the adoption structive tactics, it is clear from the number of items it contains that ordinary debate and criticism of those items will cupy more than three months. Unless in case of emergency, I believe that any Bill for more than a month's Supply should be resisted. In granting the Governanother ment four months' Supply honourable memChair bers are absolutely surrendering their concompleted. trol of the Estimates. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie usually takes an active part in the discussion of the Estimates, I remind him that if he agrees to vote £1,600,000 out of a total Supply of £6,000,000 his power to secure reductions in the Estimates will have passed away.",56

471,Mr WILKS,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"I consider the interjection a very pertinent one. The Opposiin neglecting to challenge the Government on this Supply Bill, lay themselves open to the charge of firing blank cartridge. I know it is of no use for one man exto challenge the Government, but I wish Opposition were sufficiently disciplined to do so, not with any hope of defeating them, but as a protest against this method of dealing with thefinancesof the Commonwealth.

500,Mr CROUCH,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Corio) [9.8] - I wish"" to draw attention to a matter relating to a vote of ,£5,000 granted last year to promote immigration. I find that of that sum ,£150 has been paid to the New South Wales branch of the Immigration League of Australia, of which Dr Arthur is president- a branch which issued a statement of the resources of Australia so optimistic an efthat some honourable members seemed to think that it verged upon the inaccurate. A further sum of .£100 was said by the ex-Treasurer, the right honourable member for Swan, to have been paid to the Victorian branch, and I wish to point out to the Committee some of the misstatements circulated by the Victorian Settlement division of the Immigration League of Australia, of which the Prime Minister is president, and of which, I am sure, he knows nothing. There axe connected with it a number of gentlemen whose names are reputable, and who, I feel sure, would be ashamed to find an organization with which they were associated lending its name to misstatements contained in a pamphlet issued apparently with the object of inducing settlement. In the pamphlet I find the followingDo you know that from 1891 to the 31st December, 1906, Victoria has lost by net emigration, by sea (by excess of departures over arrivals) 77,068 persons, of whom 24,428 have emigrated to New Zealand? Do you know that Victoria is threatened with further losses in the immediate future, owing to land in the other States, and in the Northern Territory being made available for thousands of settlers? We have paid .£100 to a league which scatters statements of .this kind all over the Commonwealth. The pamphlet also contains the following paragraphWe must secure land for our own people in Victoria before land can be offered to immigrants. No immigration is possible to Victoria until the State Government has arranged for land for its own people.",57
501,Mr TUDOR,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,That is not a misstatement ?,58
502,Mr CROUCH,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,I hold that immigration to Victoria is possible/ and that the people of Victoria will be glad to receive immigrants.,58
503,Mr TUDOR,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,The other day the Victorian Government could not settle twenty-seven of them.,58
504,Mr CROUCH,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"They have settled hundreds. An immigration league which receives from - the Government a grant to assist its efforts to promote immigration to Australia is allowed to distribute pamphlets of this sort all over the world. We have in the pamphlet the further statementWe do not want our farmers' sons to be leaving Victoria. We believe emigration from a rich young country like Victoria is a symptom that there is something wrong, and we think the want of land is the root of the matter. want our farmers' sons to get land in Victoria, and to stay here and prosper. We do not want the land to remain uncultivated.' We want the land to be tilled, and to increase the production of Victoria. It proceeds to give a lot of information about the central districts surrounding Port Phillip Bay, and then states that the county of Grant, in which my electorate is situate, "" lost .7,655 of its population from 1871 to 1881."" As a matter of fact, from 1881 to.1891, as well as from 1891 to 1901, the population of that county increased.",58
505,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,Was that only the natural increase ?,58
506,Mr CROUCH,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Gran t county has gained in population in respect of two decades other than the one mentioned here. In a pamphlet, designed presumably to attract immigration to Victoria, we find special reference made to the only decade in which there has been a loss of population. It is also .stated that in the north-central district of Victoria, comprising Anglesey, Dalhousie, and Talbot, there has likewise bien a loss of population. The pamphlet is so ful l of shocking pessimistic statements that I do not think we could have done worse than spend ,£100 in this way. I find also the statement thatThe losses of population we have mentioned mean that instead of there being in these districts a natural increase of population, in the periods mentioned, there is a decline of population as shown by the census returns, from which thesesaddening particulars have been taken. 'Tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed, That it should come to this : This should not be. It is not the aged, the feeble, the vicious, or the weak who are leaving Victoria. The policy of emigration from Victoria, however hidden and unconfessed, exposes itself in its workings. It is the 'young men and women taught in our State schools. It is the strong, the daring, the enterprising, the robust, who are leaving, and who marry and settle down in other lands. The marriage rate in Victoria is below the average for Australia, and the average for Australia is lower than in the following twelve countries of Europe : - Hungary , Spain, German - Empire, Belgium, Austria, England and Wales, France, Holland Switzerland, Denmark, Scotland, and Italy. The birth rate in Victoria is lower than in any Australian State (except South Australia, which is slightly lower), . and lower than New Zealand. And the average birth rate in Australia is lower than in any of the European countries (1002), except Ireland and France.",58

We have heard many that farmers have to leave Victoria to ' obtain land. In that respect, I believe that the pamphlet is on right lines, and do not at all complain of the alleged misrepresentations as the honourable member for Corio has done. I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer to a matter which I brought under his notice some time told ago.

518,Mr WEBSTER,CONSUMPTION AND MANUFACTURE OF,"Gwydir) [9.21] - I allow the opportunity to pass without directing attention to the matter of paying funds voted by this Parliament for asspecific purposes, 'to outside organiParliament voted .£5,000 for encouragement of immigration. of that sum money has been paid to Immigration Leagues in Victoria and New South'Wales. I do not object to being spent for the purpose of encouraging legitimate' immigration in an and truthful manner. But I do object to the money of the Commonwealth, for a specific purpose, being applied to what I must describe as a scandalous misrepresentation of the actual state of affairs, at least in some of the States. A letter written by Dr Arthur has 'already been quoted. That letter was not creditable to him as a man, and certainly it was very discreditable to the institution of which he is president. I intend to read it again. It was written to Mr Marshall Lyle, of Melbourne, by way of instruction to himas to what he .should and should not do in regard to the immigration movement. The letter saidWe are putting; boxes on the Himalaya, and Medic, both leaving today. Can you clo the same, or get your Government to do so? This is a splendid work, which requires to be organized. All these hundreds of passengers are potential immigration agents. Don't mix up immigration and land settlement in your pamphlet. In fact, rather issue two. In the immigration book everything must be couleur de rose. No hint of difficulty about getting land. You need not be afraid you will be rushed, liven when Queensland offered cheap farms in London, there was only one applicant. As regards land settlement for home (Victorian) consumption, you can be as pessimistic and as indignant as you please. The blacker the better, though don't get too much on the line, ""What is the use of having the immigrants here, when we have nothing to offer them."" That would choke off subscriptions. The only purpose for which the Immigrathe land. tion League seems to be run is to obtain subscriptions and keep going a movement that is not in the interests of the people of AustraliaAnyhow, don't do anything to frighten off immigrants, because competition for them is so keen in Europe, and even if conditions change for the better in Victoria you might find that it was of no avail, as you had given the place a bad reputation. That, in my opinion, is a clear indication that £150 has been paid over without any inquiry as to the method of the organization, or as to the object which the organization may have in view. But there is something stronger yet, in the way of corroboration and condemnation. I have here a letter, copied from the Barry Dock News, South Wales, as followsNA SOUTH WALES. To the Editor of The Barry Dock News. Dear Sir,-There is a great demand at present, and will be for some time to come, for miners of all kinds, and pick and shovel men, in New South Wales. There has been such an expansion in the coal trade that hundreds of miners aTe needed at the various collieries on the North and South Coasts. There the wages are from 8s. a day upwards, men sometimes making 12s. or 15s. a day. But all the other kinds of mining need men also. Two thousand miners are required at Broken Hill , several hundreds at the Cobar Copper Mines, at from ns. to 22s. a day, and small mines all over the country whether they be copper or gold 01 tin are advertising for men. Again, the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is asking for some hundred, men for railway construction, and will soon be requiring an equal number of shale miners. The land at which this Corporation is operating is about 120 miles from Sydney, N.S.W., and good men may be certain of permanent work there. The New South Wales Government is also 'commencing the construction of a railway of over 300 miles in length, the cost of which is estimated at about three million pounds. This line will take five years to construct, so that continuous work can be guaranteed. Men, therefore, who are accustomed to the pick and shovel, and who understand blasting, and rockbutting, need have no hesitation to come to New South Wales, as the prospects offered them are better than anywhere else. The New South Wales Government is offering liberal assisted passages to miners and labourers. A number of Scotch and Welsh miners have already arrived, and others are expected. I have always understood that the object of the New South Wales Government was to induce people to place themselves on the land; but it would appear, from what I have read, that the principal object is to invite immigrants to enter into competition with all except those who are engaged on I shall be glad to supply further particulars if letters are addressed to me at the Immigration League of Australia, Sydney, Australia; or our London agent, at 36 King William-street, E.C., may be written to - Yours , etc., RICHARD ARTHUR, M . D . , President, The Immigration League of Australia. There could be nothing stronger than that in the way of wholesale misrepresentation as to the state of affairs in New South Wales. We have the letter from Mr Marshall Lyle advising that, gentleman not to mix up the 'land question with that of immigration, and then we have the other, setting out that there is work galore in every other occupation, except that involved in land settlement. But even that is not all. 1I have here a letter from the Intelligence Bureau of New South Wales-the bureau to which the Premier of New South Wales wrote asking for help to dispose of immigrants about to arrive.",59
519,Mr FISHER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Is' this the Immigration League to which the late Treasurer gave £*5<>r,60

The following is the letter written by direction of the Premier of New South WalesIntelligence Department, Phillip and Bridge Streets, Sir, I have the honour, by direction from the Premier, to bring the following matters under your kindly notice. In view of the increasing numbers of grants that are now arriving week by week, have to use every means to get into touch with employers of labour in the country districts who may be able and willing to take such immigrants and supply them with different classes work. We have got into touch with large numbers of pastoralists, farmers and other employers who have intimated their requirements from time to time, but unfortunately we find that we frequently not able to supply the exact class labour needed at the time, and when it arrives in due course the vacancy may not exist. have therefore found it necessary to take some steps to secure an immigration officer in each the hundred leading towns of this State, would inform this Department of any demand for labour in his district, and also receive,, despatch and advise where necessary any new arrival in search of work. If we knew there was a fair demand for labour of tain class in any district, we might then safely send a certain number of immigrants to the migration officer there with the confident hope that they would be duly placed, although might riot be able to indicate the exact ployer to whom we were despatching each migrant. I recognize very f u l ly that your officers already so many multifarious duties that with the utmost reluctance I felt myself compelled to ask the Premier to allow me quest you to authorize your officers to undertake another one, but in view of the fact that impossible to get sufficient services from vate persons in many districts, and that no other class of public officers can do this work so I feel emboldened to trespass again upon kindness in the event of your being able to the officers in the chief districts to assist way. The Premier has approved of an honorarium of ios. each for every immigrant received headquarters, and suitably provided with ployment through the agency of such officers. I have been authorized also to ask all Government Departments who have officers in country towns to urge such officers to keep touch with the Police Department, and inform the local representative of that Department all cases which come under their notice where immigrants can be effectively, placed in rural labour. I therefore would express the that you will be able to assist in the way cated by allowing your country officers to take the duty of reporting to me any of employment for immigrants as agricultural labourers, mechanics, miners, or labourers, to receive any immigrants despatched to the country by this Department, and to help way to get suitable employment.

If a policeman has to waste his time asking employers, whether they have work available for immigrants who may arrive, but about whom he knows nothing personally, he will not have time for the duties which.he undertook to perform when he took his oath of office. The honourable member for West Sydney has some knowledge of Dr Arthur, having been, I believe, associated - with him in some matter, so that he speaks with authority and knowledge which I must respect. The state of affairs that has been revealed should not be tolerated by this Committee or by a Treasurer having control of the public funds. I trust that it will be made public, so that the people of New South Wales may learn, not only '.what these men are doing under the garb of an Immigration League, but what they are doing in the interests of another class of people for whom they are working. They profess to be actuated by a desire to populate Australia with the right class of people, and, while getting subscriptions to the League for that purpose, they use the money to deceive the Britishpublic, and to degrade - the public sentiment of Australia. I have read those striking extracts so that, when sums are being voted for immigration in the future-a n amount of .£20,000 appears on the Estimates-inChief for the purpose-w e may indicate clearly and unmistakably that no more money is to be expended in this way unless the Government have direct control, and that none shall be given to an irresponsible League to advertise a state of affairs that does not exist in Australia.",62
526,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Newcastle) [9.44] I believe that Parliament voted ,£5,000 last year for the purpose of advertising Australia, but not necessarily to be spent directly to bring out any particular class of immigrants. We find now that some of the money has been given to people who are quite irresponsible- I say it with all respect-so far as concerns the spending of Government funds. On the one hand, we have a complaint from the honourable member for Corio, that one branch which has received some of the money will not keep certain facts back, while on the other hand there has been a general comquoted plaint that another branch of the so called Immigration League have been so misrepresenting the position in Australia as practically to have misapplied the money that was given them by the ex-Treasurer for the purpose of advertising the Commonwealth. Quite a number of these advertisements, which have' been spread throughout the industrial centres of England, were sent to me today. The position of the coal mining industry in New South Wales has, at the instigation of the Premier of the State, been inquired into by the head of the Labour Department there, and, after an exhaustive investigation, he has been forced to admit that the supply of labour is equal to the demand. He adds the forecast-thoug h in this I regard him as treading on very dangerous ground-that during the next twelve months perhaps 1,000 men may be absorbed. I have as intimate a knowledge of coal mining as is possessed by any man in this country, and I say that, if everything goes well with the coal trade for the next twelve months, and the output is doubled, openings may be afforded for the employment of a large number of additional men. But at the present time men who have arrived in our coal mining districts from the old world are absolutely disappointed with the conditions with which they have been met, and regard the promises made to them as unfulfilled, the fact being that, if no employment were given to the local labour now looking for work, the - utmost endeavour could not find places for more than fifty additional hands. Do not these facts give the lie to the statements made by those in responsible positions in the State that hundreds of men can be employed in various avocations? The adoption of the methods referred to by the honourable, member for Gwydir to secure work for the immigrants now here shows that the State authorities are at-straits to fulfil their promises. If there were employment for 2,000 men at Broken Hill, and for another 2,000 in the Newcastle and Maitland districts, what need would there be to use all the Departments of the State to endeavour to find work for those who .have come here? The efforts which are being made to secure openings for immigrants show that employment is not so easily obtained as has been made to appear. We have no right, when attempting to attract desirable immigrants to Australia, to hide the condition of things here. Last year this Parliament voted £5,000 to advertise the Commonwealth abroad, and this year it is proposed to vote £20,000. I say, let the truth be told when advertising our resources.",62
527,Mr CROUCH,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,The whole truth j not only statements likely to injure the Commonwealth.,63
528,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I wish the whole truth to be told; I have no desire to injure the Commonwealth. I question if the honourable member has attempted to ascertain whether he or anyone else could get a block of land in Victoria if he sought for it. In New South Wales, on an average from 300 to 400 persons apply for every block of land that is put up for ballot. While the members of the party to which I belong have no objection to immigrants sharing our good things, we say that we should put our house jn order before inviting others to come here, and should make land accessible to our own people as well as to others.",63

534,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"That does not make them any better in themselves. Does the honourable member think that we should help those who seek to encourage, not general immigration,' but the bringing here of parties of workmen for whom there is no employment ?",63
535,Mr CROUCH,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I do not.,63
536,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Has the honourable member read that hundreds of young Victorian farmers have gone to other States because they could not get land here ? That being so, should not something be done to improve the land laws of this State, and of other States where the conditions are almost equally as bad? Does he not believe in opening up the waste lands of the country ? When that has been done, we shall be in a position to share our good things with the people of the whole world.",63
537,Mr SAMPSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,How does the honourable member account for the fact that the last block of land thrown open for selection by the Victorian Closer Settlement Board was not fully applied for?.,63
538,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"If the Victorian experience resembles that of New South Wales, the cost of resumption was so high that the Government is compelled to ask more for the land than it is really worth.",63
539,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Ye t the honourable member says that there are 200 or 300 applicants for every block that' is offered by ballot.,63
540,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"That statement is absolutely correct. Mf. FOSTER - In one case, there were 800 applicants for three blocks.",63
541,Mr CROUCH,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,How would the honourable member have the land resumed? Should not the Government pay for it at its proper price ?,63
542,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,It should be resumed on a fair valuation.,63
543,Mr BOWDEN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,That is what is done. .,63

545,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"It is a new thing to hear of private persons selling land to the Government for less than they could obtainat public auction. I hold that, as it is being proposed' to vote money to advertise the resources of Australia, we have a right to control its expenditure, and should not leave the matter to irresponsible authorities, by whom the money may be used for purposes other than we intend. We have a right to know from the Acting Prime Minister whether any money will be spent out of the Treasurer's advance to pay for advertising.",63
546,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The Treasurer's advance vote has nothing to do with this matter. . Mr WATKINS - The £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 which we are asked to vote as an advance to the Treasurer may be used for this or any other purpose.",64

Mr KELLY - In dealing with the Supply Bill , we have a right to discuss any matter affecting the policy of the Government. . Mr WATKINS - Yes ; but as the Acting Prime Minister has given me the assurance that nothing will be spent out of the Treasurer's advance for advertising abroad, I am content to let the further discussion of this matter stand over until the Estimates come before us.",64
548,Mr HUTCHISON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Hindmarsh) [9.55]. - There is one very important matter on which I should like to get some information from the Treasurer, and that is whether under the experimental imposition of Excise duties on agricultural machinery the rates of wages paid by the manufacturers are the standard rates of wages in the district. So far as I can find out there seems to be a general impression in South Australia that the experiment is hot working as was anticipated. told that some employers are evading the award of the Arbitration Court. Of course we shall know all about that when the return which I moved 'for the other day is furnished, and the Minister has been kind enough to say that it will be made available at the earliest moment. know what steps have been taken to protect the revenue; what amount of Excise duty has been collected, and what method has been adopted. should be very glad to know whether any obstruction has been put in the way of officers getting all the information which they are entitled to obtain for the Department. I do not desire to delay the passing of the Supply Bill any longer, provided that the Minister is prepared to give us the information on the points which have been raised by honourable members, and also in connection with the collection of Excise duties on agricultural machinery.",64
549,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Wentworth) [9.57] - I only rise for the purpose of asking the Acting Prime Minister whether he has an answer to give to the honourable member for Coolgardie.,64
550,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Yes , when I get a chance to speak.",64
551,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I am willing .to give the honourable gentleman a chance now.,64
552,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I want to listen to what other honourable members have to say before I speak.,64
553,Mr FOSTER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"New England) [9.58] I am very pleased that the honourable member for Gwydir has brought up the question of immigration. I trust that before more money is expended in that direction the Commonwealth Government will look into the matter, and have it put on a proper basis. It has been stated that the Premier of New South Wales has offered so much money to the police to get billets for immigrants. I was credibly informed more than two months ago that not one shilling but ten shillings per head was to be given to the police for each immigrant who was provided with employment. Knowing of the existence of that offer a young man in Sydney asked me to get him employment. I took him to the Intelligence Department and asked the authorities if they could find him a billet. They asked, "" Is he an immigrant?"" I replied "" No. He is a young Australian of good character and ability, who is out of work."" Thereupon they said "" We are not a labour bureau to get work for unemployed Australians. If he were an immigrant we I am would try to get work for him . """,64
554,Mr HUTCHISON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Australian s are not wanted.,64
555,Mr FOSTER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Exactly . While I do not object to the Government finding employment for every immigrant, I think it I want to would be a good thing if they would take it upon themselves to find employment for every man who cannot get work. Unemployed men are no good to the community. I Men should always be at work, and if it is impossible for a man to find work, the Government should do their best to find it for him. What I protest against-is that an office should be run at a large expense, and that a sum should be paid to the police to find employment for immigrants, - while our own men are deliberately refused help.' It constitutes quite a scandal. In my opinion the position as disclosed by the letter from Dr Arthur .and others is a disgrace.  been informed that the consequence of the imposition of Excise duties on agricultural machinery has been that a number of farmers in South Australia have been charged £ 2 9 for a plough, which in the previous year was offered at .£24, d a n ,£37 for a plough which in the previous year was offered at £ 3 2 . The manufacturers, through their agents, have alleged throughout the State that the increased prices are consequent upon the Excise duties which they have had to pay upon the machinery. Since I came to Melbourne, I have ascertained that those firms appear' on the schedule of firms exempted under the order of Mr JusticeO'Connor from paying Excise duties. I ask the Minister, before we begin the consideration of the Tariff, to instruct his officers to call upon each firm to produce their catalogue of prices for last year, as well as for this year. If , from a comparison of the catalogues, it should be found that my statement is correct, then it will be clear evidence that the firms have been deliberately robbing the farmers of the increase in the prices under the excuse that they had been charged Excise duties. Not only have they done that, but they have credited this Parliament with having done something which has made the cost of the machinery much dearer to the primary producer. I think it is the duty of the. Minister to have the matter investigated thoroughly before we proceed to consider the Tariff, so that we may know how to deal with these manufacturers.",64
556,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Wentworth) [10.2] - I rather regret the attitude which the Acting Prime Minister seems to take up on this question.,65
557,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I am taking up a very quiet attitude.,65
558,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The - honourable gentleman is very quiet indeed, and so far as I can see, he is absolutely unconcerned.",65
559,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Not a bit.,65
560,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"My honourable friends of the Labour Party can roar at the opening of this sitting, and coo at the end of They can start like roaring lions, and finish like sucking doves, and still the honourable gentleman seems unconcerned. What I desire him to do on future occasionsis to give an answer, if possible, to each complaint as it is made.",65
561,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Not as each complaint is made, but after all the complaints have been submitted.",65
562,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Of course, it is much simpler to the honourable gentleman to deal with the complaints together. There was a time when my honourable Socialist friends seemed almost readyto break their leashes. They have had their roaring, but now they are all tame again. The honourable member for Coolgardie started with a proposition to come over to - the Opposition if a certain demand which he made to 'the Minister were notimmediately acceded to, but he is like all my honourable friends of the Labour Party who- I am not easting any reflection on them-rathe r remind ""me of cockatoos in captivity. They can shriek, and make a terrible row on their perches, but they all have chains on their legs. I do not see now a sign of the attitude with which they started the proceedings.",65
563,Mr FRAZER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,It is better to be a cockatoo than a monkey.,65
564,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I am glad that the honourable member has a menagerie in the corner. I give him credit for every sort of species. Any one who has witnessed the performance this evening can understand that these honourable members are only speaking to their constituents, but whether they say this or that,' the Minister can sit in the chair, and do as he pleases. The majority of the honourable members supporting the Government have actually no power in the Chamber now. However, that is only by the way. What I desire to ask the Treasurer is, what explanation there is of the position put by the honourable member for Coolgardie? The position is a very difficult one, I admit.",65
565,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I am going to give an explanation, difficult as it may be, if the honourable gentleman will give me an opportunity.",65
566,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I hope that the Acting Prime Minister does not think that his explanation will close the discussion, because, unless it is satisfactory, it will be the duty of this Committee to thoroughly canvass the matter. We are now asked to give the it. Government a free hand for three months. If they have misapplied the public funds in the past, that fact should constitute a serious bar to our granting them control over the expenditure of similar sums the future. I am glad that the Acting Prime Minister ' is about to heed' the anger exhibited by the honourable member for Coolgardie by giving a belated explanation of the expenditure upon the item to which he referred.",65
567,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Trea surer) [ro.6] - I am glad that the honourable member has given me an opportunity,65
568,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,The fact of the Acting Prime Minister speaking now will not close the debate?,66
569,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"It will not close the debate, although I hope to finish it to-night. In reply to the honourable member for Kooyong, I wish to say that the Minister.of Trade and Customs has not yet dealt with the matter of what action shall be taken in respect of importations landed at ports other than the first port of call by vessels in Australian waters when the Tariff was introduced. The Government have no desire to act harshly.",66
570,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,The course suggested was not adopted on the last occasion.,66
571,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I am aware of that. If the honourable member will only contain himself for a few minutes,66
572,Mr WATKINS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I shall have something to say upon the matter.,66
573,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The question will be considered probably tomorrow. I can make no promise at all, because it is quite impossible, in anv circumstances, to return any of the money which has been paid by way of duty where the packages have been broken.",66
574,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Will the Acting Prime Minister promise to consider the matter quickly?,66
575,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"That is exactly what I am doing. Personally, my desire is that no injury shall be done by accident, if I may so put it, to those persons who were unfortunate enough to have goods in transit between certain ports in Australia when the Tariff was introduced. But whether that injury can be prevented by the administration of the Department is a matter about which I am not certain.",66
576,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Will the question be dealt with speedilv?,66
577,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I shall ask my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, to deal with it as early as possible.",66
578,Mr FRAZER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Will the Acting Prime Minister recommend that it be dealt with by Act of Parliament instead of upon Ministerial authority?,66
579,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,That is not possible.,66
580,Mr FRAZER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,It is possible.,66
581,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"It is not practicable. If the old rates of duty are to be charged, they must be collected before the packages are broken, or not at all. That practice has not prevailed in the past, although it was followed in nearly every State.  the old Tariff be collected upon these goods, what guarantee shall we have that the consumers will not afterwards be called upon to pay the higher rates?",66
582,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I quite admit that that is the point. I cannot say more than that I will consult the Minister of Trade and. Customs tomorrow, and the matter will be decided as quickly as possible.",66
583,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,What constitutional authority have the Government for retaining money which the Parliament has not authorized them to collect?,66
584,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"That would be a matter for the opinion of the Crown Solicitor to whom it would be referred. In regard to the matter of the Excise duties on machinery, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I wish to say that before I relinquished Ministerial control of the Department of Trade and Customs, I gave instructions that the Excise duties were to be collected from all manufacturers who committed a breach of the regulations. Probably proceedings are very far advanced by now.",66
585,Mr HUTCHISON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Ough t not the Excise duties to have been collected by this time?,66
586,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"If there has been any breach probably it has been collected, but it can only be collected where there has been a proved breach.",66
587,Mr TUDOR,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Where they do not pay the standard rate of wages ?,66
588,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Where there' has been a breach of the law. I understood that the cases referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the honourable member for Grey were those of firms who were exempt from the payment of the duty by the direction of the Judge of the Arbitration Court-firm s who have added to the cost of their machinery, charges which they were not entitled to add under the law. That, of course, is a different phase of the question altogether, and I shall ask the Minister to have it investigated as early as possible. I recognise that the position should be"" known so that we may understand how this scheme of Excise duties works before we submit a proposal to continue it, or to substitute something for it. The ,£20,000 upon the Estimates, to which frequent reference has been made, represents the Treasurer's advance. It is intended to cover the conveyance of mails, and the payment of various officers.",66
589,Mr FRAZER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,What mails?,67
590,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,It is intended to cover contingencies connected with the conveyance of mails-contingencie s which crop up every day.,67
591,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,But large sums'of moneyhave previously been voted .for the purpose of covering contingencies.,67
592,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I am speaking of contingencies based upon the contingencies of last year. The amount of £20,000 is designed to cover contingencies connected with the conveyance of mails, the purchase of instruments and books, and a number of other things. There is one item which is very important. My predecessor in office declined to pay out of the Treasurer's ad- vance increments upon salaries in excess of £110 a year. I propose to pay increments upon salaries up to ,£160, which represents the maximum of the fifth class. If the Treasurer's advance can be used to pay legitimate and approved salaries up to £110 a year, it is unfair that the fund should not be used, to pay increments on salaries up to .£160.",67
593,Mr FRAZER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Do these increments represent arrears?,67
594,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Yes . There is no reason why they should not be paid.,67
595,Mr TUDOR,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Othe r Treasurers- with . the exception of the late Treasurer-hav e paid them..,67
596,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I propose to do what the honourable member has urged in numerous questions.,67
597,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Will the Acting Prime ""-Minister explain the complaint of the honourable member for Coolgardie?",67
598,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I shall. When the expenditure of .£1,000 upon the Women's Work Exhibition was first mentioned by the honourable member for Coolgardie, I knew nothing whatever about it. It so happened that I was absent when action was taken in this connection. I understand, however, that the late Treasurer remitted the sum of ,£1,000 to London with which to pay freight charges upon goods intended for this exhibition in which Lady Northcote takes a great interest. Mr ""AUSTIN CHAPMAN - It is an exhibition that will do Australia a great deal of good. ;",67
599,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The Peninsular and Oriental Company have agreed to bring all goods which are sent from the Continent to England-to defraying the freight charges upon which this money was to be devoted-to Australia, where the exhibition is to be held, free of cost.",67
600,Mr WILKS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The Treasurer paid the £1,000 out of a vote?",67
601,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I did not pay anything. I expect that the late Treasurer paid it out of the Treasurer's advance. I wish to say further that the amount that was remitted last year was charged to the Treasurer's advance, and will appear on the Supply Estimates of 1906-7. That is the information I have in reference to the matter.",67
602,Mr FRAZER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Does the honourable gentleman think that, a debatable vote like that should be paid out of the Treasurer's advance ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE,- I should not like to answer a question concerning the action of my late colleague. The late Treasurer thought he was justified in what he did, and I am also inclined to think that where it is clear that good may be done to Australia by an exhibition, it might be left to the discretion of the Treasurer to assist a movement of the kind when there is no opportunity to consult Parliament in the matter.",67
603,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"In fact, the Treasurer would do the same himself if the occasion arose. : Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I shall not answer problematical questions, but I am prepared to take all the responsibility I am called upon to take for anything I do.",67
604,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,The honourable gentleman will surely stand by what his late colleague did.,67
605,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I am standing by it now. As a matter of fact, the item does not appear on the Estimates for this year. It is not covered by the SupplyBill we are now seeking to introduce, and if the point were taken, I think it would be held that it is scarcely in order to discuss the subject. When the Budget comes on, or when the Estimates are before honourable members, will be the time to deal with the question. With respect to the ,£25,000 deposit in connection with the cancelled mail contract, _ I may tell honourable members that everything that it is possible to do in regard to that matter is being done to make the persons responsible comply with their legal liability. The Crown Solicitor has had the matter in hand. Honourable members, I believe, are quite aware that nothing will be left undone to make those people pay the' £25,000, and probably, also, to cover any loss which may have arisen in connection with the contract.",67
606,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I do not think much of the honourable gentleman's chance of getting a farthing.,68
607,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The honourable member does not know much 'about it , or he would be aware that our chance of getting the £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 is exceedingly good. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not think that I have omitted to reply to any of the questions asked me. I hope honourable members will allow the Supply Bill to go through as soon as possible, as I have no wish to sit late to-night.",68
608,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I do not think the Minister should try to force the Bill through to-night. There are items of expenditure to be discussed. ' Mr WILSON (Corangamite) [10.20] - I have listened to the various questions raised by honourable members, and to the Minister's reply. I cannot help thinking that the position taken up by the honourable members for Wide Bay and Dalley is the correct position. Honourable members generally are desirous of seeing the Tariff proposals dealt with as soon as possible. _ Until a final decision has been come to with respect to them, the trade of the Commonwealth must continue to be dislocated.

610,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"On the other hand, 1 believe it is not right that we should conduct our business in such a slipshod manner as to grant three months' Supply to the Government.»",68
611,Mr MALONEY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Le t the honourable member move a vote of want of confidence.,68
612,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Let honourable members opposite move such a vote, and cease talking about it .",68
613,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The honourable member for Melbourne does a lot of "" squealing "" about want of confidence votes. While he might say that the Government have no right to do what they propose to do, when it came to a question of voting the honourable member would find himself "" drawn by the wire,"" and his previous statements would go for nothing. The proper procedure is to grant one month's Supply, and no more. At the end of the month the Treasurer would have to come down for a further grant of Supply, and that would be a pleasant interlude in the Tariff debate. I am prepared to support any motion to the' effect that we should grant one month's Supply only. The honourable member for Kooyong and several other honourable members have asked what the Minister of Trade and Customs proposes to do with respect to ships about to arrive and ships that have arrived at an Australian port. I look upon the question raised as one of very serious moment, because merchants throughout Australia have at this moment cleared out of bond large stocks of tobacco and goods of various kinds, and are charging the public full prices for these goods as though they had paid duty on them in accordance with the new Tariff.",68
614,Mr HUTCHISON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,They are charging more.,68
615,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,In some instances they are charging twice as much as the increased duty.,68
616,Mr TUDOR,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,And three times as much.,68
617,Mr THOMAS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I thought everything was cheaper under protection?,68
618,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,On some items in which the duty leviable under the new Tariff represents an increase of 6d. per lb. the merchants are now charging an increase of from 9d. to IS. per lb. to the consumer.,68
619,Mr TUDOR,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,-In some cases where the duty has been increased by 3d. the price has been raised by 6d.,68
620,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,That is so. also the Mr THOMAS - That is a good free-trade argument.,68
621,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"If it is a free-trade argument the honourable member for Yarra agrees with me on the point. They are charging these increased prices upon goods that have never paid the increased duty, and thereby, I will not say the public are being robbed, but extortion is being practised upon them. If the Minister of Trade and Customs rules that ships about to arrive, and ships that have touched at one port in Australia, are to be allowed to land their cargoes at the old Tariff rates, the consumers will, still be charged the increased duties on the new scale proposed for the goods brought in those ships. That would not be. fair to the people. The - Minister of Trade and Customs should look very carefully into the matter before he accedes to the request or"" the merchants. Only yesterday I heard that one firm expects, on account of goods which they have already in hand, and on which duty has been paid at the old rates, to make £[20,000.",68
622,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Are they going to put the prices up ?,68
623,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,The prices are up. Has the Minister bought nothing since the Tariff was laid on the table? have been put up since last Friday.,69
624,Mr CHANTER,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Price s have been put up and in some instances in the case of goods on which there has been no increase of duty.,69
625,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Anothe r brother protectionist admits that prices have been put up because of the proposed increased duties. The matter is one which seriously affects people. The honourable member for Grey has pointed out a flagrant case affecting very seriously the primary producers. In order to insure the payment of fair rates of wages to the workers engaged in the agricultural implement making industry we imposed an Excise duty from which we decided that the manufacturers should be exempt if reasonable rates of wages were paid by them. As a matter of fact, although they have been exempted from that Excise duty, they have added it to the price which they charge the farmers for implements supplied to them. This has been going on in several of the States.",69
626,Mr TUDOR,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,A case as'to the rates of wages paid in Victoria has not yet come before Mr Justice O'Connor.,69
627,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,This shows at all events that the action taken by us has had a very serious effect upon users of agricultural implements. Any delay in settling the Tariff will mean a large weekly increase in the cost of living to every working man in Australia. The Minister says that if the Supply for which he asks be granted we shall be able to proceed uninterruptedly with the consideration of the Tariff. The passing of a month's Supplyis a very small matter.,69
628,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,The honourable member wishes to put off the settlement the Tariff.,69
629,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,That is not the quesmail tion. I have no belief in the protestamakingbondsmen. tions of the honourable member that he is we are not eager to proceed with the Tariff. To sit early adjournment from 7.45 p.m. until 10.30 once a month in order to grant Supply would be a very must small matter.,69
630,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Would the honormost able member be so eager to settle the Tariff if he were in the Minister's place?,69
631,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,That is a question that I have not had an opportunity to termine.,69
632,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,And the honourable member will not have an opportunity Prices of goods for many years.,69
633,Mr THOMAS,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,The Minister should not be too sure about that.,69
634,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I do not thank the honourable member for anything at all events.,69
635,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"When we reach clause 2 of the Bill I shall move an amendment providing that only one month's Supply be the granted. I do not desire that my amendment shall be regarded as a motion of want of confidence. Honourable members may laugh, but all that I want to insure is honest business procedure.",69
636,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,If honourable members opposite will not grant us Supply they will soon have a chance to have some other party in office.,69
637,Mr WILSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"On e month's Supply should be quite sufficient to grant at a time, and when the Bill is in Committee I shall move in the direction I have indicated.",69
638,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Wentworth) [10.29] May I suggest to the Minister that this is a convenient hour to adjourn?,69
639,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The honourable member may make such a suggestion, but we shall not adopt it.",69
640,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I hope that the Minister will not take up this attitude. The Committee has debated this question very reasonably.,69
641,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Is the honourable member speaking for the Opposition?,69
642,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Most of the discussion tonight has come from alleged supporters of the Government.,69
643,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Is the honourable member making a threat on behalf of the Opposition ?,69
644,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I am making no threat. From his attitude, one would almost imaof gine that the honourable gentleman was trying to coax the .£25,000 which has been so often referred to out of the defaulting The Opposition are only a reasonable request; but if to be allowed the comfort of the usual on Tuesdays, we carry on the discussion. The honourable member for Corangamite has raised a number of interesting questions, and the important point with which he has dealt is that relating to refunds of duty. The Treasurer has said that monevs collected in excess of the rates ultimately deagreed to by the Parliament could hardly be refunded to the importers. The consideration which weighs very heavily with me, and, I think, will weigh with other honourable members; however, is that we are concerned, not with the question of whether or not an importer does his duty by his customers, but whether we do our duty by those who send us here, and our duty, so far as it lies within our power, under the Constitution. Honourable members will find that the Constitution provides that no money shall be appropriated to the Crown except with the consent of this House. The imposition of a duty is an appropriation of the people's money; and if this House, after the message, refuses to endorse that appropriation, a refund should be made of all moneys collected under a misapprehension on the part of the Minister that the House would endorse the duties originally proposed by him. .",69
645,Mr WATSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,How can we return the consumers the excess duty paid ?,70
646,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"That is a very difficult question, and, so far as the rough equity of the case is concerned, I should not be very much troubled about the refunding of any particular sum collected in excess of any duty ultimately imposed by the Parliament. But we have our duty as interpreters of the Constitution under which we work, and I think that the honourable member for South Sydney would be the first to admit that under the Constitution a Minister has not the power to impose taxation upon the people of Australia without the consent of this House.  done.",70
647,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I think that the position in regard to the first Federal Tariff was different. When the original Tariff was before the House, we were trying to determine what really were the burdens upon the backs of the majority of the people of Australia - There were in operation in Australia at the time six separate Tariffs, and it was very difficult for the Chair then to interpret what was and what was not a new burden on the people. In this instance, however, we know that there was a uniform Federal Tariff in operation prior to that now before the House, and that that Tariff has been increased on a message from the Crown. If we do not endorse the increase of a duty, and yet allow the Crown to take the revenue resulting from its own action, we shall practically give up to the Ministry our control of the taxation of the Commonwealth. That is a very serious thing to contemplate. I admit that I should very much prefer some means - if means could be devised-whereb y the consumers could obtain the benefit of any ref und, but in any event our duty under the Constitution is to see that the Crown is not allowed to tax the people of Australia without the consent of this House.  careful to see that, the importers do not rob the people outside.",70
648,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"That is a question between the importer and the consumer, the importance of which I have no desire to minimize.",70
649,Mr HUTCHISON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,It is as much our duty to see that people act honestly as it is'to make refunds of excess duty paid.,70
650,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"It is our business, but our first duty is to see that the Crown does not raise funds without our consent. to Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Our first duty is to avoid giving people outside a motive to be dishonest.",70
651,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"We must seriously consider this subject before we express an ex parte opinion upon it. So far as my personal inclinations are concerned, I have no desire that refunds shall be made to importers who, as the result of increased duties, subsequently reduced by Parliament, have made a profit out of their customers. But every member of this House must endeavour to honour the oath to uphold the Constitution that we took in entering Parliament. One of the first principles of the Constitution is that this House shall have the control and the initiation of expenditure. I suggest to the Minister that I have shown__good reason why the debate should now be adjourned until tomorrow. With his consent, I should like to move. that progress be reported.",70
652,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Whic h consent the honourable member will not get.,70
653,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"The honourable gentleman is very unreasonable. No good purpose can be served by pushing the Bill through to-night. Will the Minister tell us what he expects to have done to-night, so that we may be saved from sitting for an indefinite time?",70
654,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I will by-and-by.,70
655,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"There .are twenty-eight pages of items in this Bill , involving a total expenditure of £1,103,744. Does the Treasurer think that he ought to endeavour to force it through at this late hour? Australia, as a whole, recognises his intrinsic worth and determined virtue, but, at the same time, he is generally suspected of being slightly careless in money matters. That suspicion will gain considerable weight if be insists on pushing this Bill through to-night.",70
656,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Parramatta) [10.42] - It is unreasonable for the Government to endeavour to force through the Bill to-night. There is. no violent hurry about it. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I have to get the Bill passed into law by the 15th inst., and before it is passed it has to go to the S) ens. to",71
657,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"As far as I know, it would not take much time to deal with the Bill tomorrow. There are several items in it about which honourable members may reasonably require information. There is, for instance, a vote for the Commonwealth Office in London. The Treasurer has' told us that there is nothing in the Bill but what is in conformity with last year's Estimates. But I find that there is a vote for ,£250 on account of salaries for the Commonwealth Office, amounting to one-half of the total salaries for the year. There is also an item of £1,800 for contingencies on account of the same office, whereas the total amount expendedlast year was £1,040. object to this expenditure unless some adequate explanation of it is given. This is one of the items about which there may reasonably be discussion. We can also legitimately discuss the conduct of the Commonwealth Office in London. A large number of members desire to criticise very severely tbj recent doings of that office, and I do not think that the Minister ought to attempt to bludgeon the Bill through in this way. I promise that if there be an adjournment, there shall be no unnecessary delay in regard to this measure; but there - is a reasonable desire to discuss one or two of the items.",71
658,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Wentworth) [10.46] - The Treasurer is asking honourable members to make a very serious concession if he desires to pass this Bill through all its stages in two days. There are, I suppose, half-adozen stages, at any one of which the Bill might be blocked for a day by a single member; and yet the Treasurer is prepared to make us sit up all night to suit his convenience.",71
659,Mr HUTCHISON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,We might have discussed a hundred items in the time the honourable member has been talking about nothing.,71
660,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"When I was saying nothing I was listening to the honourable member's eloquent remarks; and I hope he will give me credit for sincerity equal to his own. We are .told by the Treasurer that it is essential that the Bill should be passed before the 15th inst., but if the honourable gentleman is persistent, he will find that any single honourable member, as I have said, may thwart his wishes.",71
661,Mr SAMPSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I thought we were anxious to get on with the consideration of the Tariff. What is the use of wasting the time of the Committee?,71
662,Mr KELLY,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"I hope the honourable member will remember that when one is talking here about the proper passage ofmoney Bills, one is not used to be reminded by members of large experience about the waste of time. When the honourable member has been here a little longer, he will find that the control of the expenditure of the country is one of the most sacred trusts which we have to guard. I hope he will also remember that it is not customary for honourable members on the same side of the Chamber as a member addressing the Chair to-make flank attacks for the purpose even of gaining the popularity of his late enemies. However, I I urge on the Minister the advisability-eve n though it be a matter of small concern to the honourable member who interjected-of permitting honourable members to keep a close control of thefinancesof the country. I am sure honourable members will be only too glad to make the concession which the Treasurer asks, and pass the Bill at the earliest possible moment; but in return there must be some consideration of the rights of honourable members.",71
663,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Lang) [10.50] - It is customary on Tuesday night, when several honourable members have travelled long distances, to adjourn at about a quarter past ten o'clock; and I hope the Treasurer will not persevere in his determination to force the Bill through to-night. There are yet some honourable members on this side who desire to speak; and I think it would only be reasonable to adjourn; but if it be the intention to "" bullock"" the Bill through, then I am prepared to help to "" bullock "" it-in an opposite direction. If the Minister will not listen to reason, why should we be deprived of our undoubted right to deal with every item? The suggestion of the deputy-leader of the Opposition is one which will appeal to every fair-minded person; and if his appeal is unsuccessful, then the responsibility for any delay must rest on the Government themselves. there seems to be no response to the appeal, I may as well address myself to the items. In the first place, I object to the granting of three months' Supply, because it is a departure from all established practice, except to tide over a general election or some other emergency. What is the object of the Government I do not pretend to sav for certain; but, on the face of it, there appears to be a desire to secure themselves in the positions they now hold. In view the business before us, the Government having brought down such drastic Tariff proposals, it is difficult to say what may happen within the space of the next few days, not to say the next three months. I can very well understand that the Ministry may have been tempted to ask for three months' Supply, if only to guard themselves against the possibility of any anticipated-shal l I say accident?",71
664,Mr WATSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Will the honourable member express his opinion on the advisability of using the Standing Orders in a case like the present? I think they ought to be enforced. This is simply ridiculous.,72
665,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,I challenge honourable members on the other side to take steps to enforce the Standing Orders. Nothing would suit me better than to see the Standing Orders invoked when members of the Opposition are resisting the imposition of unjust taxation on the workers.,72
666,Mr WATSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Then the honourable member is addressing himself to the Tariff?,72
667,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"In opposing this Supply Bill , I have in mind the fact that the Government have brought down Tariff proposals which involve the workers of this country in an immense expenditure that.would otherwise have been saved to them. The proposals of the Government entail an increase in the burdens of the wage-earners, which I propose to resist to the utmost. If honourable members on the other side feel inclined to make use of the weapon which they have it in their power to use- I refer, of course, to the '' gag ' ' - I have no objection to being the first victim. It will not hurt me.",72
668,Mr WATSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,If they were all of my opinion they would shut the honourable member up very quickly.,72
669,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"If the honourable member for South Sydney has the courage 1803 of his convictions, all he has to do is to As move the motion himself; he should not leave it to another honourable member.",72
670,Mr WATSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,There is time enough yet. It will do in another hour or two.,72
671,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"On e honourable member can submit the necessary motion, and the honourable member for South Sydney, if he feels so inclined, can do it himself. Let him take action, instead of makingthreats to me, or suggestions to other honourable members. We are justified of inresisting any proposal to grant Supply to the Government, in view of the fact that they have just laid on the table of the House Estimates and Tariff proposals which involve . the mass of the people in an immense amount of taxation which they ought not to be called upon to bear. The Government in bringing down their proposal for three months' Supply,' evidently with the assured support of men who call themselves labour representatives, and who ought to be back-, ing up the workers, standing up for their rights, and defending them from unjust impositions, have' evidently counted noses beforehand. But the fact that, they have the numbers up - does not relieve the Opposition, especially the free trade section of it, of the duty of opposing by every legitimate means in their power such iniquitous and unjust imposts - The Tariff. proposals had no sooner been published in the press than the wholesale dealers throughout - Australia; - with* few exceptions, increased the cost to the retailers of / all the commodities they .handled. Numbers of retail shopkeepers have complained to me of the unjust treatment they have received. The prices of the goods supplied to them have been enormously increased, and they have been compelled, of course, to increase the prices to the consumer. The result was that on .Saturday,' the day on which shopkeepers expect to do more trade than onany ordinary day, many of ' them found their trade almost at a standstill. That is particularly the case with tobacconists and others in a small way of business, especially in the suburbs. The large houses in the city do not feel the pinch so much, because they have had the capital behind them to take their goods out of bond, and havemade in many cases a profit amounting to a. handsome fortune, because they had not paid a single farthing of the new duties, although they put up their prices just the same. I am speaking more parOne ticularly with regard to the unfortunate retailers in a smaller way of business, have to depend on the suburban trade for their living. The greatest injury will done to the poorest sections of the comthe munity, who cannot afford to pay enhanced prices for the necessaries of life. Hardnight, ship and deprivation of the most character will be entailed in many cases, but honourable members on the other the Chamber, especially those who profess to represent the wage-earning class, sit and smile complacently, prepared at same time to vote a wholly inexcusable three months' Supply to a Government attempt to place these crushingly heavy burdens on the backs of the unfortunate people.",72
672,Mr HUTCHISON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,Why do not the hontion orable member and his party put the Goservice vernment out?,73
673,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"If I had the power to put them out the Government would not be in office for five minutes longer. do those honourable members do who prate so much about their anxiety to insure better conditions for the workers and their wives and children? They do not attempt to censure the Government, although the moved. Government could not last a day without their support. But instead they aid them in their nefarious proposals to heap this quitous load of taxation upon the backs their fellow-workers. It is about time some explanation tomorrow. of the workers knew what their professed friends are doing. It transpires from admission by the Minister in regard to an item of £[1,000 for the Women's Work hibition, about which the honourable member for Coolgardie asked a question this after in noon, that the money has been given without the authority of Parliament. Governof ments have been turned out of office for much less than that.",73

The presence of this item is itself a sufficient reason for refusing to grant three months' Supply, and I could enumerate many others in regard to which a full explanation is 'needed. The sition would be very supine if it were to make no protest against such proposals. of our chief duties is to see that the Government has not too much money to who spend, and I , as a member of this party, was elected to act as one of the watchdogs be guarding' the public purse.

If a further expenditure under the same heading is to be justified we should have a statement from the Acting Prime Minister regarding the extent which the anticipations of those who originally proposed this subsidy .have been realized, and how far the Australian Tariff has operated to counteract the anticipated advantage of this expenditure. however, no such statement has been furnished.. Some time ago I asked for a return showing the extent to which' trade between the Commonwealth and the Islands had developed, but up to animals ? the present the desired information has not been forthcoming. Consequently honoranxious able members are in absolute ignorance of the trade which is being done with the Islands, and are not in a position to say - whether or not the expenditure of the; £3,000 which we are now asked to vote in this connection should be authorized. I . note that a sum of £[1,500 has been provided for the repatriation of Pacific Island-, ers. I wish to be informed how this money to be expended, and whether proper precautions have been taken to insure the pro-, of these Islanders upon being ref this turned to their homes. Numerous complaints have been made in this connection, and articles have been published in the newspapers alleging that certain of the Isupon being returned to-their homes have been killed. If it be known beforehand that a Pacific Islander will have his endangered if he is returned to his own a island, and if he prefers to be landed elsewhere, I think that his wishes should be acceded to as far as possible. Under the heading of Defence we are asked to vote considerable sums of money. Indeed, are a number-of items in this Department which will require a good deal of Personally I do not feel justified in sanctioning any of the items, the .which appear on the Defence Estimates until I have ascertained the intentions of for the Government in regard to the Naval. Very conflicting statements Minhave been made by the Prime Minister and other Ministers as to. what was done in Statements have appeared in the press indicating that prothe Prime Minister misrepresented the. opinion of Australia upon this matter. Yet we are asked to vote Supplies to retain the in office for at least three months without being afforded an. opportunity to receive an explanation upon this question from the Prime Minister.

Mr Mauger:-Does not the honourable member think that this is cruelty to",75
710,Mr JOHNSON,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"If the Minister is so on the score of humanity, I would' remind him that it is cruelty to saddle the taxpayers with the extra burdens which the Government desire to impose. Notwithstanding the repeated denials which have been made, I find that the Prime Minister did give the Home authorities to understand that Australia wished to terminate the Naval Agreement. Reference to the official reports of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference shows that the newspapers' statements in this connection are quite correct. I propose to quote a few extracts from the speeches of the Prime Minister and"" Lord Tweedmouth, which show that the statement in question was definitely made. Upon page 129 of the official reports Lord Tweedmouth is thus reportedThe only reservation that the Admiralty desire to make is, that they claim to have the charge of the strategical questions which are necessarily involved in naval defence, to hold the command of the Naval Forces of the country, and to arrange the distribution-of ships in the best possible manner to resist attacks and to defend the Empire at large, whether it be our own islands or the Dominions beyond the seas. We thoroughly recognise that we are responsible for that defence. We want you to help us in that defence. We want you to giv£ us all the assistance you can, but we do not come to you as beggars; we gladly take all that you can give us, but at the same time, if you are not inclined to give us the help that we hope to have from you, we acknowledge our absolute obligation to defend the King's Dominions across the seas to the best of our ability. I should like to know what these remarks have reference to, if it is not to some statement by the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister prior to the delivery of that speech by Lord Tweedmouth. From the tenor of these remarks, it is distinct quite evident, even if there were nothing defence more to follow, that the impression left on minds of the Lords of the Admiralty was that Australia desired to terminate the most Naval Agreement, and did not propose to of continue the payment of the annual subitself. sidy of £[200,000, or, at any rate, wished public to be relieved of that responsibility. This tory view - of the matter is strengthened by professional further remarks made by Lord Tweedmouth, in a speech which will be found reported on page 469 of the proceedings of the Conference. He saidSince we last met, I have had the opportugentleman's nity of having conversations with various Prime Ministers and also with their colleagues, and they have had some conferences with 'some of my colleagues at the Admiralty also. do nQt know that I have any very definite to propose to you. I can only repeat what I said before, that at the Admiralty we are most anxious to meet the wishes of the various Colonies. But, of course, the real difficulty is that the position varies in the different Colonies, and they have very different' wants. In a later paragraph, I find that he saidAs I understand Australia puts forward a proposal that the agreement of 1902 should be ended, and that Australia should start something in the way of a local Defence Force. Here Lord Tweedmouth puts the position as it was understood by the Admiralty authorities from the statements of the Prime Minister of Australia. I should like to know whether the other members of the Ministry concur in the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister, and whether that honourable gentleman before he left Australia was authorized by them to make statements which so misrepresented the opinion of the people of the Commonwealth. At page 473 of the proceedings of the Conference, it will be found that Mr Deakin, speaking after Lord Tweedmouth, made this definite statementIn Australia, for reasons which have alreadv been out on record in the despatch which I had the honour of addressing to the Admiralty about two years ago, the existing contribution has not proved generally popular. A copy of that despatch ought to have been placed on the table of the House, so that we might have been made acquainted with the reasons which caused the Prime Minister to arrive at the conclusion that the agreement has not proved generally popular. The honourable gentleman went on to sayIt was passed because it was felt that some recognition of our responsibility for the of our own country and of the Empire of which it is a part was necessary, and though it did not take the form - which commended itself to the very large minority, possibly even a majority of the electors, we accepted that mode co-operation until something better presented Further consideration has convinced the that the present agreement is not satisfaceither to the Admiralty, the political or Lords of .the Admiralty, or to the Parliament of the Commonwealth. That is a very sweeping statement for the Prime Minister to have made as a representative of the people of Australia. I should like to know whether the honourable colleagues endorsed that state of the ment, or whether he made it with their authority ? Whether it was made with or without their authority, there is absolutely I plan not the slightest foundation in fact for any statement of the kind. In this matter Australia was misrepresented by the honourable gentleman throughout. In the face of a misrepresentation of that character, Ministers associated with the Prime Minister have the audacity to come down to Parliament, and ask us to give them three months' Supply, and thus prevent any successful attempt within that period to oust them from their position on the Treasury Benches. So far as I am concerned,' I refuse to be a party to voting the Supply now asked for, no matter what anybody else on this or on the other side may do, until we have some factory explanation from the Prime Minister in connection with this matter. if I had no other ground of opposition, - I should certainly oppose the granting of three months' Supply to a Ministry whose head has been guilty of such misrepresentation of Australia, in connection with so vital a matter as the defences of the Commonwealth. I notice that appear to be a little restive, because honourable members in opposition choose to exercise their right of criticism. not here from our own choice, but as a protest against the Government proceeding with this Supply Bill at this hour of the night. I notice that the item, "" Contingencies,"" occurs with alarming quency throughout the schedule. be found in connection with every branch of every Department. Where the amounts set down for contingencies are small, it may be that they cover small ture on which it is not necessary that we should have any definite information. But in the Estimates relating to the Department of Home Affairs, we find the large item ""Contingencies, .£1,000 "" ; and also an item of ,£360 in regard to contingencies in the Electoral Office. In connection with the Census and Statistics branch of the Department, we find provision made for salaries amounting to .£QOO; whilst £[1,670 is provided under the heading of ""Contingencies,"" which might cover anything. An item of ,£450 appears in respect of contingencies for the Meteorological branch of the Department. There is very grave complaint regarding the establishment of this branch in Melbourne. seems to be the policy of the Government to concentrate all the Departments in or about Melbourne, irrespective of whether or not the conditions are favourable to the adoption of that course. The Meteorological branch Mr Johnson. of the Department was established in Melbourne in defiance - of the report of Mr. Hunt, who pointed out that the conditions here were not so favourable to its work as were those in New South Wales, where he had been engaged in the State Department of Meteorology for some years. But for the sake of concentrating all these offices in and around Melbourne so as to make it appear to be what the Government allege it is, the centre of the Federation, they have established the Meteorological Department here, in face of the objections of the officer chiefly interested in it. An explanation of satis- this action on the part of the Government is required. Then there is Even £ 1 , 5 0 0 set apart for expenses in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act during the next three months. I should like to know to what these expenses relate. There is another item, ""Cost of Commonwealth Elections, £[300."" I should like the Minister to state whether Ministers this amount is to' be expended, in accordance with a suggestion made by an honourable member opposite, in refunding the expenses We are incurred by candidates at elections subsequently declared void owing to the fault of electoral officers. There is nothing in the schedule to show what will be the destination of the .£300. I certainly raise my fre- protest against the Opposition continually It is to giving way to the Government in respect of proposals which ought to be hotly contested. I would sooner go to a division a dozen times, even if I were defeated on expendi- every occasion, in order to assert principles where.they should be asserted, but I often find myself alone in calling for a division. The mere fact that the numbers happen to be against us at times does not afford justification for allowing to go unchallenged items that ought to be contested. It ds only because I have rega*rd for the comfort of honourable members, who have sat here all day after travelling by train all night, that, having entered 1 my protest and stated some of the reasonsfor the action' I have taken, I propose now to resume my seat.

I have been able to make only a cursory examination of the Bill , because, though it was circulated this morning* the copy intended for me did not reach me. Apparently, for some reason which I cannot understand, the Government are anxious to force the measure through, under the pretence of bringing us nearer to the Tariff debate. But that is no reason why we should pass soimportant a measure in a perfunctory manner. The present procedure is contrary to the best principles of constitutional government.

I have already expressed opinion in regard to the Commonwealth offices j and I should now like to know whether, in regard to the mail, service to the Pacific Islands, there is an increase or a decrease. I wish to know whether there has been a new contract entered into, and whether that contract bears any relation, to the whole question of the eastern services. This is a very important matter. Already the States are taking into their own hands the organization of independent mail services to the East; and I am not quite sure whether, such action is constitutional. It appears to me that the Commonwealth should make an arrangement by which all the States should have equal facilities, without competition. This is a matter of great importance, which needs more discussion than it is likely to receive to-night. However, if the Government are intent on forcing matters through without discussion, I can only call attention to these points, and protest against such a measure being put through without a tittle of explanation.

It was rumoured that the reason why the bond which Captain Collins is endeavouring to receive payment upon has not been honoured, is that it contained a stipulation that it was only to be binding in the event of the Commonwealth Parliament ratifying the contract within a certain period from the signing of the bond, and that, inasmuch as the Commonwealth Parliament had not done so, the bondwas no longer operative.

But I would call his attention to the fact that the total amount of the division in the Estimates is £ 4 , 4 0 0 as against . £ 2 , 1 0 0 appropriated last year.

753,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW,"Trea surer) [12.37] - There is no doubt that the honourable member is correct in saying that the question he has raised is a large one, because it deals with not only part of New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, and the New Hebrides, but with the Pacific Islands generally. When he was in London, the Prime Minister was very anxious-and I was assisting him-to make an arrangement in regard to the control of some of the Pacific Islands. We did not succeed in what we wanted to do. We have simply carried on the contract with Burns, Philp, and Company on the same lines as before. As regards the desire of the States to employ other services, there is a difficulty about interfering.

It was thought that as it had not been mentioned in the Governor General's Speech, it could not be made a Government matter, and so no action.has been taken.
