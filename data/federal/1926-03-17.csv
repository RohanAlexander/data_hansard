I submit the motion because we are now very near Easter, and there is a certain amount of business which must he dealt wifcit before the House adjourns, unless honourable members are to be brought back immediately after Easter.

LEAGUE OF NATIONS. ADMISSION OF GERMANY-INTERNATIONA L LABOUR CONFERENCE - AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSIBILITY.",15
13,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Is it the in t e n t i o n of the r i g h t honourable the P r i m e Minister Tellers: to make a statement, before the House rises' for the Easter recess, and, if possible, allow time for the discussion of the NOES. s it u at i o n that has developed at Geneva, p a r t i c u l a r l y in r e l at i o n to the proposed entrance of Germany to the ^League of N at i o n s ? Will he, at the same time , in 1 Watkins. D. dicate el'early to honourable members the West, J! E, at t it u d e that is being assumed by the Yates, G. E. British) and Do m in i o n representatives or commissioners, with regard to the proTellers: posed enlargement of the Council of the Fenton, J. E. League ? Forde, F. M . Mr Bruce . - I shall c e r t a in l y make PAIR. a statement upon the matter , possibly tomorrow or on F r i d a y . I w o u ld have done so today had a satisfactory settlement been reached of the somewhat difficult and delicate problem that has arisen at Geneva. It is desirable I should make clear to the House the exact circumstances that have led to the present situation, as well as the attitude which the Australian Government, through its representatives at Geneva, has assumed; but I cannot say anything at the present moment. I was extremely sorry to learn of the receipt in Australia of a press cablegram which, if true, would indicate that Brazil, which is one of the non-permanent members of the Council of the League, has exercised the power that is possessed by every member of the Council to prevent a unanimous recommendation for the admission to the Council of a new permanent member.",15
14,Mr WATT,Unknown,Do the official records confirm that cablegram ?,16
15,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I am glad to say that they do not; no official confirmation of it has been received by the Government.,16
16,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,Would such action by Brazil prevent Germany's admission to the Council?,16
17,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Yes . Under the provisions of the Covenant of the League a new permanent seat on the Council cannot be granted to any nation unless the - Council unanimously recommends it to the Assembly. It is suggested that Brazil has exercised her right to prevent unanimity from being reached. Without unanimity Germany cannot be admitted as a permanent member of the Council. That would be very serious. The admission of Germany to the League is one of the conditions upon which the Locarno treaties came into operation. There is nothing to prevent Germany's admission to the League, but the Powers are under an obligation to see that she obtains also a permanent seat on the Council. It is not desirable that I should, at this stage, outline what has taken place at Geneva in regard to the claims of Spain, Brazil, and Poland. The matter has progressed so far that a final decision must be reached very' soon. There will then be nothing to prevent me from making a full statement, because it will not then be possible to say anything which might prevent a satisfactory settlement. I hope that I shall be in a position to make a statement either tomorrow or on Friday.",16
18,Mr STEWART,Unknown,Will the right honourable gentleman give the House an opporthat tunity to discuss the matter?,16
19,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I do not think that that will be necessary.,16
20,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Is it a fact that Mr James MACDougall was the only person nominated by the employers' organizations as their representative at the In ternational Labour Conference at Geneva ? If so, why were different conditions laid down respecting the nominations for a representative of the employees?",16
21,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,It is not a fact that Mr. James MACDougall was the only person nominated as the representative of the employers. I believe that the names of five or six gentlemen were submitted. The Government has not yet decided who the employers' representative shall be. There has been no distinction between the treatment of the employers and the employees.,16
22,Mr WEST,Unknown,"'Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the statement made in another place regarding Australia's position, as a member of the League of Nations, in the event of hostilities occurring as the result of the present, proceedings at Geneva? In view of the question of the right honourable member for Balaclava, (Mr Watt), will the Prime Minister intimate to the House exactly where Australia stands 1",16
23,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I have not seen the statement referred to .'by the honourable member. I presume that he wishes me to define Australia's obligations' under the Covenant of the League of Nations. To deal wibh that matter would take considerable time, but I shall take the opportunity of discussing it in its many bearings and aspects when a suitable occasion presents itself. I do not think that the honourable member need fear that hostilities will arise out of the present proceedings at Geneva.",16
24,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Accordin g to cable messages published in the local press, the representative of Australia attending the meetings of the Council of the League of Nations now being held at Geneva is acting under definite instructions in supporting Germany's application for membership of the League, and in opposing any further enlargement of the Council beyond the provision of a permanent seat for that power. Will the Prime Minister inform us what instructions have been issued to him?",16
25,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The Government has quite definitely indicated its attitude in regard to the admission of Germany to the Council of the League. The views of the British Government and the Commonwealth Government have been formulated on two underlying principles. The first of these is that nothing should be done at Geneva that would - in any sense undermine the Locarno Pact; and the second is that nothing should interfere with the admission of Germany into the League. The proceedings of the Council are almost finalized: and, in the circumstances, I feel that it will be undesirable for me at this stage to say any more on the subject now.",17
26,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Does not the Treaty of Versailles require that the appointment of the representative of organized Labour to the International Labour Conference should be made by the Government in agreement with the trades union movement of Australia? If so, why is it necessary that more than one nomination should be made?",17
27,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The Treaty of Versailles provides that the workers' representatives shall be chosen by the Government, in agreement with the representatives of organized Labour throughout the country. There is no provision in the treaty giving the right to any section to nominate its representative, though that is what is being attempted; or so it would appear from what has been published in the press. We should do everything possible to prevent difficulties from arising; but those making the appointments must be given a certain latitude, so as to ensure that the persons attending the conference do not merely represent only a section or class. The representative of the employers and the representative of the employees may primarily represent the sections which they have been chosen to represent, but they should also represent Australia as a whole. I urge honourable members opposite to use their influence to convince those who appear to hold a different view that there is an obligation on the Government, which represents the whole of the people, to see that the person chosen as their representative is prepared to act in the interests of Australia as a whole. Is it suggested that in a great movement such as the Labour movement three persons cannot be found who could be nominated to represent the employees at Geneva ? - Mr Lazzarini - In view of the fact that the official organ of the Chamber of Manufactures in New South. Wales has stated definitely that Mr MACDougall has been selected as the representative of the employers and has left for England to attend the conference, I ask whether that gentleman has been appointed by the Government as the employers' representative at Geneva?",17
28,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I cannot state at the moment how many persons have been nominated by the employers.,17
29,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,The journal of the Chamber of Manufactures says that only one nomination was submitted.,17
30,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"That is wrong. The honourable gentleman may, if he pleases, see the communication from the employers in which the names of several persons, four, five, 'or six- I cannot at the moment say exactly how many-iar e submitted. The nominations have not yet been considered by Cabinet. DUTIES ON MOTOR CYCLES.",17
31,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs yet received from the Tariff Board a report relating to the duties on motor cycles? If so, will he lay it upon the table of the House? I understand that the board completed its inquiry about a fortnight ago, and, as the matter is an urgent one, it is desirable that no time be lost in considering the report.  recollection that report has not yet been received. BROKEN HILL . WATER FAMINE: COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE.",17
32,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Is the Prime. Minister aware that the production of lead, zinc and silver at Broken Hill has completely ceased owing to a shortage of water : that the stoppage has already thrown out of employment 4,000 men at Broken Hill, and that 1,000 or more will be thrown out of employment at Port Pirie very shortly? In view of the seriousness of the position, and the necessity of again producing lead for export, will the right honourable gentleman make available the assistance of the Commonwealth as early as possible in supplying water from the River Darling?",17
33,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I was not aware that production had completely ceased at Broken Hill ; m y impression was that there had merely been a diminution of the production. According to the information in my possession, the solution of the difficulty is believed to be the carriage of water to Broken Hill by rail. The railway over which it would be carried is under the control of the Government of New South Wales, and I understand that that Government is dealing with the matter. It has been suggested, however, that the Commonwealth should place at the disposal of the State certain engines that are at present idle at .Port Augusta. If representations are made to the Commonwealth on the subject, the position will be carefully examined; but I think it is the opinion of the New South Wales Government that it can more readily deal with the matter with its own rolling-stock and engines. AUSTRALIAN COAT OF ARMS .",18
34,Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON,Unknown,"Will Prime Minister take advantage of the presence in Australia of Sir Bertram Maokennal to secure from him a report upon the design of the Commonwealth coat of arms, with a view to suggesting more suitable and artistic arms than are at present in use on our coinage, notes, official publications, and documents, stationery, &c.",18
35,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,The honourable member's suggestion will reeeive the fullest consideration. PROPOSED - SESSION ON CONSTITUTIONA L MATTERS.,18
36,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"In view of the action of the Prime Minister in depriving the House of an opportunity to discuss the motion dealing with the creation of new States, and the making of necessary amendments to the Constitution, that stands on the notice-paper in the name of the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson), will the right honourable gentleman indicate when he proposes to fulfil the promise that he made at Dandenong to have a special constitutional session, and to invite the States to attend a conference to consider the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States?",18
37,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I have not deprived honourable members of the opportunity to discuss the motion to which the honourable member has referred. The urgency of Government business was the sole reason for giving it precedence of private members' business tomorrow. Nothing will prevent the discussion of the motion in the very near f u t u r e ; the length of time that will elapse before it can be discussed will depend upon the length of the adjournment that honourable members desire at Easter. It is impossible to say when the Government will be able to afford an opportunity to discuss constitutional questions, which, I agree, are of very great importance; but we shall have to endeavour to bring about a financial conference with the States at a date that will allow of the preparation by the Treasurers of the Commonwealth and the States of budgets and financial statements at the usual time. Consequently, such a conference must be held in the relatively immediate future. A constitutional session will probably be held at a later date.",18
38,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Does not the Prime Minister think that it would be fitting for the proposed Constitutional conferl the ence to be held at Canberra?,18
39,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I d o; and the indications point to its being held there. IMPERIAL CONFERENCE. PUBLICATION OF CORRESPONDENCE.,18
40,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"In view of the statement made in the local House of Commons by the Prime Minister of Canada that the British Government offered no objection to the publication of the correspondence between it and the dominions relating to the holding of an Imperial Conference, will the Prime M i nister make available to honourable members such communications as haye passed between it and the British Government on the matter?",18
41,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"There has been very little correspondence in connection with the Imperial Conference. I shall look into the matter; but at present I can see no reason why the communications should not be made public. The - question arose in the Canadian House of Commons following a request for the publication of all communications with regard to the Loearno Pact. On that point the Canadian Prime Minister said that the publication of those communications would be inadvisable, on account of the reference to other nations. EASTER RECESS.",18
42,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"In view of the fact that some honourable members must make their arrangements sometime ahead, can the Prime Minister inform the House of the probable length of the Easter recess ?",19
43,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I cannot do so at the moment. . A good deal will depend upon the'progress made with the business by Fiiday week. Certain matters, including the tariff, must be concluded without unnecessary delay; and if consideration of them is not completed before Easter, it will be necessary to call honourable members together much earlier after Easter than would otherwise be the case. RAILWAY STOCK RATE S.",19
44,Mr LACEY,Unknown,"Seeing that the South Australian Government has agreed to duce by 50 per cent, the charges for railing live stock from the drought stricken areas in the north of South Australia to other parts of the State for agistment, will the Prime Minister making a similar concession in regard to stock that may need to be carried over the Commonwealth Railways for the same purpose ? This is an urgent matter and a prompt decision may prevent pastoralists from shooting hundreds of head of cattle.",19
45,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I appreciate the urgency Canadian Government is imposing a of the matter, and will have it looked into at once. ELECTOR AL COMMITTEE .",19
46,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the Select Committee on Electoral agreement ? Matters will hold its first meeting tomorrow morning, will the Prime Minister make an early announcement of the names of the two members required to complete the committee's personnel ?",19
47,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"At the moment I cannot say what the position is, but I shall do my best to make an early announceM ment on the matter. RAVAGES OF THE BORER.  that much of our Australian timber is threatened with destruction, through the ravages of the borer, will the Government cause an investigation to be made with the object of eliminating the pest?  have been directed to the Minister for Health (Sir Neville Howse). I shall consult him on the matter and let the honourable member have an answer. [68] NA STAMPS.",19
48,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,LICENC ES TO SELL POSTAGE,"Is the Postmaster-General aware that in the event of the proprietors of news agency and stationery businesses selling out, the Postal Department refuses the transfer ofcommission-carrying licences to sell postage stamps that are connected with them, and invites the new owners in the businesses concerned to submit applications for licences without commission ? Does he. consider it reasonable to expect business. people to assist the department to meet the convenience of the public by selling stamps without recompense for their, services ?",19
49,Mr GIBSON,LICENC ES TO SELL POSTAGE,"Eac h case is dealt with on its merits. The department takes the. stand that persons have no righ t to disrepose of commission-carrying licences for the sale of postage stamps. That-is the reason why it refuses to transfer them.' consider CANADIANDUMPINGDUTY ON"" AUSTRALIANBUTTE R. Mr BOWDE N. Notwithstanding the fact that one of the few concessions that Australia received in the reciprocal trade' treaty with Canada was the right to export butter to that Dominion, the : dumping duty on all butter that we send there. Can the Minister for Trade and Customs tell us why ? I should also like; to know whether or not this decision will have any effect upon the reciprocal trade'  ing investigated by the Department of Markets and Migration, and when the inquiry is completed I shall be able to answer the honourable member's question. EMORANDUMPAPERSUPPLIED ' TO HONORABLEMEMBERS . QUESTIONS WITHOUTNOTIC E.",19
50,Mr FENTON,LICENC ES TO SELL POSTAGE,"Las t week. I complained that some of the paper used for our memorandum forms was made in Norway. Since then I have received a letter, from which I make the following extract:In the Tariff now before the House the duty on writing paper has been taken off. It was a very small one, only 5 per cent., 10 per cent, and 15 per cent.; but with a certain, amount of Government preference we' were enabled, to secure the Commonwealth andState Government contracts, and made about 1,000 tons per annum. amended tariff being introduced, the first Government that turned down the Australianpaper was the Commonwealth, and we believe that had the duty, although small, still been in force, our tender would have been accepted. Will the Prime Minister make inquiries to ascertain who is responsible for this House being supplied with Norwegian in stead of Australian paper?",19
51,Mr BRUCE,LICENC ES TO SELL POSTAGE,"I shall have inquiries made into the matter. But may I suggest that honourable members put questions of this kind on the Notice Paper ? When such inquiries are made without notice, the departmental staffs have to scan the Hansard report very carefully to ascertain that no point has been omitted in making a reply. TENDERS, KYOGLE RAILWAY .",20
52,Mr SEABROOK,LICENC ES TO SELL POSTAGE,"the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice I. What number of tenders was received for the short division of the Kyogle railway? 2. Wliat was the amount of each tender? 3. What was the name of the lowest tenderer ? 4. Was the lowest tender accepted; if not, Why not? 5. Have arrangements been finalized for the carrying out of the work; if so, by whom? 6. If the lowest tender has not been accepted, will the Government repay to such tenderer the amount expended in making his estimate? Mr HILL , - In the agreement ratified by the three Parliaments it is provided1. There shall be a railway council for the purposes of the agreement. 2. Tliat the council shall have the entire controlof all the works contemplated by the agreement and the expenditure thereon. Arrangements have not been finalized for the carrying out of the work, and, until they are completed, the information desired by the honourable member cannot be given. SUPERANNUATION ACT. LIFE ASSURANCE PREMIUMS .",20
53,Mr BRENNAN,LICENC ES TO SELL POSTAGE,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, as the result of superannuation, many public servants found it impossible to pay both life assurance premiums and contributions to superannuation, with the result that, prior to the Superannuation Board taking over the policies, many policies were surrendered at a loss to the insured? 2. Did he promise to look into the question of these losses; and, if so, what, if-anything, is proposed to be done about it?",20
54,Dr EARLE PAGE,LICENC ES TO SELL POSTAGE,"The answers Under the to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It was represented by a deputation that waited on me in May, 1923, that omcers had suffered financial loss by the surrender of life assurance policies. 2. I promised to look into the matter on receipt of details of the losses which the deputation undertook to furnish. It was not until June, 1925-tw o years later-that the promised information was supplied. The information was not sufficiently detailed to enable it to be determined what loss, if any, the officers had suffered. I am. now awaiting, further details, a request for which was made in July, 1925. NA ISLAND.  Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Will he say when the construction of the lighthouse on Eclipse Island, off Albany, was commenced, and who are the contractors? 2. What was the total estimated cost of the undertaking? 3. What sums have been expended to date on this undertaking, and when will the work be completed?  honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. Work was commenced on the 26th February, 1923, and is being carried out by day labour - 2. Â£23,680. 3. Â£17,350. It is expected that the work will be completed on the 31st August, 1026, but possibly the light will be in operation before the work on the station is completed. NA EX - SOLDIER S.",20
55,Mr BRENNAN,MENTALLY AFFLICTED,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that several mentally afflicted ex-soldiers have recently been removed from the military wards at Mont Park and Bundoora, and are now inmates of the State Hospital for the Insane? 2. Were these ex-soldiers removed from State hospitals during 1918 and placed in military hospitals because their condition was certified as being as due to or aggravated by military service ? 3. If so, what is the cause of this apparent anomaly ? Sir"" NEVILLE HOWSE - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as.follow:1. Yes; three patients. 2 and 3. These cases were admitted to the mental hospital in 1916 and 1917. by. the Defence Department (prior to discharge from the Australian Imperial Force). not establish that the disability was due to or aggravated by war service. A review of their military and medical histories discloses (in the opinion of the Eepatriation medical officers) that the insanity is not war-caused. patients were permitted to remain with the Eepatriation patients so long as the accommodation was not required for cases whose disability arose out of service. They were recently removed by the Inspector-General of the Insane, who is responsible for them. NA NA",20
56,Mr BRENNAN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"the Minister for Defence, upon noticeW it l i regard to a notice dated 1st March, 1920, addressed from Naval Drillroom, Port Melbourne, and signed "" R . Fulton, Lieutenant"", to a local resident commencing:"" 1. You have been selected for naval universal training. 2. You are to report without fail at the Naval Drillroom, Bay-street, Port Melbourne, at 9 a.m. on 16.3.26 for medical examination as to your fitness for the above""will the Minister state what is the position with regard to naval universal training as distinct from compulsory military service, and on what grounds notices of the kind above referred to are sent out?",21
57,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Par t XII . of the Defence Act provides for the liability of certain classes of persons to be trained in the Citizen Forces, and that liability extends to the Citizen Naval Forces as well as to the Citizen Military Forces. Section 143 (2) provides for those required for training in the Naval Forces to be first allotted to those forces. Section 144 of the act requires the attendance at the prescribed times and places for inspection and medical examination of those so liable. tions for naval training are made from those residing in areas convenient for the purpose. ELECTRIC LIFTS AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE.",21
58,Mr MARR,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"On the 11th March, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories1. Is it a fact that Australian tenderers for the supply of all electric lift s at Federal Parliament House, Canberra, were unsuccessful, in that the order for service l if ts was placed with a foreign company at a very low price? 2. Is it a fact that the said foreign company This does is securing the lift machinery from France? 3. W i at action, if any, is proposed to ensure that 'preference to either Australian or British products is observed in this instance ? These The following are the answers to those questions:1. No. The Federal Capital Commission has advised that six tenders were received for the supply of electric lift s at Parliament House, all being from Australian firms. The successf u l tenderers were Messrs. Waygood-Otis (Australia) Proprietary Limited, of Sydney, and Messrs. Standard-Waygood Limited, of Sydney. 2. Of the tender let to Messrs. Standard-Waygood Limited, the whole of the material, with SERVICE. the exception of a few small items of the value, of about Â£200 manufactured in Great Britain,, is of Australian manufacture. Of Messrs. Waygood-Otis' tender of Â£3,050, only Â£450 worth will 'be imported. 3. The specifications contain a clause stipulating that, in the carrying out of the contracts, first preference' must 'be given to Australian materials, and second preference to British materials. ITALY'S WAR DEBTS.",21
59,Dr EARLE PAGE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"On the 29th January, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the following question:In this morning's newspapers is published a cablegram that It a ly has been forgiven half its war debts to Great Britain . Will the Treasurer make available to the House any information in his possession'regarding this matter? I a m n o w able to f u r n is h the following information:The negotiations for the settlement of the Italian war debt to Great Britain concerned a total of. Â£610,840,000, including accrued in terest. Against this, Italy had a claim for Â£22,200,000 in respect of gold deposited in England as part security for the debt. According to the agreement signed on 27th January, 1926, Italy is to liquidate her debt in the following payments:Selec- Â£2,000,000 in the current financial year; Â£4,000,000 in each of two vears-19267 to 1927-8; Â£4,250,000 in each of four years-19289 to 1931-2; Â£4,500,000 per annum thereafter for 55 CANBERRA. years-19323 to 1986-7; Â£2,250,000 in 1987-8 in final payment. The gross amount to be paid by Italy is thus Â£276,750,000 including interest. From this is to be deducted the above-mentioned Â£22,200,000 of gold, which Great Britain agrees to release in instalments spread over the period of the agreement, commencing in 1928. The effect of this concession is that Italy's net yearly remittance to Great Britain will be Â£4,000,000 after the current fiscal year, and to reduce the net total of payments to be made to Â£254,550,000. \ SEACLTFF TRAINI NG CAMP. FOOD SUPPLIES.",21
60,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Las t week, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates), and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), asked for information concerning an occurrence at the Seacliff Military Camp, in South Australia, on 4th March. I am now in a position to inform the honourable members that I have obtained reports, which indicate that the midday meal on that day, for two companies of the 43rd Battalion, as issued from the cook-house, was insufficient. The Orderly Officers of the Companies complained to the Messing Officer, and additional cooked rations of the same materials were immediately secured from the cook-house. The time that elapsed from the complaint being made to the issue of the additional food appears to 'have been five minutes or so, certainly not more than ten. During this period, some 150 men proceeded to march out of the mess tents. They were ordered to return, and did so. On thej arrival of the second issue, objection was made by some of the trainees that the mess orderlies' food had been taken; and, - on an assurance being given that this was not so, and that there was plenty for the mess orderlies, they then complained that the meat was undercooked. It was, however, inspected by the Commanding Officer, the Adjutant, and the Medical Officer of the 43rd Battalion, as well as by the Brigade Major of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, who all state that the meat was good; if anything, was overdone. Some 300 men were involved in the initial short issue, and subsequent further issue. Of these, some 180 accepted the further issue. The remaining 121 declined to touch their food, broke camp, and took train to Adelaide. On the arrival at Adelaide, some pf them proceeded to the office of the Evening News newspaper. After obtaining a meal in Adelaide, the men remained there until the evening, and then returned to camp. On the following day, they were dealt with by their Commanding Officer for absence without leave, and each fined f 1, and automatically lost a day's pay absence on 4th March. Instructions designed to detect shortages in issue were not observed in certain particulars, is therefore impossible now to ascertain whether the correct weight of meat was delivered to the unit or not, although the correct weight was sent out from the Army Service Corps. Action has been taken against those responsible for this neglect, although, as already stated, the shortage complained of by the trainees was immediately made good. The several reports I have obtained all indicate that the complaints concerning the second issue were frivolous and unjustified, and that there is nothing to exculpate the men from their very grave offence of breaking camp. I might add that the supplies of meat for the 4th March were issued by the Australian Army Service Corps to the 43rd, and other Battalions, from 8 p.m. on the previous night. It was examined by a board consisting of a medical officer, a veterinary officer, and the field officer of the day, and found to be of good quality and condition. PAPERS. The following papers were presented:Lands Acquisition Act-Lan d acquired at Bnlaklava, South Australia-For Postal purposes. Railways Act-By-la w No. 38. Treaty of Peace (Germany) Act-Regulation s Amended-Statutor y Rules 1926, No. 24. POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL . In committee (Consideration resumed from 12th March, vide page 1617) : Clause 2-(Definition) .",22
61,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Perth) [3.59] - The Spirits Act provides two standards, one for mineralized spirit and the other for alcohol fuel. The difference between the two is only in the methods of denaturing the original alcohol. But as this bill deals with the production of alcohol fuel, I cannot understand why the standard for mineralized spirits has been adopted instead of the other standard set out in the Spirits Act.",22
62,Mr FENTON,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Maribyrnong) [4.0] I understand that in connection with the production of power alcohol for industrial purposes in France and Germany, there is some relaxation of the Customs regulations relating to denaturants - The cost for per gallon of denaturing may not be great, but it amounts to a considerable sum on a big output. I. do not believe and it in the revenue being cheated, and in facilitating the use. of power alcohol for potable .purposes, but I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that his department will allow reasonable latitude to the manufacturers, and not handicap the in dustry by undue interference.",22
63,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Perth) [4.2] - The Public Accounts Gommittee received evidence that the Comptroller-General of Customs had given an assurance to the company that it would not be harassed by in sistence upon the full requirements of the Spirits Act in regard to denaturants. If that is so, my contention that there is no need to set up a different standard from that which is already fixed by the Spirits Act is strengthened. I suggest to the Minister that he might postpone the clause and introduce a new definition which would be consistent with the Spirits Act .",23
64,Dr MALONEY,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Melbourne) [ 4 . 4 ] - I have just received information from Messrs. Clarke, Padley and Company, that by the use in Germany of a new invention-Eisenbahm-Verkehrsmitte l Aktiengesellchaft, Berlin-know n as the E.V.A . Mayback motor railcar, 100 passengers can be carried at a fuel cost of less than $d. per mile. It consumes crude oil, which can be purchased in large quantities at 4d. per gallon. If there is a chance of competition by this invention we may have to consider the payment of an in creased bounty to the power alcohol in dustry. I have no desire to delay the passage of the bill , but I ask the Minister to postpone the clause so that further information may be obtained regarding this new factor in cheap transport.",23
65,Mr BOWDEN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Parramatta) [ 4 . 5 ] - I support the request of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. When the manufacture of power alcohol was being experimented with in the acetate of lime factory at Brisbane, the greatest difficulty was experienced in complying with the demands of the Customs Department in regard to denaturing. Mr Wilkinson, the Government analyst, insisted upon adhering to the standards set up by the Customs Department. If the department caused so much difficulty to a factory that was controlled by another department under the same government, I can conceive that its interference may be a considerable handicap to a private manufacturer. If the manufacture of power alcohol by private enterprise is to be encouraged the Customs Department will require to adopt a more sympathetic attitude.  Trade and Customs) [ 4 . 7 ] - I am agreeable to the postponement of the clause, with a view to endeavouring to meet the views of honourable members. The Government desires to simplify the manufacture of power alcohol. Of course, honourable members realise that the spirit must be denatured or methylated, so as to be rendered unfit for human consumpt i o n ; but the less the expense and trouble to which the manufacturers are put the greater will be the prospectof success. Clause postponed. Clause 3There shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, the bounty specified in this act.",23
66,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Perth) [4.9] - When this bill was previously before Parliament I opposed the granting of this bounty. When urging the House to pass this bill on Fridav. the Minister for Trade and  ing the measure Parliament would be keeping f a it h . By interjection, I asked him what he meant, and his reply was very vague and unsatisfactory. There is an uneasy feeling on the part of some honourable members that the Minister has committed the Government to the payment of this bounty, and that he desires Parliament to confirm his action. If that is so, I protest against the Govern r ment being definitely committed to a course of action before Parliament is consulted, and I suggest that any such undertaking by the Minister is not bindr ing upon honourable members, This committee must decide whether or not a bounty shall be granted, and honourable members should not be told that they will be breaking faith if they do not agree to this proposal. This bill is of great importance, and if the company has been promised financial assistance without Parliament having been consulted, a very important question arises as to the - responsibility of honourable members. Last year the House was told that the company was already purchasing in England machinery for the commencement of the industry, acting apparently on some undertaking from the Government. No undertaking, explicit or implied, should be given by the Government to pay a bounty to any private enterprise until the subject had been discussed in Parliament. Since, the bill was last before this House, the Public Accounts Committee has reported upon the various proposals for the production ofpower alcohol. I congratulate the committee upon its admirable report. covered the ground completely, and has hot been carried away by any airy schemes which, although scientifically attractive, are commercially impracticable. Having had a great deal of experience with various technical. processes, I know Â£hat the crucial matter in any enterprise of this character is not the but the commercial possibility, involves the cost of production distribution. Laboratory tests and calculations of the yield from material are not always confirmed production is attempted on a commercial scale. Laboratory tests are not conclusive; the operations in the field and the cost of production are the determining factors. The Accounts Committee has shown a business instinct for practical siderations. It has taken a broad view of the question, and, on the whole, the report completely justifies my attitude to the bill on previous occasions. It is true that the committee did not, as a selectcommittee would have done, report on the pros and cons of the bill, but in its report it has dealt inferentially with this proposal. is' noteworthy that the committee no recommendation that a bounty should be paid for the production alcohol. It has reported that this or that proposition is not a commercial tion without Government assistance, but it has not recommended that such assistance should be given. On the other hand the Committee has come to the perfectly wise and sane decision that it would be .better for the Government to subsidize research work in order to throw light upon some of the problems in the industry. I suggest that the practical way to subsidize research is not to subsidize a company. The Minister has tried to make the House believe that the proposal before honourable members is a big research enterprise, and that ment, by granting a bounty, will be doing no more than encouraging further gation. But there is another side to the matter.' When a subsidy is paid to a company to establish a factory and plant, and undertake the production of a large Mr Mann. quantity of material, an industry is established which will thereafter have a claim upon the Government. If the first experiments do not succeed, we shall-have It has established a company, and shall have encouraged it to come back to the Government for further assistance. In other words, we are by this' measure building up vested interests without proper consideration, which may afterwards fasten on our back like the Old Man of the Sea. The proper way to proceed is to subsidize technical research activities through the Institute of which Science and Industry, if honourable memand bers please, or through some of the State departments already established, having certain local experience and knowledge, and comwhen petent to carry out the scientific work required. The broader the area of research the better, because it is possible to take advantage of competition in scientific research as well as in any other direction. In spite of all that may be said to the con- contrary, this proposal is but a huge experiment, and I speak advisedly, and with a sense of responsibility, when I say that it is an experiment which will not succeed. The Government is proposing to subsidize a company which may become more or less permanently dependent on Government assistance. It made Mr WEST - The Government accepts no responsibility u n t i l something has been of power produced. proposi- Mr MANN - That does not settle this question. If we encourage this company to erect building and plant, and incur responsibilities by the inducement of the bounty, we may be sure that if its first experiments are not successful, it will claim further assistance. On the subject further of the encouragement of research, there involved are two paragraphs of the Public Accounts Committee's report which are worth quoting. The committee saysIn October, 1020, the Institute of Science and Industry convened a conference of persons specially interested in the production and use Parlia- of motor fuel, and manufacturers of motor bodies accessories, internal combustion engines, &c. This conference endorsed the recommendainvesti- tions of the .institute as contained in bulletin No. 20, and urged the Commonwealth Government to give effect to them. Those recommendations were along the line of research and investigation. The next paragraph, in the committee's report is 'of particular importance. It reads: - 'The conference decided also to establish a fund for the purpose of investigating the production of motor fuels in Australia, and suggested that contributions to the fund be made on a Â£1 for Â£1 basis up to a limit of Â£5,000 each by the Commonwealth Government, and the users and trade interests concerned. The executive council of the institute endorsed the proposal, and recommended the Commonwealth Government to grant up to Â£5,000 for this purpose. The recommendation was not, however, approved by the Government. Here is a case in which private interests concerned were willing to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government and to put up an equal amount of money out of their own pockets to provide a fund of Â£l0j000 to carry out research work, in which, of course, the private interests concerned would have a say. What more desirable arrangement could possibly have been proposed, and yet the Commonwealth .Government turned down that proposal. Instead of entering into' a cooperative scheme of investigation, to the cost of which the Government would contribute Â£5,000 only, it has put before us a scheme to subsidize one private company to the extent of Â£25,000. This whole proposal is--unreasonable and unbusinesslike. I consider that the activities of the Government in the matter should be confined to subsidizing research on the lines suggested. Take the question of what is to be done with the prickly pear. I do not wish to throw the slightest doubt upon the scientific work done by Dr Sinclair. I do not question that he has produced alcohol from prickly pear. I have no means of checking his statement, but I do not for a moment suggest that it is wrong. What I say, however, is that the technical production of alcohol from prickly pear in a laboratory is only the commencement of the problem. The real difficulty, in dealing with the prickly pear is, as. every one knows, the cutting and handling of it .",23
67,The CHAIRMAN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Mr Bayley) I think the honourable member is going beyond the scope of clause 3 in entering upon a detailed discussion of the subject of the bill. .. . .. Mr MANN"" - I intended only to point out'that here is a case for investigation arid research not on the technical side. I do not question the work of Dr Sinclair on.the technical side,--but-there is.room for much investigation - into the practical working costs of cutting and ""handling prickly pear. I do not propose to traverse the whole of the report presented.by the Public. Accounts Committee. '-' I am very much afraid that there is-a majority of honourable members, against me in this matter, and I have no wish to aggravate them by pressing ""my opposition to the bill too far. But before it is passed, I feel it is necessary to again record my views upon it after the presentation of the Public Accounts Committee's report. Everything in that report points to three main conclusions. Eirst of all, molasses is the most practical source of poweralcohol in Australia at present. I want to point out that it is also demonstrated that its use does not require a subsidy ot bounty.",25
68,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"=Where is '-that - demonstrated? -""(",25
69,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Accordin g to the evidence given to the Public Accounts-Committee, molasses provides a source of power alcohol on a really commercial basis, and it's use does not require bounty or subsidy. My own view is that' this bill should be put aside altogether, and the company invited to use this', waste material in the form of molasses to, make power alcohol. I know that this would meet only a proportion of. the requirements of the country, but it would - provide a reserve in lime of need, and - from the experience gained in this way we- - might see reason to extend our operations further.",25
70,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Where does the honourable member find that a bounty is asked for the production of power alcohol from molasses? "">",25
71,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,I know that it has been suggested that molasses should be included in this bill. The second point.that arises out of the committee's report ' is that natural growths ih tropical countries,25
72,The CHAIRMAN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"May I suggest that it would be more appropriate for the honi orable member to discuss the question on; clause 6 rather than on the clause now before the committee, as it specifies tng ' materials which may be employed in the production of power alcohol. Mr MANN.:- I was in some little dif&i culty as to thecourse to pursue because; the Minister, in speaking to the .'firslj clause, said :that, opportunity-wouldbei given - to discuss the whole measure. did not wish to inflict my remarks upon honourable members more than once, but I shall now reserve further remarks on the bill for other clauses.",25
73,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Herbert) [ 4 . 2 5 ] in my hand a copy of the Public Accounts Committee's report, but having listened to the honourable member for Perth (Mr . Mann), I think we must be looking at two different documents. I see that on page 10 of their report the Publio Accounts Committee saysIf some stimulus or inducement were offered - for the manufacture of alcohol, it appears that there is a favourable opportunity for the estab. lishment of a new and important industry in the Commonwealth. I take it that that is a direct indication that the Publio Accounts Committee does recommend that some stimulus or inducement in the shape of a bounty should be given for the production of alcohol from cassava at least.",26
74,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,The committee does not say that it is on a commercial basis.,26
75,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I shall deal with that in - a moment. Again, at page 11 of the report, I find that the third recommendation of the Committee readsThat a bonus of 3d. a gallon be granted on power alcohol, in order to encourage its manufacture and to develop the primary industries on which a supply of the necessary raw material depends. I do not pretend to see any other meaning in that but a recommendation of a bounty.",26
76,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The honourable member is not quoting from the report of the Publio Accounts Committee, but from a quotation contained in it .",26
77,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I see my mistake, but the committee has included this recommendation' in its report. In. the paragraph following that which the honourable member quoted from page 11 of the report, the Public Accounts Committee saysIt was stated, however, that there would appear to be little difficulty in establishing power-alcohol industry in Australia by using molasses as the raw material, but as the quantity of spirit which could be produced under existing conditions would not meet one twentyfifth of Australia's demands, it was necessary to direct attention to other sources of raw material, such as the cultivation of certain starch-bearing crops which offer possibilities in the production of alcohol. But as suitable raw materials are either not yet cultivated at all in Australia', or are cultivated on only a comparatively small scale, and as the margin of ... profit available when using such material for the distillation of power alcohol, will initially I at any rate be small, it would - probably be necessary to afford certain facilities and inducements to attract the requisite capital and enterprise. Nevertheless, motor fuel derived from molasses has been manufactured and used in Australia. - I have For a considerable time past molasses has been ihe source of power alcohol. The honourable member for Perth stated that laboratory experiments are often discounted when an attempt is made at their practical application. But no one would for a moment suggest that the production of power alcohol from the distillation of fermentation of starch-bearing products has not gone beyond the laboratory stage. Power alcohol was manufactured in Germany 21 years ago, and today in the United States of America, 648,000,000 gallons a year are being produced. The honourable member for Perth .will admit that the extraction of spirits from starchbearing products has long passed the laboratory stage, and has reached the stage of practical application in almost every civilized community in the world. I venture to suggest that one might almost test the advanced state of the civilization of a country by the amount of industrial alcohol it produces. I have here an extract which perhaps escaped the notice of the honourable member for Perth, taken from this morning's Argus. The following telegram appears under the headings, "" Power alcohol-Queenslan d Distilleries "" :Cairns, Queensland, Tuesday - The Babinda and Mulgrave sugar mill suppliers have authorized the two companies to join with the International Sugar and Alcohol Company and the Distilleries Company Limited, for the erection of a power alcohol distillery at Gordonvale at an estimated cost of approximately Â£70,000, half of which will be found by the companies, and half locally. As a result of negotiations with representatives of British distillery companies and the chairman of the Plane Creek sugar mill,-it has been decided to form the Australian National Power Alcohol Company, with a nominal capital of Â£1,000,000, and proceed immediately with the erection of the two distilleries, one in the Plane Creek district, Mackay, and another in Cairns. A third, it is hoped, may be erected next year in the Burdekin district.",26
78,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,Then why do they want a subsidy ?,26
79,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"It is anticipated that power alcohol can be produced from molasses. That is a seasonal product, which so far has not been obtainable in quantities sumcient to keep a distillery' employed continuously. Because'of the suitability of the climatic conditions, it was decided to supplement the supply of molasses with cassava, which grows luxuriantly in the Mackay district. Those who introduced it first ascertained from other countries that their venture would be economically possible. Honourable members should not be swayed by the short extracts which the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) read from the report of the Public Accounts Committee. The Government is to be congratulated on the introduction of the measure. Its action has already stimulated the enterprise, and has led to the introduction of new capital.",26
80,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Capricornia) [4.33] - I tan not at all satisfied with the amount that the Government proposes to appropriate, but I shall not oppose the bill, be- cause it goes a little way towards carrying out in Queensland what is really an experiment. If the Government had given effect to the recommendation of the In stitute of Science and Industry in July, 1920, to have investigational work carried out, a very informative report upon this .national matter would by now have been available. It has miserably failed to tackle the matter properly. The sum of Â£5,000 per annum over a period of five years is infinitesimal.",27
81,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,That is the amount for which the State Labour Government of Queensland asked.,27
82,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,The honourable member is in error if he thinks that the Queensland Government does not desire to go further than this bill proposes to go.,27
83,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I did not make that suggestion. What I said was that the Government is granting the amount which was asked for. Mr.'FORDE - This amount was recommended by the Tariff Board, not by the Queensland Government. At the request of the Plane Creek Mill, that Government guaranteed a sum of Â£25,000 for the erection of a distillery. The following is a quotation from the report of the Tariff Board :After very careful consideration of all the evidence available, including the results of the expert examination made by the Institute of Science and Industiy into the question of the production of pnwor alcohol in Australia, the board has no hesitation in recommending that a bounty at the rate of 4d. per gallon.be paid ' on all - power alcohol produced in Australia - from, cultivated crops, including molasses, the t roduct of sugar cane, 'and' that such - bounty extend over a period of five years, commencing on the 1st January, 1926, subject to the understanding that the amcunt of the bounty to be paid to the applicant company shall not exceed Â£25,000 uvor a period of five years. A further condition cf payment of bounty is that the Minister for Trade and Customs shall be satisfied that a leagonable price was paid I ir the material used in . the manufacture of r powtr alcohol, in respect of which bounty is claimed, and that the price includes.an amount which is the equivalent of not less than one -]:o;iny of the bouj'-y payable.  suggest that clauses 6 and 7 offer opportunities for the honourable member to bring up the questions that he is now raising, and which are outside the scope of clause 3. . The CHAIRMAN (Mr Bayley) I have been following the speech of the honourable member for. Capricornia. Ho has used a quotation from the report if the Tariff Board merely as an illustration "" to support his contention that the proposed appropriation should be larger than it is. He has not been dealing in detail with the production of power alcohol.",27
84,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The Government would be justified in paying a bounty of Â£250,000 a year for four years in order to establish a great national industry that . would supply half of Australia's requirements ofmotor fuel. Last year Â£5,700,000 was spent in Australia in the purchase of 82,000,000 gallons of motor spirit. Queensland has all the raw products for the manufacture of power alcohol on a large scale. The Government did not have the matter sufficiently investigated. Had it done so, I believe that the amount of the appropriation would have been very much larger than is provided for in the bill. A visit to Queensland would have convinced the Tariff Board of the necessity for a larger appropriation. It took evidence in Sydney from Mr Board, the Australian representative of the In ternational Alcohol juid Sugar Company, of London, which is anxious to secure the bounty for itself, and from Mr Herbert' Powell, a director of Power Alcohol Limited, of Sydney. Before making a recommendation, the board should have, consulted Queensland experts in the sugar industry. One of those is Mr Seymour Howe, manager of the Mulgrave M ill, and another is Mr de Bavay, a recognized authority in Australia on power alcohol. The evidence which - those - gentlemen could have given would have .shown the hoard that, in Queensland, hundreds of thousands of tons of molasses suitable for the manufacture of power ,alcohol go to waste every year, and that, by their utilization, the over-production problem would be partially solved, This could be made a valuable by-product of .the sugar industry, which it could assist if it were utilized profitably, instead of bolstering up a wealthy company like Distillers Limited, which has a capital of something like Â£40,000,000. I speak in . the interests of the sugar-growers who .produce molasses. I do not want them to b'e exploited by the International Sugar and Alcohol. Company, by having their .product purchased for a mere song - If (they were given a bounty, the molasses - c6uld be treated, in their own co-operative (distilleries, and the profits which were earned would assist the sugar industry, ^nii.der the Shale Oil Bounty Act, the sum fjgf, Â£148,000 will .be .spent before the end of;, August .of. this year. Bounties have , been given"" to the. iron and steel, and dried i'fruits industries, to the extent of hun'dreis of thousands of pounds. This is a 'j very important industry, and it should *haye been thoroughly, investigated when 'investigation was recommended by the In stitute of Science andIndustry in 1920, 'and the oil fuel interests were prepared *to advance Â£5,000, if the Commonwealth ' Government would advance a similar amount for research work. That research would have enabled a comprehen- sive scheme to be formulated, and the "" establishment of the power alcohol industry in a big way would have followed. Industries like the sugar industry would then have, been tided over periods of de"" pression. ' Mr MANN (Perth) [4.41] - On e has some difficulty in advancing reasons .and against the clause, because one is pre\ eluded from.: dispussing many details. The honourable member for Herbert (Dr Nott), made a quotation from an article in a Melbourne newspaper , of today's - date. If the statements which ' read prove anything, they prove that there is no necessity for the proposed ' bounty. The capital already involved, proposed to be involved,'is enormous, and "" there is a widespread desire on the of different corporations to co-operate '-the production of power alcohoL principal company concerned has a capital of millions of pounds, yet' it is asking the Government to make available a paltry Â£5,000 a year! ' Dr NOTT - The idea is to make profit-. able the growing of cassava.",27
85,Mr MANN,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The granting of a subsidy does not make an industry profitable. If it did, banana-growing could be made profitable in the Arctic Ocean. It is not a business proposition to endeavour to establish an industry by giving artificialassistance by way of a subsidy. The quotation that was read by the honourable member for Herbert disclosed the fact that already a large number of persons think that this is a commercial proposition, and are willing to risk their capital - in the production of power alcohol.  must understand that the proposed bounty .relates to molasses. . Mr MANN - The honourable member for Herbert said that cassava growing had to be encouraged because molasses was only a seasonal crop, and that the bill would have that effect. Capital has already been invested to produce power alcohol from molasses, and the people interested do not desire a bounty to help them; but because they wish cassava to be grown in order to improve their business, we are being asked to provide them with a bounty. If they had only molasses to treat in their distilleries, they would have an off season, but, notwithstanding that, they have begun business. Now that they are proposing the. growth of a new crop that would provide them with a raw material in the off season for molasses, and so enable them to keep their distilleries in operation all the time, a bounty is. to be paid them. If cassava be- comes a successful crop, the overhead expenses of the company will be reduced, for and their prospects improved. It ""is ' . ridiculous, therefore, that we should have this topsy-turvy proposition before us. I intend to vote against the clause, for it is most unreasonable. I hope that the Minister will make the position of the Governhe ment quite clear. Is it committed to the payment of this bounty ? In my opinion, the payment of the bounty will not necesor sarily improve the industry, or encourage research to develop it ; nor will it enable part the business, to be conducted on more in scientific lines. I can see no factor in the The. case which entitles the Government to provide a-bounty in this way.  Trade and Customs) [4.47J - The position is that this w a Government measure, submitted to honourable members for their approval. If the b i ll is passed, it will become law. The fact that the Government rhas introduced it is prima facie evidence - that it wishes it to be passed. If the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) would read the pamphlets issued by the Institute of Science and Industry, he would learn that our best prospect of producing power alcohol on a profitable basis from vegetable growth of a starchy character is by the use of cassava, and the purpose of the bill is to encourage cassavagrowing in Queensland in commercial quantities. If cassava is so produced, the interests engaged in the production of power alcohol there will have a subsidiary raw material to use in the off season for molasses, and so will be able to use their distilleries to the fullest capacity.",28

The company is quite prepared to produce power alcohol from molasses without a bounty, but it desires that a bounty shall be paid on power alcohol produced from cassava in order that the growth of cassava may be encouraged.",29

The M in ister has told us that this bill has been introduced because it is a Government measure; and that if it is passed it will become law.

I do not agree with all the arguments submitted by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann). He looks at the matter from one stand-point and I from another.; but the measure appears to be just as unsatisfactory from his point of view as it is from mine. I am in favour of the payment of a bounty for the production of power alcohol from molasses, and I cannot understand, for the lif e of me, why provision has not been made for that. Possibly the reason will appear during our discussion of the remaining clauses.' Clause agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to.

The report of the ; .Public Accounts Committee on our oil prospects gives prominence to the sh'ife deposits in New South Wales and Tasmania, from which fuel of l is'-; already being produced; but the amount of bounty paid on the fuel oil produced from.' thege sources is less than that proposed to pie paid for power alcohol produced from cassava. In my opinion such a differentiation is not only unfair, but also unconstitutional. I hope that the Minister will give me an assurance that the amount of bounty payable on the fuel oil produced from shale will be increased to 4d. per gallon. If he does not do so, I in tend to move that a new clause be inserted with the object of achieving that object. It seems to me that the source from which liquid fuel is produced in Australia should be a matter of indifference to us, so long as it is produced. At any-rate the Government should be prepared to treat all States alike. Cassava is a crop of which we know very little in Australia. A proposal will be made at a later stage in the bill to provide a bounty for the production of power alcohol from the prickly pear. I shall probably be told that shale can be obtained more cheaply than, either cassava or prickly pear, but the reverse is the fact. Irrespective of that altogether, I hold that the bounties payable in the various States for producing liquid fuel should be on the same scale.  I wish to point out to honourable members that the bounty payable on the production of crude oil from shale is 3^d. per gallon, and that that is much more advantageous to Tasmania than would be a bounty of 4d. per gallon upon refined petrol produced from shale. Clause agreed to. Clause 6No bounty shall be authorized to be paid under this act on any power alcohol unless it has been manufactured from the following products grown in Australia:Cassava, sweet potatoes, arrowroot, or such other cultivated starch-bearing plants as the Minister approves.",29
89,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Capricornia) [4.57] Tho amount appropriated for the purposes of the bill should be increased to provide, as suggested by the right honourable member for Nort h Sydney (Mr . Hughes), that the bounty shall be payable on power alcohol produced from molasses, as well as on that produced from cassava, sweet potatoes, arrowroot, or other cultivated starch-bearing plants approved by the Minister, including prickly pear. If the Government would agree to amend the clause to provide for that, it would enable the Queensland sugar-growers to solve the problem of over-production. The assistance which the industry has received from the Commonwealth and State Governments has enabled it to expand to such an extent that it is now able to produce far more sugar than Australia requires. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) when Prime M i nister always equitably dealt with the Queensland sugar industry. To-day there is an over-production of sugar of 180,000 tans per annum. The production is about 500,000 tons, and the Australian consumption is about 320,000 tons. The .board appointed by the Commonwealth Government to fix the price of sugar based on the cost of production decided on Â£ 2 7 a ton. The Sugar Board appointed under the Queensland act of parliament deducts Â£ 1 fro m that Â£ 2 7 a ton, and places it into a f u n d to meet the loss incurred on the export of the surplus sugar. The sugar-growers, therefore, receive a maximum of Â£ 2 6 a ton. In view of the over-production of 180,000 tons per annum, it was necesjsary for the Queensland Sugar Board to pay the growers on the basis of Â£ 2 6 a ton for 60 percent, of production, and of Â£ 9 10s. a ton for the remaining 40 per cent, of production. That considerably reduced the average price paid to the sugar-grower, and today he is in a very bad way. Last year a great number of the sugar-growers averaged only Â£ 2 10s. per week income for the whole year, owing to over-production. The sugar industry, therefore, is not in a flourishing condition. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to extend the bounty to power alcohol manufactured from molasses so as to enable the co-operative mills engaged in the sugar industry to establish their own distilleries for the manufacture of power alcohol for use in Australia. If legislation were then passed compelling the retailers of motor spirit to mix with it a certain percentage of power alcohol, the whole of our output would be absorbed, and this would give a beneficial impetus to the Queensland sugar industry. Recently, at Mackay, a conference was held respecting the sugar in dustry and the manufacture of power alcohol. At that conference Mr A . J . Draper, who I understand is the chairman of the Northern Power Alcohol Committee, moved the following resolution: That, in the opinion of this, the first conference of sugar-growers in Queensland, under the auspices of the Queensland Producers Association, representations should be immediately - made to the Federal Government as follow:(1) Tliat sufficient protection by way of bounty should be granted to encourage the manufacture of power alcohol from vegetable matter within the Commonwealth, with a view to its ultimate permanent establishment to supply Australian requirements for liquid fuel. (2) To pass the necessary legislation making provision for the blending of the Australian product with imported mineral fuel until .the economic balance is established to render this no longer necessary. (3) That this conference appreciates and endorses the efforts of the Northern Power Alcohol Committee in its desire to find a solution for the serious loss accruing through the large over-production of sugar-cane, and (a) approves of the association of surplus sugar cane, with the waste molasses for the manufacture of power alcohol with the existing sugar cane milling plant; (b)- that the endorsement of the brochure prepared by the Northern Power Alcohol Committee by such an eminent practical chemist as Mr de Bavay, the Australian authority on distillation, is sufficient justification for this conference to approach both the Federal and State Governments, with all confidence, and ask their full-hearted co-operation on this great national question, which. is of such vital importance to the future commercial and industrial life of Australia.",30

91,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,On the 18th January of this year.,31
92,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,Does the honourable memgreat ber know that there have been two conlic ferences on the same subject held since then ?,31
93,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I am making my to speech in my own way, and the honorbut able member, if he thinks fit, may later throw further light on the subject. is wrong to say that the Queensland sugar-growers do not want a bounty power alcohol manufactured from molasses. The growers who produce sugar cane should profit by the utilization of land? its by-products, and should therefore receive first consideration from this Government. Under this bill, we propose to give the International Sugar and Alcohol Company a bounty of Â£25,000 on all power alcohol manufactured by ally. its distilleries in Australia. Board, the representative of that comTo-day pany, is a very astute gentleman. He knows that in Queensland there is a limited market for power alcohol, and, given twelve months or two years' start on the local growers, he will have entered into contracts for the sale of all power alcohol that can be absorbed in Australia. I doubt whether the sugarcompany's growers can come in two years after present company has started operations and successfully get the market. Because of the limited quantity of molasses duced every year, Mr Board, in two years' time, will have captured the market. He will offer for molasses a nominal which the growers will have to accept, only alternative being to pour the molasses into the fields. Since the sugar conferbounty ence was held in January there has been a change of opinion. Mr Draper and others have realized that it is better to growers. compromise with Mr Board than to tain nothing at all. It is evident that they realise that no distillery established by the sugar-growers will be able to capture the market in two years' time. Mr M . CAMERON - What market I",31
94,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The market for power alcohol. Mr M . CAMERON - The market whole of Australia. ! Mr Forde - Yes , but the demand will be limited owing to prejudice and infiuenae of the oil combine. The comarticle pany will have to rely for its raw material chiefly on the molasses that, is now being thrown away. I am doubtful whether cassava will ever be grown in quantities. The report of the PubAccounts Committee shows that the cost of producing cassava is Â£2 a ton. That committee states that it is difficult get any figures bearing on the subject, considers that cassava would be quite as expensive as arrowroot to produce. The It Queensland Department of Agriculture estimated the cost of production of cason sava at Â£1 7s. 2d. a ton.",31
95,Mr THOMPSON,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,Has cassava ever been produced commercially in Queens-',31
96,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"No - Cassava has for many years been produced commercially in Java and other places, but in Queensland it has never been grown commerciTwenty years ago some was Mr grown in the vicinity of Mackay. in that district cassava is planted on about 300 acres. It takes from eight to twelve months for cassava to be ready for cutting^ and it will cost quite as much as arrowroot to produce. Arrowroot costs Â£2 a ton to produce, and Mr Board will be able to pay to the growers of cassava only 19s. 6d. a ton for their product. The distillery is being erected in the the vicinity of Plane Creek mill.",31
97,Mr FENTON,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,White people cannot prolive under those conditions.,31
98,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"That is so. The bill provides for a bounty of 4d. a gallon, sum which means 2d. a gallon to the grower. the As 39 gallons of power alcohol can be manufactured from a ton of cassava, the will be 6s. 8d., and this added to 19s. 6d. paid by the company, provides a sum of Â£1 6s. 2d. a ton to be paid to the I have discussed this matter obwith sugar-growers in the Camilla and Flaggy Rock districts. A good number of them send their sugar cane to the Plane Creek mill, and they say that they will not be able to produce cassava at. any price under Â£2 a ton. Mr M . CAMERON - They will not be is the able to do it at that figure.",31
99,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"That is so. On page 14 of the report of the Public Accounts Comthe mittee on this subject is an interesting written by G. W. Monier-Williams, dealing with the production and utilization of power alcohol. In i the statesCassava possesses the disadvantage, common to many root crops, of requiring considerable manual labour for cultivation and harvesting. The tubers are long and spreading, and can only be ploughed out with difficulty. Usually it is necessary to pull them up by hand or dig them out. They quickly decay after harvesting, and cannot be stored for subsequent distillation unless thoroughly dried. dried cassava roots exported to France from French colonies were valued at about Â£5 to Â£6 a ton. This would correspond to approximately Â£1 10s. to Â£1 16s. per ton for the fresh roots. At this figure the raw material for one gallon of 95 per cent, alcohol would cost about Is., corresponding with maize at Â£4 6s. a ton, That authority points out that a most expensive crop to grow; consequently I am not at all optimistic that this venture will he successful. I sure that the basis for the manufacture of power alcohol will be molasses. If bounty of 4d. a gallon on power alcohol produced from molasses had been given, and if this proposition had not been stricted to Â£25,000, the growers would have been able to start their own distilleries and to obtain profits from them. This, to a large extent, would have solved time, a comprehensive the problem of the over-production sugar. Resolution No . 4, moved by Draper at the Sugar-growers' Conference held at Mackay on the 18th January for of this year, reads as follows:' That in order to afford the maximum sure of relief to the sugar industry, perative that its by-products, i.e -, molasses, &c, be utilized to the fullest advantage to buttress the industry itself, as a whole, by the creation of another key industry directly associated vious occasion. with sugar, and which would further stimulate agricultural development of tropical coastal belt, which is so essential the success of the great White Australia policy. It is, therefore, clear that in the sugar districts of Queensland there was disfactured tinct hostility to the action of the vernment in introducing this bill in present for m . I received numerous sages on the subject, not all of which were Company, from my own electorate. Mr E . Hunter, of Innisfail, wrote to me on the 15tli July, 1925In my humble opinion, the bill should withdrawn, and a thorough investigation made industry. into the whole subject. These English comlishing panies with millions of capital are not here to help our farmers. It is the thin edge of the wedge. They want a monopoly of our molasses. . Mr Forde. Mr W . J . MCLennan, sugar-grower, of Sarina, wrote that the proposal was not in the interests of the industry, as the company would get from the molasses profits which should go to the growers to help them . through the period of overproduction. On the 27th July last Mr . Seymour Howe, manager of the Mulgrave Sugar M ill , North Queensland, teleIn 1913, graphed to meBill should be postponed pending further valuable information, otherwise grave injustice sugar industry. Certainly alcohol from any vegetable source, such as sugar-cane, containing molasses should be entitled 'bonus assist to permanently establish such an important key industry. Consider no concession' or monopoly should be granted exclusively any cassava is person or corporation.",31
100,Mr MACKAV,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Why does the honoram able member "" stone w all "" the bill?",32
101,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I am not ""stone-walla ing,"" but I desire to avail myself of this opportunity to point out that the Government, instead of proposing this triflin g rebounty, should have carried out the in vestigation recommended by the Bureau of Science and. Industry in 1920. If it had induced Parliament to appropriate Â£5,000 for that purpose at that and detailed of report by a board of experts would Mr have been before us, and the Government would have been obliged to ask a substantial appropriation for the payment of a bounty upon the production meaof power alcohol, from not only cassava, it is imbut molasses also.",32
102,Mr MACKAT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,'The honourable member delayed the passage of this bill on a pre,32
103,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"That statement is Australia's for ridiculous. When this b i ll was introduced in July last I supported it , but expressed regret that the Government had not extended the bounty to power alcohol manufrom molasses as asked for by Go the Queensland sugar-growers. I pointed its out the danger of giving this bounty to mesthe International Sugar and Alcohol an off-shoot of Distillers Limited . London, the big whisky combine, which has a capital of Â£40,000,000, thus enabling them to get a start on the be growers .and reap"" profits out of the This company is not estabitself in Australia in order to help coming the growers in Queensland to overcome the difficulties of over-production; its purpose is to exploit the growers, as far as it is allowed. Because I drew attention to these facts members opposite said, during the election campaign, that I opposed the establishment in Queensland of a big national industry. As a matter of fact, the machinery for Mr Board's company is only due to arrive in Australia, and seven or eight months must elapse before the cassava, planted in the Mackay district, will be ready for cutting. Therefore, the statement that my advice to the Government in Jul y last delayed the establishment of a great industry in Queensland is not true. The Government had 46 members as against Labour's 29. Seymour Howe said, at Gordon Vale, on 14th July, 1925Mr Board, of the International Sugar and Alcohol Company, made it quite clear that tha whole of the molasses produced in Queensland would be quite insufficient to permit. of their producing power alcohol to the extent necessary to supply Australia's needs, which was their objective; and further stated his company would not be prepared to enter upon the undertaking without having a right to ultimately secure the whole of the Queensland molasses. His facts and figures, upon which they based their decision to become identified with the initial experience in the Mackay district, are directly associated with the opposition of entirely absorbing the whole of the molasses. The company's object is not to help the sugar-growers to get all the profits from the by-products of their industry and place it on a better footing; its aim is to make profits out of the growers' produce. Mr M . CAMERON - If the molasses "" not utilized now, will not this new venture be in the interest of the sugar industry?",32
104,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Certainly , a great tity of molasses goes to waste now. Mr M . CAMERON - Then why quarrel with the International Sugar and Alcohol Company ?",33
105,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I want the bounty to be extended .to enable the growers is to establish their own distilleries. The company will offer a nominal price for the molasses. If profits can 'be made by the production of power alcohol from molasses, why not exto them. tend the bounty to that product, and so enable the sugar-growers to establish tilleries and secure the profits for ' selves ? I do not believe in speculative proprietary oompany to come in and fleece the growers. Mr Board will be able to dictate terms to the of the sugar cane. At the present time, there is no market for molasses, but if honourable this bounty is extended to power alcohol, manufactured from molasses, the growers'will be encouraged to establish their own. distilleries. They realise that if Mr Board's company gets a two years' start, it will capture the Australian market. For some years there is bound to be a great prejudice against power alcohol in . Australia, and that feeling will be fostered by the pro-' paganda of the great oil corporations. In consequence, the market for power alcohol will be limited for a number of years, and this measure will give to one big company Mr two years in which to establish itself. Beading between the lines, I can see that the Queensland sugar-growers realise that it is better to co-operate with Mr Board's company than to be excluded entirely from the benefits, of the new enterprise. But instead of the profits going to this wealthy English company, I would prefer the whole of them to be reaped by the growers through their co-operative mills and distilleries.",33
106,Mr MACKAY,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,Will there be no room for the co-operative distilleries?,33
107,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"No , because for years the market for power alcohol will be limited unless the Government will f o l low the example of France, and introduce legislation compelling the retailers to mix power alcohol with motor spirit.",33
108,Dr NOTT,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,That was done merely for . the sake of economy during the war.,33
109,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"It was absolutely is necessary, otherwise the power alcohol would not have been sold at all. I predict that the cost of production will in quancrease considerably the price of power alcohol in Australia, and the retailers will be threatened by the oil corporations that supplies of motor spirit will be withheld if they sell power alcohol. If the cooperative distillers have to take only what left of the market after Mr Board's company has obtained two years' start, and has secured contracts with, the biggest consumers, they may expect only losses instead of the profits which should accrue  disthat half of the capital of the Interthemnational Sugar and Alcohol Company has allowing a been subscribed in Australia.",33
110,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,I am certain that the Australian capital does not come from the producers Queensland sugar-growers.,33

112,Mr FORDE,AND COMPULSORY MILITARY,"It may come from other persons who are interested in the try. The great m a j o r it y of growers have no monetary interest in at all. I desire the grower the cane to the mills to get all the profits . from the new industry, instead of being ' again exploited, as he was when the ' Colonial Sugar Refining Company conconsidered trolled the industry. In proof that - question is a live one, I quote the followpower ing letter received by the Leader of Opposition (Mr Charlton) a few days ago, from the Maryborough District Countain cil of the United Cane Growers' Associaof tion :NA CANE-OROWERS ASSOCIATION. Dear Sir, The Maryborough District Council United Cane-growers Association, representing - on 1,000' cane-growers supplying cane to Maryborough, Mt.

I yours respectfully, I ask honourable members not to regardlarger appropriation. the action of the Northern Power Alcohol Committee in joining with Mr Board for the purpose of assisting him to establish a distillery in the north as an indication that the sugar industry generally approves of the action of the Government in fining the bounty to power alcohol factured from cassava. The growers bespirit lieve that it should be extended to the duct of molasses also, so that the 40 cent, surplus production of sugar may utilized. According to Mr Seymour Howe, if the bounty were extended to molasses, Â£2 a ton could be paid for siigaT cane for the manufacture of power alcohol. Under present conditions, the sugar- Â£20,000,000. growers get an average return of f r 12s. 6d. to Â£ 1 a ton for the surplus sugar-cane. Mr Howe is a recognized TATIVES.J .

J. F. De Bavay, consulting chemist, whose scientific research and processes are a feature of Australia's industrial development, informed the committee that he the utilization of molassen this provided the best means whereby the alcohol industry could be estabthe lished in Australia. He had studied the problem for many years, and had recently discussed the economic practicability of 'cerschemes put forward by representatives the sugar-growers in the Cairns district.known as the Northern Power Alcohol Gommittee, whereby it was proposed to so treat the Queensland sugar crop that a greater quantity of molasses would be available and be used in the production of alcohol in order to lessen the loss on the surplus sugar exjust ported. The committee was informed at a later stage of its inquiry that although the sugar producers proposed to further utilize molasses for the production of alcohol, the profolject concerning the exportable surplus was possible being held in abeyance. I have myself discussed this matter with of . Mr De Bavay. He still considers that Mr . from Seymour Howe's scheme is a very good Comone. F r o m this I take it that Mr Seyultimour Howe, who is manager of the M u l of the grave m ill in Northern Queensland, must rebe a very disappointed man because of be enthe decision of the Government - not to the make this measure sufficiently comprer hensive to cover a bounty on power alcohol manufactured from molasses. The amount of the appropriation proposed in this bill (Signed)' L. MEROABD, Secretary. is insufficient to enable that to be done. The Minister should have asked for a A bounty of Â£5,000 per annum would cover a production of only 300,000 gallons per annum. The Queensland requirements alone of motor spirit amount to 8,000,000 galconlons. When ono considers the wonderful manuincrease in the importations of motor from 34,000,000 gallons, valued at pro- Â£3,100,000, in 1921-2; 67,000,000 gallons, per valued at Â£4,200,000, in 1923-4, to be 82,000,000 gallons, valued at Â£5,700,000, in 1924-5, one may reasonably assume that in ten years' time our requirements will reach 200,000,000 gallons, valued at Â£14,500,000, and retailed probably at The Queensland sugaro m growers are not at a ll satisfied that cassava can be grown profitably. They say, "" We have been producing sugar cane for the last 50 years, and understand its production. There is now an overproduction of sugar, and why should not the hounty on power alcohol be extended to alcohol manufactured from molasses so that we may be enabled to establish cooperative distilleries and secure all the profits for those engaged in the sugar industry."" Too many of the primary producers of Australia are exploited by people who jump in and secure the profits from by-products of their industries. In common with the members of the party to which I belong, I stand for cooperation. Instead of assisting great proprietary companies to exploit the sugar-growers of Queensland or any other Australian primary ^producers, the Government should have proposed to extend the bounty to power alcohol manufactured from molasses. It should have convened a conference representative of the best brains amongst the sugar growers of Queensland, the Institute of Science and Industry, one Federal minister and one from Queensland, and representatives of the sugar associations of Queensland to discuss the whole question before proposing to pay a bounty tc Mr Board, of the International Alcohol and Sugar Company. That was not done, and Mr Board came along and secured the ear of the Minister. The honourable gentleman said that, under this bill, no monopoly will be given to any one; but he must recognize that practically a monopoly will be given to the gentleman who is permitted two years' start of the sugar-growers of Queensland in the manufacture of power alcohol. He will be able to dictate his own terms to the sugar-growers. At the present time, there is no market for molasses. Most of it is used as manure. This company will be able to sign up long contracts with the sugar-growers for the sale of molasses. Assuming that the Minister is right when . he says that the company will get only half the profits made from the manufacture of power alcohol from cassava and . from molasses, for which it will pay a merely nominal sum, I say that that is half too much, because all the profits should be divided amongst those"" engaged in the sugar industry. They should go to the men who, in many cases, felled the . scrub, and prepared their farms in the face of great difficulties. They have been so efficient in the production of sugar that today our sugar production exceeds the consumption in Australia, and the surplus must be exported to the world's markets, where it is in competition with sugar produced in Java and F i j i , and other places where labour is paid Is. a day. The Government having failed in its duty, the representatives of the sugar growers realise that it is better that they should secure an interest in this business by joining in with Mr Board, than that they should receive no consideration at all. The Government proposes to permit Mr Board to establish his distilleries, and to pay him a bounty on the production of power alcohol. It is useless to suggest that the bounty will not be confined to him, and that other distilleries will receive a share of it , because the amount proposed to be devoted to the purpose of this bill is infinitesimal when compared with the bounties-amountin g to hundreds of thousands of poundspaid in respect of other manufactures. The sugar-growers know that if the In ternational Alcohol and Sugar Company gets a footing in Queensland, and they do not now insist upon acquiring a share in its management, they will get very little consideration from such a combine. They realise that the best they .can hope to get now is a share in the profits of this company. I say that that is not enough, and that proper encouragement should have been given to the Queensland sugar industry, to start ita own distilleries.",34

114,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I am contending that the bounty should not be restricted to power alcohol manufactured from cassava, but should be extended to that manufactured from molasses. Instead of the sugar-growers getting some of the profits, they should get the whole of them.

What is proposed is to enable the whisky combine of England to establish a subsidiary company in Queensland to secure profits from the sugar industry so desired. which should go to the Queensland sugar growers.",36
119,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Does the honourable member believe that people will bring capital into Australia if they are not the measure. assured of profits?,36

The - Government proposal in this bill is to .confine the payment of the bounty Mr Board and the International Alcohol and Sugar Company, and to set aside the interests of those who do the real work in the sugar industry, whose interests, in my opinion, should be first considered. When representatives of the sugar-growersrealize that the Minister emphatically stated that the bounty would not be extended to alcohol produced from molasses, they saw that it would be better that they should get some share of the profits rather than none at all.

This, is all in the futureMr Board is to make a visit to Cairnsin March to talk the matter over with the Northern Power Alcohol Committee.

It is further significant that the honourable members for Perth and Capricornia attack the b i ll from different angles. The honourable member for Capricornia says that the appropriation proposed is not"" nearly sufficient, and should be Â£250,000 per annum. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), on the other hand, says that the amount stipulated is so trifling as to be unworthy of consideration - It is unfortunate that those two honourable members should have cooperated to delay the passaga of the bill.

125,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Because of the prejudice that will exist for some time against power alcohol.,37
126,Mr MACKAY,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"That prejudice is iDeing largely overcome. A quantity of power alcohol is. being manufactured at the Acetate of Lime Factory, in Brisbane, and distributed to various government departments. Eighteen months ago I was assured that a motor car in which I rode in Brisbane was driven by power - ialcohol which had been manufactured at the Acetate of Lime Factory, and the ro.sult was extremely satisfactory.",37
127,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,The American corporalions will use their influence to prevent power alcohol from being effectively marketed.,37
128,Mr MACKAY,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"If the statements made in a morning newspaper today are true, two companies in Queensland have combined and will command a capital of Â£1,000,000. They will be able to look after their own interests.",37
129,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"The whole of the profits should go to the growers, not to wealthy companies.",37
130,Mr MACKAY,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"The Institute of Science and Industry included in its report a list of a dozen or eighteen articles, including sugar molasses, from every ton of which at least 65 imperial gallons of power alcohol can be obtained, compared with 39 imperial gallons from a ton of cassava. Wheat will produce 83 gallons, barley 70 gallons, maize 85 gallons, and sorghum-grain-8 7 gallons. Each of those products can be grown as easily as cassava, and they are very much richer in their alcohol content. They are, however, more valuable for food purposes than for the production of power alcohol. The honourable member for Capricornia is afraid that the company which he named will take possession of the whole of the available molasses. He must be aware that molasses are not produced in one parhowticular spot only. It is estimated that the total-production in the various sugar districts of Queensland is 10,000,000 gallons-Brisbane , 375,000 gallons; Bundaberg, 2,525,000 gallons; Mackay, 1,880,000 gallons; Bowen, 1,300,000 gallons; Townsville, 750,000 gallons; and Cairns, 2,500,000 gallons. The impossibility of one company handling the whole of the production must be evident. Cartage for a considerable distance would not be a payable proposition. There will thus be room for many companies to operate. It is clearly pointed out in the report of the Public Accounts Committee that a company cannot expect to make a sucesss of its operations unless it has other crops upon which to work. I appeal for expedition in the passage of the measure. I am as sympathetic as the honourable member for Capricornia towards the sugar-growers, and I shall welcome the day when the Government can make a larger sum available. As there are persons who are prepared to put a large sum into the industry, let us give* this at r i a l and see whether success will attend their efforts. The Queensland Government has shown its sympathy by backing the venture to the extent of Â£25,000. It could justifiably have asked that the local people be consulted, or some other crop dealt with. The fact that it did not is an evidence that it is prepared to accept the measure as it stands.",37
131,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Macquarie) [5.52] Whenever this measure hag been before us, I have urged that it be passed without waiting for the report of the Publio Accounts Committee. The fact is frequently lost sight of that the bounty is to be paid only for a completed and satisfactory article. We would have been well advised had we passed the bill when it first came before us. We cannot hope to induce outside capitalists to establish new industries in Australia unless they are allowed to make a profit. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) deprecated this action of the Government, because he believed that it would benefit a particular company, which he named. That company is not named in the bill, and it will not have the sole right to participate in the bounty.",38
132,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,The Minister explained that he introduced the bill because Mr. Board waited upon him and asked for it .,38
133,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"That was a very good reason for the introduction of the measure. If a gentleman offered to introduce into Australia capital for the establishment of a new industry, under certain circumstances, from what I know of the Minister he would welcome him. No one will invest capital unless he is allowed to make a profit on his enterprise.",38
134,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,The total sum is very small.,38
135,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,It is as small for that man as for any other. is nothing in the bill which will prevent other companies from participating in ths bounty. Every inducement should be given to capitalists to establish new industries and thus provide additional employment.,38
136,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Mr Board's machinery has not yet arrived.,38
137,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"If he is awaiting the passage of this bill, it will not arrive until that stage has been reached.",38
138,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,The Minister said that 1 the Government had promised him the bounty.,38
139,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"-That may be so. I ' ; take it that the Minister promised to introduce this bill, and to use the whole of the influence of the Government to have it passed.",38
140,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"There are 52 Government members, but only 23 members of the Opposition.",38
141,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Some Government members are not supporting the measure. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann), for one, cannot be regarded as its loyal supporter. The scope of the clause should be widened to enable experiments to be carried on with articles other than those which are specified. With that object, I propose to move an amendment to include prickly pear. If we can establish an industry to manufacture power alcohol from prickly pear, and the amount of the bounty is found to be too small, the Government can with justification increase it . Prickly pear is a greater menace to Australia than any of its other pests. It has a considerable hold of Queensland and a large part of New South Wales.",38
142,Mr FENTON,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Is it worse than the rabbit pest?,38
143,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Yes , and very much more difficult to cope with. If wei can establish an industry which will turn that very grave liability into an asset, we shall do an immense amount of good. Every encouragement should be given to action along those lines. I believe that honourable members would unanimously support an additional subsidy if it wero shown that this curse could be turned into a blessing. I move That after the word "" grown,"" line 4, the words "" or growing "" be inserted. If I did not move that amendment, I should be met with the objection that the products from which the power alcohol There was produced were such as had to be specially grown to enable the growers to participate in the bounty. The Minister has told us that the making of power alcohol in commercial quantities and at a reasonable price from prickly pear has not yet passed from the laboratory stage; but I urge the wisdom of amending the clause so that as soon as the laboratory tests are considered to be satisfactory, a start may be made with the work on a commercial basis. Dr Sinclair's report states that power alcohol could be produced from the prickly pear at Is. 3d. per gallon. If that is so, it would be a serious competitor against power alcohol made from 'the products' specified in the clause, and it is quite likely that no bounty would be needed to encourage its production; but it may happen that the cost of production will be practically the same as the cost of production from cassava and other crops, in which case a bounty would bo necessary. I hesitate to express an opinion on the proposal of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) that molasses should be included among the products set out in the clause, although I think it quite likely that our surplus sugar cane could be more profitably used for the production of power alcohol than for the production of sugar that must be sold at world's ' parity rates. I am anxious to see this bill passed as soon as possible, and I suggest to the honourable member that it would be of little use for him to have molasses in cluded in the products specified without very greatly increasing the amount of the appropriation - A good deal has been said about the",38
144,The CHAIRMAN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Mr Bayley) Before honourable members enter upon a discussion of the relative merits of the various plants from which power alcohol may be produced, I should like them to deal with the specifio amendment before them.",39
145,Mr GREGORY,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Swan) [ 6 . 8 ] - I do not think that a bounty ought to be paid for the production of power alcohol from cassava.,39

Trade and Customs) [6.9] - The words ""or g r o w in g "" would be necessary if the second amendment suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr . Manning) were adopted; but I wish to inform the committee that, for reasons which I will give later, I cannot accept his proposal ",39
147,Mr HUGHES,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,The word postulates a grower.,39
148,Mr SCULLIN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I should say that "" grown "" includes growing.",39
149,Mr FENTON,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Maribyrnong) [6.10] I suggest that the clause should be made to read in this wayNo bounty shall be authorized to be paid under this act on any power alcohol unless it has been manufactured from cassava, sweet potatoes, prickly pear, arrowroot, or other products that are grown in Australia.",39
150,Mr HUGHES,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I do not think that "" grown "" would exclude the prickly pear, but it might.",39
151,Mr FENTON,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"A p a r t altogether from the wording of the clause, I wish to give my support to the proposal of the honourable member for Macquarie that prickly pear should be brought within the provisions, of the bill. If the amount that the Minister has proposed for appropriation were not so small I should like to include a number of other products. We could test the proposal to include prickly pear, and have the clause redrafted afterwards if necessary. I am also in accord with the suggestion of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Forde) that the sugar-growers of Queensland, and anywhere in Australia that the industry may become established, shall be assisted by providing a bounty for power alcohol produced from molasses.  advisableness of widening the scope of the bill to provide for the payment of bounties on other products than those specified. When the measure was before us last year, I - was inclined to the view that it should be widened, but more mature consideration has led me to the belief that the Government's proposal to l i m it the payment of the bounty is wise. Molasses is, of course, the ideal raw material for the manufacture of power alcohol; and thousands of gallon* of it are being run to waste in Queensland each year-sufficient , in fact, to manufacture about 8,000,000 gallons of power alcohol. But a certain proportion of the molasses is run to waste in isolated districts, and it would not be profitable to attempt to use that. That will be the more readily appreciated when I point out that for every Â£ 1 per ton that is paid in freight for molasses, 4d. per gallon would need to be added to the price of the power ""grown"" alcohol that was produced from it . There will , however, be molasses available in centres in which it can be readily distilled sufficient to produce about 5,000,000 gallons of power alcohol. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), and also the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr . Hughes), have said that molasses should be included in the clause, but one very good reason why it should not is that the sugar-growers themselves have made no such request. The right honourable member for Nort h Sydney himself, had this matter arisen under his regime, would have regarded the fact that the bounty was not asked for as prima facie evidence that it was not required. It has to be remembered that molasses is today being run to waste. Surely it would be better for the growers to obtain some return for the molasses rather than nothing at all.",39
152,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Giv e the growers a bounty and let them have the f u ll results of their labours.  member has said a good deal about giving the growers the full results of their labours. He spoke of the company that is coming here as if it were an octopus ready to take from the sugar-growers something which rightly belonged to them. We must remember that this company will give to the sugar-growers the benefit of the latest technical knowledge of distillation, which has advanced to an extraordinary degree within recent years. The honourable member spoke about cooperation. He believed in co-operation. Evidently his interpretation of that word is that the sugar cane growers must obtain all the profits connected with the turning of their molasses into power alcohol. We should look upon co-operation in its broader and true sense. A company of distillers is coming here to assist us, not only with capital, but also with expert technical knowledge. Even though the company itself may benefit to some extent, it will surely confer benefits on those who provide the raw material. We have, therefore, true co-operation, in the provision on the one hand of technical knowledge, and on the other hand of raw material. There is every reason to believe that power alcohol can be produced on a commercial basis from molasses. By a commercial basis, I mean a basis that does not require propping up by means of a bounty. The proposal to erect the distillery close to the sugar mill will make it unnecessary to have two steam-raising plants. One plant will suffice for both the distillery and the sugar mill, because the sugar mill will be operating for half the year and molasses will be converted into alcohol in the off-season. This will provide for continuity of employment to workers whose usual employment is seasonable. I am informed that there is no difficulty whatever in storing molasses for the requisite time. The amount of fuel alcohol that is expected to be obtained from molasses in Queensland will be about sufficient to provide half of Queensland's needs. It has been said that power alcohol cannot compete commercially with petrol because it is not so well suited to the present day motor engines. That is quite true, but with the addition of a certain amount of ether and Colonial Oil Refining motor spirit a mixture is obtained that compares' favourably with petrol. While the importers of petrol sell their product in the capital cities at a flat rate, the price is very much increased in country centres. The distillation company will therefore have a big advantage in supplying motor spirit to the outback districts adjacent to the distilling plant. There is a very strong argument in favour of letting the production of power alcohol from molasses stand on its own. For one thing, a bounty has not been asked for. The growers are content to endeavour to manufacture it solely on a commercial basis, and, therefore, to begin with, it should rest on that basis. After the distilleries have increased in number, sufficient to make use of all the molasses which today is running to waste, is the industry to go no further? It is at that stage that the growing of cassava will really be given prominence. It would be too late to wait for several years until the whole of the molasses had been used, and then to wonder what should be done to provide further raw material. It is therefore' a wise step on the part of those interested and of the Commonwealth Government to make experiments now in the growing of cassava. Having had some little experience in the growing of potatoes, I have grave doubts that cassava for power alcohol purposes will ever be commercially grown under Australian conditions. That, however, can only be determined by experimenting in the. growing of cassava for a period of years. A conclusion based on the experience of one crop would be of no practical use. The provision in che bill for a bounty for five years is a reasonable attempt to encourage the growing of cassava, and to find out definitely whether it can be grown under Australian labour conditions on a commercial scale. It was mentioned by the honourable. member for Capricornia that cassava is a root crop with tubers from 18 inches to 4 feet long, difficult to plough up, and must be pulled out by - hand or dug out. One does not need a vivid imagination 'to realise that under Australian labour conditions cassava will be an expensive crop to harvest. W it h out an artificial stimulus I have grave doubts whether it can be successfully grown to be utilized only for poweralcohol purposes. The Government is absolutely justified in endeavouring to ascertain whether cassava can be commercially grown. The permanency of this bounty is another question. I doubt very much . whether benefit will be derived from some' thing which can be produced only by the permanent payment of a bounty. It is ' altogether a different proposition, however, to provide a bounty for a limited term to encourage an industry in its early stages. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) said something about producing alcohol from surplus sugar' cane. He must know that the proposals put forward by the Northern Power Alcohol Committee, although not alto'gether abandoned, are at least in ' abeyance, and that the is now standing right behind the Government's proposal to deal with waste - molasses and the growing of cassava. 1",40
153,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"The committee would ' prefer to deal with the whole matter, but Mr Board has the advantage and is erecting his plant.  doubtful whether the committee could effectively and efficiently deal with the whole matter without the assistance, advice, and technical knowledge of this company, which perhaps constitutes the last word in the science of distillation. honourable member must realise that this .company is conferring some benefit on Australia by coming here, not only with its capital, but with its knowledge. It ' will assist other new companies. honourable member for Herbert (Dr Nott) \ quoted a paragraph in this morning's Argus, portion of which readsThe Babinda and Mulgrave sugar mill suppliers have authorised the two companies to ""join with the International Sugar and Alcohol - Company and the Distilleries Company Limited for the erection of a power alcohol distillery at Gordonvale at an estimated cost of ap' proximately Â£70,000, half of which will be found by the companies and half locally. That paragraph shows that the' sugar 'cane-growers are really behind this pro; posal, and that for the time being, at any rate, the projects of the sugar canegrowers themselves have been abandoned. .The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) suggested that power alcohol manufactured from prickly pear should receive the benefit of this bounty. While experiments in this direction have advanced probably past the laboratory stage, they have not yet reached the stage of usefulness.",41
154,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Until that stage was reached no bounty would be paid.  true. A better purpose would be served by leaving the bill as it is, and if , later, the prickly pear proposition proves beneficial, an amending measure could be passed including prickly pear and increasing the bounty. If the clause were to in clude prickly pear, the bounty would be too small altogether, because there is an enormous field for exploitation if the experiments that are now being conducted with this plant prove successful.",41
155,Unknown,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.  committee ing extract from the report of the Public Accounts Committee:Concerning the experiments being conducted by Dr W. M. Sinclair to utilize prickly pear for the production of power alcohol, it can be said that the process has advanced beyond the laboratory stage, though much has yet to be accomplished before it becomes a commercial proposition. In Australia, an area of about 60,000,000 acres is covered with pear, and it is now increasing at the rate of 1,000,000 acres per annum. Of this area, over 10,000,000 acres are said to carry dense' pear averaging at least 100. tons to the acre. Assuming, therefore, that the witness's claim to produce 14 gallons of alcohol to the ton of pear is substantiated, The 890,000 gallons of alcohol would be obtained from each square mile of country carrying 100 tons to the acre, or 14,000.000,000 gallons from the densely covered area alone. In other words, the quantity of alcohol, The lying dormant in the densely infested prickly-pear country is equal to Australia's requirements of petrol for 140 years at the present rate of consumption. The report continuesThere is little doubt, therefore, that should success attend these efforts, the whole question of the production of power alcohol will be revolutionized. The persons interested in the process have already spent Â£15,000 in experimental and research work, and now claim to be ready to undertake work in the field provided they can obtain the necessary financial assistance, which they put down at Â£20,000Â£10,000 for. plant and Â£10,000 for contingencies - suc h assistance to b'e regarded as a loan only. The claims of this process are certainly at variance with the usually accepted theories as to the alcohol yield from prickly pear, hut the successful utilization of what is at present one of Australia's greatest pests would be of immeasurable value to the country, and the committee is of opinion that this process warrants expert investigation by the Government. Such an investigation would be welcomed by the patentee to prove his bona fides, and he has intimated his willingness to give the Government such control as is considered necessary for the purpose. It is therefore recommended that a qualified person, unbiased by preconceived ideas as to the possibilities of prickly pear for alcohol production, should be appointed to fully investigate the process, and subject it to a technical and critical tion, with a view to determining the extent to which the project should 'be helped if the claims are substantiated. That investigation should be made, and Parliament would then' be in a position to determine to what extent such proposals should be encouraged. The suggestion has been made that as soon as the bounty appears likely to be utilized for alcohol obtained from prickly pear, the amount of the appropriation will have to be i creased. That could be done by passing an amending bill to include prickly pear, and increase the appropriation if the sults of the investigation justified such ""an extension of the bounty. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Manning) regarding the desirability converting into a bjessing a plant that now a curse, but I do not concur in the method he suggests. As power alcohol' can be produced from molasses on a comthe mercial basis, no bounty is needed in spect of it . Moreover, a bounty has been asked for in respect of alcohol duced from that source, except by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde). I hope, therefore, that the bill in the bill. will pass in its present form.

Neither the resolution nor the bill itself limited the products from which power alcohol might be made. There is no prethe fatory definition clause or schedule this bill, and clause 6 merely specifies certain products from which power motion and alcohol may be manufactured.

My department, representing the Government, has done a good deal towards endeavouring to expedite the production in Australia of power alcohol, and to utilize the prickly pear to that end. I remind the committee that brochure No. 20, issued by the Institute of Science and Industry in 1921, contains a considerable amount of information regarding investigations made by the institute into the manufacture of power alcohol from the prickly pear. On page 26 of that brochure it is stated that at that time the manufacture of power alcohol from the prickly pear was not a commercial proposition. Investigations made by the Tariff Board prior to the introduction of this bill had the same result. One small company only was then experimenting. It promised to supply the department with some information of a practical nature within three months, but it has not yet done so. There was a further report from Mr , Hamlet, an analytical) chemist who at one time was Government Analytical Chemist for New South. 1 Wales, upon the only present proposal, to make power-alcohol from prickly pear,-inj - which it was stated that the investigations; had not progressed beyond the laboratory' stage.",44
172,Mr HUGHES,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"That report did not say that power alcohol could not be produced from the prickly pear.  whether power alcohol can be manufactured fro m the prickly pear, but whether it can be produced commercially. A few week's ago Dr Sinclair came to Melbourne with his secretary, and asked the Government to place at his disposal facilities for making experiments in connection with the production of power alcohol from the prickly pear. I gladly placed the Go-, vernment laboratory at his disposal. Experiments were made in the presence of members of the Public Accounts Committee, the Government Analyst, and myself. Later, I received a report from Mr Wilkinson, which, however, was not conclusive. As the result of that report, Dr Sinclair has requested that an officer be sent to Sydney to view experiments made by the company in its own laboratory. That I have promised to do. Clause '8 provides that no bounty shall be paid unless the requirements of the act, and the regulations have been complied with . What are those requirements? Clause 9 reads9. (1) Every claimant for bounty under this act shall supply with his claim a certificate showing(a) the material from which the power alcohol was produced; (b) the'name, of each supplier of that material; and (c) the quantity of that materia! purchased from, and the price paid there for to, each supplier. (2) Before any claim for bounty is paid the Minister may require the claimantto furnish, and the claimant shall thereupon furnish, such information as to the correctness or otherwise of the certincate supplied in - accordance with the last preceding sub-section as the Minister deems necessary. Clause 10 provides that the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty unless, he is satisfied that a reasonable price has been paid for the materials U3ed in the manufacture of . the power alcohol in .respect of which bounty is claimed. That price must include an amount equivalent to. not-, less than half of .the bounty paid. Honourable, members will see at once that this bill is intended for the purpose of developing the growing of further materials for the production of power alcohol. They must that a price equivalent to 2d. per gallon of alcohol produced could not be paid the growers of prickly pear. They must know that the production of power alcohol fro m prickly pear is of such paramount importance to the Commonwealth that price, any proposition put up to the Govern the ment to bring this about would have i stant attention. Clearly, any proposialcohol tion of the kind must deal with the quesits tion of acquiring the land from which prickly pear is cleared, and other quesis tions quite apart from the provisions this bill. The measure is designed, to deal with prickly pear, but with the starch-bearing products it refers to. It Manning). would be a responsibility of the Government to liberally assist any scheme for the eradication of prickly pear by utilizing it for the production of power alcohol.. In Queensland the Prickly Pear Board of Advice has taken no action whatever to produce power alcohol from the plant. am giving this committee the whole of information at my disposal. It seems me that honourable members will not deof sire to emasculate the bill, or divert it it. from its original purpose for these reasons. The Government cannot accept any amendment which will include prickly pear as one of the plants from which power alcohol entitled to the proposed Dounty may be made.",44
173,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Perth) [8.33],-The h ill could not be more emasculated than it is at present. It is a ridiculous founded upon absolute ignorance of the circumstances connected with the commercial production of power alcohol. have spoken strongly against the b i l cause it is one of the most ridiculous positions ever submitted in this House. nave already said that the technical profailed duction of power alcohol from prickly pear has really nothing whatever to with the commercial aspect of this matter. The real question is whether prickly pear can be cut, harvested and handled so to produce power alcohol from it on a commercial basis. I say that it cannot be handled commercially. The production of alcohol wil l in no way promote the def struction of prickly pear.",45
174,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,It is only a question money. It can be done if enough money is spent upon it .,45
175,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Why is it not done!,45
176,Mr MANNING,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Because it is too costly. MT . MANN - I know that it is. I resee peat that the fact that, alcohol can be produced from prickly pear does not alter to the commercial aspect of the matter. It may be said that from a certain quantity of prickly pear a certain amount of alcohol can be produced at a certain and that price is to be set against cost of the destruction of the prickly n - pear. That is not so. The price of the has to be set against the cost of production, and the cost of destroying the the prickly pear has still to be met. That common sense. It would be foolish of of the Government to lend itself to such an not amendment as has been moved by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr .",45
177,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,That is very strong language.,45
178,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I am aware that it is, but I am talking of what I know. The bill should be abandoned.

179,Dr NOTT,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Herbert) [ 8 . 4 0 ] - I greatly regret that the passage of the bill through committee is being delayed. I also regreat that the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) should have moved his amendment. He may have been in duced to do so by the action of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) in suggesting that the bill should provide bill , for the payment of bounty on power alcohol produced from molasses. In dealing with the matter the honourable memI l beber referred to several meetings of the proNorthern Power Alcohol Committee held I as far back as the 18th January. He to refer to meetings subsequent to that date. It seems to me that the hondo orable member has lost touch with the movement, and has also lost touch with what the Labour party in Queensland is as doing in connection with this matter.",45
180,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,I have not lost .touch with the sugar-growers of Queensland.,45
181,Dr NOTT,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I am in a position to quote r o m the official report, issued on the 5th of February of this year by the Power of Alcohol Committee. On the 18th of January, the meeting to which the honourable member for Capricornia referred was held. Subsequent to that the Power Alcohol Committee met on the 26th, of January to discuss the matter with Mr . MCCormack, Premier of Queensland. About the same time Mr Forgan Smith, Queensland Minister for Agriculture, was in touch with the committee. It held several meetings extending over several hours, and, as the result of much debate, a memorandum was drawn up and submitted to a meeting at which Mr Board, the representative of the Distillers Com sent. I should like to quote some of the conclusions set out in that memorandum. It says(1) That no difficulty is anticipated in the manufacture of power alcohol from molasses. (2) That the Northern Power Alcohol Committee's scheme for Mulgrave alone would produce, say, 60,000 gallons of power alcohol per week, and if Babinda joined in, this quantity would be doubled, or 120,000 gallons weekly. (3) That the consumption of motor spirit in ttie Cairns district is, say, half a million gallons per annum, or, say, 10,000 gallons weekly. (4) That after very careful inquiry and investigation we are convinced that, in view of the diverse and numerous obstacles associated with the marketing which would have to be overcome, it is not considered advisable at stage to risk the ultimate success of the whole nortliern movement. Then there is this conclusion, which is most pertinent to the present position(5) That the consensus of opinion of our well-wishers and friends was that an effort should be made to associate our movement with the National Sugar and Alcohol Company Limited and the Plane Creek Power Alcohol Company Limited, Mackay. The International Sugar and Alcohol Company is the company which the honourable member for Capricornia dramatically describes as an octopus that is coming here to paralyze the Queensland sugar industry.",45
182,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,I said nothing of the kind. What I said was that the profits it would get ought to go to the sugar growers.,46
183,Dr NOTT,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"The memorandum conQueensland tinues(6) With this object in view, arrangements have been made with Mr Board to visit Cairns in March next to discuss details of the proposed arrangements. (7) If these arrangements be carried cessfully through they will, of course, the establishment of the distillery in Cairns district, and as the distillery will be connected with, the .sugar mill, every tunity will be afforded to try out Mr Seymour Howe's scheme of utilizing syrups, which wa are convinced merits a proper trial. (8) In view of the foregoing, and pending further developments, it has been decided for the present to defer further approaching the Federal Government for their aid by way of bounty or other economic assistance. That was decided on as late as the 28th of January. On the following morning, although it was a public holiday, an appointment was arranged with Mr . MCCormack, the Queensland Premier, who met a deputation at 11 a.m. The report of the matter from which I quote says The Premier gave evidence of having thoughtfully considered the Northern Power Alcohol Committee's proposal. He stressed the great difficulty which confronted .the scheme in distributing the product and finding a market for it , and, furthermore, the powerful opposition generally to be expected from those already interested in the trade. This interview left an impression on the committee that most sympathetic treatment could be expected from the State Government provided something of a concrete nature was placed before them; hut the committee was reminded that the question of legislative assistance rested entirely witli the Federal Government. . . . The Premier thought it would be adthis vantageous for the Northern Power Alcohol Committee to give careful consideration to the advisability of co-operating in some form or other with the distilling companies with which Mr Board was connected, in view of their world-wide"" experience and undoubted resources being so invaluable in connection with the marketing and distribution.",46
184,The CHAIRMAN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I ask the honourable member not to read the whole of the report, but only such portions of it as are pertinent to the clause under discussion.",46
185,Dr NOTT,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I accept the direction of the Chair, but I did not wish to leave out any of the references to the Premier of Queensland or those which showed that the Northern Power Alcohol Committee had abandoned its previous proposal for a bounty on alcohol produced from molasses. I supported that when the bill was last under consideration, and it also received the whole-hearted support of the Premier. When the quotations I have made are taken into consideration, together with the information published in the Argus and the Sun News Pictorial of this morning, it will be seen sucthat there has been an amalgamation, involve and that a new name has been given to the the Distillers Company and Plane Creek .opporr Power Alcohol Company, and it is now called the Australian Sugar and Power Alcohol Company, and has a nominal capital of Â£1,000,000. Government of Queensland has guaranteed Â£25,000 of that amount. Surely the Queensland Government knows that the money is being transferred to the newlyformed company. The people concerned in the production of power alcohol from molasses are not asking for a bounty, and we have no evidence that the production of power alcohol from prickly pear has advanced beyond the stage of a laboratory experiment. The question could be dealt with in the way suggested by the honourable the Minister. On a subsequent occasion, it could be submitted to the House, and the inducements necessary to bring a desirable scheme to f r u i tion could then be decided upon. might as well include rice, bamboo, sago, tapioca, and other starch-bearing plants in this class as accept the amendment. I hope that the bill will pass throjjgh the committee without the pruning knife being used upon it . It offers inducements for which the people in the north of Queensland are asking. like to see the bounty paid on alcohol produced from .sugar, syrup, and molasses, but the persons concerned do not wish to stake the reputation of the industry by Asking for Federal assistance u n t i l they have proved beyond doubt that the production of power alcohol from those articles is more than an experiment.",46

187,Mr COLEMAN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has been misled in this matter. His amendment is practically useless, for it will not achieve the end he has in viÂ«w. It may be due to my ignorance of parliamentary procedure, or to some other cause, but it seems to me, Mr Chairman, that your The objection to the inclusion of the words "" p r i c k l y pear"" applies with equal force to the amendment now before the Chair. The amendment will extend the scope of the appropriation by giving a wider discretionary authority to the Minister.",47
188,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,It will give unlimited scope to the Minister.,47
189,Mr COLEMAN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"In the interests of the privileges of the committee, I seek your ruling on this matter. You objected to the inclusion of the words ""prickly pear,"" which would have extended the scope of the clause only slightly, but an amendment to give unlimited scope to the M in ister, and thereby, if it is given effect, likely to affect the destination of the One appropriation, has your tacit acceptance. How can the attitude of the Chair to the two amendments be reconciled ? I hope the position will be clarified, and that you w i ll give your reasons for accepting 'the amendment. The Minister does not approve of the amendment, and from that stand-point the matter calls for a ruling I should from the Chair.",47
190,The CHAIRMAN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Mr Bayley) When the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) moved his amendment, I ruled it out of order on the ground that it would alter the destination of the appropriation. I remind the honourable member that a message from the Governor General, recommending an appropriation of Â£5,000, was brought down to the House. The House passed a resolution, which was submitted to the committee. Certain members of the M in istry were instructed to bring in a b i ll in accordance with the terms of the resolution. That bill is. now before the committee. Clause 6 deals specifically with crops in respect of which the bounty There is no may be paid. When the honourable member for Macquarie moved his amendment, I ruled it out of order because it would alter the destination of the appropriation. The amendment now before the Chair for the deletion of certain words does not necessarily either increase, or alter the destination of, the appropriation. The first amendment was specific and definite; the second is quite indefinite. I therefore did not feel that it was competent for the Chair to rule, it out of order.' : Mr Charlton - W it h respect, Mr your ruling . Chairman, I cannot accept your ruling The acceptance of the amendment would the alteration of the appropriation, and , not increase the expenditure under the bill. I submit that the committee may tion of the appropriation. make any. amendment of the bill if the effect of it is not to increase the of the appropriation.

193,The CHAIRMAN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"The r e are two limitations to be considered. is that the total. amount of the appropose priation may not be exceeded, and the second, which must not be overlooked, that the destination of the expenditure may not be altered. If money ropriated for a specific purpose e expended for that purpose only. alcohol. When the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) moved his amendment I ruled it out of order two grounds. The first ground it would alter the destination of the appropriation, and I stated that I would not. accept an amendment that would enable the bounty to be paid on any item not specifically mentioned in clause 6. The only way in which an alteration be made in the clause is by bringing down a further message from the Goverout, nor-General. The amount was appromolasses priated for a specific purpose, and canbounty not be expended for any other purpose. Under the Standing Orders there is the nothing to prevent a further message from the Governor General being brought down.

Certain arguments may be urged in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning), but, as the hon can son), who is also the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has pointed a bounty on power alcohol made from is not sought. Before any such is paid this House should be consulted. If the amendment is agreed to, Minister will have the power to grant a bounty on the production of power alcohol from , molasses. The honourable ' first member for Gippsland read the reof the Public Accounts did Committee, which was made after the fullest inquiry into the matter, and it should receive the earnest consideration The committee strongly recommended that the. Government should institute an exhaustive investigation in impartial quarters to ascertain whether power alcohol can be produced from prickly pear. It also stated that a bounty was not the best way of rendering assistance, but that, on the contrary, a loan was favoured. .I am not - sanguine of the success of power alcohol production from cassava. I believe that it would be a failure. With the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), I ihink it is a pity that the Government has meddled with this matter. The cassava plant is grown by black labour, in tropical countries, under the most trying conditions. The estimated cost of production, about 19s. a ton, could not be realized.",48

Victoria, but it cannot be delivered to the mill at a cost less than Â£2 a ton; yet it can be gathered more easily than cassava. Mr Monier-Williams, who is an authority on the matter, has advised that the cassava root runs through the ground and cannot be ploughed out except with difficulty. When it has been gathered it has to be cleaned of the dirt that adheres to it. Our knowledge of Australian conditions should convince us that the cost of production would be at least Â£2 a ton. At that rate the price of petrol in Australia which is the highest in the world would be increased. The bill has not my sympathy.",49

If the committee, or individual members of it, desire to dissent from the Chairman's ruling, they have the perfectly clear course which is laid down in the Standing Orders and the practice of Parliament-that is, to take the action which you suggested to the honourable member for East Sydney, by giving notice of dissent in writing, and allowing the committee to decide the matter.

It would be far better if the Government were to build up the Institute of Science be and Industry to enable it to carry out be research work in the primary and secondary industries. The sum of Â£5,000 a year will be of very little value in the building up of this big industry in Queensland. It is more than likely that in a short period the"" Government will memcome down with the requestthat the assistance to that industry ,b.e increased.

Mr GREGOR if - The Institute has been in existence for eight or ten years. It has done the best it could with the limited funds which have been made available, but it has not had a sumcient amount to enable it to do good work. If the production of power alcohol from prickly pear could be made a commercial proposition, it would serve the two-fold purpose of providing us with a motor fuel and ridding us of the greatest pest that we have ever had. The Government, through the Institute of Science and In dustry, should assist those who are endeavouring to solve the problem that is presented by the prickly pear. assistance might enable them to put forward a definite scheme for the production of power alcohol from the pear. When the bill was discussed in the House six months ago, it was specially referred to the Public Accounts Committee for in vestigation and report. That committee took evidence, and reported in the following terms:Reviewing the evidence heard concerning the possibilities of various starch-bearing crops, the committee considers that there is room doubt as to whether such crops can be grown at a price which will permit of their being utilized for the production of alcohol on a commercial basis. Cassava, however, appears to be the most favourable of these ded it can be successfully cultivated at reasonable cost in the tropical parts of the State. Owing to the fact that the cultivation of this crop has not been hitherto attempted commercial scale in Australia, no evidence yet available on which accurate costs duction, its yield per acre or the alcohol tents of Australian-grown cassava can be based. The experiments with cassava being conducted in Queensland will no doubt give useful information which will form able guide for the future. AB certain commercial gentlemen in Queensland are prepared to find large alcohol sums of money in establishing the powermaterial alcohol industry, a bounty of Â£5,000 a year for five years, such as the would Government proposes to expend in this not instance, is merely a waste of money. It cannot do any good, and we shall no use to anybody. find that the cultivation of cassava or other starch-bearing crops for the production of power alcohol will be so expensive that Parliament, will be asked to provide further sums of money in order to carry on the work or to impose higher duties on liquid fuel imported into this country, which may be particularly in jurious to primary production in Australia. I am opposed to the amendment and also to the bill .",50
208,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Capricornia) [ 9 . 1 7 ] - I cannot understand the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Perth (Mr .

209,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,That is. not a fact.,50
210,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"It is the truth . I have no recollection of any measure being in troduced in this chamber for the paySuch ment of a bounty to assist a struggling secondary industry in its initial stages which has not been bitterly opposed by certain honourable members on the corner benches, and particularly those honourable members from Western Australia whose names I have mentioned. When I first became a member of this chamber I was struck by the anti-Australian attitude of those honourable members, and one's, first impression on hearing them speak, would be that one was in a foreign Parfor liament. If the power-alcohol industry 13 established in Queensland, as it undoubtedly will be, it will be of advantage not only to Queensland but also to the crops, proviwhole of Australia.",50
211,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,That does not follow.,50
212,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"It does. I regret that on a the Govermnent has not gone further. is It has been too niggardly in its proposals. of proI n support of that contention I quote conthe opinion expressed by Mr de Bavay, now who, when this bill was introduced in June of last year, is reported in the Mela valubourne Herald of 27th. June to have saidWith petrol at its present price, power cannot be made in Australia from any. whatsoever without a substantial bounty. Fourpence is not enough. Sixpence be. required for the first two years. If the bounty will only operate for five years, and exceed Â£5.01)0 in any one year, then I say deliberately that the proposed bounty is of  views expressed by Western Australian members.",50
213,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"No . The honourable member for Forrest and other Western Australian members are opposed to the payment of any bounty at all, whereas Mr. de Bavay says that the amount should be higher. He expresses the opinion that the Government would be justified in spending up to Â£400,000 a year for a period of two or three years in order, to place the power-alcohol industry on a firm footing.",51
214,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Does Ihe honourable member approve of that?,51
215,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I believe the Government would be justified in spending at least Â£250,000 a year for the next two years, and in paying a bounty ou . power alcohol produced from any crop in order to establish the power-alcohol industry in a large way, instead of importing 82,000,000 gallons of liquid fuel from other countries at a cost of Â£7,000,000 per year. Mr de Bavay, who is one of the greatest scientists in Australia, and who visited North Queensland recently, and conferred with the membeTE of the Northern Power Alcohol Committee, is Btill of the opinion that the Government should have tackled this question in a more comprehensive way, and extended the payment of a bounty to power alcohol produced from molasses. He holds that there would then be no hardship in connection with the overproduction problem of the sugar industry. When this measure was first introduced, Mr de Bavay saidIt is estimated that Queensland's surplus sugar would produce 35,000,000 gallons of power alcohol-lal f Australia's present requirements. If the Federal Government will help, that can become fact, substantially insuring the country against the calamity of a petrol shortage. The Government has seen fit to restrict the payment of the bounty to power alcohol manufactured from cassava and certain other plants specified in the bill. .I am in sympathy with the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning), who considers that a bounty should be paid on power alcohol manufactured from prickly pear, but the total amount of the bounty to be paid under this bill is so small that it cannot be extended to power alcohol produced from other plants such - [69] as prickly pear. As Mr de Bavay said six months ago, and as I have frequently stated, the whole proposal is a farce, and is not likely to be of any substantial benefit to any one unless it is greatly liberalized at a subsequent date. It is merely a window-dressing scheme, and submitted with the intention of making the people of Queensland believe that the Government is anxious to establish a great power-alcohol industry. The Min concerning the production of cassava, but I have heard certain honourable members who are farmers, including the hon say that cassava cannot be produced under Â£2 per ton.",51
216,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,The honourable member also said that.,51
217,Mr FORDE,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Yes , and I repeat it. Whilst the Government believes that 4d. per gallon is sufficient, I believe, from the inquiries I have made, the reports I have read, and the statements by Mr de Bavay, that the bounty is insufficient, and will not result in cassava being extensively grown. Consequently, the Government will have to grant a bounty on power alcohol manufactured from molasses, and thus enable the Queensland people to establish industries subsidiary to the sugar industry, which, I trust, will return all the profits to sugar-growers. Such industries should be controlled by the sugar-growers as an adjunct to their co-operative mills, and thns enable them to obtain the profits derived from the treatment of their by-products. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) suggested that if his amendment were carried, the prickly pear would be eradicated, but I am not so optimistic as to think that that would be the case. In Queensland 29,000,000 acres are now under prickly pear. In New South Wales an area of about 3,000,000 or 4.000,000 acres is also under this pest, and, although efforts have been made by the Federal Government, in conjunction with the Government of New South Wales and the Government of Queensland, to have the prickly pear eradicated, up to the present the problem has only been tinkered with. The sum of Â£4,000 has been contributed by the Commonwealth, and Â£2,000 each by New South Wales and Queensland, making a total of Â£8,000, but that has been found to be altogether inadequate. Persons - were sent to America to obtain a supply of the cochineal insect and certain caterpillars which are the natural enemies of the prickly pear, and which, in America, keep it in check. They brought these insects out, and they are now being distributed with good effect. prickly pear, having been introduced into Australia without any of its natural enemies, has flourished in Queensland, and in certain parts of New South Wales, to such an extent that it has got quite out of hand, and is today covering millions of acres of good country. If I thought that by carrying the amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie the prickly pear in Queensland and New South Wales could be eradicated. I should gladly support the proposal. The honourable member's amendment may please certain persons in his constituency, but it is not a business-like one. The eradication of prickly pear and its utilization for the manufacture of power alcohol is a big question. It is regrettable that the Government has not considered this question in the way it should, because, if it had carried out the recommendations of the Institute of Science and Industry in 1920 a thorough investigation would have been made. The Public Accounts Committee has made a very interesting comment in regard to the prickly pear, certain portions of whioh have beeu quoted. Dr W . M . Sinclair pointed out that millions of gallons of power alcohol could be produced from prickly pear, and the Accounts Committee in commenting on that claim saidThe claims of this process are certainly at variance witli the usually accepted theories as to the alcohol yield from prickly pear, hut the successful utilization of what is at present one of Australia's greatest pests would be of immeasurable value to the country, and the committee is of opinion that this process warrants expert investigation by the Government. Sueh an investigation would be welcomed by the patentee to prove his bona fides, and he has intimated his willingness to give the Government such control as is considered necessary for the purpose. It is therefore recommended that a qualified person, unbiased by preconceived ideas as to the .possibilities of prickly pear for molasses 24,000,000 gallons a year. alcohol production; should be appointed to fully investigate the process, and subject it to a technical and critical examination, with a view to determining the extent to which the project should be helped if the claims are substantiated. Mr Forde. The committee further said that the proposal had advanced beyond the laboratory stage, but that much had yet to be accomplished before it could become a commercial proposition. I should like to know if the Minister can enlighten us as to what representations have been made by those interested The in the production of power alcohol from prickly pear. The Minister knows that the annual expenditure of such a small sum as Â£5,000 over a period of five years for the manufacture of power alcohol in Queensland is insufficient, and that the bounty should be greatly liberalised and extended to power alcohol produced from prickly pear and other . plants. I would have moved an amendment to include molasses, but, knowing the inadequacy of the total appropriation, I contented myself by suggesting to the Minister that a com- prehensive scheme should be brought before Parliament providing for the payment of a bounty on power alcohol produced fro m any crop. Mr De Bavay and other qualified men have said that cassava cannot be grown at the price likely to be offered. The Government is only tinkering with a great national question. There is an opportunity for the Minister to recommend that a thorough in vestigation be made immediately con- cerning the manufacture of power alcohol from prickly pear, and also as to the possibility of solving the question of over-production in the sugar industry. A further bill could then be brought down next - session. By providing a bounty for power alcohol manufactured from sugar cane, inferior sugar, syrup and molasses, the Government would be helping the sugar-growers to solve the problem of over-production, which is weighing heavily on them at present. It is ridiculous to suggest, as the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) does, that the inclusion of prickly pear in this clause would result in the eradication of the pest. The bounty provided in the bill will cover a bounty on only 300,000 gallons of power alcohol per annum; whereas Queensland alone, according to a report by the In stitute of Science and Industry, could produce from her surplus sugar cane and The follorwing is an 'extract from that report :- There is little doubt that molasses is the most promising raw material for alcohol occurring in Queensland at the present time. On the other hand, Queensland now has a surplus cane production of 1,200,000 tons of cane, equivalent to, say, 24,000,000 gallons of alcohol, or more than one quarter of Australia's requirements of liquid fuel. That statement was quoted in a brochure entitled The Proposed Power Alcohol In dustry, issued by the Northern Power Alcohol Committee of Queensland. It is futile to think that the adoption of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Macquarie would do anything to cope with the prickly pear pest. I urge the Government, even now, to regard this matter as urgent, and bring down a comprehensive scheme for the payment of a bounty on power alcohol produced from molasses, inferior sugar dane, syrups, prickly pear, aaid every other product that is useful for its manufacture. In view of the fact that there is likely to be a serious world shortage of liquid fuel, we should do everything possible to make ourselves independent of supplies from other countries. If the Government would handle this matter in a broad statesmanlike way, it would be responsible for the establishment in Australia of a new and wonderfully usef u l secondary industry.",51
218,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Perth) [9.34] - As I understand that the Chairman's ruling does not preclude a general discussion of the methods of producing power alcohol, I propose to discuss the use of the prickly pear in that connection. So far, the prickly pear has only yielded power alcohol in laboratory experiments conducted by Dr Sinclair. Nothing has been done to show that it could be used for that purpose on a commercial basis. I do not question the results that Dr Sinclair has obtained- I have no means of questioning ' them-no r do I for a moment suggest that he would mislead honourable members: say, without fear of truth f u l contradiction, that the tests that have been made so far, are probably the least important factor in determining the value of prickly pear for the production of power alcohoi. Bound up with the use of the pear as a raw material for this or any other purpose, is the whole question of cutting, handling and crushing it . I venture, with diffidence, to say that I have studied the prickly pear as much as, if not more than, any honourable member of the committee, for I was a.member of the first committee of the Institute of Science and Industry which investigated the matter. Before we can use the pear in any manufacturing process, we must solve the prriblem of economically cutting and handling it ; and, so far, no workable plan for doing this has been devised. It is far more than a question of laboratory experiments; so what is the use of considering subsidiary processes for the production of power alcohol from it? It has been said that the revenue derived from the sale of alcohol made from the prickly pear may be set against the cost of destroying the pearj'but that is a f a l lacious idea. The revenue from that source must be set against the cost of manufacturing the alcohol. The one cancels the other. The whole proposal is futile.",53
219,Mr MAXWELL,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"What has this bill to do with the prickly pear, anyhow.",53
220,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"An amendment was proposed to provide that the prickly pear should be included in the specific growths mentioned in clause 6, and the Chairman has ruled that the matter may be discussed",53
221,The CHAIBMAN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Mr Bayley) For the information of the committee, may I say that the ruling I gave was that the amendment moved by the honourable (member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) was out of order in the form he submitted it ; but that does not debar the committee from discussing the advisableness of bringing the priokly pear within the provisions of this clause.' I pointed out that there was nothing to prevent a fresh message being brought down from the Governor General which would cover the provision of a bounty for the production of power alcohol from the prickly pear.",53
222,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I observed, at the bobut I ginning of my remarks, sir, that your ruling ' did not preclude honourable members from discussing the question of producing power alcohol from prickly pear; and that is my reply to the interjection of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). As io the general question of producing power alcohol from cassava, sweet potato, arrowroot, or other cultivated starch-bearing plants, I only wish to say that while it is perfectly true that in tropical climates, under favourable conditions, where-there is excessive growth, cheap labour, and other favourable economic factors, it might be profitable to use natural growths for the production of power alcohol to use for that purpose, deliberately cultivated orops, like cassava, under the conditions which prevail in Australia, is not commercially sound. That is clearly shown in the report of the Public Accounts Committee, which has been quoted frequently during this debate. What is the definition of "" commercial production"" or ""production on sound lines "" ? I interpret the phrases to mean ""production which pays."" It cannot be said that an industry which needs a bounty to make it profitable is commercially sound; it does not pay the community; it only pays the persons directly interested in it. Over and over again in its report the Public Accounts Committee draws attention to the fact that the production of power alcohol from these crops would not be commercially sound. An industry cannot be said to be sound when it is bolstered up by a subsidy.",53
223,Mr HUGHES,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,The wool-tops industry was established in Australia with the help of a bounty; and it is sound today.,54
224,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"In spite of the conditions in the wool-top industry in Australia. I say that it is not commercially sound. It is of no use for us to use terms like this and avoid their real significance. Everything goes to show that cassava cannot be grown on a commercially sound basis in Australia. Although I have congratulated the Public Accounts Committee on the fine report that it has submitted on this subject, I must say that it did not consider one point which, in my opinion, should have received its earnest attention. I submit that the payment of a bounty on power alcohol produced from food products, potential food products, or products grown on land which could be used for the production of foodstuffs, is not only commercially unsound,, but politically immoral. I will go further, and say that, in view of the fact that, broadly speaking, half the world is starving today, the Government is acting absolutely immorally in providing a bounty for the production of power alcohol from the products of land which should be used to produce foodstuffs. It is all very well for farmers to talk. Every one knows that they want to get the highest price possible for their products.",54
225,Dr NOTT,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,This is a wonderful calamity howl!,54
226,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"The honourable member may, if he wishes, regard my remarks as a calamity howl. It is nevertheless true that millions of people' in the world are half starving, and I repeat that it is politically and economically immoral for the Government of this country to disregard their wants. I do not care what gibes are thrown across the chamber at me in connection with this matter. It is politically immoral to legislate for the production of power alcohol from material which otherwise would be utilized for the production of food for millions of the human race. This is what I have urged from first to last in the debate on this bill. I am aware, of course, that the opinion of the committee will be against me, but I do not care for that, because I know that scientifically, technically, and morally, my position is right. It is absurd for the Government to legislate for the payment of a subsidy to a wealthy company with millions of capital for the production of power alcohol from material which would otherwise provide food for starving millions of the human race.",54
227,Dr NOTT,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Would the honourable member feed them on prickly pear?,54
228,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"The interjection of the honourable member for Herbert (Dr Nott) will not disturb me for a moment. As a medical man, he should be ashamed of it. He should take a wider view of his duties as a member of this legislature than fo support a measure like this for the payment of a bounty on the production of power alcohol from material which should be used for the sustenance of human beings. Honourable members may laugh at me; the loud laugh often bespeaks the vacant mind. On this subject. I know more than other honourable members, because I speak from a long experience in a certain branch of the Public Service. The Government, I know, will carry the bill through committee, notwithstanding that it is founded on ignorance of the important issues involved, founded on ignorance of the the technical questions involved, and contrary to a report of the Institute of Science and Industry and the report of the Public Accounts Committee, which was specially instructed to consider this question.",54
229,Mr COLEMAN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Is the honourable member ""stone-walling"" the bill? Mr MANN"" - I do not care what views the honourable member takes of my attitude. I am prepared to ""stone-wall"" any bill which I think is opposed to the best interests of the community. I have endeavoured to place at the disposal of the Government any special knowledge which I possess on this subject. If I did leas I should be recreant to my trust as a member of this Parliament. committee chooses to disregard what I have said, then the responsibility is not mine.",55
230,Mr HUGHES,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Hear , hear!",55
231,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"I do not care if the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) jeers at me. I say with all deference that on this subject. I know more than other honourable members. In my opinion the bill is economically unsound and morally wrong. I have given my reasons against it over and over again. Public Accounts Committee states, in effect, that the bounty will be equivalent to a subsidy to one rich company to which, apparently, the Minister has committed himself. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 7 to 16 agreed to. Postponed clause 2In this act, unless the contrary intention pears, "" power alcohol"" means spirit which complies with the standard for the tame being prescribed under the Spirits Act 1906-1923 for mineralized spirits.  Trade and Customs) [9.55] - I promised earlier in the debate that I would give the committee some information with regard to this clause. The act of 1906 provides in section 14, sub-section 28, that spirits for power purposes must come under the heading of mineralized spirits. The schedule sets out the standard for this type of spirits, but the act empowers the Minister to make regulations, which have been altered and liberalized from time to time. Honourable members will, no doubt, have noticed in the tariff schedule now before the House that a reduction is proposed in the duty on methyl alcohol not now produced in Australia, so as to make the methylation of alcohol cheaper even than it is now. I give honourable members an assurance that I will endeavour, con1 sistent with the protection of the revenue on alcohol, to make the regulations as simple as possible.",55
232,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,Perth) [9.56] - I should have been satisfied with the explanation if the Minister had stated that the regulations would provide that the standard should be in accordance with the provisions of the Spirits Act 1906-1923 as from time to time amended. The preI f the sent standard is unduly severe.  . Mr MANN - Yes . Apparently the Minister has recognized that by providing in this measure that the standard shall be that for mineralized spirits instead of for power alcohol.  come under that standard.,55
233,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"The bill states that the standard for power alcohol shall agree with the standard for mineralized spirit. Is the Minister of the opinion that the The present standard for power alcohol is unduly severe?  Trade and Customs) [9.58] - Sub-sectio n lb of section 14 of the act deals with the standard for mineralized spirits for lighting, heating, and power purposes. Spirits for power purposes must come under that heading. Another portion of the act provides that the standards for industrial apspirit and mineralized spirit shall, until altered by regulation, be as set out in tha schedule. The regulations, as I have already stated, have been altered several times since 1906 so far as concerns power alcohol, which must come under the heading of mineralized spirits. The department, however, has power to make regulations, and I may add that a standard has already been practically agreed to of a 1 per cent, addition of methyl alcohol. This will satisfy the department.",55
234,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Perth) [9.59] - I am sorry to appear pertinacious in connection with this matter. It would appear that  know his own regulations. I say this deliberately. Under the Spirits Act there is a schedule of standards which has been altered twice. The Minister ought to know this. The present regulations prescribe two standards which are set out on page 16 of the report, of the Public Accounts Committee. There is one standard for mineralized spirit, and another for power alcohol. Why has the Minister in this bill adopted the standard for mineralized spirits instead of the standard for alcohol fuel?  mineralized spirits are described as spirits for lighting, heating, and power purposes.",55
235,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"But the act states that, subject to regulations, the schedule shall set out the standards. Subsequent regulations have set out those standards, and the Minister should know what they are. It matters not what the act says, but what the regulations say today. The regulations at present in force provide a standard for mineralized spirits and a standard for alcohol fuel. Both standards set out a certain method of methylation or denaturation. . Why not adopt the standard for alcohol fuel? I suggested to the Minister in the earlier stages of this debate that possibly he might consider that the standard for denaturation was unduly complicated, and that, if so, he should defer the consideration of this clause until he could bring in a definition that would make it easy to methylate this spirit. He said that he would do so. It seems to me that something is wrong when the department, in dealing with alcohol fuel and regulations governing it, disregards its own standard for that fuel, and prescribes the standard for mineralized spirits. Surely what I am saying is clear. I do not want to embarrass the Minister. I have pointed out to him the conditions under the regulations of his department. It seems to me to be utterly unreasonable that when dealing with a bill relating to alcohol fuel, we should prescribe something that is not according to the standard prescribed for that fuel.  Trade and Customs) [10.3] - The honourable member has entirely misunderstood the position. I wish to make it clear to the committee that, provided that the revenue is protected, the conditions respecting alcohol fuel, so far as methylation, or destroying its fitness for human consumption, are concerned, will probably be made even simpler than they are under the regulations, because we are considering today merely the addition of 1 per cent, of wood naphtha and nothing else. In my administration of the department, I want the honourable member to understand, I shall put up with no red-tape in this connection. All I think that the committee act requires me to do is to see that the revenue is protected, and that thOse concerned in the manufacture of power alcohol are given the greatest facilities to denature it and make it unfit for human consumption.

238,Mr MANN,MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL UNITED,"Perth) U0.91 - I wish refer to a matter of more than usual increased. urgency, which I mentioned when the House met this afternoon, namely, the port of the Tariff Board concerning duties on motor cycles. Before the war the British manufacturers of motor practically controlled the motor cycle market in Australia; but during the war, owiug to restrictions in Great Britain, the American manufacturers obtained a great advantage, and far outstripped their competitors. Since then, however, the British manufacturers, by constructthe ing a type of light machine particularly this stage. adapted to Australian conditions, have again outstripped their American rivals"". The American manufacturers have recently copied the British light machines, and are manufacturing them in their factories. In consequence, the British manufaction, turers have made special application the Tariff Board for an increase in British preference on certain articles, cluding motor cycles. The British render manufacturers have applied to the Tariff Board for an increased measure of preferrequest ence, and the hoard, having considered financial the mattor, is, .so far as I oan ascertain, apparently sympathetic. The hearing of evidence on the subject was concluded about a fortnight ago. As the American manufacturers are threatening British trade in the Australian market, a decision is urgently necessary. Probably no His further opportunity to discuss the duties will he afforded after the conclusion of with the debate on the tariff schedule, and I therefore ask the Minister to obtain the of report from the hoard immediately, and to give it prompt consideration, so that, if have possible, we may discuss it during the his further consideration of the tariff.

So far, the Government has received no from the State _ Government for assistance, but it has been assisting in every way possible in the provision of tents, blankets,' and other equipment available from the Defence Department. To-day the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacoy) asked a question about the carriage of cattle and fodder in the drought-stricken areas of South Australia. T have had an opportunity of looking into the inatter, and I find that yesterday the following recommendation was submitted by the Commonwealth Commissioner of Railways to the Minister for Works and Railways:ID view of the conditions prevailing in South Australia it is recommended that fodder required for starving stock when carried to Gordon and stations north thereof, and live stock conveyed from one point to another for agistment, be carried over the .Oodnadatta railway at one-half of the ordinary rates as applying on that railway.
