FINLAYSON - In view of the' fact that on Saturday next - the whole of the British Empire will be celebrating Peace, I desire to ask the Acting Leader of the Government (Mr Groom) whether the Cabinet will take immediate steps for the release of the several .hundreds of returned soldiers who are now serving sentences for military offences in the gaols of Australia, so that these men may join with their relatives in celebrating, - the Peace' for which they went away to fight?",21
2,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member conveys a wrong impression when he says that thero are several hundreds of returned soldiers imprisoned in Australia. The whole matter referred to by him has been receiving our attention for some time. We 'have been in communication with all the State Governments, with the object of securing uniform action in regard to civil prisoners. We are considering the case of the soldiers and sailors, but are awaiting further information, and an announcement will be made as soon as possible.",21
3,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"This afternoon?' M T. GROOM - Not this afternoon, but, if possible, tomorrow.",21

Why not let these returned soldiers, out now instead of indulging in platitudes?",22
6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am afraid the honourable member is hardly doing himself justice. He knows that it is impossible for me to make a statement immediately, but I assure him, and the House, that the Government are giving tihe matter the most careful and sympathetic consideration, and hope to be able to make an announcement either ito-night or tomorrow. Wo arc considering the question from the most generous stand-point. NA IN EGYPT.",22
7,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,Can the Assistant Minister for Defence give the relatives of Australian soldiers in Egypt any idea as to when tlbey may expect the last of them to DB returned?,22
8,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,"On .the 4th instant I made a full statement in the House in regard to this matter. I may, for the information of the honourable member, quote the concluding paragraph of that statementAdvices have just been received to the effect that the Sth, 6th, and 7th-Regiments embarked and sailed on 28th June, and the 8th Regiment and ANZAC Divisional Details embarked and sailed yesterday. Tho total number of Light Horse Regiments in Egypt was fourteen. It is .anticipated that the remaining six will emhark in the Bhips allocated, and leave Egypt before the end of the month. It will, therefore, be seen that the return of these troopB is now being accelerated and proceeding as fast .as possible. Relatives of tnese soldiers need now have no anxiety with regard to them.

9,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,"May I ask you, Mr is Speaker, what steps are being taken fill the vacancy on the Publie Committee, caused by the resignation of' the Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr. Poynton) ?",22
10,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE," The matter is one with which the Prime Minister has to deal. On, receiving from the Acting Minister for the Navy a letter intimating that he desired to resign from the Committee, I at once forwarded it to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), in order that he rnighit take the necessary steps to fill the vacancy, if it was considered desirable to do so. DIRECTOR OF NAVIGATION .",22
11,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,"Will .the Minister for Trade and ' Customs state whether the Government 'have yet reached finality, and are prepared to make Ian announcement in regard to tihe appointment of a Director of Navigation? There appeared in the Herald last week a statement that the position had practically been filled? '",22
12,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,The position has not yet been filled. An announcement will' be made to the House as soon as it has been.,22
13,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,Wall the Minister state whether it is the intention of the Governmeut to apjooimt a - nautical .man or a layman to the office of Director of Navigation 1,22
14,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,The Government will endeavour to appoint to the position the man whom they think best fitted to discharge the duties attaching to it . Later,22
15,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,Will the Government before making an appointment afford the House an opportunity of discussing the question of whether the Director of Navigation should be a man with seafaring - experience or a landsman ?,22

SHIP - BUILDI NG TRIBUNAL.",22
17,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,"Yesterday I put to the . Acting Minister for the Navy a question in regard to the ship-building industry, which, I think, was misunderstood by him. What I desire to know is whether it is intended to give effect to the decision of the ship-building t r i bunal, presided over by Mr Conington, in regard to compensation claimed by members of the Australian Society of Engineers ?  understood the question put to me yesterday by the honourable member. My recollection is that the tribunal recommended that in. some five cases compensation should ,be paid for - wrongful dismissal. Two or three other matters were also dealt with . The only point not finalized is the suggestion by the t r i bunal that I should get r i d of the foreman of the yard, and place in his stead a member of the Australian Society - of Engineers. I have positively refused to allow this tribunal, or any other body, or individual, to interfere with the control and management of the yard. HOU SE MESSENGERS.",23
18,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,"May I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether, in the preparation of the Estimates of Expenditure for the current financial year, you w i ll take into favourable consideration the position of married messengers in this House who are working for a wage of something like £ 3 a week, with a view to following lead set by the State Parliament by giving them an increase that will make their payment somewhat commensurate representing with their duties and responsibilities?",23
19,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE," Under an arrangement, made by my predecessors in office, salaries paid to messengers and others connected with the establishments of both Houses of the Parliament are usually the subject of consultation bement? tween the ' Presiding Officers. tunately nothing can be done in respect of the salaries of the staff of this House without affecting the salaries of those ployed in the other, although'there is good deal more to be done in this than there is in connection with the Senate. I had consultations with the President on the subject when the House Estimates were in course of preparation, when the matter was full y considered, but it was not deemed advisable to provide for such increases for the present financial year. Recognising, however, that the increased cost of livin g might press heavily on some of the lower-paid officers, we arranged with the Treasurer for the payment of a bonus to certain employees at the end of . the last financial year, and I have no doubt that favourable' consideration will be given to a similar proposal at the close of the current financial year. IMPORTATION OF SHEEP - DI P.",23
20,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,"I ' d e s i r e to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether the restrictions on. the importation of sheep-dip were imposed at - the request of the Imperial Government, or whether the Australian Government acted on its own initiative ?",23
21,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,"I am given to understand that the Imperial Government originally asked the Commonwealth .Government to take whatever steps it could to secure the local manufacture of the sheepdip required here in order to avoid, first of all, the use in England of certain constituents of dip that were urgently needed for munition-making purposes; and, secondly, to conserve freights both to and from England. the SOLDIERS ' LANDSETTLEMENT .

SEAMEN'S STRIKE .",23
23,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE,"I desire to ask the Acting Leader of the Government whether he has made himself acquainted witli the demands of the seamen on strike, and whether the Government have formed any opinion as to whether those demands are just or fair ? ' If so, will he tell the House what decision has been arrived at in regard to the merits of the claims?",24

If so, is it not a fact that there are agencies for this and other makes of motor cycles in Perth - which can supply the same at considerably less than they cost when sent from Melbourne? 3. Will the Minister give instructions that the requirements of his Department will as far as practicable be obtained from local traders?  honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Yes. 2.

Mr Wise - The answers to the honourable member's question is as follows:(a) The amount deducted in each individual case is recorded in the corresponding individual ledger account, but the extraction and compilation of these amounts into a total would. involve a very large amount of work, which is not considered warranted in view of the expense of same and of its impeding much more urgent work connected with demobilization. The information is not necessary for departmental purposes. (6) The Government have already approved of the remission of fines and forfeitures in respect of all soldiers who die on service, provided that the'proper beneficiary in the estate was either dependent or is father, mother, wife, or child. This is the l i m it J w h i c h it is thought right to go, for the reason that the remission of fines and forfeitures duly awarded amounts to preferential treatment of those who have by their misconduct lessened their own services and much hampered the efficiency of the Porce.

Debate resumed from 16th July page 10797), on motion by Mr GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time.",28
66,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"South Sydney) [11.28] The people in my constituency have been looking forward to the cessation of hostiliwith ties in the belief that industry would then be restored to normal conditions. They are disappointed to find that Government, by this Bill , are asking an .extension of their control in regard to certain, commodities, and that no relief will be afforded to secondary industries. In regard to the wool industry, I am suri prised that the Government should t r mystify the House and the country by viding that the Wool Committee shall in clude two representatives of the growers and three representatives of the sellers. I should like to know the differwas ence between a wool grower and a wool seller, for ' the wool grower wool for sale, and sells it in first place. The Wool Committee is composed entirely of squatters who are at the present time. directly interested in the production of war wool, and to this I have no objection ; there are other industries to be consideredwhat Then, on the Wool Committee there has to be one wool buyer. Does that mean the British Government, seeing that the British Government is the biggest buyer of our wool ? One manufacturer and one scourer or fellmonger are also to have seats: Who is the manufacturer on the Committee? And there is not one wool scourer or fellmonger on the Committee, although there is one gentleman, who was formerly in the business, but is now a station-owner. As a matter of fact, this PAPER. is not a representative body, but is composed of producers or interested men oniy. When it was formed, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) , said that its first function was to stimulate the whole of the Minindustries involved, and there is a paragraph in the original regulations setting for th that fellmongering and wool scouring shall be kept at full speed, and that any surplus products may be exported. of That, however, has all been reversed. In my constituency a large number of men depend on the fellmongering and scouring industry, which was built up by private enterprise, has pioneered the manufacture of wool tops, and was (vide doing fairly well before the war. The firm had a market for their commodities in Japan, at a high price, and the business was gradually extending. A f t e r the war started, however, the contracts ran out, and they were allowed to make others the Japanese Government, though the conditions were such that it was necessary to charge a very high price for the the tops. Under the arrangement the Comf o r monwealth Government were to receive a little more than half the profits, and when inquiries were made as to the reason of the high price, it was explained that t was not desirable that Japan should get y to cheap tops, and so cut out the British promanufacturer. That is a reasonable pro- position, but because the firm I have in my mind earned huge profits, in which the Government participated, the opinion expressed in this House and elsewhere that too much money wasbeing made in has the industry. The Wool Committee had the fresh regulations made, which have so hampered the industry that it cannot be ' carried on satisfactorily Before the those concerned went into the but meat market and bought the sheep; using they called green skins, from which the wool was taken for the purpose of making the tops. Under the new agreement, however, the Wool Committee prevented the use of green skins, and said that if the firm bought the sheep they would have to get the wool washed and re-appraised, and carted back to the manufacturing establishments. All this, of course, meant ' additional labour by the firm, and the result is that they have been unable to carry on. They have tried to continue the industry, but the Wool Committee has decided not to allow them to export, so that now large stores in Sydney are stacked to the roof with tops.",29
67,Mr SAMPSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Why is the export of wool tops not allowed?,30
68,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Because there is a law case pending regarding the profits made.,30
69,Mr SAMPSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Who is bearing loss in the meantime?,30
70,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The firm. The whole of the plant is idle, and some 700 or 800 men are out of work. The firm can buy wool at the re-appraised rate, but they are not allowed to export u n t i l the case is settled, which is not likely to be before twelve months henGe ",30
71,Mr RODGERS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Honourable members on this side have a good deal of sympathy with the honourable member, and would help him j f he informed them as to the agreement made between this firm and the wool growers on a review of the wool top question.",30
72,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I cannot go into .the whole of the details, but I may point out  principal of the f i r m , was a member of the Wool Board, and a party to the agreement, and that Sir John Higgins seems to have got at loggerheads with, that gentleman. Mr Hughes could not accept the agreement because he found it an i m possible one; and I ask, now that the war is over, why the Wool Committee should have the power to close these great works. If the power of the Committee, in regard to wool tops, were taken away the works could be re-opened, and an export business in wool tops extended to all parts of the world. Are we to consider only the primary producer in the matter of wool? We understood that secondary interests had to be established and encouraged; but that is not being done under the present arrangements.  interests of the primary producer also.",30
73,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"If this country is to be a great country we must have secondary industries. This company, before the war, had its own machinery for the manu1 facture of wool tops, and was doing good business, but it has been ham-strung by the action of the Wool Committee. If the control of the Committee were removed tomorrow we should have a large industry, employing thousands of people.",30
74,Mr SAMPSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"What is Mr Hughes' objection to the agreement? - Mr Riley - There are technical legal points that I cannot explain, but it is a question of how much profit shall go the to the Government and how much to the firm. . 1 venture to say that if the matter were left to a Select Committee of members from both sides of this EHouse, the matter could be settled and the works re-established. The law case will be long and expensive, and, in the meantime, the industry is crippled. I am sorry that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) is not here, because he has the whole subject at his fingers' ends, and I believe he sympathizes with the effort to secure encouragement for this industry. The desired end could be achieved if the Government told the Wool Committee that the manufacturers of wool tops must be permitted to carry on. as before the war. Of course, contracts and agreements must be observed, but there is no agreement with the British Government, or any other Government, in regard to wool tops; so that there is no difficulty of that kind in the way.",30
75,Mr SAMPSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,It depends on the attitude of Mr F . W . Hughes'.,30
76,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Mr Hughes is prepared to carry on, but the firm is not allowed to export, although quite ready to make the tops. I understand that the Wool Committee require the tops to be kept here as a sort' of guarantee.",30
77,Mr MAXWELL,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,The Board could hold the produce of the sale of the tops.,30
78,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Q u it e so. ' The Committee have gone further, and have dislocated tihe whole of the scouring and fellmongering industry. In Botany, in my own constituency, there has heen established for tihe last fifty years an industry of this 'character, andyet today the machinery stands idle, and the employees are walking the streets. If one asks the reason for 'this, the reply is thaij; those who carry on ..this industry carnnot obtain skins. Just fancy, in a country like this, in which there are killed over 10,0.00,000 sheep annually, it is not possible to get skins for fellmongering! I have information, though I cannot prove the accuracy of it, that, after the visit of the French Delegation, one of its members, who is interested in the (production of skins in France, approached the British Government, with the .result that it is now more profitable to send dry skims' Home to be treated in Europe than bo treat them here. If a fellmonger buys a skin here, and takes the wool off it, he gets only Is. 3£d. per lb. for the wool, but if a person buys skins, and sends them Home to .the Old Country, and the .wool is taken off there, the return is 2s. 6d. a lb. Thus it is that those who export skins can afford to - pay more for them than can the local fellmonger ; and now we see a sort of gamble in skins. In short, this large industry is crippled in the interests of employment in other parts of the world. ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - There roust be some other reason - away.",30
79,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I do not wish to impute motives, but Lt is said that some people are making money as a result of the present position. Skins are worth 10s. to 12s. 6d. more in the Old Country than they are here. If I buy them in Australia and send them away I get double the price for them.",31
80,Mr MAXWELL,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,So that you are not likely to sell to the local fellmonger.,31
81,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"No, and it would not pay him to buy them., seeing that he is only permitted to get a flat rate for the wool on them. I wonder why the wool growers permit this sort of thing. When a wool grower sends his wool to Great Britain he gets 50 per cent of the profit. obtained over the fixed price of Is. 3id. per lb., but wb.en skins which are bought here are sent to other parts of the world he does not get the benefit of that-profit, but must be content with the flat rate of Is. 3^d. per lb. By the export of these dry sheep skins the wool grower is a loser, the fellmonger is a loser, and the workers are losers; and in no sense is the country a gainer. The local fellmonger cannot compete with the man who is buying sheepskins for export. I cannot understand why the Central Wool Committee persists in crippling the fellmongery industry. I give the Minister notice that in Committee I shall move an amendment to omit paragraph (f ) of section 5 of the Third Schedule and insert the following words in lieu thereof:After the State Committee have ascertained that all local fellmongers have heen supplied, any surplus sheep skins may be sold, but shall be sold only to or through or with the consent of the Commonwealth Government. I believe that a great injustice has been done. It was the intention of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that all local manufacturers should be kept going at full speed, but now there seems to be a struggle to send skins to Europe. Someone is making money out of these operations. I do not know who it is, but it is peculiar that the Central Wool Committee have appointed agents to go about the country and buy skins to send",31
82,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,For whom are they buying?,31
83,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I do not know, but I have information that after the visit of the French Delegation an arrangement was made to buy sheep skins here with a view to establishing the basil industry in France. I do not know whether that is correct, but it is certainly a fact that in Australia the industry is going down, and men are walking about the streets unemployed, while thousands of bales of sheep skins are to be seen on the wharves awaiting shipment to Europe I hope that my amendment will be accepted. It will make it imperative that the export of sheep skins will only be possible when the local fellmongers have a full supply to enablethem to carry on their establishments.",31
84,Mr FLEMING,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Robertspn) [11.50] The remarks of the honourable member for South - Sydney (Mr Riley ) in regard the handling of wool and sheep skins seem to show the necessity for an gation. We are very largely in the about what is being done, not only regard, to wool, but also in respect to operations of the Wheat Pool; and if the statements of the honourable member are correct- I presume they are,' coming such a source-the Government certainly institute an inquiry. They would also do well to investigate the reported loss of about 6,000,000 bushels of wheat in New South Wales, because, if by thieving-for it means nothing else-that quantity of wheat has distoils appeared, it proves that the Wheat Pool has been a gigantic failure. It certainly means the loss £1,500,000, more than enough to pay all the expenses usually entailed in marketing of wheat. It seems to that the reported loss is too gigantic to be possible, but the Government would be well advised to have the matter thoroughly inquired into. We are told that it is a matter for the State Governhonorable ment to deal with , because the Federal Government merely controls the financial end of the Pool; but where does the farmer come in if the State is supposed to control the actual product, and the Federal Governagreement ment controls the financial side, and both disown responsibility concerning what has become of this lost wheat? In my opinion it is the duty of the monwealth Government, as representing the whole of the Australian producers, take the matter in hand and have it thoroughly investigated. In dealing with these matters I speaking largely at random, because I of the coal miners? - was away from Australia when the main part of the work was in progress, and I find it very difficult to obtain reliable formation as to what has actually been done, and what is now going on; but if it is a difficult matter for an honourable member of this House to obtain inforthat. mation, how much more difficult must be for the man who is engaged ing the products controlled by the various Boards ? There is a great dfeal of i feeling among the primary producers of Australia today, and it is not without to reason. Even if , to a certain extent, it may seem to be - a usurpation of State investirights, it is the bounden duty of dark Commonwealth Ministers to take steps in to protect men who have toiled and the sweated to produce these commodities, in regard ""to the control of which errors, to say the least of them, have been exposed fro m as far as honourable members of thisshould House can expose them. One would think , listening to statements made from the other side of the House, that the man on the land has been living in luxury for many years; that he has no troubles; that he neither nor spins, and that he simply sits down and enjoys prosperity. Nothing could be further from the truth . Tho of man on the land has more cause for complaint than any other member of the the - community. We have been told, during me the course of this debate, that the primary producer is not entitled to the full market rate for his produce, and .that it should be kept down as it has been kept down during the years of war. Do those members opposite who claim to represent the workers realise where that argument would lead them ? One honourable member who put forward the proposal represents a coal mining constituency where the coal miners have an with the owners that wages rise and fall according to the price of coal. If we carry the honourable member's argument to a logical conclusion, Comand the men who produce wheat and butter are not to get the full value for to their products, how can he expect them to pay reasonable rates of wages to their employees, and, at the same time, how can he maintain the reasonable agreeam ment that exists to keep up the wages",32
85,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,So m e of the p r i in - mary producers are working for nothing this year.,32
86,Mr FLEMING,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The primary producers are more or less accustomed to' Some years the profits are. good, it but other years often swallow up the in growwhole of those profits.",32
87,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Is the honourable member l l - speaking of the war period generally.,32
88,Mr FLEMING,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"D u r in g the war period the primary producers - were not given fair treatment. In 1910 this Parliament passed the first Federal land tax, but in 1914 it increased it , and also imposed succession duties. In 1915 the income tax was imposed, and since then the lessees of Crown lands have been called upon to pay land tax.  tional 20 per cent, increase in that tax in 1918.",33
89,Mr FLEMING,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The man on the land is carrying the heaviest burden of taxation, and is also being held down in respect to the price of his products, while honourable members opposite advocate that he should be still further held down in this respect. At a time like this when, people are suffering grave injustices, it is not right that we should hear arguments put forward in this House that the primary producers should be prevented from getting a fair return for their labour. Instead of endeavouring to crush them, we should rather extend them consideration, particularly when they are just recovering from the severity of a drought. Australia, in common with other parts of the world, increased its currency during the Avar very largely. The result is that the primary producer having the value of his. product kept down, while the secondary producer has been allowed to obtain any price he could get for his article, the cost of all commodities used by the .primary producer has risen enormously. On top of that we are threatened with an increased Tariff to protect factories that were established owing to the increased price it was possible to secure for goods manufactured from raw material, for which the primary producer was not permitted to get a fair price.. We are going to call on the individual who, after all, is the stable man of the country, to pay out of his pocket for the support of the very things that were established at his expense. House takes it calmly, and wonders why land is going out of cultivation. Unless some of these things are remedied., Australia will fin d it very difficult to meet the load of debt imposed on it by the war.  lation is increasing by thousands.",33
90,Mr FLEMING,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"E very one knows bhat the d r if t of population from the countiy to the cities in Australia is alarming. Can we wonder at it when we see that the man on .the land has to bear-taxation, niot only to support his local shire or municipal council, but also for the purposes of the Federal and State Parliaments, and, on the top of that, the Federal Parliament.says to him, "" We are not going to allow you to get the market value for your goods?"" Is it reasonable that this man should go out to subdue the desert, ,as it is sometimes put, ,to sacrifice the future, not only of himself, but of his family, by struggling on the land to keep those people , who are fattening in the cities? This House is taking up an attitude extremely dangerous to the future safety of this continent, if it listens to the argument that the man who is doing the work, breaking in new land, and feeding and clothing the people generally, is not to get a fair return for the very arduous labour wihich he undertakes year in andyear out, day in and day out, come-daygo-day, every day and Sunday. The man on the land 'has to .put up with all these things, and is he then to be told that he shall not get .the price obtainable for his product? Are the people in the cities, where men congregate in their unions, and can dictate to their representatives in this House, to Ibe pampered and petted in - every possible way-'to be given definite hours and good pay for those hourswhile he who produces is to receive lower returns than he should get? I cannot understand how a man representing any constituency, no matter what his shade of political opinion is, can advocate in this House such an evidently wrong and i m moral proposition.",33

' Mr FLEMING - U n for t u n at e l y the arguanent adduced by the Opposition is - that .the jprimary producer is not to get the full market value for has product. The question of the profiteer * is quite another matter. We on this side of the House are just as keento destroy the - profiteer as any honourable 'member on the other side is, because we realise that, as things stand at present, he is taking money out of the pockets, not only of the workers themselves, serious as that is, but of the producers When I memtion the workers, I mean those engaged in all branches of industry, primary and secondary. It is the ducers on whom the stability of this country rests, and to whom we must look absolutely and finally for .the clearing off of the enormous burden of debt that faces us. I hope, after the interjection of the honourable member for iSouth Sydney (Mr . Riley), that we shall find that the honourable members ©f the Opoosition are seeing the error of their ways, and will no longer defend such plain daylight robbery as the taking from the primary producer of the full market value of his product.",33
93,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Adelaide) [12.4] - The majority of those who have spoken in this debate seem to have adopted towards the Bill an attitude that they should not have taken up. The House and the country are deeply indebted to the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) for the manner in which he handled the subject last night. We have several lawyer legislators, and this is a - measure on which, above all others, they should have dilated in accordance with their knowledge of constitutional law. We, as laymen, hardly know where we are.' The honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory), for instance, said that he supported the Bill only on account of the contracts entered into. It was an expedient, he said, which covered some of the acts of the Government during war time. But to my mind it is quite in opposition to all the arguments that have ever been urged against the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth during peace time. What the Government did in war time was done only by virtue of the decision of the H i gh Court, and the honourable member for Batman, in a well thought out exposition of the judgments of the High Court Bench, showed that they in themselves were not sufficient to warrant the extension of the Commonwealth powers. He suggested that stress of circumstances, and the force of the personality of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), brought about the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth as we have seen them exercised under the War Precautions Act. The only authority we have that we shall be doing the right thing if we . pass pro- this Bill is the statement by the legal gentlemen selected by the Acting-Attorney General (Mr Groom), - and hi* voucher that the Bill is legal and correct. As a layman,' I do not see how you can be both Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. On one occasion we are told that the Commonwealth cannot assume these powers in times of peace, and then, when it suits the Government to get a statement in the other direction, they call together a coterie of legal gentlemen, presided over, I presume, by the Acting Attorney-General, and obtain from them a favourable certificate. As some one. suggested, it is simply making work for lawyers. I shall be very much grieved if after this Bill is passed it is. found that we have no right to these powers, and I hope the people will take a note of what has happened. I shall support the Bill because if the power is necessary I do not want to see chaos result from the activities of the Government during - war time in connection with our primary products. I have been astonished to hear honourable members who represent primary in dustries talk as they do about the Pools. Boiling the thing down to common everyday facts, the primary producers know full well that during the stress of wartime nothing better safeguarded their in terests than the pooling scheme carried out by the Government. If that was not the case, why do not their representatives in this House utter their protest in the proper manner by challenging the Government on the question ? Why do they not-refuse to pass the Bill , in order that we may go riglit back to the pre-war method of handling the products of the primary producers? But the primary producers are getting a fair deal, - and have had far more than a fair deal, as I am prepared to illustrate by facts, and not by quoting the mere utterances of interested parties. I want some statement, other than the certificate of the Acting Attorney-General, backed up by the legal gentlemen - who acted with him , showing their reasons for certifying that the Commonwealth has this power. What are the points that they may have to meet when this legislation is challenged by the wool people, or by the jam people, as has been hinted ? A r e we simply to be the plaything of the Law Courts?. people do not desire to be ruled by the High Court, no matter what the majority is on the Bench, and they certainly do not wish that a majority of one on the H i gh Court Bench should settle such important questions. t f any one man in that position can decide for or against the Commonwealth, he practically becomes the ruler and dictator of the Commonwealth. The House has not been given enough information on this Bill , and those people outside who go to the trouble of ascertaining what is done in this place will have nothing to show them why the Commonwealth Government have now taken up the attitude that they should get wider powers. opinion of the legal gentlemen outside, that the Government can take these powers, is correct, let honourable members support amendments that will be moved in Committee to carry the principle further. I . shall vote for other industries to be taken in , and then those honourable members on the other side of the Chamber who back the Government will have a chance of proving that they are sincere in their offers to cr,ush profiteering. They will be able to support amendments that will extend the Bill so that it will take in every activity, not only primary, but secondary, and do everything that will protect the people from the profiteers. That we have been at the mercy of the profiteers goes without saying. honourable member for Werriwa (Mr . Lynch), last night dilated upon the unrest prevalent in the Commonwealth, but that unrest is prevalent throughout the world, and for the one specific reason that during the stress of war the people have been bludgeoned by the profiteers of every country. I feel aggrieved at what has taken place in this regard in Australia. I went to the war honestly and conscientiously to assist as far as lay in my power to put an end to m i l i tarism, and on one very auspicious occasion during the war I accepted the Prime Minister's assurance that not even the wildest ideas of anyone who was advocating the conscription of wealth would approximate to what he would do to make wealth pay for the war. That was the utterance of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) which won my vote on a certain The issue. But, now, I ask any honourable member, looking through the statistical returns, to show me where, in one instance, the Prime Minister has made wealth pay for this war. Wealth has profited out of ' the war, even in ' regard to those interchanges of credits which are called loans. Every transfer of credit from one side of the book to the other has been a source of profit to the men who, according to the Prime Minister, are going to pay for the war. If the honourable member for Robertson (Mr - Fleming) were present, I would remind him of an article which was sent to all the papers in the Commonwealth telling the people that investment - in the War Loans was a gilt-edged seI f the curity. If it is a gelt-edged security, where has the Prime Minister made any investor pay for this war? Besides the exhortations to men to offer their services at the Front, the thing that rang most in the ears of the general community was the statement that sacrifices must be equal. Where has the sacrifice been made by the "" capitalistic section "" of the community- a phrase which I do not use offensively ? Show me one instance of it . Not only has that section made no sacrifice, but dt has made profits in excess of 1 anything known as to any period of years prior to the war. I challenge any man, in the light of the figures which have been collated by the Commonwealth Statistician, to prove that I am wrong. The 1 The taunt has been hurled at us that we are the - enemies of the primary producer. The Labour Party has never been his enemy. I have always maintained that very few members of the labouring section of the commuuity have been known to retire on what they have earned from the primary producer Very few farm labourers retire to their own farms, and very few shearers buy palatial mansions out of what they earn at shearing sheep.",34
94,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"More farm labourers have become the owners of, farms and employers of labour than any other class in the community.",35
95,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The honourable member that may be righ t in the .case of Tasmania, but I do not believe it is true of South Australia. The more general ruhj of exin pansion in the farming industry in that wheat has been detrimental to his in State is that the farmer puts his son on terests. to acres which he has added to his holding since he first began. To add acre to acre is more the custom there than for farm labourers to leave their employment buy farms for themselves.",36
96,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,I could instance a whole settlement where farm labourers are now farmers.,36
97,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The opposite is the in South Australia, except that in our closer settlement activities and . in the irrigation settlements along the Murray, where blocks have been allotted, several men who were workers in the city have been very successful. Speaking generally, - hoped they would long continue. so far as wheat-growing is concerned, tendency is for people to aggregate areas, gathering them, holding by holding, and then to distribute them amongst their children. I deny the accusation so often made them was £4,032,954. by our political opponents that the Trades H all element in this community would deprive the primary producers their rights. It is not the workers exploit the man on the land; but the middlemen who "" farm the farmer."" Their operations are to be traced i our big cities, and they usually occupy large offices and palatial residences. Such men rob the primary producers that which should go to them. The working section of the community do not exploitthem in any way. I am unable to find in the reports of the Inter-State Commission anything bearing on the operations of the Wheat Pool during the war period, but I think it will be acknowledged that, in the stress and turmoil of the war, the farmers would not have fared as well as they did but for the Pool, and the fact that the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr . Hughes) was acting in their interests, as he did the other day, when he arranged the sale of 1,000,000 tons of wheat to theImperial authorities. The - same quantity might have been sold to the Britisb Government under other circumtime stances, but the primary producer would not have been advantaged to the extent he will be as the result of the action taken by the right honourable gentleman. I do not think the farmer will say that, the circumstances, the pooling of his The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) said that the primary producers were more or less satisfied with the Wheat and other Pools and whose operations are to be extended under this Bill . I think they are. Some honourable members have said that the primary producers have not done well during the war. As against that rule statement the honourable member for .  in stock was candid enough to say in the House the other day that themeat producers were quite satisfied with the prices they had secured, and that they I the should think they would be satisfied. large 'According to a report issued, by the Inter-State Commission we had in Australia, in 1913, 11,892,584 sheep, and the value of the wool obtained from In 1916 the number of sheep in Australia had been reduced to 10,545,632, but the value of of the wool-clip from that reduced numwho ber was no less than £6,577-,614. In other words, although the number of sheep had decreased to the extent of n all 1,346,952, there was an increase of £2,544,660 in the value of the wool.",36
98,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Is not the honof orable member glad of that?,36
99,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"What effect did that increase have on thegeneral community In view of these figures, will the honourable member say that sheep-owners have been called upon to make any sacrifices during the war. Surely if the honourable member were a sheep farmer he would not wish for anything better than to have his returns in one year increased notwithstanding that his flocks had beeu seriously reduced. Can the representatives of the pastoral industry say that there has been any attempt to prevent the pastoralists getting the full value of their labours?

I have endeavoured already to deal with them.

The comI pany even endeavoured to fix the price of Indian Root Pills in the same way. the proprietors of that medicine would allow them' to do so. As to the honourable member's suggestion that we should put a ston to profiteering I may say at that the Opposition are prepared to'go any lengths to secure that end. honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) inquired this morning £274,451 in the returns. whether Ministers had observed that French Government are going to enter into competition with several industries in pas- France.

107,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I am aware of that. The profiteers allowed the cattlemen to get the extra price during the war period. What sacrifice have the cattlemen made? What have they done for the soldiers' widows and mothers and for those who kept the wheels of industry going during the conflict? What have they done to help the Empire during its time of stress? I care not whether it was the man who owned the cattle on the hoof, or the operator in the market, or the retail butcher-somebod y made that increase of £274,451. I know that these large profits are one of the causes of the unrest and strikes of today; and the Government desire to gaol men because they tell .'the people the facts. These figures show who are the men who. have exploited the community. I do not say they arranged it deliberately, but the opportunity offered and they took advantage of it. In the early days of the war, we heard much about equality of sacrifice. Sir William Irvine said that, if necessary, the fanner should put a firestick in his crops if the interests of the country demanded it. What sacrifice has been made by the cattle kings ? In the year 1913, 4,732,231 sheep were slaughtered for a return of £3,739,012; and in 1916, 2,647,200 sheep were slaughtered for a return of £3,759,613. In other words, there was a decrease of 2,000,000 in the number of sheep slaughtered, but an increase of £20,601 in the return from the stock.'",38
108,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Is that the wholesale or the retail value ?,38
109,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I am quoting the return published in the document to which I have already referred, and it relates to dealings in meat from the station to the consumer. But, as I have pointed out, the sheep farmers have not made as much money as the wool merchants. Their extra gain from the smaller output was only £20,000; the cattle breeders' extra gain was only £276,000; but the wool sellers made an extra profit of £2,544,000.",38
110,Mr TUDOR,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,They did very well.,38
111,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Again , I ask, where was the sacrifice for the war? The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) told us that the wildest proposals of the men who would conscript wealth would not nearly equal what he would do by way of taxation to make wealth pay for the war. But, as I predicted, wealth has not paid for thewar; the payment will be made by posterity. I have dealt with this measurein reply to the assertions of honourable members on the Government side that, owing to the operations of the Pool, theprimary producers of meat and wool have not had as good a time as they should have had. The figures I have quoted provethat they never had a better time than during the war period. The same argument applies to wheat.. I do not say that the wheat farmer has not been in the hands of the very personswho exploited him in pre-war times. I have previously told this House that the. late John Darling died worth £2,000,000,. made in twenty-five years by dealing in. wheat. No man working on a farm everleft £2,000,000 behind him. It is the duty of the House to appoint some Commission to ascertain whether the depredations that are taking place in connection with our primary industries cannot be prevented, and those who have been responsible for them penalized. In South Australia two Commissions have inquired into the wheat business, and one brought about the downfall of the man who claims to be a representative of the farmers, and who, writing to the press signs himself either ""Parmer"" or ""Mother of Ten."" I refer to Sir Eichard Butler. He was always pleading for the ""poor cocky farmer,"" but he was ignominiously pushed out of the Ministry for dealing in the Wheat Pool. In the course of the inquiry, reference was made to the all fact that Mr Brimage, one of the officials of the Wheat Board, sold timber to the Pool and made a profit.",38
112,Mr TUDOR,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Is there not a lot of wheat missing' in South Australia ?,38
113,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I do not know what the position is in that State, but the statement made by ,the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) regarding the thefts in New South Wales was serious enough. If it be true that 6,000,000 bushels of wheat are missing from the New South Wales Pool, the persons who took it are just as bad as any burglar. If the wheat has been obtained by criminal means it is the duty of the Government, in order to protect the farmer, to thoroughly investigate the matter and lay the felon by the heels. Reverting to my argument, I repeat that the farmers never did better at any period of their existence than they have done during the last two or three years. I make no complaint of that; I desire everybody to have the best that the world can offer. That is a basic principle of the Labour party. "" The Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,"" and we are all brothers; and although at times we have to resort to extremes to convince honourable members opposite of that doctrine, it is, nevertheless, a fact. The day will come when such a doctrine will replace the present system of cutting each other's'throats for a few shillings. The season 1914-15 was affected by drought, and the farmers reaped only 24,000,000 bushels of wheat throughout Australia. But in the following year the wheat crop increased to 179,000,000 bushels, and in 1916-17 it was 152,000,000 bushels. By that time about half-amillion men were either engaged in war activities or were fighting in France, but notwithstanding the depletion of man power, the farmers in. 1917-1S harvested 114,000,000 bushels.. I ask honourable members to consider what those figures connote. The previous largest harvest was 103,000,000 bushels, obtained in the year prior to the drought. .During the war period the farmers received for their wheat a flat rate of 4s. 9d., plus any further amount that could be obtained by the Government from the sales to the Mother Country, and I hope that honourable members will not say that that payment was less than the wheat merchants would have given to the producer. There is no' doubt that the vultures of finance have scarified the.farmer, and will do so again if they are permitted, but the traffic in wheat - certificates has not taken place at the Trades Hall. Honourable members on the Government side talk glibly about the primary producer not getting a fair deal from members on this side, but I remind them that the Labour Government created the various Pools in order to insure that the farmer would get the best possible price for his products, and that' the accumulated surplus would not be wasted. I am grieved to know that the Commonwealth does not possess greater powers in that direction. One of the iast measures on which I spoke in this House before leaving for France was a Bill to permit the Commonwealth to finance the State Governments in the erection of silos for the storage of the wheat which was being destroyed by mice and weevils in the stacks at nearly every port. I believe that New South Wales has been the only State that has taken advantage of that enactment, so as to conserve the surplus of the fat years for use in the lean years. It is our duty to carry out that policy, and I am sorry that the other States have not proceeded further in the matter, and that the Commonwealth is not able to arrange storage in silos, as well as regulating and controlling the sale of wheat. When honourable members say that the primary producer is a cause of annoyance to this side of the House, they are quite wrong; but I do assert that during the war period the farmers have had a fair return; in fact, they have never done better in the whole of their existence than ' they have since .the drought season in 1914-15. I suggest that on all these Boards, or Pools, there should be a representative of the employees in the industry concerned, for, after all, this is a correlative community, and in the last analysis it is the working .people who have to pay.",38
114,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Why not have at least one honourable member from each side of the House on all these Boards ?,39
115,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"That might meet the position; but what is in my mind is representation by a man employed in the trade or industry concerned. Suppose I were aippointed on the Wool Committee, aa from this side of ihe House, what do I know, about wool ?",39
116,Mr FOWLER,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,What does the Chairman of the Wool Committee know?,40
117,Mr YATES,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The honourable member knows more of the composition of the Wool Committee than I do, and while I do not question the ability of the chair-' man, I suggest, as was suggested in the case of the Industrial Commission to America, that men who are employed in particular trades or industries, and who know all their intricacies, should be appointed. I am going to support the second reading of the Bill, but I shall be very much grieved if subsequently this legislation is challenged and declared to be ultra vires, the Government being involved in considerable expenditure owing to having followed the lead of the Attorney-General. In my opinion, it is the duty of members of the legal profession, who have been returned to this House because of their legal and general attainments, to follow the lead of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and give us all the information they can as to the legality of the Bill, so that we' may not vote in the dark, but do that which is for the benefit of the community generally. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT (New England) [12.50] - Amongs t the 'activities dealt with by the Government, there is one branch tiba.t^requires careful handling. I refer to the rare metals-the tungstens, which comprise wolfram, scheelite, and molybdenite. Prior to the war, practically the whole output for Australia, which was very limited, went to Magdeburg, inGermany, which had a monopoly of the industry. Early in the war it was discovered that England had only four months' supply of tungsten steel; so the scientists got to work, and laboratories were established in the Old Country, with the result that the factories set up were able in a short time - to turn out sufficient tungsten steel to meet the requirements of England and the Empire during the war. At the present time the control of .these metals in Australia is vested in the Commonwealth Government, and all the sales of the three I have mentioned must be through Govenmnent agents. For the period of the war, and for six months afterwards, contracts were made with the British Government, under which the price of molybdenite of a certain stan- . dard is to be 100s. per unit, and of wolfram 52 s. per unit. This contract will probably continue for another six months. The mines in Australia axe mostly in the north of New South Wales and Queensland, .and there the position has become rather hazardous. In June last notification was received by the different miners and concentrating companies from Dalgety and Company, the authorized buyers, that tungsten ore3 would not be received unless of a certain standard. That standard is almost prohibitive, and at present it is impossible, without scientific research, to produce the concentrates required by the representatives of the Government. As a consequence, the whole of the mines in North New South Wales are closed down, and the miners are out of work. The expensive works which were recently erected there, and in Sydney and elsewhere, for the treatment of these rare metal concentrates, are also closed down, because they are unable to produce a commodity of the.standard of excellence set by the Commonwealth Government, who are agents for the British Government. So long as this state of affairs continues, the production of metals will be practically n i l ; and I invite the attention of the Commonwealth authorities to the importance of preserving the industry. Unless something is done at an early date, Australia, instead of producing a fair share of these metals, will be compelled to go out of the market. Further, we shall find the different mining centres which have been established ceasing to exist, and the treatment works, on which thousands have, been expended, will become white elephants. This will also be the fate of the expensive' plants erected to carry on the various processes, including the oil flotation process, which produces the concentrates, and the results of which have been remarkable up to the present time. In Australia, there seems to be great ignorance in regard to the use of tungsten steel and metals, and only as a result of the war has attention been drawn to it. Prior to the war, practically the whole of our high-speed tools were manufactured on the ordinary blacksmith method-by suddenly heating and then suddenly cooling the metal. But the difficulty, in a continuous operation, was to make the steel sufficiently hard and tempered to offer the necessary resistance, and to answer the test of - carrying out heavy work, such as drilling cylinders for big guns, <und insuring mathematical correctness along the line of shafting. In England, there was only one factory prior to the war which had attempted in any way to deal with the production of high-speed tools by means of tungsten alloys, and that factory was not a success. whole of the products from Australia and elsewhere in the Empire,- went through the bottle-neck of Germany and radiated to 'England, America, and other parts of the w o r l d; and when attention was drawn to the fact that the German supply was cut off by the war, the scientists of England awoke to the necessity of fillin g the gap if the war had to be carried on with any hope of success. The manufacture of high-speed tools has played a far greatei' part in the successful conduct of the war than most people imagine. W it h the antiquated methods of pre-war days, it would not have beenpossible to produce one-fourth of the munitions, or onef o u r t h of the guns of heavy calibre, and other instruments required in a conflict so huge. Therefore, high-speed tools had to be produced; and, in order that honourable members may know to what extent these have affected the production of munitions, I need only point out - that they are necessary for very many reasons, as the following statement will showOwing to the fine edge to which the"" tools must he ground, and the fact that the tool never leaves the work, the heat affects the tool far more than the work. It follows, therefore, that good engineers' tools must combine . a number of essential qualities, namely:' (1) Hardness to give a keen-cutting edge. (2) Strength to resist the enormous strain concentrated on the' cutting edge and body of the tool. (3) The property of remaining unaltered in hardness and strength at high temperatures. . (4) Uniformity in texture', so that tools may be re-heated, re-made, and reground many times and still show - the same .characteristics [404] (5.) Uniformity, as between, one tool a'nd another, so that identical, results, may . be obtained in repetition work. (6) Softness and ductility when heated to a suitable temperature, so that rolling and forging are possible without undue waste (7) The capability. of being annealed or softened, so that complicated tools, such as twist drills, milling cutters, shell-boring tools, &c, may be manufactured while the steel is soft, and may be_ hardened with the least possible distortion.. If this industry is allowed to go out of existence in Australia, there .wil l be very great difficulty in supplying' the requireThe ments of the Empire, and of,England in particular.",40
118,Unknown,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - There are other uses to which tungsten can be put, such as in the manufacture of permanentmagnets of the quality requisite for magnetos and telephones, filament lamps, and armour plating steel of high quality. A few figures in regard to the world's production and consumption of tungsten may be of interest. So far as Australia is concerned., mining for rare metals has been a parlous industry because the use to which they could be put was not too well known. The world's consumption of tungsten ores rose steadily from 4,000 tons in 1906 to 10,000 tons in 1913. During this period the British* Empire produced approximately half, and, in. fact, possessed a controlling interest. Since the war the output of ore has risen to close upon 20,000 tons per annum, and the United States has jumped into the position of being the largest producer, having increased the output from 1,400 ' tons in - 1913 to close on 7,000 tons in 1916. while the Empire production for 1916.was under 6,000 tons. The increased production within the British Empire of ,from 5,000 to 6,000 tons was no .small achievement in itself under war conditions ",41
119,Mr SPEAKER,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND," What particular relation have the honourable member's remarks to the Bill? Lt - Colonel-ABBOTT - The Bill deals with certain activities which are controlled-: 'by the Commonwealth, and proposes to .extend the life of our control'over them. I am anxious to point out the absolute necessity for continuing control in regard to rare metals, i u the search for which a considerable number of men are employed in New South Wales and Queensland. I am also pointing out that throughthe ignorance of the man in the street in regard to those metals, it is possible that the claims of the persons engaged in the industry, which is only in its, embryo state at the present time, are apt to be overlooked unless attention is drawn to the great utility they are to the British Empire.",41
120,Mr SPEAKER,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The honourable member's argument is to point out the necessity for enlarging the scope of the Bill in order to ' ' e i l with those metals? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Yes , I was referrin g to the increased production of the British E*npire. In 1914 tungsten metal, as opposed to tungsten ores, with which I have just been dealing, was almost solely produced, manufactured, and made in Germany. In this respect it can be compared to epsom salts, a product which may be bought and sold every day. Germany secured"" the raw material and manufactured a sort of Eno's f r u it salts, which was distributed throughout the world at a high price as a patent medicine. Tungsten metals contain 50 per cent, to 60 per cent, of tungsten materials, and in 1914 Germany had almost a monopoly of the tungsten steel manufacture for the world.",42
121,Mr MCDONALD,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Pranc e had a share of the manufacture. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - The honourable member is quite correct. The United States of America was partly self-supporting in the matter of tungsten metals, and France was also attempting to compete in ferrotungsten manufacture, but it was recognised that Germany had in her - claws practically the whole of the world's supply and distributing power of tungsten metals. I know from first intimacy with people engaged in the mining of these rare metals in Australia, that Germany was a most keen buyer prior to the war. The price offered by German buyers was £100 per ton more than the price which - has beensecured by our miners during the war. W it h in three months prior to the war the owners of a small mine in New South Wales sold a large quantity at £300 per ton. That quantity was shipped to Magdeburg, and the buyers were very keen to get the producers in the north of New South Wales and Queensland, where most of the Australian production of these rare metals comes from , to enter into contracts to supply so many tons per year for years ahead. That was, I suppose, in anticipation of the war. Tjuckily, however, during the war the attention of the British Government and scientists was drawn to the potentialities of these metals, and in the laboratories of Great B r it a in scientists have been able to perfect machinery which will produce tungsten steel equal to the German out,put. Scheelite, molybdenite, and wolfram are very rare metals. They are tungstens, inasmuch as they are used for the hardening of steel, this method taking the place of the old carbonizing process of heating very rapidly and cooling very rapidly. This is how the scales fell from our eyes during the war, and honourable members should know something about it , although it is not very palatable talk to those who are not closely in touch with the production of these metals. From a comparatively early date in the war, prices for the tungsten ores and' high speed steel were controlled in such a way that the B ritish makers-in reality - the British Government/-coul d secure their supplies of tungsten at a figure which has always been far below that ruling in other countries. During the war, Norway and Sweden, which produce very low-grade ores, were getting up to £2,000 per ton for their product. The British Government had to pay them the prices asked, so that the metal should not go to Germany or elsewhere, but the miners in Australia were only getting from £ 4 0 0 to £500 for the same standard 6f metal. This was owing to the fact that the British Government, who were out to win the war, had. cornered the whole of the Empire's supply of these precious metals. It was a case of l if e or' death to the nation to have these tungstens for the alloy of metals used for turning out munitions or producing high-class tools employed in munition works and elsewhere. I have a publication here which says with regard to the contracts made within the EmpireBy this arrangement a large sum of money, probably over £2,000,000, was saved by this country. The miner in Australia has helped to win the war by accepting from 40 to 50 per cent, below the price that he could have obtained for his produce in the nary markets of the world. He is not grumbling at that, but now that six months from the termination of the war the contracts between the Imperial yernment arid the Commonwealth Government will come to an end, and Gertralia, many will be a competitor in the markets of the world, he. believes that the monwealth Government ought to take steel steps to foster the industry here. I am speaking on behalf of hundreds of miners interested in winning these rare metals, and of people who have put thousands of pounds into oil-flotation ancl concentratThrough ing plants which have been set up for dealing with these precious metals. The producers have no wish to sell to the German buyers, but they want to know whether the Commonwealth Government will see that when the contract with the Imperial Government expires a market is found for their metals in the heart the Empire, and that they get the laboratory highest price to be obtained in the all allied metals. world's metal market, preferably from the British buyer.",42
122,Mr GROOM,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Does the honourable ber suggest that the Commonwealth tical tests and. experiments in regamil, should take over and organize the sale of these metals, and export them ? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I would not so far as to say that, but as the ramifiwill cations of the metal market are so weird and uncanny, the working miner or a the small company cannot be expected to into the heart of things at the other end of the world to ascertain what price should be obtained for the metals sent overseas. I regard it as being within province of the Cabinet of the day not brush this matter aside cursorily, but in the interests of the miners engaged in the industry producing metals which the Empire requires, to see that the. best price that is ruling in other parts of the [4041- 2 world is obtained for their output. During the war they accepted from 40 to 50 per cent, less than the price they could have obtained in the open markets of the world, and the British Government saved, at least £2,000,000 by getting theirsupplies from within the Empire - Our miners have helped to bring the* war to an end, and it is only fair and rational that this industry, which is so important to the British Empire and to its future orditrade, should be carefully watched, so that the miners engaged .in producing these rare metals may get the highest price which they could obtain by compeGotition in the open world's market. At the present time we have not in Ausso far as I am aware, any laboratory or works where experiments in reComgard to the manufacture of tungsten can be. carried out. At Teddington, near Richmond, in the suburbs of London, there is a research laboratory which, to an Australian, is an absolute eye-opener. the good offices of Sir John Monash, I had an opportunity to look through those works, and made the pleasing discovery that on the metallurgical side the highly intricate scientific researches being carried out there were under the direction of an Australian, D r Rosenhain, who won a travelling research of scholarship in Victoria. At this great tests are made of tungsten and I put it to the Government that one of the most important duties of ous. Bureau of Science and Industry tcrmemday should be that of making praco not only to the uses of our tungsteir metals, but to the manufacture of go tungsten steel, the demand for which be world-wide. We have here the iron, the steel, and the coal necessary to establishment of a great industry, and get the Broken Hiill Proprietary Company today seems likely to be able to supply the whole of the steel requirements of Australia. We need, however, to go f u r the ther. We should utilize our raw mato terials here just as Germany dealt with them before the war, and as England is utilizing them today. It seems to me that it should be the province of our Bureau of Science and Industry to make experiments, not with a small retort on a table, but on a scale designed to truly test - the general commercial u t i l it y of tungsten for the manufacture of tungsten steels. It should not deal merely with minute particles, but make experiments on a large scale, so as to show our ""steel manufacturers that it is physically possible to turn out in Australia an. article that was formerly manufactured principally in Germany.",43
123,Mr MCDONALD,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Succes s for us would mean a monopoly of the tool steels of the world. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Quite so. Providence has blessed us with all the things that go to make u,p a great nation - We have all that should tend to make Australia more self-contained than any other - country. Before the war these rare metals, about which .no one here, save those directly concerned, knew anything were being shipped from Australia, and concentrated in Magdeburg, Germany, where they were treated and, in manufactured form, sent to every quarter of the globe at prices perhaps 50,000* per cent, in advance of the original, cost of the raw product. That is a point that we ought not to forge.t. We should remember, also, the desire of Germany to corner these .metals as she cornered other metals from Australia. We have the coal and everything else necessary in connection with the production of steel. What, then, is there to prevent us' doing what Germany prior to the war was doing, with the use of our metals, for the world ? At the Teddihgton laboratory, amongst other things, various aeroplane tests are . made. I saw there a model aeroplane, with a spread of 2 f t . 6 in . , enclosed in a glass case, where it was subjected to a wind travelling: at the rate of 60 miles an hour. Scientists on either side of the glass case watched the effect of this rushof wind upon the tiny model, and noted every movement. In this way new designs were being tested.. The dimensions of the several parts were mathematically true to the extent of one ten-thousandth part of a second, and as the result of tests made in this way, plans and papers were sent to Woolwich and elsewhere, for the construction of aeroplanes, with a spread of 50 feet, with the certainty that as soon as they were made, pilots could enter them and fly away. It was there that I saw an Australian' boy,' Dr Rosenhain, controlling one of the biggest scientific research departments established in connection with the war. Why should not Australian scientists, instead of being employed'in other parts, be found employment here? I met several such men in the Old W o r l d . . One enters a great scientific laboratory in the Old Country, and finds occupying a prominent position there - a man who has come from the School of Mines at Ballarat, Adelaide, or Broken Hill . In conversation with him, one is told that Australia offered him no opportunities when he completed his course, and that he had to go abroad. The people of Australia paid for the' travelling research scholarships won by these men, who have been blessed with genius, and we should utilize their services here. They constitute a great national asset; they belong to us, and would be delighted to work with us; but we must offer them some inducement to remain here, and to assist in scientific research calculated to materially assist in building up the Commonwealth. It may be due to our sunlight or, perhaps, to our universal system of education, but the fact remains that, as a community, we have more initiative, than have any other people. These tungsten metals are more far reaching in their importance than most people imagine. They are associated with all the big industrial enterprises that are going to play a large part in the building up of Australia. This world of. ours is not run by hands alone, but by the dynamic force of every person in the community-by the utilization of the brains ' and the abilities of men occupying even the most humble positions. The abilities of our people should be marshalled foT the benefit of the whole community, and I urge the Government to enlarge the Bureau of Science and Industry ten or twenty fold, even if it costs £10,000 or £100,000 to do so. Every improvement made in the production of a particular commodity must benefit Australia as a whole. The nation that hopes to be some day at the head of the world's affairs must be prepared to utilize science to the full . It must recognise the value of science as applied to industry, and the importance', of bringing'to bear on all its - operations the Drains as well as the physical strength required to give effect to them. We have produced scientists whose services are being utilized in other countries today;we should find employment for them here. In regard to the utilization of these base metals, success lies in the hollow of our hand. One mine alone in the'north of New South Wales has prodiiced more, molybdenite than any other mine in the world. If these rare metals which are. going to count so much in the industrial progress of the community are to be utilized as they should be, it behoves the Government to see that the industry is protected. At the present moment all the miners in this particular branch of the industry are'out of work, amd expensive plants, costing from £8,000 to £10,000, are shut down because of the literal interpretation given to the agreement made by the British Government as to the supply of' these metals"". . I urge the Government to take such steps as will enable them, when the contract for the supply of tungsten terminates, six months after the conclusion of the war, to open up a market for the tungsten miners where they will get the best price for their metal's. We should take care that neither America, Germany, nor any other nation is allowed to exploit the industry as Germany did at the expense of the Australian public and the British Empire before the war - combustion The Acting Attorney-General (Mr. Groom.) asked, by way of interjection a few minutes ago, whether I would .suggest that the Government should take complete control of the marketing of this product.",44
124,Mr GROOM,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I was wondering whether the honourable member suggested that the Government should organize the producers, so that the marketing of their product might be carried out through the agency of the Government. ""Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - It seems to me that that proposal would hardly fill the hill. What I suggest is that the Government should ascertain what is the world's price for tungsten, and' where the best market is. If they do not intend to continue the control of this metal, then they should enable the Australian producer to shift it to the placewhere he can get the biggest price, so"" that the working miner will get ""the best possible Teturn for his industry. Unless that be done, Australia must go'out of the market as a producer of these rare metals. It is all-important to Australia, and the British Empire as a whole, that this branch of the metal in- dustry should be fostered. The subject is a very dry one, and I do not wish to labour it, but it is, as I have said, very far-reaching in its effects, and I am Utopian and hopeful enough to' believe that as the ramifications of the steel industry spread, and as strikes and industrial troubles become things of the past, we shall have established on this littorai of ours-nea r our coastal centres if you like, but I should say where hydro-electric power is availabie-^great industrial works. In Victoria and elsewhere beautiful rivers are running to waste; the latent power is. there'if we. will but use - it. We have all the raw materials,, and I hope that in the near future, with the aid of the brilliant minds of our scientists, the great steel industry of Australia will haye taken such strides that we shall be producing not only the crude steel, but all the highly-finished products which are now distributed from Sheffield, Wolverhampton, and other big centres in the United Kingdom, that we shall be able to supply the world's demand for internal engines, high-class electrical machinery, and every other high-class steel product. It is my belief and hope that it will not be necessary for us to send toGreat. Britain or America, and certainly not to Germany, for those manufactured! steel goods which in years past have absorbed so much of the life-blood of Australia.",45
125,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Brisbane) [2.48} The Bill before us' brings us face to face with a problem of a most intricate kind, which has been a fruitfu l source of perplexity to this Parliament ever since Federation was accomplished. One pleasant feature of the debate so far has been the evident desire of honourable members on both sides to recognise the difficulties and devise the best way out of them. Some honourable members have devoted their remarks to the need for protecting the manufacturers; others have thought of the consumers, and others of the producers; but there is evident desire in the Chamber.to secure to this Parliament such power as will give to all interests in Australia efficient protection and lasting security. purpose of the Bill is particularly focussed in the following paragraph of the which preamble: Ancl whereas the conditions brought .about by the war ore still operating, and render necessary to further control the supply price of sugar and dairy produce to the people of the Commonwealth . . . and the prices of dairy produce are concerned, the War Precautions (Prices) Regulations should continue to have the force of law, and provision should be made for the continued fixation of the price of sugar. . . . There we have a clear statement of what the Bill is expected to accomplish. brief, the measure seems to aim at securpeople ing statutory authority for we have been able to do by a temporary exercise of authority under the War cautions Act. I was interested that it was not until the War Precautions Act had been in operation for a considerpared able time that this Parliament discovered that it had any power under the Act do what'we have been doing during the last two or three years in our interferthem ence with the trade and commerce of the country. The limitations of the tution were recognised, and when the War Precautions Act was passed, there was no suspicion in the mind of ParliaB ment that it would enable us to extend the powers of the Constitution, limited our authority over trade and merce to that between States and with foreign countries. Later, a decision of the High 'Court revealed the fact that the Act conferred upon this Parliament unlimited power so far as trade commerce of the Commonwealth concerned. We have now come to end of that authority, and the Bill proPowers poses to continue under the authority of a statutory law of the Commonwealth certain of those powers which we sessed in time of war. At once the queslegal tions present themselves--""Can this ? Is this the way to. do it 1"" there is not the slightest doubt in minds of honourable members that we are exceeding our constitutional authority passing this Bill, I - have equally Mr Finlayson. doubt that we are trying to do the right an thing, but in the wrong way. A memorandum relating to the Australian Industries Preservation Act was prepared in August, 1909, by the honourable member The for Angas (Mr Glynn), and it says The method of amendment (section 128) enables the people to speak both through their,national representatives and directly at the poll on a referendum, is evidently more in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution it than that of parliamentary reference, which and applies to matters affecting the interests rather of two or more States than of the in so far as whole Commonwealth. I do not think there can be the slightest that doubt in the mind of any honourable member that the proper, unquestionable, and constitutional method of securing the powers sought in this Bill would have Ih been' by means of a referendum of the for the purpose of au amendmentsome things of the Constitution.",45
126,Mr GROOM,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"If we have the power to Predo these things, where is the necessity to notice for taking a referendum ?",46
127,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I am quite preto believe that Parliament is satisfied as to the need for the exercise to of these powers, and I also firmly believe that the people are ready to grant to the Commonwealth; indeed-, I believe the people are ready to give the. ConstiCommonwealth Parliament, if not entirely unlimited, at any rate, very much wider, powers than are contained in this ill . The spirit of nationalism has made rapid progress in Australia during the which last few years, and the ability displayed comby the Commonwealth Parliament in war emergency, and under pressure, has convinced the people that there are advantages to be gained from this Parliament possessing unlimited power over trade and and commerce. When the War Precautions was Act was in operation, late in 1915, this the Parliament passed a Commonwealth War Bill , which sought to arrange that certain powers should be granted to the Commonwealth Parliament for the purposposes of the war. Some very eminent gentlemen who are now quoted in we do support of this Bill expressed the view, Whilst then that if the States conceded the the powers which were being sought during the war, such powers would last only for in the period of the war and twelve months little afterwards, and then would revert to the States. An arrangement whereby the majority of the States conceded the powers sought was later accepted as the easier and more expeditious way out the difficulty. We must recognise the difficulties that do exist. The experience of the Federal Parliament and of the world, commercial community since the advent of Federationhas convinced the people that the present Constitution is unable to protect them in any sense either as producers, manufacturers, or consumers. How, then, are we to do it? Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) has quoted to the House certain legal authorities, who state that in their opinion this Bill is within the powers necessary. competence of the Federal Parliament. I would not dare to venture an opinion in contradiction of those eminent gentlethat men, but I cannot help reminding myself that these same lawyers have always been quoted as authorities against the Comside monwealth Parliament in the exercise of powers that were - not strictly constituthe tional. Now, we find them expressing every elector. an opinion that seems to give a very free and liberal interpretation of the tion.",46
128,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,On l y on the subjects mentioned in the Bill .,47
129,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"That cannot be, because if the Commonwealth powers exchequered career. tend to the matters mentioned in the . Mr Bill , they must also be capable of sion to anything else to which - the vernment may choose to apply them.",47
130,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Not necessarily.,47
131,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I am aware that this Bill is meant to continue certain arrangements made under the War Preif cautions Act . There is before the House another Bill to prolong other arrangegenerally ments made under the same Statute. We know how necessary and advisable it is that certain things should be protected, tralia, that whatever - contracts have been encracking tered into in regard to wool, wheat, sugar, and other commodities shall be prevent continued. The whole question is whether this Bill is the proper way to do it this the .proper time.",47
132,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,What will be position of the contracts if this Bill not pass ?,47
133,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"There is no quesprevent tion of the position in which the contracts will be. When we were discussing an extension of the Wa r Precautions Act a few months ago I aTgued that whilst it of would be necessary to guarantee the security of some of these contracts, and prevent disturbance in the commercial the sooner we got r i d of these restrictions that prevent business flowing back to normal channels the better it would be for the Government and the country. The danger I see is that we are going to establish a method of getting The round the Constitution without having the courage to say that the Constitution must be amended - in such a way as will secure to Parliament for all time the I was interested in looking up the case was put for and against when it was last proposed to alter the Constitution in 1915 - It will be remembered that each in politics was given an opportunity to put its case in writing, and copies of arguments were to be sent out to",47
134,Mr BRENNAN,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,I do not think copies Constituwere sent to every elector.,47
135,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"They were printed for that purpose, but I believe they were not really sent out.",47
136,Mr BRENNAN,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The publication-had a - FINLAYSON - Howeve r that extenmay be, on page 12 of the pamphlet .the Goargument in favour of the constitutional changes proceed thusEvery other Parliament in the Empire has the powers we are asking for. These Parliaments can protect the interests of the people they choose. They can limit the profits of these unscrupulous persons who are heaping up war fortunes., regulate prices, and deal with Trusts and Monopolies. They can deal with strikes and industrial disputes generally. But the Federal Parliament of Aus.in the greatest crisis of the modern world, when the entire fabric of civilization is with the frightful strain, is powerless to deal with capital or labour: powerless - to exploitation of ,the people by capital: powerless to maintain industrial peace. , and On page 19 that is emphasized in these wordsthe For example, under the Defence power, or does any other it now possesses, the Commonwealth could not give the producer a guarantee of trading freely between the States; it could not the States acquiring wheat, meat, or other produce; it could not make a general company law to protect shareholders and 'the general publie; it could not prevent exploitation pf the people by regulating prices; it could not limit profits during the war, and so prevent the piling up of huge war fortunes: it could not deal effectively with any industrial dispute .that paralyzed the industries of the country; it could not deal with Trusts and Combines; it could not nationalize or control a monopoly even if it were bleeding the nation white. On page 23, in reference to companies, we find the following: The Commonwealth must have power to control companies, because companies control nearly 'all the capital invested in industries upon which the great mass of the people are dependent for a living. Thecontrol of companies is a bread-and-butter question, for companies not only employ 75 per' eent. of all labour, but fix the prices of the greater part of-what the whole community lives on. . Companies control wages and prices, therefore the community must, be able to control companies. Trusts and Combines are usually composed of companies working together for their mutual benefit and the. people's detriment, and in order to effectually control Trusts and Combines we - must have power over the companies that compose them. It is interesting to notice that that power was desired, particularly during the war, because of a tendency among a certain class to take advantage of war necessities in order to aggrandize themselves. page 13, the present Prime Minister- (Mr . Hughes), who was the compiler of the argument in favour of the referendum j saidNow, we ail know how the cost of living has increased so .that it is with .the utmost, difficulty that the bulk of the community are able, even with the - greatest economy, to make both ends meet, and, making every allowance for the effects of the drought, there can be no doubt whatever that this is due very largely to manipulation' of. the market by unscrupulous persons at the expense of the community. These persons frequently pose as patriots. They subscribe £50 to patriotic funds, and fleece the public of £5,000 by high prices.",47
137,Mr TUDOR,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"That is absolutely correct. - Mr FINLAYSON ' - No one w i ture to question it . This Bill professes, as its particular purpose, to regulate the price of sugar and dairy produce, and to protect the people of Australia. But the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves is that, so far from the exercise of those powers having protected the people of Australia, we have a higher cost of livin g and larger profits, and the people i u a more'destitute position,:economically, than before - It is strainge, also, that while the' Government; in their' Minis terial statement, say that the price-fixing system they adopted saved some m i l lions of money to the people of the country, they propose to withdraw the price-fixing arrangements.",48
138,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,The Government could not help themselves.,48
139,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Why ?,48
140,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"They could not, from a constitutional stand-point.",48
141,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,That shows the one-sided character of this legislation.,48
142,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Not at all.,48
143,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The Government say that they have been able to reduce prices for the people, but that they cannot continue the protection because it would be unconstitutional, while at .the same time under this Bill they propose to continue protection-to whom ?",48
144,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Nothin g of the sort.,48
145,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I appreciate the position so thoroughly, that honourable members opposite find themselves compelled at considerable pains to explain things. I used to think that there was On only one class of men in the community who could adapt themselves to every change in circumstances, who could dothat to which Goldsmith refersDoctrines fashioned to the varying hour I am satisfied that in addition to the lawyers there is also a very .large section of politicians who find their doctrines very convenient in that respect. I know that there are two sections of politicians, at any rate, whom we can always i d e n t i fy and locate: I mean the extremists on both sides. There is the Conservative on the one side, and the Labour man on the other, and we always know where to find them; hut between there is an enormous l l vennumber who seem to be able to accommodate their conscienoe and arguments whenever circumstances require. They remind me of the lines by John OxenhamThe high soul climbs the - high way, Arid the low soul gropes the low; And in between, on the misty flats, The rest drift to and fro. There is scarcely an honourable gentleman opposite who feels more strongly in these matters than doesthei Minister in charge ef the Bill (Mr Groom) - That honourable gentleman has opposed and obstructed every attempt those very powers which he now purposes to acquire by unconstitutional method. Manyhonorable members oppo1 site have always consistently opposed the exercise of such powers by the Government, and there are also many others who, under more congenial political circumstances, have supported attempts to secure them. I believe that all of us here are of opinion that the Commonwealth should have these powers, but the question is whether we have a right to n u l l if y' the Constitution. This Parliament is supposed to be"" the depository of power under the Constitution-suppose d to be the custodian of the Constitution of Australia, and the protector of the liberties of the people. ^ Y e t we are deliberately being asked by the Government to violate the C'onstitutrio'n, which limits our powers.",48
146,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,I thought you said you would not dare to differ from the legal opinion given.,49
147,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,I do differ from that opinion; but I do not put my own opinion forward as of the same value.,49
148,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Y o u say that we violating the Constitution.,49
149,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I do, and I go further. In the Judiciary Act it is provided, section. 88, as both the honourable member for iWilmot (Mr Atkinson) and the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Bobert Best) must be aware, that when ever the Governor General refers to the High Court for hearing and determination any question of law as to the validity of any Act or enactment of Parliament, the High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. Then section 93 provides that the determination of the Court on the matter shall be final and conclusive, and not subject to any appeal. I challenge the Government to submit this Bill to the High Court under the provisions of the Judiciary Act after it has passed both Houses of Parliament, and let the High Court determine whether or not it is valid under the Constitution.",49
150,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Do not worry; Bill will get there! . Mr FINLAYSON - The ' honourable 1 member makes; a very relevant interjection when he says that the Bill will get to secure before the Court, in any case, and I can only hope that he will get his share of the work involved. There is no question that if the Government do not themselves take advantage of the Judiciary Act , and refer the Bill to the High Court, thus saving. an enormous amount of' time , trouble, and money, there are sections of the community who, for their own protection, will have to test its validity. This latter method will involve no end of intricate legal technicalities and arguments and, as I say, the expenditure of large sums of money.",49
151,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Surely you do not object to lawyers living ?,49
152,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I do not object to their l i v in g ; the only objection I have is to how they get their living. The honourable member's interjection reminds me of a most interesting episode that occurred in the House when we were discussing the industrial powers of the Commonwealth, and it was proposed to submit to a referendumthat the limitation! in .regard to the control of industries should be removed. 'On that occasion, the present Chief Justice of Victoria (Sir are William Irvine), who was then member for Flinders, said, in effect, "" The Acb is an Act for conciliation and arbitration and the prevention and settlement of . in dustrial disputes; we have argued as to the meaning of ' conciliation' and the meaning of ' arbitration,' and we have discussed the meaning of ' th& prevention and settlement' of disputes, and, most of all, as to whether or not there is a dispute at all . "" It will be much the same in regard to this Bill . Immediately the Commonwealth attempts to exercise the powers it gives a . whole stream of legal arguments will be let loose, and, instead of the ' powers accomplishing the purpose for which they are introduced-to secure certain arranged contracts in the interests of the contracting parties-w e shall have the Constitution of Australia dragged, torn , and beaten about, and we will scarcely know where, we are when the argument is over. On every occasion when a constitutional question has been brought before the the High Court, there has been a doubt left* as to what the Constitution really, means. It is admitted that it is not what it says, and that we do not know just where we are.",49
153,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,That is inevitable in regard to any written Constitution. It was the same in America.,50
154,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"It was not to the same extent in America, simply because - the Supreme Court there took a very courageous, though somewhat risky, attitude in their interpretation of the Constitution, and practically remade it . Mr ATKINSON , - And our Hig h Court followed them.",50
155,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"But not to the same extent, nor witl i the same clarity or definiteness. The judgments of the Supreme Court in America in regard to constitutional matters have always been clear, and in regard to specific cases have left no doubt as to their meaning.",50
156,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"America n have been relied on in interpreting our Constitution, which is largely founded on the American Constitution.",50
157,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I know that our Constitution and the decisions of. our High Court upon constitutional questions have largely followed the American stitution and Supreme Court decisions, but it is an argument that we should be content to follow the long, audi ruinous journeys of the American people in regard to their Constitution, which, like ours, was'a compromise based on political rather than economic necessities, and that we sliould go to the fountain head, which is not provided the American Constitution, and ask people of Australia what they think about this whole question of Commonwealth powers. We have a favourable opporget tunity of doing so at the next general election. I have not the slightest that if the people are appealed to they will be prepared to give this Parliament the powers which are now sought to be extended to it , particularly because is an urgent necessity to protect them against exploitation. The people, only of . Australia, but of every other country, have been deliberately robbed exploited by their fellow countrymen under the pressure of war necessities. I is unfortunate, but immediately war wasteful, breaks out troubla begins. The Melbourne Age on l l t h August, 1914-abou t a week after war broke out-publishe d the following:State interference is not merely justifiable, it is necossary. The exploiter is in com/mand of the market, and he has shown us the stuff of which he is made. Like a bolt from the blue war fell upon the world . . . with a parallel rapidity the exploiter fell on us, and proceeded to batten on our needs. Not an instant did he hesitate. The nation lay prone before him, and, perfect patriot that he is, he fastened on the nation like a vampire. It would be less harmful to encounter an armed foe in the field than to suffer the extortions of these ruthless greedy traders. Unquestionably we must outface and disarm them; and there is only one way to clo that-by collaborating State interference. The position has not improved since then. On the contrary, it has gone from bad to worse. Whatever disadvantages we suffered because of profiteering, exploitation, and economic piracy at 4}ie beginning of cases the war, we are in a much more parlous condition today.",50
158,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,The strike is not helping matters.,50
159,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"There would have been no strike if the Commonwealth Parliament had used fearlessly and honestly Confche powers the Government possessed under the War Precautions Act , and not which should have been used under contortuous, stitutional authority. Mr MCWILLIAMS . : - To man and run the ships? I agree with you.",50
160,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,To ' run the ships by granting to the seamen what are adi n mitted on every hand to be nothing more the than fair and reasonable terms.,50
161,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,If the Arbitratio n Court says that they are the seamen will the benefit of them. The honourable member's party has always been in doubt favour of arbitration.,50
162,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,That is so.,50
163,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"It does not look like ft now, because the purpose of the strike there is to burst up arbitration.",50
164,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The honourable not member is putting a very strained interpretation on the attitude of. the seamen. and Our party has distinctly repeated its belief in arbitration; but it maintains t that the present system is inefficient and and that it is too slow and too costly. When we asked for the power to make the Arbitration Court effective for its purpose, the honourable member for Kooyong (i Sir Robert Best) was one of those who' most violently opposed it .",50
165,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,NO ; I have been one of the strongest supporters of arbitration for the last t h i r t y years.,51
166,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I did not say that the honourable member opposed arbitration. I say that he opposed our efforts to get power to make the Arbitration Court effective for its purpose. The faul t today is not that arbitration as a principle has failed, but that the application of the principle so as to be usefully effective has failed. The demand is not for the abandonment of arbitration, but that the Government, not only in connection with the proposals referred to in the Bill , but also in regard to the whole economic situation, should secure to the Commonwealth powers which will enable the Arbitration Court to be made what it was meant to be, and what is was understood it was to be- a means of preventing and settling industrial disputes. To-day we have a paralysis of the functions of a Court which could be made useful for economic purposes. Mr Justice Higgins, President of the Court, told us ten years ago that the position which has arisen would certainly emerge unless some attention was paid to the functions of the Court.",51
167,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The Court is not paralyzed. The trouble is simply that the men will not go to it . Mr ' PINLAYSON - The seamen did go to the Court last December, and they secured an award.",51
168,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"But they refuse to go to it now, because then they did not get as much as they expected.",51
169,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"It is amusing to hear these gentlemen referring to the action of the seamen, and accusing them of not doing their work or proceeding along constitutional lines when the Government are introducing a Bill which is absolutely unconstitutional. Where have the seamen or workers in any for m of activity learned the virtue of direct action? Froin my friends opposite. The whole of their actions, every step they have taken, has been direct action. May I revert to the - argument I was putting forward when drawn away from it by the interjection of the honourable member for Franiklin (Mr . MCWilliams) ? I was talking about the exploitation of the public and increased prices. On every occasion that the wiorker in an industry went to the A r b i tration Court and secured an award, almost .contemporaneously there was direct action on the ipart of the manufacturers and merchants in the shape of increases in the cost of the commodities produced. - Sir ROBERT BEST - The manufacturers do not carry on philanthropic institutions.",51
170,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The increase was partly justified by the increased cost of production, but in some cases the price paid by the public was out of proportion to the increase in the cost of production, brought about by the new terms of the award. However, on one side we had arbitration in regard to fixing the workers' wages, whereas on the other side there was direct action on the part of the employers and manufacturers in fixing the cost of the commodity. There is no Arbitration Court to fix prices, and when the Commonwealth Government exercised some control over the fixation of prices and the manufacturers discovered at the end of the war that protection of the public was withdrawn--ther e was immediate action on their p.art. A case was brought under my notice this week. The day after the Government announced . the withdrawal of the price-fixing regulations dealing with condensed milk, the price of that commodity increased by 6s. per case.",51
171,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Does the honourable member contend that the Commonwealth Parliament has the constitutional power to legislate in regard to the fixation of prices ?,51
172,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,I say that the Commonwealth Parliament does not possess that power.,51
173,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Then for what is the honourable member arguing ?,51
174,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I contend that the Commonwealth Parliament does not possess the constitutional power to do so, neither has it the constitutional power to continue its control over wheat, wool, or any other thing ; but, inversely, if it has the power to deal with these commodities it also has the power to deal with others. i",51
175,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"There , are no contracts in regard to the other commodities. We can deal only with commodities for which we have contracts.",52
176,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"The honourable member must know that if the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to.deal with commodities, their list does not end with those contained in this Bill . The very fact that certain articles are covered by the Bill is an admission that somewhere the power of this Parliament is lacking - able member prophesying what the GoMr HECTO B LAMOND - The ment have, merely brought this Bill forward because the House insisted that definite legislation should replace the Wa r . Precautions Regulations.",52
177,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,I do not know that the House insisted on it . The party upstairs may have done so.,52
178,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,No . The honourable member was as insistent as. any other honourable member.,52
179,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"When we were previously discussing' this matter, I submitted an'amendment to refer the whole question of the continuation of the control of trade and commerce, industrial matters, and so on, to a referendum, and Mr Speaker, quite correctly, ruled the amendment out of order. Nevertheless, I believe that is theproper method to adopt. If there was not some doubt as to the power of the Commonwealth under the existing authority, there would not be need for this Bill . . The very fact that the 'Government bring forward a Bill to give them authority to do things which are illegal, prove that they deem it is necessary to obtain the power sought for.",52
180,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Unde r the existing regulations the Government could do anything they propose to do under this Bill.,52
181,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"W it h every movement in the direction of protecting the producers of wheat, milk, wool, and sugar, and the consumers of those commodities, I am in most hearty agreement, but I want to know why the Government stopped at these articles-. Other people are not protected.  tion.",52
182,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"It is not another question, but another phase of the same question. The Government, having decided to obtain statutory authority for all these regulations,, and since it is a certainty that their right to this authority will be questioned in the High Court, they might as well have made one .job of the. lot. As it is, they are making two bites at the one cherry, and t'he result will be grave trouble.",52
183,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Is the honorGovern- vernment are going to do?,52
184,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I am pointing out how the Government could obtain the necessary authority in the easiest and most effective way. I am confident that the people of Australia are ready to give fchis Parliament increased powers. I recently had an argument with a friend in regard to the W a r Precautions: Act. My friend said, "" Thank goodness, the W a r Precautions Act will expire in a short time . "" But my reply to him was, "" I am certain that before the Act expires there will be a movement for it s extension."" My friend pooh-poohed the idea, and said that, under the Constitution, it would be impossible to extend it . But writhin a fortnight there was introduced in this House a Bill to extend the Act.",52
185,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,The honourable member must have known it was coming on.,52
186,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"No ; but there are many men who, like the honourable member, and the honourable member for Hlawarra (Mr Lamond), have plenty of backsight but little foresight. The honourable member for ' Robertson (Mr Fleming) has made a very striking appeal for the farmers. He has pointed out the difficulties that confront them at the present time.",52
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,So m e of them are in a very bad position.,52
188,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I think that is so. No one on either side of the House objects to the prosperity of any section of the community; but we have all to recognise that the man on the land practically, carries the burden of "" the community. If it be true-and I believe that to a large extent it is-that the primary producers' of Australia are in 'the very unfortunate position outlined' by' the honourable member' for Robertson, 'thensomething should be done for their projection. The honourable member 'said that there was a strong feeling on the part of the' primary producers that they' were' not receiving proper treatment, and he asserted,'further, that land was going out of cultivation. That is' a most unfori tunate position of affairs, and it can be true oniy because of the actions of the Government now in power. statements were made while the Labour Governmentwere in office were charged with not giving the farmer sufficient protection, - but it was - never said that the farmers ""were not properly treated by us, or that during our regime land was going out of cultivation. If the farmers are suffering, it , may be but another illustration of a man falling amongst his friends who have robbed him.",52
189,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,The honourable member has been looking so far ahead that he has no time to look at the complaints made while his party were ' in office.,53
190,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,My concern is that if land is going out of cultivation it will constitute one of our biggest difficulties in meeting our liabilities and in endeavouring to reconstruct after the war.,53
191,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,The high price of sugar is causing some hundreds of acres of small f r u it country to be given up.,53
192,Mr FINLAYSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"If the price of sugar is too high, writh whom rests'the fault? While this Bill proposes to perpetuate the present price of sugar, namely, 3Jd. per lb. for A l grade, the actual result of the fixation of prices is that today the people have to pay 3^d. per Ib. for an inferior sugar. The maximum price is becoming the price for the minimum grade. In the restaurants, as well as in. the.homes of the people, today you will find, not A l sugar, but brown sugar being used, and the price charged for this is 3 | d . per lb. I am prepared to support the Government in guaranteeing the people A l sugar at 3Jd. per lb'., and low.er grades at correspondingly lower prices.' The honourable member for 'New England (Lt - Colonel' Abbott), who ""treated"" the'House to an interesting and illumi-nating speech in regard to the metal in dustry', pointed to the enormous potential wealth that we have in our metals. Every one knows that in our mineral resources we have a latent wealth of i m mense value, not only to - our own material internal interests, but in rehabilitating us in respect of our foreign responsibilities. What are we doing to develop them, and what can we do? Each State has its ownMines Department No such controlling the mining industry. The Federal Parliament,' by means of its True,- we control over exports, also interferes, and between the two authorities it is so battered about that only those large firms that areable to exercise, monopo-listic control are securing any benefit from their labours;' The workers, the men who are doing the spade work of the industry, are getting the least return.' That is what is happening in connection with all industry in Australia, and it is largely responsible for the prevailing industrial unrest. Unless we can find ways and means - of meeting this difiSculty other than by an extension of the powers of the Wa r Precautions Act, for what can we hope ? Legislation of this kind is mere patchwork. It represents only instalments to keep the wolf from the door for the time being. What we want is a strong, bold, courageous policy for Australians, having regard, not to the individual States, hut to Australia as a whole. I am inclined to think that what the Government are trying and hoping to do by means of this Bill is good, but I believe, also, that they are seeking to secure that object in a wrong way; and no method ' of doing the right thing in the wrong way will ' ever lead to satisfactory results. There is a very easy method of getting the necessary powers. In addition to the method of the referendum, which is by far the most reliable means of getting the people of Australia behind these powers, there is still another way in which' 'to secure authority - The Government, might have made an adventure along these lines by asking the States to give their concurrence to; the vesting of these powers in the Federal Parliament. Such' approval, on the authority of Sir Edward Mitchell, who speaks as to' the competence of ""the Parliamentto '.pass this Bill , would have enabled the Commonwealth Government to carry on these schemes u n t i l the expiration of the present contracts. I do not see how the States could have objected to such an extension of these powers as would cover the period of the contracts, and, having obtained their concurrence, the Commonwealth Government would have had an effective and easy method of accomplishing their purpose. Instead of that, they have brought down a Bill which is going to lead us into bog after bog and morass after morass of legal technicality, and in the end we shall not know where we are or what our Constitution is worth to us. It is because I believe that we can get a Constitution that will give us power to effectively manage the affairs of Australia in the interests of the people that I suggest to the Government that, immediately after these Bills are passed, they should submit them to the High Court under the terms of the Judiciary Act , and obtain straight way the decision of the Court as to their validity.

196,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I l l a w a r r a ) [3.45] - An order recently issued seems to aim at the discharge of the whole of the staff sergeants on the In structional Staff, and the substitution for them of returned soldiers. I have every desire that returned soldiers shall have preference in employment, but I have been told that some of these men applied for leave to enlist, and made every endeavour to get to the Front, but were prevented by the Department from doing so. Now they are being punished because (on they did not see active service. If that is being done, it is most unjust that they should be made the victims of a regulation which ignores the fact that it is owing to the action of the Government that they are in their present plight. The payment of these men also calls for sympathetic attention. They have been kept for three and a half years at practically the same wages as they started at, although, owing to the war, the cost of livin g has been increasing each year. Altogether it seems to me that their case calls for TO RE - more sympathetic treatment at the hands of Ministers than it has had so far .",54
197,Mr RILEY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"South Sydney) [3.47] A man who is well advanced in years, and has one wooden leg, has been dismissed from his employment in the Ordnance Branch in order to make room for a returned soldier. Surely the Government do not intend, in order to give effect to the policy of preference to soldiers, to discharge old men who were not capable of going to the war. This man has for many years struggled for his living, and yet he has been dismissed, and another man, who is hale and hearty, although he has served at the Front, has been put in his place. I am sure that returned soldiers do not expect to take the place of aged cripples. I hope the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) will make inquiries into the case.",54

199,Mr WEST,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"East Sydney) [3.52] - In the main streets of Melbourne today I witnessed a spectacle which almost broke my heart. I saw large crowds of men, women, and children pleading to be given the means to buy the necessaries of life. It seems to be deplorable that something has not been done to grant the relief they need. I have no desire to go into the merits of the present industrial dispute, but I think that, in the midst of our rejoicing at the great victory which the E m pire and the world have achieved, we should at least try to remove the great distress in our midst. I appeal to the .Government to regard the plight of these people in a humane spirit, and to do something to prevent a repetition of the demonstration we saw today. We ought not to let the wide world know that people needing sustenance must in this twentieth century parade our cities in order to impress their claims upon the Government. I feel sure that if the Government are of the same mind as the majorit y of honourable members, and of the people outside Parliament, they will adopt some method of rendering assistance to these needy citizens.",55

He was demobilized last ruary, and sent word saying he could not home quick enough. I have had no money since, and no word or sign from him. I feel sure he is dead. I was driven fairly mad owing three weeks' rent, and no money to move. So, yesterday, I - sent furniture store, .and a friend paid for a room for days. My eldest girl worked three years at MACRobertson's, but is out of work. Other children are aged 13, 11, 10, and I have fairly hurt and insulted, over my rent bills in front of neighbours. I have pawned even my blankets, and I can prove to not able to work hard. A friend has paid for a room in this house until Tuesday, and dren have been taken by different people few days. After that-7-God knows. St. cent de Paul Society has helped me with a food and boots for two children; one has just come out of Fairfield Hospital after scarlet fever. They tried to get the boys into the orphanage, but could not; they are crowded My only reason for bringing this matter forward publicly is that there may be other similar cases; .and I regard it as great travesty and satire on the celebrations that a woman and her. children should be in such ,an unfortunate position after the services rendered the country by her husband.

It is particularly pointed put that in the case of vessels The husband coming vid the Cape, Hobart could easily be made the first port of call, in wif e volving scarcely any diversion from the ship's course. It seems deplorable that there should be such difiSculty in getting men to the island State after they have been landed in Australia.

I am informed that a wire has been sent to the Acting Prime Minister been (Mr W at t ) , and to Admiral Clarkson, and to the effect that public meetings are being held throughout the island in order you I am to impress on the Government the. my chilgravity of the situation.

206,Mr HIGGS,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Capricornia) [ 4 . 5 ] - I think that, honourable members' on both sides will be interested in the reply I have received from the Defence Department to the petition which was forwarded .from enemy subjects, or people of enemy origin, who desire to remain in Australia. The reply is as follows: Department of Defence, Melbourne, 14th July, 1!)19. Witli reference to your letter of the 5tli in-' stant, addressed to the Acting Prinie Ministei . and a petition received by you from certain enemy aliens resident in the Ambrose and Mt. Larcom districts, together with a supporting petition signed by other residents of the districts, I have to inform you that nothing is known of - these individual cases at headquarters, but that only in exceptional cases is it proposed to call on uninterned enemy aliens to show cause why they should not be deported, and that before any person is deported lie will have an opportunity of applying to a specially appointed tribunal for permission to remain in Australia - Your s faithfully, The Ministry ought to tell us, I think, how this specially appointed tribunal is to be composed, and where it will sit. Are these uninterned residents in Queensland to be compelled to come to Sydney, Melbourne, or Adelaide, in order to appear on their own behalf ? I urge that any action by the Government in regard to these people should be prompted by the dictates of humanity, and not by vindictiveness and revenge. We asked these people to come to Australia, and amongst those who have communicated with me are many who took up very heavily-timbered country, cleared it , and invested all they had in their farms. Germany has been utterly smashed, and we ought to follow the plan of America, where native-born Germans, of whom there are 10,000,000, are allowed parole. America is composed of a dozen different nationalities-Russian , Austrian, German, Italian--possibl y it is the admixture that accounts for the strength, of the United States as a nation. ' In our own race Danes, Jutes, Angles, and Saxons, and a dozen other peoples make up the British race.",57

Wow that the war is over and the enemy crushed, we ought to allow a spirit of humanity to influence us. We are anxious to keep the country popu^ la ted, and to increase the populat i o n ; and yet it is proposed by the edict of the Government to send these people out of Australia. The tribunals ought to be local, so that those concerned may not be put to expense or placed at a disadvantage, and all the proceedings T. TRUMBLE, ought to be open to the public. If there Secretary. is evidence that a person is not fit to re- main here let him be sent away, but if those brought to the Court are shown to be honest, hard working citizens who have done nothing against the British Empire, fchey ought to be allowed to remain, whether they be German, Austrian, OT any other European nationality.

213,Mr KELLY,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Then I did not quite understand; but, in any case, I think the Government ought to get in touch with Australians who enlisted in the Imperial Forces on sea or land and take care that their dependants are treated as favourably and generously as are the dependants of the men who enlisted in Australia. This means, of course, that we must maintain the dependants u n t i l their men folk return. I have no doubt that the Imperial Government will do everything possible to help men who enlisted in their service, but whether'they do so or not, we are under obligation to our own people; and I trust that the Assistant Minister for Defence will see that dependants are given a decent chance u n t i l the return of the breadwinners.",57

The position of Tasmania, I am afraid, is not thoroughly understood in this House, ""for very few members find time to visit the island and ascertain what are the conditions there. In the circumstances, honourable members are apt to 'forget that Tasmania is an island, and has not ithe same quick and means of transport as land. Many of these boys have been away for years, and, with other Australians, have held their . own. they deserve-and I do not say they do not get-as much attention as is given to others, but the people of Tasmania, not being full y aware of the departmental replies to questions, do not always realise that a fair deal is being given. the Government to hurry up the despatch of the Tasmanian soldiers to their homes, either by sending them - by way of Adelaide, as has already been done, in one case; or allowing the boats vid the Cape to first call at Hobart. There is another matter in regard to which I do .not think the authorities are getting full credit from the Tasmanian people, who cannot understand why the Rotornahana should have been held up at Portsea instead of going direct to Barnes Bay. I think that the authorities very likely have a good reply if they would 'only make it known. \ - Mr TUDOR - Perhaps there accommodation at Portsea.",58
215,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"That cannot be the - reason, because they do not go ashore at Portsea.' If the Rotornahana could go straight to Barnes Bay, and come back again, she could convey 500 or 600 men during the time that she is now wasting at Portsea.",58
216,Mr TUDOR,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,Is there sufficient accommodation for 500 men at Barnes Bay?,58
217,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"Yes . There were 700 men there quite recently.. But that is not the reason. It is, I understand, because there is not sufficient coal. A very - I unfortunate position has arisen in regard to quarantine. When the influenza epidemic broke out, the States and the Commonwealth were raising small points in all directions, and quibbling about , them, while the people who were suffering from the scourge were allowed to be neglected. The State of Tasmania happens to have remained a clean State, and surely they have a right to keep out the disease. Medical men do .not seem to know very much about it , and the Tasconvenient manian health authorities claim that the main- seven days is a sufficiently short period. At any rate, at least one case of influenza occurred within six days on a boat proFor this ceeding to the island, and proved fatal. Other cases have occurred after intervals of-four and five days. My experience of influenza was a pretty lively one.. I was on the Rotornahana at Portsea for seventeen days, and the disease went through I urge the ship like a bush.fire. The authorities at Portsea relieved the situation by removing the crew and second class passengers, and by sealing up the fore part of the ship, after which there were no f u r ther cases on board. On that occasion the cases followed one another within forty-eight hours, but as the Tasmanian authorities can point to cases which have occurred in which the interval has been five or six days, they are satisfied that a period of seven days is the very least that they can adopt with safety to the people of the State. Apparently doctors everywhere know very little about the disease. In fact, they are. very chary about giving any opinion in regard to it . is more",58
218,Mr TUDOR,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"I think that the Tasmanian health .authorities, who are enforcing seven days' quarantine, know as little about influenza as others do.",58
219,Mr ATKINSON,PEACE CELEBRATIONS AND,"They know quite as much as others do, and, on the experience they have gained, they arc entitled to claim that a period of seven days' quarantine is necessary. I do not want the State authorities and the Federal authorities to be fighting one another while the patient they are supposed to be saving is left to die, and seeing that the disease is likely to continue with us for another twelve months, it is time they put their heads together to devise a scheme consistent with public safety for permitting freer communication between Tasmania and the mainland. If a quarantine station is established at Middle Tsland, in the Tamar River', what is there to prevent the Loongana, or any other boat, taking passengers backwards and forwards much more speedily than is possible under the present arrangement? The interests of the public should be the first thought of the Commonwealth and State authorities, and the sooner something is done in this matter in the interests of the public the better it will be for all concerned.",59

In order that this could be rendered possible Australia put the best part of400,000 bien under arms, of whom, approximately, 60,000 fell in the war. Chiefly by reason of the character of the Australian soldier on service, small breaches of discipline Brought penalties on the war servicesheets of many of those who fell, and, in the spirit in which we ought to approach Peace, I ask the Government to remit all those penalties.",59
