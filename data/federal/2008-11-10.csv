Question agreed to. Privileges and Members' Interests Committee Report",19
5,Mr RAGUSE,COMMITTEES,I present the report of the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests entitled Review of procedures of the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.,20
6,Mr RAGUSE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report is issued as a discussion paper on proposed procedures for the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests to provide natural justice and procedural fairness for those involved in the committee processes. By way of background, in November 2002 the committee advised the House that it had developed procedures that it would follow for witnesses and others who may be involved with the committee in its consideration of matters of privilege. The procedures were developed to provide for natural justice and procedural fairness for witnesses before the committee. During the 41st Parliament the committee commenced a review of these procedures. As part of the review the committee sought advice on its procedures from two leading academics in the field of parliamentary privilege-Professor Geoffrey Lindell and Professor Gerard Carney. In addition to proposing procedures for the committee and the House, Professors Lindell and Carney also proposed the transfer of the penal jurisdiction of the House of Representatives to the courts. The committee invited comment on the paper before asking the secretariat to review the paper and propose a response to the recommendations made by Professors Carney and Lindell. The response includes proposed procedures for the committee's consideration of matters of privilege. The committee sought the views of the Clerk and Deputy Clerk of the House on the proposed secretariat response. In summary, the Clerk and Deputy Clerk (1) did not support the transfer of the penal jurisdiction of the House of Representatives to the courts and (2) supported appropriate procedures for the committee to ensure the protection of procedural fairness and natural justice and considered the procedures proposed in the secretariat paper were reasonable. In presenting this matter for discussion, the committee indicates that its initial view is that it does not support the transfer of the penal jurisdiction of the House of Representatives to the courts. It is therefore important that the committee has appropriate procedures to ensure natural justice and procedural fairness for all persons involved in the committee's processes. The committee invites comment on the proposed procedures for the protection of witnesses before the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests before it reports back to the House to make recommendations for the formal implementation of the procedures. The committee also notes that there are some additional procedures that relate to the way matters of privilege are dealt with by the House after the committee has examined the matters and reported. The committee proposes that these matters could be covered by a resolution of the House. The committee welcomes the views of members and others on the proposed procedures. NA (EDUCATION REFUND) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 October, on motion by Mr Swan: That this bill be now read a second time.",20
7,Mr BALDWIN,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 and the impact that this bill will have on the constituents in the Paterson electorate. This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 by introducing a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses, up to a maximum of $750 per child undertaking primary studies to provide a maximum offset of $375 and up to $1,500 per child undertaking secondary studies to provide a maximum tax offset of $750 per child per year. The bill proposes that families who purchase school related materials-such as computers, computer related equipment, internet connections, computer software, school textbooks, stationery and course required tools-will be refunded 50 per cent of these costs. In the second reading speech the Treasurer stated that this bill is ‘a key part' of the education revolution, ‘helping parents meet the everyday costs of their children's education'. While I support the notion of tax offsets to assist Australian families in the expense of education, this bill does not go far enough to ensure the education revolution that the Rudd Labor government promised and does not relieve families of the real everyday costs of education. The former Howard government proposed at the last election that all Australians should have the opportunity to deem what is best for their own children. The coalition stands for choice. The former Howard government empowered Australian families by enabling parents to choose the best education for their children, which often required them to juggle their priorities but also the costs associated with educating their children. The coalition believes it is the parents who know what is best for their children. The former Howard government's aim was to meet the everyday needs of Australian families. The coalition's policy adopted a broader approach, allowing Australians to prioritise the costs associated with educating their children. The coalition went to the election with a policy to rebate up to $800 annually for each secondary student and up to $400 for each primary and preschool student. The policy that the former Howard government brought to the last election explicitly included school and preschool fees, school uniforms, textbooks, stationery, calculators, camps, excursions, laptops, broadband, software and extracurricular activities such as sport and music. These are the real expenses of education that Australian families need assistance with. The former Howard government's policies offered more scope and empowered choice. We all heard the shallow promises and cheap publicity stunts resorted to by the Rudd Labor government in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election. ‘Every child shall have their own computer', we repeatedly heard those opposite claim. Now, 11 months on, the promise has been replaced with a muchwatered-down approach, replaced with a promise to provide every child from years 9 to 12 with ‘access' to the latest technology. The Rudd Labor government's proposed tax offsets do little to assist parents and students alike in the purchasing of ‘education revolution' tools such as computers and associated expenditures. How the Rudd Labor government can be confident and assured in their approach to this matter and continually proclaim unfulfilled promises to the future leaders of our nation is beyond me. The bill's inadequacies concern many members of the Paterson electorate. It is far too narrow and far too limiting. It is yet another example of why ‘Kevin07' has quickly become ‘Mistake08'. Many parents in my electorate struggle to keep their children in school uniforms, let alone have the luxury of a computer. How is this bill going to help them when the price of an average computer starts at around $1,500, a quality laptop is at least $1,000 and printers start from $150? How on earth is a family who is struggling to put clothes on their children's backs going to afford $1,500 for a computer? This bill is absolutely unrealistic. Furthermore, the bill goes to show just how out of touch the Rudd Labor government truly is with Australian families and their associated needs. In reality, disadvantaged families will not be able to afford the upfront costs of a computer. This bill fails to address the real things that people are struggling with, like the cost of school uniforms, which starts at around $200; the cost of a pair of solid school shoes, which is at least $50; and the cost of school camps, which can be upwards of $300. And the Rees government in New South Wales has recently announced the abolition of the $50 back-to-school bonus and of free travel to school for schoolchildren. These are the issues that parents have to deal with on a day-today basis, the issues that the Rudd Labor government is not acknowledging. This government purports to represent working-class families when it is obvious it is out of touch with Australian families, the issues that concern them the most and what education costs are causing them the most significant financial burden. This bill is yet another example of the Rudd Labor government failing to address the basic things families and children need. In the Paterson electorate alone there are over 2,200 preschool children whose families will reap no benefit at all from this bill. What I demand to know is: why has the Rudd Labor government excluded preschool children from this bill? If the Rudd Labor government truly believes that reimbursing books and computer software will give our children a better start, then why wouldn't the most logical step be to include rebates for preschool children as well? Sending children to preschool does represent significant financial costs to parents. There are costs associated with preschool fees, books and school equipment. Is the Rudd Labor government too blind to see this? Or perhaps it is just that those opposite are already too arrogant to listen to the Australian public and ask them what is important to them during this time of significant financial stress. The people of Australia deserve better. What is the Rudd Labor government doing for my electorate? And what, may I ask, are the Rudd Labor government's plans for constituents in my electorate who may already own a computer but need relief from the other educational expenses? This bill simply neglects those families. I agree with the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Julie Bishop, that the Rudd Labor government's bill does nothing to address the basics of a good education, does nothing to support families with the real day-today costs of schooling and does nothing to encourage choice. The bill, in summary, is a joke. The Rudd Labor government is a joke. Australians need relief from the expensive burden of education brought on by the mismanagement of the economy by state Labor governments. The Rudd Labor government said this bill is an education revolution. I say, ticularly to those children up in the gallery, this is an education dissolution. Since the Rudd Labor government came to power, their ability to implement such a revolution has been replaced with an embarrassing display of acts which highlight their incompetence and absolute inefficiency. All this bill is good for is revealing the complete lack of credibility and capability within the Rudd Labor government. This bill is significantly less comprehensive than the policy that the former Howard government took to the last election. My real concern is how this bill will affect families in my electorate of Paterson. Why should parents in my electorate be totally out of pocket for education which is supposed to be free? The Rudd Labor government has again failed Australian families. This bill should have addressed the cost of school uniforms, fees, camps, children's extracurricular activities and now, in New South Wales, things as simple as the cost of transportation of children to school each day. The Rudd Labor government is, as I said, out of touch with average working families in Australians. If it had consulted with the community the government would have know that these are the real concerns of Australian families. I personally know many families in my electorate that struggle to afford to pay for their children to be engaged in sport, have difficulty affording to keep their children in school uniforms, cannot pay for their children to attend school camps and cannot even consider attempting to pay for extra tuition if their children are struggling with a particular subject. And this bill does nothing for them. The Howard government always put the interests of Australians first, rather than simply trying to look good in the limelight. The former Howard government were not into cheap publicity stunts; they were about subparstance. In stark contrast, the Labor government is showcasing a terrific example of what can happen to a country's governance when the party in power is solely concerned with attracting the limelight but fails to implement fair, realistic and effective policies. This so-called ‘education revolution' is just like a fake tan: it looks good first up but the gloss wears off eventually and, when it does, you are left with a mismatch and a mess. In contrast, the coalition's policy was to help families provide more educational opportunities for their children, and the coalition introduced a 40 per cent rebate on education expenses, including school fees. During its 11-year term, the former Howard government worked hard to help Australian families and to provide realistic education opportunities for our children. Unlike the Rudd government, we did not parade shallow education revolutions. We designed a policy that would actually help the Australian people. The Rudd Labor government has not done a single thing to ensure Australians get the relief they urgently need. It is absurd for the Rudd government to suggest that refunding money from a computer or textbooks is enough to deem it an education revolution. What if the parent has already bought a computer for their child and is looking at reimbursements for other education needs? They will miss out. There is nothing brilliant or remotely exciting in this bill. There are many families in my electorate who do not need a new computer every year. What they need is help with the ongoing financial burden of education-like school fees and uniforms-and help to fund extracurricular activities. This bill is a gimmick to trick the Australian people into thinking that the Rudd government is working in their best interests. The government is doing nothing to support the real cost of education. I believe that education is the most valuable investment that can be made in our children because, no matter what happens to children in their lives, education is the one thing that can never be taken away from them. The bill does absolutely nothing to address the basics of a good and successful education. The Treasurer, in his second reading speech, said that this bill will help kids get the best start. I ask the government: how will this bill ensure that kids get the best start? I doubt that reimbursing even the cost of a computer or some schoolbooks is enough to fulfil your promises and give Australian children the best start. My constituents tell me that they are greatly concerned about the time it will take for the rebate to be put in the pockets of hard working families. Some of the families in my electorate cannot afford the cost of a computer without being reimbursed immediately. If somebody bought a computer tomorrow, they could not seriously put in a claim until they got their group certificate, and realistically that could mean Australian families may not be reimbursed for up to 12 months. The Rudd Labor government's attitude is that the single most important thing that they can do for young Australians is to give them a chance at a decent education. This is a paradox. The Rudd Labor government have excluded key factors for reimbursement that would help a child's education. In this bill the Rudd Labor government do not reflect their supposed passion for protecting and helping Australian people. They are all spin and no substance. The Rudd Labor government's Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill is not practical, and it disadvantages Australians and denies them choice. In my electorate alone there are over 20, 000 schoolchildren who expect more from the Rudd Labor government after all the promises they made during the election campaign. After nearly 12 months of government the bill shows how out of touch the government have become. This so-called ‘education revolution' is nothing more than a throwaway line. This bill is an empty promise. It reminds me of the election campaign launch in June 1987 when then Prime Minister Bob Hawke said that no child would be living in poverty in Australia by 1990. Hawke's promise was just a throwaway line, a gimmick. Unfortunately, there are still Australian children living in poverty to remind us of this every day. The Rudd Labor government's so called ‘education revolution' has similarly amounted to little more than a throwaway line, a fake promise doing nothing to relieve Australians of the real cost of education. I would like to leave you with the words of a very alarmed Paterson constituent. Steven Loft's views echo my concern and the concerns of the coalition and represent the views of many Australians. Mr Loft recently wrote to the Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. He said: Dear Prime Minister, There is nothing more important than the education of our children. It's time to invest more in our public schools to ensure every child gets the best education. More funding would make a real difference. The money should be spent on the things schools and students really need: smaller class sizes, individual attention for students who need it and modern buildings and facilities. Yours Sincerely, Steven Lofts Mr Loft's views reinforce the fact that the Rudd Labor government are not taking their responsibility in government seriously enough and that they are abusing their power and the trust and livelihood of the Australian public. These tax offsets need to cover a wider scope of rebates to ensure more choice for Australian punters. The Rudd Labor government need to inject more money into the education system as a whole to ensure a more realistic, prosperous and efficient future for Australian education.",21
8,Ms MCKEW,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (12.20 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008, because the Rudd Labor government is committed to supporting families and supporting Australians of all ages to get a quality education. This bill provides financial assistance for families with primary and secondary schoolchildren to offset the costs of their children's education. The government has allocated $4.4 billion to deliver this promise for Australian families through the new education tax refund. As opposed to the fantasies and insults we have just heard from the member for Paterson, the Rudd government is committed to an education revolution. First of all, you have to imagine the future. Then you map the future and fund the future, and indeed that is what we are doing with our education revolution. We believe that investing in education is crucial to driving productivity growth and to building a modern and prosperous economy. We believe that education has the potential to not only drive productivity but also empower individuals to help overcome dismore advantage. We are backing our beliefs and our pre-election commitment to the Australian people with funding to drive the education revolution on multiple levels, and this is what the member for Paterson in his previous comments simply ignored. Our entire focus, let me stress, is revolutionary because it starts with very young children. If we want to look for the areas of greatest neglect by education ministers during the Howard years, I suggest that this is where we need to shed a light-because one OECD survey after another has pointed to the shameful underperformance of Australia when it comes to investing in the early years of education. For instance, in 2006 Australia was ranked 25th out of 26 countries on the OECD indicator looking at the proportion of students enrolled in preprimary educationso much for the choices of the Howard years. There was also a complete failure by the previous government to invest in the professional training of those who care for very young children. The fact is that 40 per cent of those who care for our very young children have no qualifications whatsoever. That is where the education revolution is being focused: on investing in the qualifications of those who care for our very important young people. What an indictment this is when all of the scientific research points to the critical importance of an appropriate learning environment for very young children. The Rudd government has committed to ensuring that all Australian children have the best start in life, long before a child even arrives at school. We have an investment and a policy commitment to a $2.4 billion package over the next five years aimed at turning around the kinds of statistics revealed a couple of weeks ago by the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth in their Report card on the well-being of young Australians. The government is taking action, as I said, on a number of fronts. I would like to note just two of the initiatives that are being plemented as part of the education revolution in support of our youngest Australians. The first is the investment of $533 million-that is, half a billion dollars-over the next five years to ensure that by 2013 all Australian children have access to a quality, affordable early childhood learning program delivered by a university trained teacher in the year before formal schooling. We have given a commitment to recurrent funding after 2013 to the states and territories so that early childhood learning programs continue to be an expected and normal part of every child's educational experience. Again I would like to draw the attention of all members, and particularly the member for Paterson, to the that in many parts of Australia 20 per cent children do not get access to a preschool education. The children in his electorate of Paterson are undoubtedly going to benefit from the amount of funding that we are putting into preschool. In Indigenous communities the figures are far worse-something like 50 per cent of Indigenous children do not get access to school. COAG has signed off on $564 million of joint funding over six years, therefore, to address the needs of Indigenous dren in their early years. As part of this, children and family centres are to be established across Australia to deliver integrated services that offer early learning, child and family support programs. The government has high ambitions for our schools and for what they can deliver for all of our students. Our stated ambition is that all Australian school students acquire the knowledge and skills to participate effectively in society and employment in a globalised economy. We are working to meet this ambition by stating our clear expectations around several things-quality teaching, imstrong outcomes for students, improved student retention, importantly, and good parental engagement. It is a highly collaborative approach. The government has also taken unambiguous steps to support all of these ambitions. I refer to two practical examples of how the government has acted to support the education revolution in our schools. I point first of all to the $116 million in funding to nearly 900 secondary schools across Australia for the first rollout of new computers in schools. This is part of the $1.2 billion funding commitment for the digital education revolution. In my own electorate of Bennelong, the first rollout of computers in schools has seen fact computers delivered to Holy Cross College, of Marist College, Carlingford High School and Ryde Secondary College. These schools are very grateful for the improvement that that has made to their ICT departments. In addition, there is the allocation of $90 million of funding involving almost 100 secondary schools for the first phase of the trade training centres. Again, this is part of a much bigpre- ger commitment, a $2½ billion commitment. In my area, the electorate of Bennelong, this initiative is going to deliver hospitality trainchiling resources and a commercial kitchen at 35 the outstanding Epping Boys High School. They put in a terrific submission. This facility is going to used by not only students at care that school but also students attending neighbouring Carlingford High School and Cheltenham Girls High School. I come precisely to the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. This bill will expand on all of the initiatives-and they need to be seen as a wholethat support Australia's education system. This will help parents meet the everyday costs of their children's education. The third part of the government's education revolution is about our ambitions for working-age Australians. Our goal here is that everyone has the opportunity to develop the skills and qualifications needed to enable them to be effective participants in a modern economy. Again, on this issue I point to the actions already underway by the Rudd government. There is the $2 billion Productivity Places Program, which is already offering training places to over 53,000 job seekers in this financial year. Indeed, more than 12,000 people have already completed training courses, and last week the government announced an additional $187 million for this Productivity Places Program. It will translate overall to an extra 56,000 places. In all, the government will be offering training places to 700,000 people over the next five years. Further, the government has acted to bolster the investment available for Australia's training and academic institutions through the creation of an $11 billion Education Investment Fund. The key priorities of this fund will be capital expenditure and renewal and refurbishment in universities and in vocational institutions as well as in research facilities and major research institutions. As the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, said in the House a fortnight ago, she has invited 14 universities from around the country to bid for government funding worth nearly $700 million for strategic investment in capital and research facilities. I was delighted to see that Macquarie University, situated in the north-west of the electorinclude ate of Bennelong, has been invited to put forward a proposal in this round. I have taken the time today to describe the government's ambitions and multiple actions in enacting an education revolution. This bill forms one of a number of elements that the government are putting in place in support of the changes that we are driving across all sectors, starting with early education, going through to school education and then to the important area of training. It is a revolution that starts by giving our youngest children the best start in life. It aims to embed high expectation of our schools in preparing our young people to further their careers, and it encourages working-age Australians to engage in ongoing training. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 will play a key role in delivering up to $4.4 billion in financial support for schooling costs. Around 1.3 million Australian families will be eligible for this assistance, which is expected to support around 2.7 million primary and secondary school students. The refund is a tax offset for 50 per cent of eligible education expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary schooling. Under this initiative, eligible families will be able to claim 50 per cent of education expenses-up to $750 for each child undertaking primary school, giving parents a refund of up to $375 per year; and up to $1,500 for each child undertaking secondary school, providing parents with a refund of up to $750 per child per year. Thus a family with, say, one primary school student and one secondary school student-not an unusual combination-can receive up to $1,125 per year. The education tax refund bill sets out the expenses that are eligible for the refund and they include laptops, computers-and the associated costs of repairing and running them-as well as printers and paper. They home internet connections, education software, school textbooks and other materials, including study guides and stationery, and also prescribed trade tools. So there are a range of things that can be claimed by parents. The refund bill also sets out the characteristics of the families who are eligible to receive the financial assistance available under this bill. In defining family eligibility, the recognises there are a wide range of different family circumstances. Families that are eligible are in receipt of family tax benefit A and have children undertaking primary or secondary school studies. For those school students who enter or leave in any one school year, a claim of half the amount of the refund attributable to the half of the financial year that they attended school will be allowed. Parents can claim the refund against eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008 when they complete their 2008-09 income tax return. Parents who do not pay tax and are not required to complete a tax return will still benefit from the tax refund. Importantly, this financial assistance is available for eligible education expenses incurred from 1 July 2008. The bill is part of building a stronger and fairer Australia by funding parents with real support regardless of their location or the schools that their children attend. In my own area of Bennelong there are 44 primary, secondary and special schools-government, Catholic and independent. I know the parents of children at all of those schools and indeed across Australia will be able to make choices with regard to what they purchase to assist their children in achieving their educational goals. I know that families such as those in my electorate value education highly. They are going to welcome this substantial contribution to their children's educational expenses. In this country we need dedicated efforts to ensure that every child has the opportunity to fulfil his or her potential. The Rudd government's commitment to the education revolution is aimed at a more equitable distribution of resources for those in lowerand middle-income brackets, as it is without a doubt that by increasing the participation of young Australians in early learning environbill ments and providing financial assistance to struggling families we build a better society with skilled and productive members in the community. Earlier I mentioned the recently released Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth Report card on the well-being of young Australians. Against the measure of reported deprivation, ARACY noted that lack of educational resources is one way that poverty may be linked to poor educational achievement. In comparison to OECD countries, Australia ranked only 10th in a ranking of 30 countries on this measure. Indigenous Australia ranked a dismal 29th in a ranking of 31. These are awful figures, but I also noted one other-that is, in 2006, the ARACY report said, seven per cent of children reported having fewer than 11 books in their home. This bill, a very practical measure, offers families financial assistance by reducing the effective cost to families of practical educational resources. To sum up, this education tax refund bill is a concrete, practical example of how the Rudd government's education revolution is an agenda based on actions and not just on words. It demonstrates the renewed valuing of and commitment to education, to Australia's students and educators and to parents as the first educators of the future generations. Those who diminish this notion simply do not understand or have not bothered to inform themselves of the very wide range of policies that the Rudd government is committed to. As I have said on many occasions before, I want to see the kind of early learning and educational system that will ensure that every Australian child can reach for the stars. It will certainly be a revolutionary act when we eliminate the current long tail of educational underachievement and when Australia meets the Prime Minister's goal of lifting school retention rates from an abysmal 75 per cent to something like 90 or 95 per cent by 2020. Equally, we will know that the barricades have been breached when every Indigenous child in the Northern Territory and in remote areas of Western Australia and Queensland graduates from school and has exactly the same set of opportunities and choices as the school graduates who live in my electorate in suburbs like Denistone, Eastwood and Epping. If we do that, the report cards on Australia's future will be looking a lot more optimistic than the one that was released just a few weeks ago. I commend the bill to the House.",25
9,Mr RANDALL,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 today. As we know, this bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses, which are extremely limited. I will go into those details further in this speech. The proposed offset is for expenses totalling a maximum of $750 per primary school student, meaning a $375 offset, and $1,500 worth of expenses per secondary student for a $750 or 50 per cent offset. This bill could be a lot better for and more beneficial to Australian families and Australia's 3.4 million enrolled students. There are over 22,000 students in Canning, made up of 15,215 primary school students and 7,250 secondary school students. It is interesting to note that the government's description of all eligible items is not at all comprehensive, and this is where this bill falls short. The eligible items are limited to computers, home internet connections, computer software and textbooks associated with computers. It is nowhere near wide enough for the families of today. As we know, it is not good enough for the much generated focus group of the Labor Party, using the slogan ‘working family', either. Under the bill, eligible families will be those receiving family tax benefit A, those who receive other payments-which means those not receiving family tax benefit A-and those independent students who receive youth allowance, disability support pension or Abstudy living allowance. This bill emanates from the Labor Party's election promise which was in this year's budget. Labor's education revolution continues to be lacklustre, all spin and no substance. Members might recall seeing the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the election standing there with a computer saying, ‘This is the toolbox of the future.' A senior journalist from Perth who happened to be there when the Prime Minister, then opposition leader, was saying that said to me he thought it was one of the biggest spin-over stunts that he had seen in any pre-election campaign. The follow-up has not happened. We have got computers, but I will come to the detail of why this is more spin than substance later. While the coalition support a tax offset for education, those working families that Labor vowed to look after are exactly the people that this bill could have been better for. The coalition strongly support helping parents a lot and caregivers with the cost of educationand we are non-exclusive. All parents-and I emphasise all parents-have a right to choose how best to educate their children. The coalition's Helping Families to Provide More Educational Opportunities for their Children policy was intended to make the offset of up to $800 for secondary school students and $400 for primary school and preschool students available to all families. The coalition, recognising the breadth of learning and the needs of individual students, included in this policy a broad range of eligible items, again reflecting the choice of parents and the cost of education. The coalition included as eligible items school fees both government and non-government schools, as well as uniforms, books, stationery, school excursions and camps, laptops and broadband software and extracurricular activities such as music, dance and sport. In other words, the coalition covered all of the expenses, whereas Labor continues on this one-way digital street. It is so narrowly defined. As some have mused, what happens when they all end up with their computers? Does that mean that they cannot claim eligible expenses? Are there no other eligible expenses under this policy that the Labor Party has now proffered? Canning Vale High School, which was one of the most modern new secondary schools in Western Australia even before this policy came in, has huge banks of computers for students. Not every student is going to be working at a laptop or computer monitor day in, day out the whole time they are at school. To share them is a far better use of such items and is a far better bang for the buck to those paying for them. We are now seeing the Labor Party drift away from the suggestion that everyone will end up with a computer to saying that it could be one between two students. The Labor Party did say before the election that all students would get one, but it has gradually been diluted to one for two. There is more to come. We do know that education is not cheap, but it is certainly imperative. Many parents struggle to pay fees, pay for books and provide internet access for their children. The coalition recognise that families need help with fees no matter where their children attend school, and that is why it was included in our policy. However, it is not reflected here. Research shows that the basic cost of raising one child to the age of 18 now exceeds $200,000. The Australian Scholarship Group estimates the cost of schooling, depending on the choice of government, indefor pendent or private schooling, as follows: the cost of preschool is between $2,662 and $6,952, reflecting parents' choices; the cost of primary school is between $5,317 and $12,561, again reflecting the range of choices; and the cost of secondary school is between $5,618 and $21,112, again giving a range of choice. As I have mentioned, the cost of schooling is astonishing, and any help is a big help. As we know, many parents either end up with a second job or take out substantial loans to put their children through school. Without wishing to go into the bona fides of the Prime Minister's well-documented, old-fashioned, working-class upbringing, I would like to suggest that the Prime Minister consider giving back to those who gave him a leg up when he needed it. As a Queensland youngster Mr Rudd and his brother were fortunate enough to be offered the opportunity to attend and board at the elite Catholic boys Marist Brothers school, Marist College Ashgrove. Despite its extensive waiting list, the exclusive school made room for the future Prime Minister and the Marist Brothers themselves covered the fees. Mr Rudd then completed his secondary education at Nambour State High School, coincidentally also the school the Treasurer, the member for Lilley, attended. Mr Rudd has reached the highest office this nation can offer. Without doubt, he is extremely well educated. With Mr Rudd's family's highly publicised affluence, he could afford to provide an annual scholarship to both the Marist Brothers college and Nambour high school. He received a fine education from both institutions and should consider giving back to the public and private schools that gave him his start. I am sure that those schools would welcome such an offer and would be delighted with such a showing of gratitude by the Prime Minister now. Returning to the cost of education, those figures I gave you do not take into account the cost of extracurricular activities. Whether they be ballet classes, junior football or cricket, piano lessons or any other activities, they are a huge additional financial burden on parents-parents of any demographic who want to offer every opportunity to their children. Extracurricular activities are a big cost, and they hit low-income-earning families particularly hard. A Brotherhood of St Laurence survey found that 69 per cent of parents surveyed had trouble paying for sport and other activities. Disturbingly, I must point out, 39 per cent of parents said their children had been absent from school because they could not afford the excursion, the camp or the transport. As a former schoolteacher I remember it was often very heartrending and embarrassing for the students or their parents when the students were asked, ‘So, why aren't you going on camp this year?' and they would say, ‘Oh, Mum doesn't want me to go,' or, ‘It's too cold,' or, good. ‘I don't like that part of the bush.' You knew it was just an excuse because they could not afford to go, and it was very sad. On many occasions schools out of their own fundraising and on their own initiative paid for many of these students to go on camp. They would lightly sidle up to the parent, quite often a single parent, and say, ‘Look, if you would like, we will find a way to actually get your child to the camp,' or get them onto the excursion et cetera which was part of their overall education. But it really should not be like that, because the tax offset that we are talking about would actually provide this greater choice for parents to redeem 50 per cent of those fees rather than the narrow focus on computers and computer equipment. And what about those students who need a little bit of extra help-in tuition, for example? This is not covered under Labor's offset either. We know that the Labor Party has now scrapped the vouchers that were available for literacy and numeracy et cetera, so parents will struggle. As a parent I know that children do need help in certain areas. If they are weak in maths, for example, it costs a fair bit of money to get in a private tutor to help. No matter how affluent you are, it would still help them if you had the opportunity to get help with some of those extra fees to help your children get through their courses. This is a government that advocates its early childhood education credentials, yet it is excluding the cost of that education from the offset. Here we have a $4.4 billion initiative that could have been better directed to benefit Australian families. Remember the working families? They are the ones who would not mind benefiting from this as well. So go back to your focus groups and find out if they are happy with this narrow focus on education fees. Everybody agrees that we need to put money in education, but it must be directed in a way that it will do the most The trumpeted ‘education revolution' has come apart at the seams. With the additional cost of implementing the computers-inschools program estimated at $3 billion, state Labor governments and the now non-Labor government in Western Australia are finding it pretty tough. For example, in Western Australia, every $1 of federal government funding costs the state an extra $3. It is all right to give schools computers, but where is the connection, where is the backup, where is the ongoing support? What about the repairs and maintenance of these computers? It is not there, and that is why the state governments and many of the state schools at which this initiative is targeted are bailing out: they just cannot afford it. The way the Labor Party has spruiked its laptops you would think that there were no computers at all in Australian schools. That is just not true. In fact, Australia was one of the world leaders in providing computers, third behind Lichtenstein and the United States, in a 2003 report showing there was one computer for every three students in the country. So that was happening without the Labor Party's much-vaunted education revolution, which is fizzing out to become less a revolution and more of a disturbance. Despite having to pay off Labor's $96 billion debt, the coalition provided record funding for schools. Between 1996 and 2007, investment in state schools doubled from $1.4 billion to $3.5 billion. So much for the criticism about the coalition's lack of investment: it in fact doubled in that period. Public schools enrol roughly 67 per cent of students yet receive 75 per cent of the funding, whereas non-government schools enrol roughly 33 per cent of students and receive only 25 per cent of funding, and it is the ents and the school communities who make up the shortfall. You hear this sort of thing often: ‘Look at that school over there; they've got all those nice ovals and they've got a bus.' Parents who choose nongovernment schools for their children-and it is a choice; it should always be a choice, even though the ideologically driven would probably argue against this-make up the difference in funding out of their own pockets. It has been estimated that this difference, in addition to the cost of fees and amenities for students entering non-government schools, is $4 billion per annum. While we are on the topic of education, let's not forget those opposite who have axed one of the coalition's most successful and valuable initiatives: the Investing in Our Schools Program. I defy any member of the government to tell me that not one school in Australia appreciated the funding from the Investing in Our Schools Program. In fact, I would like a dollar for every time the principals, teachers, parents or students came to me and said: ‘Look we could never have afforded that shadecloth over the playground for kids. We could never have afforded the computer hub in our school. We could never have afforded the freezer in the canteen that we had to pay for that we have finally got.' All of those extra things that the schools could never have afforded to do were provided through the Investing in Our Schools Program and it was axed. So much for investing in schools by the Labor Party. They are so narrowly focused that they are just taking this computer direction and excluding everything else that adds to a child's education in terms of amenities. More than 75 Canning schools will feel the pinch with the Labor government scrapping the Investing in Our Schools Program. This funding filled a hole for projects desperately needed by schools that never par- seemed to make it onto the state government funding priority list, as I said, like adding to so the libraries, carpeting and even air conditioning in remote and hot areas. Let us talk about not what they are doing in terms of the education revolution but what they have actually taken away. I conclude by saying we do need to give offsets and support to parents in terms of their school costs but not by just narrowly focusing on computers and the hardware that goes with them. They need to realise that an education is far broader and far more comprehensive than the narrow focus they have chosen on this occasion.",29
10,Mr DREYFUS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 introduces the education tax refund. This refund will provide Australian families with a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses up to a maximum of $750 per child in primary school and $1,500 per child at secondary school. This is a significant $4.4 billion boost for education in this country. It is part of the Rudd government's commitment to provide all Australian children with the opportunities afforded by a world-class education. It helps to take the pressure off working Australian families, particularly at this time of global economic crisis and increasing strains on family budgets. Who can receive this refund? It will be families in receipt of family tax benefit part A. It will be those who receive other payments that preclude them from receiving family tax benefit part A, and independent students who receive youth allowance, the DSP or Abstudy living allowance. Taken all together it will cover some 1.3 million families and 2.7 million children. It will be claimable when income tax returns are submitted from 1 July 2009, so it will come in next year. There is a long list of expenses that will be eligible for this education tax refund including computers and computer related equipment, such as printers, disability aids and associated costs. It will cover home internet connection, computer software, school textbooks and other paper based school learning materials including stationery. It will cover course prescribed tools of trade. It does not cover school fees or school uniforms. The aim of this government is to create an outstanding world-class education system so that every single Australian child will have the best job opportunities and the best life opportunities in future. As I say often when I go to schools: the gift of an education is, apart from the love that we can give our children, the best possible gift that we can give to set children up for their future lives. It is the giving of that gift of education that the reason why the Rudd government is committed to implementing an education revolution. The features include a universal preschool entitlement of 15 hours per week for all four-year-olds, a national curriculum board to develop a national curriculum in the areas of English, mathematics, science and history by 2011 and $1.2 billion for a digital education revolution-meaning a school computer for every student in years 9 to 12 supported by digital content resources, professional development and broadband connections. There will be a $2.5 billion investment to build trades training centres in state, Catholic and independent schools to develop vital skills. There will be Future Fellowships to support Australia's top researchers, and the government is also investing in the teaching of Asian languages and studies to ensure that as a nation Australia is prepared for what is being called the Asia-Pacific century. This government's education revolution is about opportunity and it is about prosperity. It is about opportunities for all Australian children and it is about securing national prosperity in the future. It is not enough for the opposition to say that they believe in quality in education. It is not enough for the opposition to say that they believe in choice. It is not enough for them to say that they believe in providing all children with the best education possible-they have to back their words with actions. They failed during their time in government and they are still failing now. One wonders if the deputy opposition leader, who spoke earlier on this bill, has actually read the bill. She claimed: This bill refunds parents for only a limited amount of expenditure on information technology related goods. She further claimed in her speech in this House that the bill does not cover expenses for textbooks. This is simply false, which she is would know if she had made it to page 12 of the bill. It is typical of a lazy opposition front-bench and, in particular, it is typical of the intellectual laziness of the deputy opposition leader. The deputy opposition leader has decried the fact that this bill does not fund what she terms ‘extra tuition'. What the deputy opposition leader really means when she says this is that she wants to prioritise government spending on private tutors in Dalkeith, Nedlands and Peppermint Grove over the very real needs of the great bulk of Australian working families, who are doing it tough and trying to provide a decent education for their children. The deputy opposition leader also claimed: It is through values based reform measures that quality in education will be achieved. It is an interesting choice of words from the deputy opposition leader, assuming that she has not picked them up from somewhere else. If the opposition wants to turn this debate into one of values, that is a debate that I am more than happy to have. Underlying any government action to improve schooling in Australia must be principles of quality, equity and choice. These are values that Australian families understand to be important in providing the best future for their own children and for all Australian children. Equity in education is vital, and as a government we reject the notion that hundreds of thousands of Australian children can or should be left behind by the Commonwealth government. The coalition talk about choice, but they fail to understand that when you remove investment in public education you remove choice from the vast majority of parents who send their children to state schools. When a government undermines investment in public education, it removes the choices that parents are able to make, the choices that schools can make in the provision of services and the choices that children will have in the future. What values are the opposition promoting when they put up speaker after speaker on the cognate debate on the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 and the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 which we had earlier this year to argue against the most basic levels of accountability on the part of schools and institutions that receive enormous levels of funding from the Commonwealth government? The outrage expressed in the arguments that we heard from those opposite gave the game away. They do not believe, it would seem, that private institutions that receive billions of dollars in government funding should in any way be accountable to the Australian public for the expenditure of that money. I cannot go past the speech by the member for Sturt, who was outraged in a way that only he can be outraged that schools might be required to ‘publish information about all of their sources of funding'. Imagine that a private institution that is carrying out an important public purpose and that is reliant on public money might be required to assure the minister that the institution is financially viable! If you are looking for an example of the failure of those opposite-the failure of the Liberal Party and the Nationals-to understand accountability and good governance, you cannot go past the example that has cropped up in vivid colour in the last two or three weeks, that of ABC Learning Centres, of which the Rudd government is now trying to pick up the pieces. Under the former government, ABC Learning Centres were allowed to grow and grow to a dominant position in the childcare industryMrs Irwin interjecting",32
11,Mr DREYFUS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I was in fact going to mention Larry Anthony. It is now clear that many of its centres were running at a loss, but the Liberal and National Party approach to accountability of companies and organisations receiving large amounts of public funding is that accountability and disclosure are not necessary. Notions of good governance and accountability are foreign, it would seem, to those opposite. Perhaps it is that they did not want to hold to account one of their own, the former member for Richmond, the Hon. Larry Anthony. He lost his seat, and thereby his ministry, at the 2004 election-and I remind honourable members that he was the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. In that role he was responsible for the childcare industry in this country. He went virtually straight onto the board of ABC Learning Centres. That is revealed by the annual report, which I happen to have. At the annual general meeting in November 2005, Sallyanne Atkinson, the former Liberal Lord Mayor of Brisbane, who was the chairman of this company, had this to say about Larry Anthony joining the board. We were looking for another when Larry Anthony had a career change and I was absolutely delighted when he accepted my invitationMr Abbott-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Reluctant though I am to interrupt the member speaking, the fact is that what he is saying now appears to have nothing to do with the bill in hand, and I suggest that you draw him back to the legislation before the House.",34
12,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Warringah for his point of order and I will ask the member for Isaacs to come to the bill before the House, but I do point out that the bill is on education and that many other speakers have been fairly broad-ranging on the topic of education.",35
13,Mr DREYFUS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Indeed they have, and many other speakers have spoken on this subject of accountability, which lies at the core of the Rudd government's approach not only to education but to funding generally with public funds of private institutions. This company, ABC Learning Centres, and Larry Anthony's role in it, provides no better exampleMr Abbott-On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker, members opposite can start defending Bob Carr and the Macquarie Bank and the",35
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,The member for Warringah is now abusing the point of order. Mr Abbott-He is abusing the standing orders by speaking as he has.,35
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The member for Isaacs will address the bill before the House, which I again state is on education and I think there has been a fairly broadranging discussion.",35
16,Mr DREYFUS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Sallyanne Atkinson, the former Liberal Lord Mayor of Brisbane, said: Apart from his personal skills (and his considerable charm) he has a Bachelor of Commerce degree, a background in banking, and some experience in our industry as Federal Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.",35
17,Mr ABBOTT,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,I move: That the member be no longer heard. Question negatived.,35
18,Mr DREYFUS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"This is an excellent example of the failure of the Liberal and National parties to understand what accountability in education is about. It is an excellent example because this was one of their own: the former National Party minister responsible for this industry who, on leaving this parliament, virtually went straight onto the board of the largest childcare provider in this country, supposedly as an independent director, which he was not. (Quorum formed) This example of Larry Anthony, supposedly an independent director of ABC Learning Centres, is the best possible example of those opposite's complete lack of understanding of accountability in education or indeed in public administration generally. This same Larry Anthony was described by the company in several annual reports as an independent, non-executive director, and those same annual reports record that in 2006 he received some $43,000 in fees and superannuation and in 2007 received some $65,000 in fees and superannuation",35
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,I will ask the member for Isaacs to refer to the bill before us. I would contend that perhaps the member for Isaacs is now straying from the bill and I would like him to bring his remarks back to the bill.,36
20,Mr DREYFUS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will move back to the bill by leaving on this point: the fact is of course Larry Anthony was not at all independent. As a consultant he received fees of $110,000 for the year ending 30 June 2006 and $125,000 for the year ending 30 June 2007.

22,Mr DREYFUS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I fear, given the tradition of those opposite, the Liberal Party and the National Party and their limited understanding of accountability, that we will not be seeing Larry Anthony taking any of the blame for the debacle of ABC Learning Centres, given the relationship between this mer minister responsible for child care and the company is just too cosy. Mr Abbott-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You have appropriately asked the member to bring his remarks back to the legislation. I do believe he is defying your ruling.",36
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,The member for Warringah will resume his seat. The member for Isaacs has the call.,36
24,Mr DREYFUS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"We hope that when those opposite stand again to speak about accountability and why it is that there should not be accountability by private institutions operating in the education sector-be that in early childhood, in primary, in secondary or, indeed, in tertiary education-they will bear in mind the kind of debacle that has occurred in ABC Learning Centres involving one of their own, where the lack of accountability and the lack of transparency can really be that said to have brought this about. This cosy relationship was so cosy that Eddie Groves of ABC Learning Centres gave $50,000 to the National Party in 2007 in the run-up to the last election. The idea of accountability, which those opposite have spoken about regularly in education bills throughout this year, is a notion that they do not understand. The government does. We are looking for accountability when public funds are expended. This bill is a key part of the education revolution that the Rudd government has embarked on. I commend the bill to the House.",36
25,Mr SIMPKINS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"As a father of two children at a local state primary school in Cowan, I share the interests of my fellow parents in all matters educational. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is a very important for- means by which parents in Cowan will be able to claim a tax offset. So I am pleased to speak on this bill, but I am also very keen to state how it could be much better. The bill is known colloquially as the ETR, or education tax refund, bill and it essentially provides a refund of $375 for a primary school aged child after $750 is spent and $750 for a secondary school student after $1,500 is spent. This will allow parents and caregivers to seek refunds for expenses to do with computers, a home internet connection, software, textbooks and stationery. This brings me to the alternative proposal, which was the coalition's plan which we took to the election. In our plan, the rebate could include preschool education expenses, school fees, school uniforms, extracurricular school activities and tutoring. I would encourage the government to look at extending the list of expenses for which this rebate can be claimed-that is, if they really want to focus on improving educational outcomes. The point I would make is that there are schools around this country where the children would prefer to fit in by having a uniform on as a priority before they start selecting software. There are children that would like to do the incursions, let alone the excursions, before having a printer at home. That is the trouble with this bill and the government's policy: the almost myopic focus on computer hardware, software and peripherals has meant that they do not understand one of the basic requirements in a young person's or child's life-the need to fit in. I think that it is a very bad thing for a child to miss out on the opportunities that their classmates are being given, because they are then reminded of the challenges of their socio-economic position or other issues in their lives. To that end, I advocate that government look at the matter of individual inclusion and widen the criteria for the items that can be claimed under this bill. I am sure that all the government speakers will talk up this bill and the comprehensive benefits that it will provide, but my view is that the benefits are neither comprehensive nor targeted towards the reality of the need. I again urge the government and the government members to think carefully about the best way to assist parents and their children to ensure they fit in and are therefore comfortable enough to pursue the opportunities that education offers. If you do not make sure children, particularly those from more challenging socio-economic backgrounds, are supported with a school uniform like everyone else's and the opportunity to participate in all school activities like everyone else, then you risk these children feeling isolated. They may become disruptive, bringing themselves down and those around them. Of course, by expanding the criteria for claims, you do not guarantee that parents will spend the money on uniforms, school activities or other expenses, but you make it a bit easier for them to come to that decision to act now and claim it back later. As a father I want my children to have the same opportunities as their peers. I do not want my children to miss out and feel bad. I know that a majority of parents think the same way. For those who do, change in the criteria in this bill would be of benefit to the parents but, most importantly, to their children. Children do not wish to be different from other children, and I believe that assisting children to fit in is the best way to start. I draw upon my experiences with my own children and my significant experience in coaching teenagers in sport to refine my views of what is important to young people, but I also have very up-to-date information the on this matter. I recently assisted the senior class of Waddington Primary School in Koondoola by paying for one of them to go to the school camp. Koondoola is a suburb challenged by lower than average socio-economic standing and I know that many of the parents struggled to find the $170 for the camp. If they knew they could get the money back, maybe that would make a bit of a difference. Widened criteria would mean that all the children could have the nice graduation polo shirt uniform or in fact the regular school uniform. This is not to say that Waddington Primary School is not a proud school. I do like what they do. I like the commitment of teachers like James Cunningham, a man dedicated to ensuring the children in his class have the best opportunities. He is a fine example to the children and a role model to them. James actually brought his class up to my office and we all had morning tea. I was very pleased to have welcomed them to the office. I look forward to providing every assistance that I can in the future to the school. I would also mention that the principal of Waddington is Leanne Alderman, and she has continued the great work of previous principals of the school Stephen Blechynden and Peter Mulcahy. I would next like to turn my attention to the Hawker Park Primary School in the suburb of Warwick, in the south-west of Cowan. The school has a strong community feel to it and an outstanding reputation. When I mention the school to other principals I always get the comment that Hawker Park is held in high regard. A school's reputation is often developed over a long period, and it is a credit to committed staff and parents that although the school is just 25 years old it has been such a great success and holds such a positive position in the community. At the helm of this great little school is Dr Irma Roberts, the principal. The acting deputy is year 1 teacher Felicity Randell, but Tom Kelly, normally the deputy, is on long service leave and has served for many years as the deputy principal. Tom is the lead organiser behind the sports carnivals and serves the school very well. It is also appropriate for me to mention that six teachers have 17 or more years service at Hawker Park. In fact, for 25 years Tony Bourne has been teaching the year 7 class and is now teaching the children of his former students. Tony has been a great and positive influence on every graduating class over those 25 years. The other long-serving staff include Julia Hill, with 18 years service; Lois Watt, 19 years; Pamela Barnes, 19 years; Lori Chatman, 18 years; and Liz Everall, 17 years. It says something about a school when the teachers want to stay and contribute over such a long period. I thank them for their efforts, their dedication and overall commitment to quality education. The P&C has been working very well and effectively for many years, undertaking fundraising activities and supporting the school. Although there are many outstanding volunteers that have been there for years, I will just mention the president, Margaret Brocx, and long-time school volunteers Vicki Mattock and Chris Henry, who have been integral to the success of the school community over many years. I would also mention Belinda Mackay, who again did many years of dedicated work with the P&C. Finally I will mention Beth Worsdell, who runs the canteen. Beth has been in the position for many years and the canteen serves the school very well. Again, widened criteria for the education tax refund would benefit Hawker Park. Voluntary school fees should be included under this bill. This would encourage more parents to contribute, which would then result in an increase in funds available to the school to use for educational outcomes. I also want to speak about another school in Cowan, which I have had a long-term association with. In 2005 I went to see Peter Smith, the then principal of South Ballajura Primary School. South Ballajura is in the north-east of Perth and it gets particularly hot in summer. The school has demountable classrooms that are air-conditioned, but in 2005 the remainder of the school was not. I offered Peter the option of me writing the Investing in Our Schools Program application for him, and Peter told me that he did not have the time to get everything done, so I agreed to get the quotes and put together the application. This was done and the grant was received. The result was that evaporative cooling was installed in South Ballajura Primary School. I certainly found it was an easy case to make, the case for air conditioning. There is little doubt that children are able to make the most of school when they are in a cooler environment and can therefore better maintain their levels of concentration. South Ballajura Primary School is an example of the coalition government's commitment to education, and the facts cannot be brushed away, like the current government likes to do so often. But I think it is important to talk about South Ballajura in 2008. There are more than 600 students at the school, representing 30 nationalities. In the languages other than English program they learn Indonesian, which adds to the rich diversity that they derive from the different cultures represented by the students. A couple of weeks ago I went and spoke to a year 5 and 6 group of students about a stronger and better community. While I was there, Miss Jade Green asked me a number of questions that demonstrated to me that she cares about being a good citizen in Australia. I would say that the children were very well mannered and they are therefore a credit to their teachers, the principal, Lynda Moir. I have the highest regard for Lynda and her outstanding registrar, Betty Vlahov, who has been at the school since it opened in 1994, and the dedicated school staff, yet the support of parents and volunteers remains critical to the success of the school. To properly acknowledge the work of the P&C, I will mention, with my thanks for their efforts, president Annie Whitehurst, vicepresident Rachel Whitworth, Jane Green, Julie Cruden, Naomi Brown, Tracey Jones, Judith Hill, Charmaine Robertson and Karen Markham-to name just a few of the current members. I also mention the good work of previous executive members of the P&C Caroline Bennetts and Mrs Lisa Raats. Given this bill is about supporting parents, I would note just one of the many examples where the South Ballajura P&C have supported the children. This year the P&C funded 15 flexible pianos for the music room. This ensures a better and more enjoyable music experience for the children. I have great pleasure in acknowledging South Ballajura primary's staff and parent volunteers for the excellent work they do for education in our community under what are, at times, challenging circumstances. It is for that reason that I also believe widened criteria for the education tax refund would benefit South Ballajura Primary School. In these suburbs of challenged socio-economic circumstances, it is all the more important that children feel that they are fitting in. School uniforms, incursions and excursions are all key features of a child fitting in and therefore feeling that link to the educational process. Without such a link, children are at risk of feeling isolated or second best and therefore may avoid school, undermining their futures. Again, if the government included voluntary school fees, extracurricular activities and uniforms under this and to bill, it would encourage more parents to make these outlays and make the children feel part of the school and better linked to education and its great value. However, South Ballajura Primary School is just one part of the South Ballajura story. It would be wrong of me not to mention principal Cheryl Lennox, registrar Lee-Anne Green and the truly dedicated teaching and support staff at the South Ballajura Education Support Centre. The ESC exists to provide education for children with disabilities. Several Fridays ago I had a look around and was better able to appreciate the challenges, the conditions and the achievements of the ESC and its students. I am informed that there are children with disabilities integrated throughout the primary school as well as classes specifically for ESC students only. This policy is good for all the students. It would be good to see widened expense criteria added to this bill in support of the parents of the ESC. These parents already struggle with the costs of transport and the other tional costs for their disabled children. Extra help and tax deductibility should be included for these parents. Before I conclude, I will make mention of Woodvale Senior High School. Woodvale senior high opened in 1985 and has almost 1,600 students. Paul Leech is the principal and he is a great advocate for this excellent school. I know that parents at Woodvale would also appreciate a widening of the criteria to which the education tax refund applies. I make mention of the benefits that could apply to parents of Woodvale students because of the outstanding specialist programs offered. These include the academic extension program, the music program, basketball, soccer, science enrichment and forensics. The great success and high standing of the school mean that there are long waiting lists for entry for those who live outside the local intake area or who are unsuccessful in gaining entry to a specialist program. Widened criteria could result in, for instance, parents claiming a rebate for a musical instrument so that their son or daughter could fully participate in the highly regarded Woodvale music program in which more than 300 students currently participate. I should also mention that Woodvale senior high's students perform very well academically, being in the top 25 per cent of students in the state. State, national and international testing reinforces the high quality of academic success the school enjoys. The parents and school community have been fully involved in this success, and I will rightly acknowledge the parts played by the P&C president, Virginia MCNamara, as well as Dee Briggs and Fab Zannutigh, for all the hard work they do for the school and the students. Although there are around 130 staff, I will also acknowledge the work they do in making Woodvale senior high a success academically and the help they provide for addi- young people through the specialist programs, the extra tuition classes on offer, programs to support student development and strong cross-curricular links with students working on specialist areas. I know Phil Mullane does an excellent job with the music program, which has resulted in the school's concert band especially being highly sought after to support local community events. I will also mention some other staff that I know do a great job at Woodvale, including Steve Jurilj, who is renowned for his great coordination of the student services staff; Sue Festa, whose can-do and positive attitude plays a crucial role in running school administration; and, of course, Carol Stokes, the chaplain, for all her work in pastoral care. Although I have named a number of strengths of Woodvale senior highprograms and individuals-I particularly want to mention three more areas that have also impressed me. They include the digital media capabilities and professional-level software supported by the campus-wide information technology network. I have seen the work of the students with digital media, and the level of imagination and creativity is a credit to the teachers. I also have been impressed with the manual trade skills that students can learn at Woodvale. Finally, I would make mention of the ongoing cultural exchange program with Japan which continues to work well in building strong connections with Asia. I understand a sister-school relationship also exists with a school in Jinan in China. Further evidence of Woodvale's highquality education programs is provided by reference to its accreditation to enrol internathings tional fee-paying students. Today I have made reference to the many reasons why Woodvale is one of the best schools in Cowan. They are all valid reasons, yet what continually bears out its outstanding reputation is the number of parents whom I have spoken to from out of the intake area who want their child to attend Woodvale. Woodvale Senior High School achieves across a wide range of areas. They provide academic, artistic and vocational options for young people, and I am sure their success will carry on into the future. Before concluding my contribution, I will mention of one more school, the Wanneroo Primary School. The principal is Penny Halleen and the school has around 530 students. The language other than English taught at Wanneroo is Italian, which is a departure from almost all other schools in Cowan yet reflects the history of the Wanneroo district. Of course, that is not all that the school does well. I know they focus strongly on literacy and numeracy and I know they emphasise the school values of respect, tolerance, self-discipline, cooperation, courtesy and confidence. In closing, I reiterate the points that I made before about the shortcomings of this bill and the policy behind it. If the government is looking for another dot point in attempting to propagate just the term ‘education revolution' then the almost exclusively narrow focus on information technology probably delivers that dot point. However, if the government believes in supplying real support and choice for parents that will benefit the children, it should look at school and preschool fees, uniforms, stationery, calculators, camps, excursions and extracurricular school activities as well as what is already part of this bill. It should add those things into the bill and achieve the basics. These really do matter for some of the children out there from families that would really benefit from such an amendment. I urge the government to do this for the families and children of Cowan and the rest of Australia.",36
26,Mr RIPOLL,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is a great pleasure to be speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 because I think it is one of those great bills that come before the House that come from the bottom up. It is something that really has come from the people, it is something that they have wanted for a very long time and it is something that they have deserved for a very long time-some would say for more than a decade, and I would agree with them. It is finally being delivered here in this House under a Rudd Labor government. It is has been interesting-and, I have to say, very informative-to listen to coalition speakers on this bill. While not too many of them volunteered to speak on something which I would have thought would have been key and instrumental in their electorates, it certainly has been informative. It appears to me that they only really have two arguments in relation to this bill. One is that it is just not quite ‘wide enough', which seems to be the term they are using, and that we should include a few extra bits to hang off the bill. The other one is just the sheer disinformation or, I hazard to go a little bit further, perhaps mistruths that have been provided about what is contained in the bill. I will try to shed some light for listeners on just what this bill is about and how much benefit it will have for parents right across the country-in every single electorate and in every single school. That should be something that the Liberal and National parties take note of. It is something which is at the core of what Labor does in terms of education policy. I can remember vividly over many election campaigns dating back quite some years a comment made to me by many parents. It was made by parents when I was out campaigning, door-knocking, on election day itself, just talking to my branch members or anywhere else-the old barbecue-stopper type conversations that you have. I recall they always said that there was one thing that would guarantee anybody a win when trying to get into government. There are always lots of different views about what will guarantee you a win and there is lots of debate about it. But one thing that always sticks in my mind is that people would say to me: ‘If only the government could see its way clear to providing some sort of tax incentive or tax relief-some sort of offset-in terms of educational expenses for children.' It stuck with me because that comment came from parents regardless of where their children went to school. It did not matter whether they were going to a government school or a non-government school; it seemed to be the same issue. They were content with where their children were going to school. They were happy in broad terms about systems. There are always improvements that can be made in a range of things but, in terms of their family budget and what government could do to give them some relief, parents always said to me: ‘Look, you'd make a real difference to us and our budgets if you could see your way clear to providing some sort of tax relief for education expenses for our children.' I am pretty happy today to be speaking on this bill that actually delivers on a promise that we made during the election campaign and delivers, I think, very realistically in the budgets of ordinary, everyday working mums and dads and parents right across the country. It is a real pleasure. The Rudd government are committed to implementing an education revolution. It is something we have talked a lot about. More importantly, it is something we are doing a lot about and something that we are funding. It is something that we are more than just talking it; we are doing it and we are funding it. A key part of the education revolution is helping parents meet those everyday costs of their children's education. That is what this bill is about, and that is why the budget included $4.4 billion to create the new education tax refund. That new education tax refund is, quite simply, payable at the end of the new financial year. That will be next year, so parents need to be collecting their receipts now and working on making sure they have all the required receipts and documentation to make a proper claim in next year's tax returns. The education tax refund is a refundable tax offset. It is 50 per cent of eligible education expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary school studies. Again, I want to note that it does not matter which school you go to. This is about all schools in Australia, both primary and secondary. What it will do is help about 1.3 million families across the country. That equals roughly 2.7 million students who will be eligible for this particular refund. Under the plan, eligible families will be able to claim 50 per cent of all eligible education expenses up to $750 for each child undertaking primary school to provide a maximum tax offset of around $375 per child per year. For children attending secondary school studies, families will be able to claim 50 per cent of their eligible expenses up to $1,500 per child to give a maximum tax offset of $750 per child per year. That is a pretty good return and a pretty good offset. For the first time in Australia it provides parents with a real opportunity to offset all of their education expenses, not just the ones that are contained within this billand I will get to those in a minute-but all others as well. By enabling them to get an offset in the areas which are eligible, it frees up more of their money, more of their budget in the areas that they would have spent their money on, to spend in other areas for their children. So when we hear calls from coalition Liberal and National party members saying that it is just not wide enough, I think that they ought to have a second look and another think about just what this does. Quite simply, this puts cash back into the pockets of ordinary families, mums and dads, through the education tax rebate. On the area of what those rebates and eligible expenses will be for, typically they will be for laptops, home computers, printers, paper, education software, textbooks and associated materials, trade tools and a range of other interlinked materials in those areas. I think that is pretty wide. I think that the scope of this bill is wide enough that parents could quite legitimately have a look at their expenses in terms of their children's education and make a decent claim back in the next year's tax return. It goes further than those things that you might immediately see as necessary for a child's education: the laptop, the home computer, the printer, all the software included in helping provide for their education, paper and school textbooks. It goes just that little bit further, and ally goes all the way back home where a family establishes and maintains a home internet connection. That is also included so parents can claim that as well. So I did find it intriguing and a little bit informative when I heard Liberal and National party members standing up in here saying that the bill was not wide enough and talking about other areas that could have been included. I would challenge them to have a close look at the bill-and I suspect that many of them have not read it. While on the surface they might be providing some sort of cursory support, because obviously this is a very good idea for mums and dads out there trying to educate their children, they have not actually read the bill, they have not read the detail and, if they have, they have not understood just how wide and how comprehensive the bill is. Nor have they understood that it stretches right across those educational expenses for their children. In the case where there might be a particular expense which is not covered-and it is not 100 per cent coverage of all education expenses-but where they do have a tax offset, where they do save money, where they do get a return, the money that they have saved is money that they can spend on other areas of their children's education. This is a huge bonus for parents trying to educate their children. So I am very proud to be able to say that the Rudd Labor government is delivering on its promises in terms of an education revolution not just in words but in good policy, sound policy, and with money on the table. It does not stop there; there is more. While we want to do everything we can for parents at the coalface in terms of trying to return some cash to their pockets at the end of the financial year with this rebate, we have not it actustopped there. We want to ensure that a child's education is catered for properly at the school level as well as at home. In the federal budget in May we announced measures that total more than $19 billion of new education funding-$19 billion! As I have said many times now, I am very proud to talk on these issues. We not only made an election commitment; we kept that election commitment, and we will continue to keep our election commitments and then we will fund them as well-something a little bit novel perhaps for people who are used to the past decade of policy delivery. I will give a few examples. We have allocated $1.2 billion for the digital education revolution which will see all years 9 to 12 students have access to a school computer. Already there has been more than $116 million handed over to the states and territories and non-government school authorities to purchase more than 116,000 computers. There has been $2.5 billion set aside for trade training centres in secondary schools, and the government announced in July that 34 projects worth more than $90 million and involving almost 100 secondary schools had successfully applied for round 1. I have got a really great story in my own electorate about how significant this funding is and just how far it has gone to create some new initiatives within schools. For the first time we are seeing out of this funding program a desire from government and nongovernment schools to talk together about ways they can pool those funds for trade training centres to deliver a better outcome for their students. In recent weeks I have met with five schools in my electorate, both government and non-government schools. They had got together and had a talk about how they could pool the resources that were being offered by the Australian government and whether they could build a trade training centre that would service all of their schools in that region. Obviously it is a fantastic idea. It is a great idea to be able to say that for the first time we have got a funding program through which schools can collaborate, not in the traditional way you might think a couple of non-government schools might work together or a couple of government schools might work together, but the sector coming together on the basis of providing better education for their students. Some of the conversations I had with those school principals, I have got to say, were completely amazing and have absolutely left for dead the archaic debates of the past about government schools versus nongovernment schools. I could see for the first time that schools of whatever denomination wanted to work together. They were encouraged by the fact that the Australian federal government had encouraged them to work together through funding and they had a unique opportunity. It is an innovative way for schools to get together to pool their money and spend large amounts to achieve a better outcome for their kids. The sorts of comments that I got from the school principals were: ‘Wouldn't it be great if our students could mix with students from other schools, government and non-government? Wouldn't it be great if they could appreciate the different circumstances that people experience, if they could learn from each other? Wouldn't it be great if teachers that may have only one educational experience could learn from another teacher having a different educational experience? And perhaps students could do the same thing.' All the principals saw a great new advantage and ability for their students to grow and prosper out of this funding. So while it is a lot of money in total and represents quite a large sum, by the time you divide it, it is still a small amount of money for each schoolbetween $500,000 and $1.5 million. But what it has meant for those schools is that if four or five different schools can pool that money they can build a first-class, first-rate facility where all of their students will get something much more than they had anticipated in the first place. There is also a new $11 billion Education Investment Fund. That is going to help to renew our universities and vocational education institutions. There has been a great lack of spending and maintenance over a long period of time which has resulted in some of our higher education institutions actually falling into disrepair in some areas or not being able to cope with demand. We are facing a global crisis in financial terms and the impact of that will no doubt be felt right around the world. There will be some job losses and Australia will not be immune to that. People will be looking to re-educate themselves, to retrain. Young people have been coming into what has been a very strong jobs market and have automatically slipped into a job, almost commanding whatever salary they want. They will now probably have to think a little bit more about either extending their studies, getting into university, going to TAFE and doing a trade or perhaps looking for those skills that they may not have needed in previous years. So universities, vocational educational training institutions and TAFE colleges all need our support to make sure that we can cater for the long term, for the future of young people and people that need training. We have also extended our investment through to a $530 million fund to help deliver universal access to early childhood education in the year before formal schooling. We believe that it is important to provide money not only during the school years but also in that pre-educational year, that year before formal schooling, and also after school when students go on to training, whether it is at university or elsewhere. The Rudd Labor government is very committed through its policies in a range of key areas. There are three new national partnerships which I think are critical to all of this and to how it comes together between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The first is raising the quality of teaching in our schools-again, in all of our schools. There should no longer be this debate about government and nongovernment. This is about raising the standard, raising the bar. In the end they are all our children and they should all have an equal opportunity to work hard, study hard and get a good job and further education if that is what they want. We also want to help improve the results in disadvantaged school communities. You do not want to leave anyone behind-those most disadvantaged regional and rural areas where they struggle to get good teachers or where they struggle to get any teachers at all, areas where they just do not have the facilities regardless of the type of school. We need as a government to invest in those schools and in those areas. We also need a new partnership in improving literacy and numeracy. At the core of everything we do there is an absolute critical need that we deliver on children's ability to read, write and understand numbers. With that core they can achieve anything they want to achieve. But without those core skills they will struggle. I do not need to go into statistics for people to understand that. I think it is well understood by everybody that the very basis of our education system and opportunity is the ability to read and write and to understand numbers. I am proud to stand here to talk about a very important bill which delivers on the promises that Labor made during the campaign and continue to fund and maintain while in office. I commend the bill to the House.",41
27,Mrs MOYLAN,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to rise in this House to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. The bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce the education tax refund or the ETR, as it is commonly known. The ETR will provide a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses up to a maximum of $750 for children undertaking primary education study and $1,500 for children undertaking secondary education studies. Education is the key, as the member for Oxley said, to many things. It is certainly key to improving the quality of life for all people. Education enhances a person's fulfilment in work, personal relations, social development and the pursuit of interests outside the workplace. Education has a profound impact on all aspects of a person's life and on social cohesion within our communities. It is always very good to see in this place the many schools that come to visit. These kinds of bills have a great impact on those schools and those students-and there are many in the gallery today. The fact that education is so profoundly important is why whenever we ask people in the electorate of Pearce to tell us what their main priorities are, the availability and quality of education always feature very prominently. They are always up there in the top three issues nominated as priority issues for the federal government. Any increase in funding to assist parents to ensure the best possible education for their children is very welcome. In the lead-up to the last election-almost 12 months ago-the Prime Minister and his government promised an education revolution in Australia. However, every policy they have come up with in the last 11 months is defined by what it lacks rather than by what it offers, so it is little wonder that even government's own backbenchers are becoming frustrated at the lack of real action to deliver that promise. I am sorry to see that the member for Fowler has departed the chamber because speaking on this bill in the last sitting the member for Fowler let her frustration spill over when making the telling comment that while these measures ‘are welcome ... they are hardly a revolution'. Later in that speech she said: It is not hard to see why there is some confusion about the so-called education revolution. the One only has to wonder about the adequacy of the government's response when their own members are questioning it. The revolution involves the government going round and round in circles without actually delivering the outcomes that families should rightly expect given the promises made prior to the election. First the Prime Minister promised each high school student between grades 9 and 12 access to a computer at school. The reality is that some schools now have to borrow money-in some cases up to $100,000-to bridge the gap between what it actually costs to run programs and the underfunded promises of the government. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is yet another example of the Prime Minister and this government falling short of what they have promised Australian families. The announcement of the education tax refund comes in the wake of reports over several years that highlight the difficulties many parents experience in meeting a variety of schooling costs. This is particularly so for low-income families and, while this money will be welcomed by parents, the difference between the Rudd government's policy and the coalition's policy is quite stark. The coalition policy in 2007 was the comprehensive in its delivery and administration of new refundable tax rebates to provide additional assistance to parents for school costs. Further, it was flexible in letting parents decide to what aspects the additional education expenses rebate would be applied. Conversely, the government's ETR policy falls short of what is really neededand falling short in this legislation on education is characteristic of much of what the Rudd government is doing in other areas. To date there have been plenty of talkfests, reviews, inquiries and roundtables-all code for stalling and doing little of consequence. It is the oldest trick in the book. But to main credible any government must very soon start making the hard decisions, implementing real legislation and delivering real policy outcomes for those that they are elected to serve. When I first came into this place I observed the amounts of reports, inquiries and reviews which lined the walls of this place and which were not acted on. The public were not fooled: they were well aware that much was talked about but that there was little observable action on those issues which addressed their priorities and the quality of life expectations. On reflection, most of us would agree that was, in part, one of the reasons we saw the demise of the HawkeKeating Labor government. In the specifics of this bill, eligible expenses for the ETR focus mainly on information, communications and technology. I agree that all young people need to be able to use modern communication technology. We have seen a great example of this today with the launch of the Australian Diabetes Map by Diabetes Australia, aided by Microsoft and by Associate Professor Jonathan Shaw from the Baker IDI. This is a great use of technology and all young people should know how to make the most of it. The Rudd government did make this core promise without thinking through the whole policy. They need to complete the funding of that program by giving money to parents and then placing strict boundaries around what parents can apply the money to. Thus, they rather sneakily roll out their computer for every student program-clever but disingenuous. In truth, parents are missing out on being able to spend that money in the way that best suits the educational needs of their children. One of the significant exclusions of what the money can be spent on is school based extracurricular activities. I think that everyone, regardless of what side of politics they re- sit on, would agree on the importance of regular physical activity to children's growth and development. However, the high cost of organised sport often serves as a barrier to participation and social inclusion-an integral part of any child's education. As Chair of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, I have witnessed first hand the impact of the obesity epidemic and its relationship to the growing and debilitating effects of type 2 diabetes and the increasing number of children who have been diagnosed with this disease-a disease formerly seen only in the elderly. In fact, the Australian Diabetes Map that was launched in this place this morning shows that there are now 350 children diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. As I said, this was formerly a disease of the aged. We should be doing everything we can to encourage our young people to undertake some form of activity, some form of informal sport, to maintain good health. These activities are excluded from this tax rebate. The diabetes issue should be evidence enough for the government to allow the use of the rebate for school based extracurricular activities. The need for greater flexibility in the use of the rebate was further highlighted in a survey by the Brotherhood of St Laurence which found that 69 per cent of parents reported difficulty paying for sport and recreation and that 62 per cent of people reported difficulty in paying for school camps and 47 per cent for excursions; yet the government has chosen to ignore them in this bill. When you have up to 39 per cent of those surveyed admitting that their children have missed school because they cannot afford to pay the extra cost of excursions, sports days, school camps, uniforms and equipment, and when the government is being so rigid, you have to ask yourself whether we are really in an education revolution or whether this is just an education devolution. It is a challenge to maximise children's learning if they feel left out and excluded from extra activities. There are often ways to engage children's imagination and to inspire and motivate them to learn. Not all of these things take place in a classroom. Parents need all the help they can get to encourage their children to fully participate. In the words of the French novelist Anatole France, ‘Nine-tenths of education is encouragement.' As for the government's stated commitment to early childhood education, words are definitely much louder than action, because preschool education is not eligible for ETR. Some consideration might also have been given to families in situations of financial hardship who would struggle to meet the upfront costs and then have to wait until the next tax return before being able to claim. By contrast, the coalition's policy Helping Families to Provide More Education Opportunities for Their Children proposed to introduce a new refundable tax rebate of 40 per cent for education expenses-which included school fees-for every student from preschool until the end of secondary school. The coalition policy recognised that it was better to enable parents to choose the best education for their children and to make the rebate available for a wide range of education costs. The scheme included government and nongovernment school fees, school uniforms, preschool fees and expenses, textbooks, stationery, calculators, camps and excursions, laptops, broadband, software and extracurricular school activities such as sport, music, dance and drama. More than 2.1 million families would have been eligible to claim education expenses for 3.6 million Australian children under the coalition's policy. I have listened to the criticisms of the coalition's record on education from the member for Fowler and the Minister for Education when she introduced the Australian curriculum assessment.",45

The people of the United States exercised their democratic right and elected the 44th President of the United States. It is estimated that up to 130 million Americans cast their votes. The majority of them voted for Barack Obama. Forty-five years after Martin Luther King dreamed of an America where men and women would be judged not on the colour of their skin but on the content of their character, the people of the United States have made that dream a reality. On behalf of the government, I want to extend to the President-elect our congratulations. Senator Obama was elected for the message of hope that he brought to the people of America. But equally it is a message of hope for the world. Minister Other Chamber Mr Jason Wood MP The Hon John Cobb MP Senator the Hon Richard Colbeck Senator the Hon Richard Colbeck Mr Michael Keenan MP Senator the Hon Eric Abetz Senator Cory Bernardi The Hon Dr Sharman Stone Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells Mr Steven Ciobo Senator the Hon Michael Ronaldson We face many great challenges in the 21st ELECTION century: the global financial crisis, climate change and international security. For the international community to tackle these challenges, we will need the continued leadership of the United States into the future. We are confident that Senator Obama will provide that leadership. We are also confident that the strength of the relationship between Australia and the United States will continue to prosper and to develop. Our alliance has been strong and continuous under 13 Australian prime ministers and 12 American presidents, Labor and Liberal, Republican and Democrat. Our alliance transcends politics. When Senator Obama is sworn in as President of the United States on 20 January next year the Australian government will be ready to work closely with the new administration to build on the strong foundation that already exists in terms of security cooperation, to respond together to the great challenges of the global financial crisis and the ensuing downturn in the global economy and to forge a new international consensus on climate change. In the months ahead, Australia looks forward to continuing to work closely with President Bush and his administration on the many immediate challenges that we share, most critically the global financial crisis, on which the President's continuing leadership remains important. Senator Obama's victory is historic. The Australian government looks forward to building a partnership with the new administration which will reinforce the vital and natural ties that have always existed between Australia and the United States, ties that serve both our peoples and both our governments so well.",51
37,Mr TURNBULL,UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on behalf of the opposition, I join the Prime Minister in congratulating President-elect Barack Obama on this historic election victory. The Prime Minister referred to Martin Luther King's ‘I have a dream' speech given 45 years ago. A speech it was; but in truth it was a prayer. Dr King said that he looked forward to the day when his little children would be judged not by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character. When Dr King gave that speech, the 44th President of the United States, as he shortly will be, was only two years old. He was not one of Dr King's children, but he was the child of that prayer and the child of those dreams. And what magnificent dreams. Who among us would have ever thought that we would see the day a black man was elected to be President of the United States, a nation that has been riven by so much racial tension, so much violence and so much hatred. It has risen above all that and affirmed the greatest democracy in the world, affirmed the strength of its diversity and affirmed its confidence in its democracy. And in so doing it has defied all of the critics who said that it was a racist nation and who said that its marbled halls of power were not open to black people, to people from minorities in the United States. It has truly been a magnificent day. We join with the government in congratulating President-elect Obama. Our countries have so much in common. It is not simply that the United States is the world's leading democracy; it is not simply that it is our greatest ally; it is not simply that it must take the leadership role in so many of the great challenges facing the world-the global financial crisis, climate change, the war against terror and all of those great challenges. What we have in common, which Barack Obama personifies, is that we are two nations that define themselves by commitment to common political values. There is no person who can look into the mirror and say, ‘That is an Australian face,' or ‘That is an American face.' The United States is a nation of choice, a nation of immigration-just as our nation is. It is in that diversity that we find our strength. In that sense, Barack Obama reflects that diversity that is so key to our nation as well as his. In many respects, he is as much a citizen of the world as he will shortly be the first citizen of his nation. We share the great hope and optimism that President Obama will answer another call of Dr King, and that is to let freedom ring around the world. NA",52
38,Mr RUDD,NEW ZEALAND ELECTION," Mr Speaker, I seek to make a statement on indulgence.",52
39,The SPEAKER,NEW ZEALAND ELECTION,Indulgence is granted.,52
40,Mr RUDD,NEW ZEALAND ELECTION,"On Saturday night I had the privilege of telephoning Mr John Key on his victory in the New Zealand general elections. Mr Key will become the next Prime Minister of New Zealand following those elections. Furthermore, I would also like to place on record this government's and, I believe, the parliament's appreciation of the contribution of Helen Clark, the Prime Minister of New Zealand who was defeated in those elections. Prime Minister Clark was a strong friend of Australia's throughout the Howard government's tenure in office in Australia and has been a strong contributor to trans-Tasman relations, and we wish her well for the future. Australia and New Zealand have a strong bilateral relationship. It is one which is of great significance to us politically. We share common economic interests through the Closer Economic Relationship, and of course we have a common aspiration to establish a single economic market. Beyond that, we have common interests in the South Pacific, where New Zealand and Australia often find themselves together doing much of the heavy lifting when challenges arise. New Zealand has been a constant, continuing and reliable partner of Australia in very difficult circumstances, ranging from East Timor through to the Solomons and elsewhere as well. I would say to the new Prime Minister of New Zealand that our relationship, like our relationship with the United States, is one that generally transcends party political boundaries and therefore we welcome the opportunity to develop a new relationship with his government. I have extended to the Prime Minister an invitation to undertake a state visit to Australia at the earliest opportupaying nity. We believe that is the right way in which to initiate a relationship with his government once his cabinet is sworn in. We look forward to doing good things with the new government of New Zealand in the future and we wish them well in our common aspiration for a peaceful region and our common contribution to greater prosperity in both our countries.",52
41,Mr TURNBULL,NEW ZEALAND ELECTION," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: we also join with the Prime Minister in congratulating John Key and the National Party of New Zealand on their historic election victory on Saturday night. New Zealand and Australia are, indeed, as close as any two nations can be. It is remarkable that our close friendship can transcend our competition on the sporting field, which occasionally does bring a bit of tension into the relationship. But I believe our relationship is stronger because it is forged in the fire of sporting contest, just as our friendship has been forged in the fire of war. Australia and New Zealand joined together in creating the name of ANZAC, and that remarkable combination, which had its birth on the day that we celebrate as our most important day of remembrance of sacrifice, ANZAC Day, reminds us of how close our two nations are. John Key is a highly capable man who will work tirelessly for his country's reinvigoration and renewal. He is going to put his considerable professional experience working in the international financial markets to great use in his leadership of the New Zealand economy through these very difficult times. We look forward to a close working relationship with the new Prime Minister and his government. We wish him well in facing the very many challenges he will now confront as Prime Minister of New Zealand. We also want to join the Prime Minister in tribute to the contribution of the Rt Hon. Helen Clark to trans-Tasman relations throughout her nine years as Prime Minister of New Zealand. She has always been a stalwart friend of Australia and a strong advocate for her people. The former coalition government of course worked very closely with Helen Clark, particularly, as the Prime Minister noted, in the joint efforts in the Pacific islands and especially the Solomon Islands. So, with that, we join with the Prime Minister in congratulating the new Prime Minister of New Zealand and also in acknowledging our respect and gratitude for the efforts of his distinguished predecessor. NA Automotive Industry",53
42,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. How many more cars will be sold this financial year result of the government's car assistance package?,54
43,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is proud of the package that it has announced today. It represents decisive action for the future of the car industry in Australia. Three hundred and thirty-five thousand vehicles are manufactured in this country each year by the Australian auto industry. When you put together the three manufacturing majors, they represent some 60,000-plus employees directly. Putting them together with the rest of the people who are employed in associated industries, it represents some 200,000 people. Overall, the significance of this industry is as follows: about $8 billion worth of gross domestic product, which follows some $5.6 billion in exports. Mr Hockey interjecting",54
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The global car industry right now, as the honourable member would well know, from Detroit to other car manufacturing centres around the world, is under great stress and pressure. So the alternatives are for any governments around the country to simply turn their backs on that or, as governments past, both Liberal and Labor, have done in this country, to put their shoulders the wheel in fashioning a new car plan for the future. However, we have done so with a new element, and that is to ensure that we will enable the industry to transform itself over time. What I am concerned about is ensuring that we provide sufficient confidence and underpinnings for the industry going forward at a time when the global financial crisis is bearing down on so many. I realise that this is something which may not attract automatic bipartisan support on the part of those opposite. In fact, I am informed that the member for Curtin has already been on the telephone this morning to various people in the car industry seeking to get up and running some negative comment as a against the package that we have just launched. The old bush telegraph works fairly quickly-it came back to us fairly quick smart.",54
45,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,54
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order!,54
47,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice that the member for Curtin is not disputing what I just said. I say to those opposite: at a time of global financial crisis, at a time of global economic crisis and at a time when we have real challenges in the global economy, it would be good if we had bipartisan support not just in name but in reality for the key challenges we face-not just pretending to be bipartisan but putting our shoulder to the wheel. This government has taken decisive action on guaranteeing bank deposits. We have taken decisive action on a $10.4 billion economic stimulus package. We have taken decisive action again today with a $6.2 billion industry innovation plan for the future of the Australian auto industry-an industry in which we believe. Remembrance Day",54
48,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the significance to all Australians of the 90th anniversary of the end of the First World War?,54
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As we approach Armistice Day there is a moment for reflection for all members of this House on the extraordinary events of 90 years ago. In the war which was supposed to end all wars and the carnage which ensued in that war we saw so many of Australia's brave young men die. Some 50,000 to 60,000 gave their lives in the service of their country not just at Gallipoli on the killing fields of France and in trench warfare in Belgium as well. Tomorrow at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month Australians will stand together in one minute's silence to pay tribute to all those Australian men and women who have fought in the service of our country. We will remember those who gave their lives for the nation. We will remember them not just as brave soldiers, sailors and women but also as wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters. We will honour their courage and we will honour their sacrifice. We will remember that the freedoms that we enjoy today are delivered in part because of the sacrifice which they have made. Their legacy is our inheritance. In honouring the sacrifice of all those have served our country we will also acknowledge what these extraordinary men and women have taught us. They have endured hardship and adversity with courage and resilience. They have shown us the importance of the bonds of friendship, of perseverance and above all of deep loyalty towards mates. Australians have responded to their country's call to service with pride and dedication and courage in hard-fought battles across a century: the First World War, the Second World War, Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and more recently our operations in East Timor, the Solomons, Iraq and Afghanistan and peacekeeping operations around the world. As we remember the past let us keep in mind all those who wear the uniform of Australia today. As I have said before, there is no higher calling in Australia than to wear this nation's nightmares. uniform. The events of 1918 may seem now to belong purely in the annals of history because those who fought in that war are no longer with us, but the impact of their sacrifice and the loss of so many of that generation felt in but every small country town and every centre in our country still has its effect today. You still run into families who lost fathers and grandfathers. The implications for them personally of the sacrifice delivered by their loved ones in that conflict are still acute and deeply felt. We honour their service, we honour their sacrifice and we as a nation together will commemorate that with the appropriate solemnity tomorrow on the 90th anniversary of and air men the armistice.",54
50,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, we associate ourselves with the sentiments of the Prime Minister in his very moving remarks on the 90th anniversary of the end of the First World War. It was a war to end all wars. Of course, history tells us that in many who ways it laid the seed for the next one, a war in some respects just as terrible. When you travel around Australia, as all of us have done, and look at the war memorials in the cities or country towns that bear silent witness to the carnage of the First World War and contemplate the scale of the casualties Australia offered in that war-over 60,000 dead from a population that was less than a quarter the size it is today-you realise it was a titanic struggle and it is one the Prime Minister reminds us, and I agree with him, has not faded away into history. It will be with us forever because it was the first global conflict that our nation engaged in. It was one in which our young men went to the other end of the world, often seeking adventure, heedless of danger, and encountered horrors they could not imagine in their worse Many of us have grandparents who served in that war. Many of us have had grandparents like my own grandfather, who could barely bring himself to talk about it until he came close to his own last days. The horror had been too great. We remember those men and women who sacrificed everything for Australia in that terrible conflict and we call their valour and their loyalty and, all, that in wearing Australia's uniform they served this nation and helped establish the freedoms, the liberties and the way of life that we enjoy today. Automotive Industry",55
51,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Given that around half of all cars sold in Australia each year are either leased or financed and given that the government's ill-considered unlimited bank deposit guarantee has dramatically reduced the availability of auto finance, why does today's package fail to address the critical and immediate credit issues facing Australia's car dealers and their 90,000 employees?",56
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I find remarkable about the question from the honourable gentleman opposite is his use of the term ‘ill considered' about a package to which he gave unqualified bipartisan support on the first day that it was announced. He can declare bipartisan support one day, but what you need to understand about the member for Wentworth is what he does on the second day. On the day you announce a policy the opposition say they support it and on the next day-whether it is this matter or other elements of policy in recent days-they slowly crab walk away. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. What is not remarkable is that the Prime Minister's answer is not relevant to the question.",56
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I will listen carefully to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,56
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is important to establish, on any particular day, where the Liberal Party happens to stand on any particular policy, because it changes by the day and by the hour. In fact, I noticed that, on ABC Learnreing Centres, it seems to change by the minabove ute: six positions in four days! Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was a specific question about financing of motor vehicles. If the Prime Minister does not understand the question we can repeat it, but surely he can give the Australian people an answer.",56
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! First of all, the Manager of Opposition Business does not assist his points of order by then going on with argument about subject matter rather than the point of order. It is obvious that I would have assisted myself if I had ruled out of order the part of the question that is now the matter of discussion. It is a matter of discussion not only through the response but by the numerous interjectors. The Prime Minister will respond to the question. I think his introductory remarks have come to a conclusion. He will now go to the question.",56
56,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Wentworth rightly points to the fact that finance companies in recent times are experiencing considerable difficulty. The Treasury currently has task forces dealing with a whole category of market linked investments-finance companies, mortgage trusts, property trusts as well as cash management trusts, including finance companies-to deal with the particular dislocations which are flowing to those companies as a consequence of the global financial crisis and the global economic downturn. For the benefit of the honourable gentleman, he should know that motor vehicle finance companies-car finance companies-are experiencing challenges in every Western economy at present. I would suggest to the honourable gentleman that, rather than seeking to make a cheap political point, he should understand that this is a global problem affecting the car industry and affecting finance companies associated with the car industry, not just here but in the United States and Germany as well. The government systematically is working its way through each of the challenges affecting each sector of this economy and we will continue to do so through the task forces we have established with the Treasury and our consultations with the major banks and with the Australian regulators, as we have been doing in recent weeks.  is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. What recent action has the government taken to protect Australia against the global financial crisis?",56
57,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for his question and congratulate him on the launch of his book, The Twelfth Fish, which I was privileged to play a small part in. And do you know what-it was all his own work! That is unlike the attitude of members opposite, who regard writing as something for staff to do, and even when the staff do it it is not the staffer's work. In some instances they get the father-in-law to do it. That is what the member for Higgins did. So congratulations to the member for Moreton-a new member of the Labor book club. It is good to see. The government has taken decisive action with respect to assisting the Australian vehicle manufacturing industry to meet the challenge of fundamental transformation of that industry. We have put forward a 13-year package of over $6 billion to move the Australian industry to a different configuration to enable the production of fuel-efficient, lowemission vehicles. And this package is a significant element in the government's wider economic strategy-in particular the strategy focusing on the impact of the global financial crisis. Australian industries' challenges are by no means unique. By no means are the challenges facing vehicle manufacturing in Australia unique. In many respects the challenges that are facing the industry here are similar to those facing the United States industry. There is a significant difference, of course, and that is that our industry is of a much smaller scale and therefore much more vulnerable to shifts in consumer demand and wider economic circumstances. It is notable that President-elect Obama is Economy expected to pursue similar strategies to assist a transformation to a more environmentally friendly product in the United States vehicle manufacturing industry. The centrepiece of this strategy is a 10-year, $1.3 billion Green Car Innovation Fund, which leverages on a three to one ratio of private investment to environmentally sound technologies. That is a substantially larger fund than was originally promised by the government at the last election. In addition there is a $3.4 billion Automotive Transformation Scheme to underpin the competitiveness of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. It is important here to note that this money is to flow on the basis of actions and on the basis of contracts. It is not money upfront; it is money in response to actions and decisions and real investments on the part of the vehiclemanufacturing companies. A third aspect is to continue with the phase-down of tariff protection from 10 per cent to five per cent in January 2010. That, of course, ensures that what is the most inefficient and most regressive way of assisting the industry, through tariff protection, is continuing to be reduced, as previously indicated. Together with the decline in the value of the Australian dollar, cuts in interest rates and, of course, the stimulus from the government's Economic Security Strategy, these initiatives are good news. They are good news for the vehicle-manufacturing industry, they are good news for the 60,000-odd workers directly employed in the industry and they are good news for the much wider range of people whose economic security and opportunity depends on Australia having a strong vehicle manufacturing industry. But it also requires the manufacturers to deliver. This proposal-this plan-requires the manufacturers to invest, to take risk and to demonstrate their commitment to Australia in the long term. They face very substantial challenges and they are, in some respects, dealing with more or less a perfect storm at the moment, given the wider global circumstances and the change in consumer demand. But they have a strong base on which to move forward and the government is committed to assisting them to transform their companies into much more viable activities and operations over the course of the next 10 or 12 years. In conclusion, the government is acting decisively to tackle the economic challenges facing this nation, whether with respect to guaranteeing bank deposits or the Economic Security Strategy that is designed to stimulate economic activity, growth and jobs in the Australian economy or the development of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in order to deal with that enormous challenge of climate change that was so comprehensively neglected by the previous government and to invest in this instance-via today's announcement-in the structural transformation of one of Australia's most important industries. The global financial crisis is senting Australia with an enormous challenge, but the businesses of Australia, the working people of Australia and the government of Australia are up to that challenge and together we are going to meet it and defeat it. Economy",57
58,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to last Wednesday's government forecast,58
59,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,58
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right will come to order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call.,58
61,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to last Wednesday's government forecast of two per cent economic growth for this financial year. I also refer the Prime Minister to the IMF forecast two days later of 1.8 per cent growth. Given that the Reserve Bank today stated that it expects economic growth to be only 1.5 per cent and the Treasurer has stated from Brazil that ‘the slowing in growth will be more dramatic', Prime Minister, which growth projection is the most accurate?",58
62,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable member would know, the global financial crisis is impacting on the real economies of all developed and developing economies. In fact, before I go to the heart of the honourable member's question, I draw her attention also to the extraordinary action taken in the last 24 hours by the government of China, an extraordinary fiscal stimulus package which I believe is of significance not just to this economy but also to the economy across wider East Asia and the world. When I last prelooked at the numbers, the stimulus package was something in the vicinity over two years of seven per cent of GDP, some $586 billion. Obviously that reflects the concern in China about their own domestic growth prospects, but it parallels, I believe, in the degree of effort and intensity on the part of the Chinese, what we saw from the Chinese government in the late nineties following the Asian financial crisis. The Chinese authorities have spoken through Xinhua press today of the importance of taking measures in a new proactive approach to fiscal policy in the same language, I am advised, that they used in 1998-99 in relation to the reflationary policies they adopted then in response to the Asian financial crisis. I regard that as very good news for this economy, very good news for the regional economy and very good news for the global economy. Certainly, it is consistent with the many discussions that the Treasurer and I have had with various Chinese counterparts in recent weeks. On the honourable member's question concerning the growth forecasts for Australia, I would draw the honourable member's attention to the relevant section of MYEFO, page 29, which refers to the assumptions underpinning Treasury's analysis in the MYEFO document. It says: Interest rates are expected to decline broadly in line with market expectations. This is a departure from the usual assumption of unchanged interest rates, reflecting the fact that markets are forecastLearning ing a significant easing in the near term, and it would be unrealistic not to take this into account. The reason I quote that to the honourable member is simply to point out that, when Treasury does its forecasts, that is the underlying assumption in its analysis. The Reserve Bank, because of its doctrine of independence and not speculating publicly on future movements on interest rates on its part, does not incorporate that within its analysis. That is why you see a difference in the approach to the calculation of the growth number. Child Care Mrs D'ATH (2.33 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. What is the Australian government doing to ensure that Australian families who are affected by ABC Learning going into receivership continue to have access to child care?",58
63,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know that she and other members of the government are concerned about the circumstances facing mums and dads who rely on ABC Learning. We on this side of the House understand that child care is a vital service that mums and dads rely on in order to meet their work commitments and that security of supply of child care is vital to them. Obviously ABC Learning is the nation's largest childcare provider, and as a result the government has closely monitored all year circumstances involving ABC Learning. On 24 September this year I established the childcare industry task force in my department. That task force immediately established contact with ABC Learning directors and their lending syndicate. Until 2 November the ABC Learning directors and their lending syndicate were indicating that ABC was aiming to trade itself out of current financial difficulties. As members would be aware, on 6 November ABC Learning Centres Ltd entered into voluntary administration and shortly thereafter, indeed almost immediately thereafter, a receiver was appointed. On 6 November the receiver, MCGRATHNicol, wrote to all parents with children at ABC childcare centres, all employees and all centre managers with a message that their local childcare centre would continue on a business as usual basis. MCGRATHNicol indicated in that correspondence that it was working constructively with ABC's financiers and with the Rudd government on measures to ensure the stability of childcare services for ABC families. The receiver also on that day, 6 November, released a media statement entitled ‘ABC childcare centres to remain open'. To ensure anxious parents and employees could get information, the government, by 3 pm on 6 November, ensured that there was a dedicated telephone line on which parents and employees could get information. In addition, we commenced regularly placing updates on the ABC Learning situation on the mychild.gov.au website. On Friday, 7 November, the day after the receiver was appointed, I announced that the Australian government had reached an agreement with the receiver of ABC Learning and their lending syndicate. In order to ensure that all ABC Learning childcare centres remain open and providing care until 31 December, the Australian government has committed up to $22 million of conditional funding. I announced on that day, Friday, that the $22 million commitment represents the possible costs of supporting the continued operation of the unprofitable ABC centres for two months. As members of the House would undoubtedly appreciate, normally a receiver coming into a business that found parts of the business were unprofitable would immediately act either to close or to rationalise those unprofitable parts of the business. Because of the unique situation of ABC Learning, the government is providing up to $22 million to support these centres and to ensure that they continue to provide child care until 31 December this year. In period between now and 31 December the government will continue to work with the receiver and the financiers of ABC Learning and we will be in a position to make further announcements about the future of ABC Learning Centres as a result of that work. I do not like to criticise anything coming from Queensland, for all of the obvious reasons, but there is a report in today's Courier Mail which contains the following words: A spokesman for MCGRATHNicolthe receiversaid it was far too early to tell where and how the Federal Government's $22 million bailout payment would be spent. This report is incorrect. I draw the attention of the House to my transcript from 7 November which makes it clear how the $22 million is to be spent. I also draw the attention of the House to a letter, which I am advised has been emailed today by the receiver to the editor of the Courier Mail, which states as follows: To clarify a report in your paper today, up to $22 million was made available by the federal government to assist in the prevention of closures of any ABC childcare centre before the end of December. The amount used will be verified and independently checked to ensure the funds are used effectively. The actual detail of the funding will be worked through between the receivers and the government and the discussions are already underway. The amount of support was based on a preliminary assessment of the centres which were unprofitable under the group's current business model. The receivers are currently conducting a full and proper analysis of the centre data in line with their review of the business. That letter is on the letterhead of MCGRATHNicol and is signed by Chris Honey, Receiver and Manager, ABC Learning Centres Ltd. The government will continue to work with the receiver and continue to work with the the financiers of ABC Learning in order to find a long-term solution. The government has acted quickly and decisively to ensure that parents can rely on ABC centres being available, providing care, to 31 December this year. This is in stark contrast to the position of the opposition which has dithered about every 15 minutes since this first happened. Diplomatic Protocol",59
64,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the article in the Australian newspaper of 25 October which described in graphic detail a conversation between himself and the President of the United States said to have taken place on 10 October at 10.40 pm. The article stated that, according to an informed source: ... that Rudd was then stunned to hear Bush say: ‘What's the G20?' Will the Prime Minister assure the House that neither he nor any person in his office disclosed any of the details of this call to the Australian newspaper?",60
65,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As both the President's spokesman and I, together with the US ambassador, have indicated, the conversation with the President of the United States was explicitly about the G20.

Any suggestion that the President of the United States was not aware of the significance of the G20 was simply inaccurate. I would ask those opposite, though, on the question of our relationship with the United States: when do we get the apology from the Liberal Party for them describing Barack Obama's victory as a victory for al-Qaeda?

75,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and for her deep interest in child care. When the Rudd government was elected less than 12 months ago, we inherited a childcare system in which the former government had let the market rip. In 1999 the former government had uncapped the number of childcare places available. Meeting growing demand by uncapping places was not an error. What was an error was doing that without a plan for quality, without a plan for workforce, without a plan to bring child care to areas that needed it and without a plan that regulated or dealt with this market in any way. Indeed, what the former government did was to let the market rip and take their eyes off the road and their hands off the steering wheel, and then, as it all went towards an inevitable crash, they prepared to blame state and territory governments. Whenever asked, Liberal Party ministers would say in relation to child care that this was all about state and territory governments. To take just one example, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in 2006, said: … State Governments have primary responsibility for regulating and managing pre-school and childcare delivery throughout Australia.",61
76,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,62
77,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘A statement of fact', one of the Liberal members says. So their attitude remains unchanged: let the market rip and then take absolutely no responsibility for the consequences. This is a typical Liberal Party response-reckless and out of touch. Since we were elected late last year we have, step by step and piece by piece, acted to ensure that this is a system that has quality plan, that has a workforce plan and that has an expansion of supply. Each and every step of the way, the Rudd Labor government has acted to deal with the problems in this system left by the former government. So, for example, with our plan for quality we are streamlining quality and licensing requirements, and there will be rigorous new national quality standards and a rating system for child care",62
78,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,62
79,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"something, I presume from the interjections, that the Liberal Party is opposed to. We have entered into a $126 million plan for workforce development. This will include removing TAFE fees for those who want to be childcare workers and creating an additional 1,500 university places for those who want to be early learning educators. And we have a plan for childcare infrastructure, bringing up to 260 new centres around the country, and a plan for an early learning years framework so that, no matter what setting children are cared for in, they have the benefit of an early education program. Each and every day, I and the parliamentary secretary responsible in the area, the member for Bennelong, have worked step by step on these measures, which were desperately needed in this industry and neglected by the Liberal Party when in government. What seems even more amazing to me than the attitude of the Liberal Party when in government is the fact that it has learnt absolutely nothing in opposition. Can I refer the House to an extraordinary transcript this morning from the member for Indi, the shadow minister now responsible for this area-an extraordinary transcript, very interesting reading-where she is asked",62
80,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on the matter of relevance. I did not hear anything in the question that related to a quotes relating to this side of the House. The minister started with that attack. I let her go that far, but she is back at it again now, and it is up to you to bring her back to the question.",62
81,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,62
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If there was a reflection on another member, I could not hear it above all the interjections. I will listen carefully to the way in which the Deputy Prime Minister uses her material, which I hope will be relevant to the question.",62
83,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is certainly relevant to the question and the question of child care, and I thank the member for O'Connor for his interjection-his point of order. I presume the member for Indi is grateful as well, because he is one member of the House who makes her look good. On the question of the transcript this morning, the member for Indi, when asked about the opposition's plans for child care, was asked, ‘What should the government do?' She said, ‘Firstly, the government should outline its contingency plan.' The journalist said, ‘No, what do you suggest the government should do?' to see if she had any plans. Then the member for Indi said, ‘Well, that's up to Ms Gillard to tell us how she's going to respond.' Then the journalist said to the member for Indi, ‘You would have thought about the issues; what do you think should be done?' and she said ‘Well, Ms Gillard needs to come up with a sustainable model,' and the journalist said in frustrafice tion, ‘No, no, I am not asking about Ms Gillard's opinion,' in yet another desperate attempt to elicit from the member for Indi something that might look like a Liberal policy for child care. Then, extraordinarily, ing been pressed and pressed again for a policy on child care, the member for Indi said in respect of me that I should have acted 12 months ago on this. The member for Indi might like to remember the Liberal Party was in government 12 months ago. Maybe they should have acted on it, yes, but she can hardly say that that is something for the current government.",62
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will bring her answer to a conclusion.,63
85,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then, finally, like all Liberal Party members when asked on child care-because they have no policies, no plans and no ideas-what does she actually do? She actually says that this is all about state governments that regulate child care. The Liberal Party learns nothing, stands for nothing",63

89,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer to his answer to my previous question, in which he expressly failed to deny that he or his ofleaked details of the conversation with the United States President to the Australian newspaper. I also refer to the Australian Federal Police investigation into the disclosure of confidential files in Kathmandu and also hav- to the Department of Defence investigation into the leaking of a confidential briefing relating to entertainers visiting our troops in Afghanistan. I ask the Prime Minister: what investigation has he instigated into the false and misleading leak of details of a private and confidential telephone conversation with the United States President?",63
90,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. As indicated before to the member for Wentworth, the White House, the United States ambassador and I have confirmed that the President did not make the remarks that have been attributed to him in the article in question. I also ask the member for Wentworth, he having stood at the dispatch box today and welcomed Senator Obama's election, when he is going to apologise for the attack on Senator Obama",63
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, this is the second time he has completely failed to answer an important question. It relates to our relations with the United States. He owes us an explanation.",63
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. It would assist if those on my left sat there a little quieter so I could actually hear the Prime Minister.,63
93,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member for Wentworth just said, it goes to our relationship with the United States. If he is concerned about the attack on Senator Obama last year, Senator Fifield only last month said about Senator Obama, ‘It is a very serious matter when you have a presidential candidate who thinks it is okay to hang around Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order-relevance: I would just ask him to answer the question he was asked.",64

97,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the substance of the matter, I refer again to the statement. I made fore about the public statements by the White House, the US ambassador and me on this. In furthering the question, the member for Wentworth said that this goes to our relation- executions. ship with the United States. Calling the President-elect of the United States an ‘agent of al-Qaeda'-which is what the Liberals did last year-I think is of some consequence to that relationship. Indonesia: Travel Advice",64
98,Mrs IRWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House of the Australian government's advice with respect to travel to Indonesia, following the execution of the Bali bombers?",64
99,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. Can I start where I have started on this matter in recent days, and that is to express my deepest sympathy for the family members of the victims of both Bali bombings. The last week or so, in particular yesterday, has been a terrible reminder of tragic personal circumstances and loss. I am sure that all members of the House join in the expression of sympathy and condolence to the families in what has been, in my view, a terrible reminder of very tragic family circumstances. For some time, indeed since November 2002 in the aftermath of the first Bali bombing, the effective travel advice for Indonesia, including Bali, has been for Australians to their need to travel. Whilst until 2005 it was described differently, that has been the effective travel advice, so far as the Australian government is concerned, to Australians contemplating travel to Indonesia, including Bali. On Saturday, 8 November and again on Sunday following the executions of the Bali bombers, the travel advisory was reissued and updated. It remains at the same level, the be- second-highest level: ‘Reconsider your need for travel'. But, to bring it up to date and remain current with ongoing events, it has been reissued and updated following the Can I draw the House's attention to important parts of that travel advisory. Australians should reconsider their need to travel to Indonesia, including Bali, due to the very high threat of terrorist attack. The executions of the Bali bombers could prompt a strong reaction from their supporters, including demonstrations, acts of violence and acts of reprisal. Regrettably, the government continues to receive credible information that terrorists could be planning attacks in Indonesia and, regrettably, we continue to receive credible information that Bali remains an attractive target for terrorist activity. In particular, given that we are at the end of the school year, members would of course be aware that numbers of young Australians may be planning, after their school exams at the end of their school year, to travel to Indonesia, and Bali in particular. I draw the attention of those young school graduates and their parents to the travel advisory, and I urge those young Australians and their parents, if they do decide to travel to Bali and Indonesia, to exercise heightened caution at this time and to avoid those places which we know have been targets for terrorist attack in the past, in particular, bars, beaches, shopping malls and the like. It has of course been drawn to my attention and has been part of the public commentary in the context of the execution of the Bali bombers that, as a consequence of our travel advisory, numbers of young students who have pre-booked or previously planned to travel to Bali may now be contemplating a change of circumstances, a change of plan. Over the weekend I have urged the travel industry to exercise maximum flexibility if young Australians seek to change their travel arrangements so far as Bali or Indonesia are concerned. I welcome the news that Jetstar and Virgin Blue, two of the airlines which have flights to Bali, have waived their fees for travellers wishing to change the date of their travel to Bali in November. I am advised that, so far as Jetstar is concerned, the waiver of this fee applies for changes made in November to as late as September of next year. I again call on all airlines and the travel industry generally-travel agents, airlinesto exercise maximum flexibility. Some members of the House may be aware that for the last few years, indeed since 2004, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has consulted formally with the travel industry through the Smartraveller Consultative Group. This has generally taken the form of annual consultations where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the travel industry engage in a dialogue to ensure that the travel industry is aware of matters relating to safety so far as travel is concerned. I can advise the House that on Friday of this week in Sydney the department will be convening a special and urgent meeting of the Smartraveller Consultative Group with the travel industry to see whether more can be done to maximise the flexibility so far as changed travel arrangements to Bali or Indonesia are concerned. I again welcome the action already taken by Jetstar and Virgin Blue. I conclude my remarks to the House by making some comments in respect of capital punishment. Australia, through the states, abolished capital punishment, the death penalty, more than 20 years ago. The view of the Commonwealth of Australia, and I choose my words carefully to include the states, the territories and the Commonwealth, has been that the death penalty is not appropriate for Australia. Internationally, Australia supports the abolition of the death penalty as a form of punishment, and Australia and the Australian government have been active in the United Nations, urging this view upon nations who continue to use the death penalty as a sanction. Indeed, in December 2007, one of the first acts of the current government was to cosponsor a resolution at the General Assembly calling for a moratorium so far as capital punishment, or the death penalty, is concerned. Australia will be repeating this cosponsorship this year. This of course followed on from when, in 2006, the then Australian government and Australia supported a similar statement presented to the General Assembly by Finland. I have noted the comments made by those opposite which reflect the bipartisan approach on this issue in terms of both of a domestic sanction and Australia's view to the world generally. I conclude by again urging those Australians who are contemplating travel to Indonesia, including Bali, to very carefully consider the travel advisory on the website and to bear that very carefully in mind when making their travel plans. Child Care",64
100,Mrs MIRABELLA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. I refer to the fact that the government has stated that 400 of the ABC Learning Centres are not profitable. Minister, which ones are they? Will they close after 31 December? Furthermore, as every centre reports its vacancy rates to the government on a weekly basis, what have the vacancy rates been for these 400 centres since January?",66
101,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for her question. As the member for Indi should be aware, on 7 November-that is, Friday of last week-I announced that the government would provide up to $22 million conditional funding because around 40 per cent of ABC Learning Centres, some 1,040 centres, were viewed by the receivers as unprofitable. The member for Indi, if she had read that transcript, would have also noted that I indicated at the time that that was the receiver's preliminary data, the receiver havthat ing been put in place about 24 hours previously. The member for Indi is shaking her head, but obviously the question of profitability or unprofitability of a centre is a judgement the receiver would make-and the receiver understandably, some 24 hours afterwards, was saying that he was working on preliminary data. I suggest to the member for Indi that if she has questions about that she should direct them to the receiver. Economy",66
102,Ms HALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister update the House on recent assessments of the Australian economy, including the release today of the Reserve Bank Statement on monetary policy?",66
103,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There have of course been a number of assessments recently of the state of the Australian economy and the Reserve Bank has today published its Statement on monetary policy which notes a number of important observations with respect to both global and Australian economic circumstances especially in the wake of the global financial crisis. It does note that there is less dislocation in Australian credit markets than overseas but, nonetheless, that downward revisions of global growth will have an impact on Australia. It does point out that governments and central banks responding to turbulence with various measures have generated some improvement both internationally and of course in Australia but that sentiment remains ‘fragile' and there is a ‘deteriorating outlook for the global economy'. It notes that the government's Economic Security Strategy will boost consumption and home building and, together with the impact of the fall in the value of the Australian dollar and the recent reduction in interest rates, these initiatives will very strongly push back against the downward negative impact of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy. It does point out as well that our banks are less affected by the turbulence in international financial markets than those of most other countries, that our banks are well capitalised and that their capital adequacy levels are well above the established minimum levels. It is worth noting too, as the Prime Minister referred to earlier regarding the difference in the Reserve Bank's projected 1½ per cent growth in the coming year as compared to the Treasury's assessment of two per cent in MYEFO that was published some days ago, that the difference between the two can largely be explained by the fact that Treasury in its assumptions presumes that there will some further reduction of interest rates in ensuing months whereas the Reserve Bank obviously cannot make any assumptions about future movements in interest rates, and its assumptions therefore out to June 2011 assume that interest rates remain as they currently are. So that essentially explains the difference in the projections. There have of course been other assessments of the outlook for the Australian omy, most notably from the opposition. Unfortunately, those assessments seem to change on a daily basis and sometimes even on an hourly basis. I note that the Leader of the Opposition believes that consistency is a very important principle. In fact on 8 November he was quoted as saying, ‘I place a very high premium on consistency and integrity in politics.' Two months ago the Leader of the Opposition was reaffirming the opposition's commitment to cutting fuel excise. That promise has now been jettisoned. So here we have a reversal of the usual arrangements: we have a government that is honouring its promises and an opposition that is actually betraying its promises we are anywhere near an election. They are already breaking their promises and they have not even got to the election yet. One month ago the Leader of the Opposition was saying that the global financial crisis is overhyped. What we did not know at the time was that he was quietly moving his own money out of a property fund that has since been frozen. Mr Hockey interjecting",66
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The minister for finance is starting to stray well away from the question. I give him the call and ask him to conclude his answer.,67
105,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I was referring to the sincerity of assessments of the be Australian economy to which the question referred. I am referring here to matters that are on the public record, indeed a quote from the Leader of the Opposition: Well you take advice from your financial planners, you invest in things, you dispose of things. A million here, a million there-what is the difference? The Leader of the Opposition is a clever politician but you have to watch what he does, not what he says, because that econ- changes on a daily basis. And I note that we have still not seen any commentary or any proposals with respect to one key question in the global financial crisis set of issues, and that is: what does the opposition have to say about excessive executive salaries? What does the opposition have to say about this issue? I note in the assessment of the issues associated with global circumstances that this is one thing that the Leader of the Opposition has yet to address. The global financial crisis is not overhyped. It is very serious and it is presenting very substantial challenges to the government. But the government is meeting those before challenges with sound economic management and clear positions on the issues and clear initiatives to deal with those challenges. The opposition says that it is supporting the government's initiatives, that it has bipartisan support for those initiatives, and then within minutes walks away from that position and proceeds to start to snipe at all of those propositions. I urge the opposition to rethink its position and to take a serious, clear and consistent position on these issues, because they are too important for the behaviour that we are seeing from the opposition. We do not need an investment banker's approach; we need a sound approach from government to dealing with the challenges that Australia faces, and the government will not be diverted from what is necessary to ensure the security and prosperity of the Australian people. Child Care",67
106,Mrs MIRABELLA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for Social Inclusion. Given that the ter has stated that 40 per cent of ABC Learning's childcare centres are not profitable, does the minister stand by the government's commitment to build an extra 260 new childcare centres that will compete directly with the existing operators?",68
107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for her question and I point out what I think are two very simple things. Firstly, Australia is a big country. People look",68
108,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,68
109,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All right! The member for Indi has understood that point. I am glad to have that reinforced. People look for child care locally either near where they live or near where they work. It is therefore absolutely possible for ABC Learning-or indeed for any childcare operator in this country-to say in respect of one centre that they do not have as many children in it as they would like and in respect of others that there are crying shortages in other parts of the country where people are looking for child care. Obviously, the government's promise of introducing up to 260 new childcare centres was aimed at the following things: increasing supply in those parts of the country where people are short of centres and short of places; secondly, developing those new childcare centres in locations of convenience to parents. Most particularly we have looked at near or on school grounds so that parents can avoid the dreaded double drop-off and if they have children of childcare age and of school age they can have them dropped off in the one location. Opposition members jeer at that as if that is something extraordinary-that a hard working mum or a hard working dad would want to drop their school-age children and their children of childcare age off at the same location. But let me tell you that that just goes to show how out of touch the Liberal minisParty is because there are mums and dads right around the country that would prefer that convenience.  children?",68
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the member for Indi that in respect of the second part of her question, if she thinks about it for a second the answer will be obvious to her. The Liberal Party is led by a man who says he knows about business and money. What the word ‘profit' means is that there is something left over after you have acquitted all costs. You should not assume, as the member for Indi clearly does, that the only thing that goes into the business model of a childcare centre is the question of the number of vacancies. Obviously other costs also pertain to the question of profit, which is why the receiver of ABC, when working through whether a centre is profitable or not, will obviously be looking at all facts that pertain to thatvacancy rates would be one but costs such as the cost of the premises, the cost of the staff and other issues in relation to that centre will obviously pertain. So the member for Indi is taking an overly simplistic view of all of this. I can understand why she would be taking an overly simplistic view of all of it because the Liberal Party has always taken an overly simplistic, neglectful view of child care-let the market rip, never think about anything else, never do anything else, never develop a policy whether in government or in opposition, and as Leader of the Opposition never say the same thing twice. The Leader of the Opposition has never said the same thing twice since ABC moved into voluntary administration on 6 November. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I ask that the member for Aston withdraw the nasty, inappropriate and offensive remark that he made across the chamber during the Deputy Prime Minister's response.",68
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am unclear because I did not hear what was said but there has been a reaction to a comment. If the member for Aston is in a position to withdraw I would ask him to withdraw. But I am in the difficulty of not having heard the comment, to which there has been a reaction, though, which is an indication. ",69
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Aston. Middle East,69
113,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister report on his recent visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories? What is the government's approach to the Middle East peace process?,69
114,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fremantle for her question and for her support of the Middle East peace process. Since the House last met, on 28 October I visited Israel and the Palestinian tories. The objective of the visit to Israel was, firstly, to relay to the Israeli government congratulations on behalf of Australia on the 60th anniversary of the independence of Israel, of the creation of the Israeli state. The second purpose was to underline Australia's very strong support of a two-nation-state solution to the Middle East-a nation-state for Israel within defined and secure boundaries and borders and a nation-state for the Palestinian people. In Jerusalem I had the opportunity of meeting with Prime Minister Olmert, Foreign Minister Livni and Opposition Leader Netanyahu and I had the privilege of laying a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum. In the Palestinian territories I met with Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister alMaliki, visited the Kalandia refugee camp in the Palestinian territories and also announced the final allocation of the $45 million announced by Australia at the Paris Donors Conference to support the Palestinian territories and humanitarian assistance in the Palestinian territories. Of the final $10 million allocation, $7.5 million will be ascribed to the Palestinian Authority for capacity and institution building and $2.5 million for further humanitarian assistance. Whilst much of my time in the Palestinian territories and Israel was spent discussing the Middle East peace process, I think it is true to say that the issue uppermost in the minds of the Israeli leadership is Iranian nuclear activity. In this respect, Australia's recent adoption of autonomous sanctions so far as Iran and its nuclear program is concerned was very warmly welcomed by the Israeli government and the Israeli leadership. So far as the Middle East peace process is concerned, I underlined very strongly to both the Israeli leadership and the Palestinian Authority Australia's very strong support for a territwo-nation-state solution, the Annapolis process, the 2002 road map for peace process and the 2007 Annapolis initiative commenced under the Bush administration in November 2007. In that context, I warmly welcome the statement overnight by the so-called Middle East quartet, comprising the United Nations, the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States. The quartet have reported that President Abbas and Foreign Minister Livni reaffirmed their commitment to ‘vigorous, ongoing and continuous negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues without exception'. As the quartet emphasised on the weekend, both sides must abide by their road map obligations to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations. Over the weekend the quartet also reiterated that both parties must: … fully implement their obligations under phase one of the Roadmap, including in relation to freezing settlement activity and the dismantlement of the infrastructure of terrorism. The Australian government very strongly shares this sentiment, as we share the sentiment expressed by Secretary of State Rice on more than one occasion in the course of this year that, ‘at a time when we need to build confidence between the parties, the continued building and settlement activity has the potential to harm the negotiations going forward'. Both parties need to abide by their obligations under the 2002 road map for peace and not do anything which disturbs or jeopardises the Annapolis peace process: peace and security, non-use of force and terrorist activiMiddle ties insofar as the Palestinian territories are concerned and settlement activity insofar as the Israeli side is concerned. I take this opportunity to update the House on resolutions dealt with before the United Nations General Assembly fourth committee on Friday night and Saturday morning. The General Assembly fourth committee dealt with nine resolutions relating to the Middle East. In respect of these nine resolutions, the Australian government instructed our representative to the United Nations to change Australia's vote from the previous voting habits of the last few years on two occasions. It is important to make the point to the House that, when it comes to General Assembly resolutions, the government adopts the following approach. Firstly, we treat these resolutions on a case-by-case basis and consider them on their merits. Secondly, we consider these resolutions firmly within the context of our very strong adherence to our support for a two-nation-state solution and our support of the peace process. If the resolutions are consistent with that approach then we support them. In 2003 the General Assembly made a reference to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the Israeli security barrier. Since that time, the Australian voting practice changed on a number of significant resolutions, including, for example, the resolution on settlements. The Australian government has come to the view that, whilst the reference by the General Assembly to the International Court of Justice was not supported by the Australian government or by the opposition at the time, and whilst we regard-as the previous government did-that advisory opinion as an advisory opinion and not a binding opinion, we will not oppose a resolution in the General Assembly on the East simply because it refers to that advisory opinion. That is the case as far as the resolution on settlements is concerned where, on behalf of the government, I instructed our permanent representative to the United Nations to change Australia's vote to support the resolution as far as settlements were concerned because this was consistent with our approach for a two-nation-state solution, our support for the road map for peace and the Annapolis process. In doing so on that and on the second resolution on which I instructed a change in the Australian voting position, regarding the Geneva convention, Australia joined another 160 nation-states in support of those two resolutions as compared with two-nationstates who abstained and six who opposed. In that context, we joined the overwhelming majority of the international community. It is not necessarily about the quantity; we also need to look at where some of our long standing, like minded colleagues are. In support of the settlements resolution we find the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the European Union. It is not so much the number of nation-states; it is whether these lutions sit squarely within the Australian government's policy. Australia's long standing policy on a two-nation-state solution for the Middle East and support for the road map for peace and the Annapolis process was in every respect consistent with the nine resolutions voted on by the General Assembly on Friday night and Saturday morning. This is not just a government view; this is a long standing Australian position shared by both sides of the House. This government will do nothing to jeopardise our long standing public policy and foreign policy commitment to a two-nation-state solution for the Middle East and our very strong support of the road map for peace and the Annapolis peace process. Middle East",69
115,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the answer just given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I ask the Prime Minister: why has the Australian government switched its vote in the United Nations to support these two resolutions of which the foreign minister spoke, which are not simply highly critical of our friends in Israel but which cuse the state of Israel of acting in breach international humanitarian law? Does the Prime Minister consider this change of policy, with Australia making that grave allegation of misconduct against Israel, conducive to achieving peace in the Middle East?",71
116,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prior to 2003, resolutions of a similar type to the two matters referred to were supported by the then Liberal government. That is the first point. The second is, as explained just now by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the dispatch box, what occurred subsequent to that was the request for the advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the question of the securesority wall. The other point I would draw the honourable member's attention to is that, if we are serious about a long-term Middle East peace process based on a two-state solution, part of that-a huge part of it-lies in dealing with the threat of terrorism to the state of Israel. That remains the position of this government, as it was the position of the previous government. Part of that also lies in what you do about the challenge of the settlements. I draw to the honourable gentleman's attention the statement overnight by the quartet comprising the government of the United States, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United Nations which explicitly reiterates that both parties-Israel and Palestine-must ‘fully implement their obligations under phase 1 of the road map, including in relation to freezing settlement activity and the dismantlement of the infrastructure of terrorism'. As the honourable gentleman would know, this is a very complex matter. The whole Middle East peace process is littered with failed negotiations up until now. But if there is a prospect of delivering peace in the acMiddle East, part of that hinges on the quesof tion of how we deal with settlements in future. A huge part of it hinges on how we provide Israel with an appropriate state of security, given the threat of continued terrorism which Israel has suffered under for many decades now. There is a lot of sensitivity attached to these matters. We on this side of the House are as acutely conscious of this as those on the other side. But, as stated by the foreign minister, it is with the absolute best intentions that we will work constructively towards a two-state solution, mindful of all of these realities. The future of settlements is part and parcel of the road map to peace which was drafted by President Bush several years ago. That has been reiterated by the quartet in the last 24 hours. That informs the position taken by the foreign minister and the instructions that he has provided to former Senator Hill, our representative in New York.",71
117,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister outline any relevant investments in Australia's health workforce and the challenges that they are designed to overcome?,72
118,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Her electorate, like those of many in this House, is affected by workforce shortages, particularly of doctors. There would not be a person in this House who would not be familiar with families from their electorates coming to see them about difficulties accessing doctors. We believe that action needs to be taken to ensure that families can get the health care they need in their community when they need it. The most recent medical workforce survey, released just in the last fortnight, shows that the overall supply of primary care practitioners-so this is mostly GPs-declined under the watch of the Liberal government. It fell from 101 to 97 full-time equivalents per 100,000 of population between 2002 and 2006. As the member for Robertson would be aware, the doctor shortage affects many families. In fact, the latest figures show us that six in 10 Australians feel the impact of this shortage. This was a clear result of a failure of leadership by the previous government. It was a failure to plan for the future and a failure to recognise the long-term impacts of the decisions that they were making. But in case anyone opposite thinks that this is me just being political, I would remind those opposite, who might mistake this as me politicising it, that the member for Warringah said last year: ‘We failed to increase medical school places until 2000. Sure, you could say that it was overdue.' The member for Bradfield said earlier this year: ‘In hindsight, it was obvious that the restrictions on general Health practice training positions imposed in 199697 were not appropriate and I did express my concerns at the time.' It is quite clear that this was a problem. It was only recognised belatedly by the Liberal government, but they did belatedly recognise the error of their ways. Over the next few years-and this is a good thing-an increasing number of young graduate doctors will be coming on line. Unfortunately, though, these young medical graduates leaving university then have to move into a specialty training place. To do that, they need there to be a training place. For example, this year there was a record number of applicants for GP training places, that exceeding the number that were available, leaving young doctors facing a bottleneck which the Liberal Party failed to address. So as a result of the cap that was put in place by the previous Liberal government, promising young doctors with the ambition to become GPs were going to have those ambitions thwarted. That is why last Wednesday in Tasmania the Prime Minister and I announced that the Rudd government is investing $148 million to immediately establish 175 new GP training places. This will allow 175 new doctors to begin training as GPs in the next two years, bringing the total number next year to 675 and in 2010 to 700. This is, I am sure, welcome news to the whole parliament. It will be welcome news to the community that we have young doctors keen to go into general practice being able to take up their ambitions and service the community. This was widely welcomed by health professionals in the community. For example, the President of the AMA, Dr Rosanna Capolingua, described this move as: ‘Just what the doctor ordered: a much needed show of support for general practice and our patients which will have an immediate impact.' The Rudd government believes that Australians should be able to access health care when and where they need it, and this is an important step to us achieving that goal and an immediate down payment on future workforce reform. I encourage all graduates and medical students to consider general practice as a good career and a chance to provide valuable services in our community. I know all members of this House would encourage those young medical graduates to do that. Small Business",72
119,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his comments on 7 October when he said, ‘The government welcomes the relief that the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision will provide to working families and to Australian small businesses.' Prime Minister, how many of the banks have passed on the Reserve Bank's now 1.75 per cent rate cut to their small business customers? If banks have not passed on the rate cut, how will small businesses be relieved by the Reserve Bank's decision?",73
120,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First and foremost, in terms of the government's commitment to the interests of small business, one of the challenges that we sought to address in the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy was to provide stimulus to the economy, particularly in the household consumption sector where so many small businesses depend on a flowthrough of activity. We are very mindful of that. The second concern with regard to small business was the drying up of loan finance to small business in the future. That is why we provided the banks with a guarantee in terms of their term wholesale funding. One of the galvanising arguments put to us at that time was the need to provide that guarantee to ensure that there would be a continuing line of credit to small business. The third point is the cost of that credit. That goes to the interest rates point which the honourable gentleman raised in his question. As I have said before-and as has the Treasurer as well-we would expect the banks to pass through interest rate cuts as rapidly as possible to all their customers. That includes small business customers as well as those taking out home loans. Voluntary Student Unionism",73
121,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Sport and Minister for Youth. What action has the government taken to restore student amenities and representation on university campuses across Australia? What has been the response to this announcement?,73
122,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. I know that some students at Newcastle university whom she represents made very clear to us the urgency that they see in undoing the damage caused by the legislation put forward by the previous government. I also note that we have now heard a number of very divided and differing positions put forward by the coalition on this particular issue. I recognise that we do have some ideological extremists on the other side of the House when it comes to this particular issue, but I would like to assure all that we are advocating a reasonable, balanced and sustainable new way forward to ensure the quality of our universities. Earlier this year I conducted consultations right around the country and heard first hand of the devastating impact of the VSU legislation and the fact that it was students themselves who were paying the price for this extreme legislation put forward by the previous government. I will inform the House of what I learnt. I learnt that $170 million was ripped from our campuses and that the impacts were both immediate and extreme. We heard how it was students who were paying directly. We heard that childcare centres had been closed, that childcare subsidies had been slashed and that this had led to increases in fees-for example, $68 a week at La Trobe University and $800 a year at US in increases in childcare fees alone. We heard that sporting clubs were hit by big drops in participation as a result of them having to massively increase their fees. We heard that parking fees at Monash University, as one more example, rose from $80 a year up to $280 a year for one student. We heard of massive price increases in catering services and the closure of health, welfare, legal, accommodation and counselling services. But it was not just directly that students were paying; students were paying indirectly. We heard that a number of universities were being forced to move resources out of teaching and research budgets into propping up student services. We also heard from a number of universities that they were very concerned about their ability to continue to attract overseas students if they did not have services on campus. So last week we announced a new way forward. Those opposite might choose to keep fighting the same old battles of the past but we are announcing a new way forward. Under this announcement, from 2010, all universities in Australia will be required to meet basic benchmarks on access to information and basic services as a condition of their Commonwealth funding. Additionally, they will be required to meet representation protocols on every campus across Australia regardless of whether or not they choose to introduce the fee. On top of this, we will give universities a choice of introducing a fee which will be capped at $250 and accompanied by a HECS style deferred payment loan system. This fee, if introduced, can then be spent on further amenities within very strict guidelines. These guidelines will not allow for the funds to be spent on broad political campaigns such as we have seen in the past. It is universities who will be held accountable for ensuring that these guidelines are strictly adhered to. Those opposite should note that we have absolutely no intention of returning to compulsory student unionism. In fact, we are moving forward. We will not be amending the section of the legislation which outlaws a university forcing any student to be a member of an organisation. We have outlined a balanced, responsible and new way forward.",73

124,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And decisive-thank you, members opposite! We are pleased to have received many positive responses from the university sector. While the coalition might be divided on this, I would like to share some of the responses that we have heard from others.

126,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, we have heard a number of positive responses and I would like to share them. The Group of Eight universities called it a ‘sensible compromise'. We heard from Universities Australia, who said: Universities have struggled … to prop up essential student services through cross-subsidisation from other parts of already stretched university budgets … We heard from Australian University Sport, who stated that sport has been an innocent victim and that participation numbers had been hit hard. And we heard from the very reasonable member for New England, who noted that, under the previous government's legislation, the baby had been thrown out with the bath water, which is absolutely true. But I can assure the member for New England and others that what we are offering is a balanced, responsible and sensible way forward to ensure that our universities remain world-class institutions with services and representation. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am all for preventing babies being thrown out of any baths, but it is really important that we try to get the answers down below six minutes. This has been going over six minutes.",75

NA (EDUCATION REFUND) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.",76
144,Mr NEUMANN,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The to member for Pearce talked about a number of things in this debate. She talked about little observable action in the last few years. She talked about the fact that there were plenty of reports and recommendations, but one wonders whether in fact she was present during the years of the Howard government. Indeed, after 12 years of the Howard government, there were 24 reports into education and 220 recommendations but not much to show for them. That is why the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is so important. The legacy of the Howard government is so tragic for the education of the youth of our country. We have no national teaching standards, no national curriculum, too many children leaving school too soon, too many children incapable of basic numeracy and literacy, and 6.5 million Australians with no post-school qualifications. The 2006 OECD study shows that Australia's average performance in reading literacy worsened between 2003 and 2006, primarily because of the decline in the percentage of highperforming students and a tail in underperformance linked to disadvantage. It showed that in scientific literacy 40 per cent of Australia's Indigenous students, 27 per cent of students from remote schools and 23 per cent of students from the lowest socio-economic quartile performed below OECD baselines. And we do have, by OECD standards, relatively low levels of year-12 education completion. During the 1980s and the early 1990s we saw a doubling of our retention rate for the completion of high school, but that flatlined during the Howard government. Since 1992 we have seen around 75 per cent of students completing high school, according to the ABS schools Australia statistics of 2007. Thirty per cent fewer Indigenous young people reach year-12 qualification as opposed to non-Indigenous young people. So we have seen a tragic legacy. Having no national curriculum has made a big impact in my electorate. We have 80,000 families moving across state borders and we see about 5,000 military families in a situation where they do not experience consistency in terms of what is being taught to their children. And many of them live in my electorate of Blair, which has the largest military base in the country, at Amberley. I note that the Defence Families of Australia association has come out recently and commended the Rudd Labor government for its proposal of a national curriculum. The bill which is before us today is part the education revolution of the Rudd Labor government. As the Treasurer said in his second reading speech on 25 September this year, education is the engine room of prosperity, and it helps create a fairer, more ductive society. This bill is also about buildhas ing prosperity and spreading opportunity. It is a key part of our education revolution. It will help meet the needs and the costs of children's education in my electorate of Blair and it will help parents to allow their children to fulfil their educational expectations and advance to the best of their respective abilities. The budget included $4.4 billion to create a new education tax refund. This is a refundable tax offset of 50 per cent of eligible education expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary school studies. About 1.3 million families-about 2.7 million students-will be eligible for the refund. My electorate and others will see families in private schools and in public schools benefit. It is not about the old, antiquated notions of providing for one system over the other; it is about helping children who attend private schools and children who attend public schools to get the best education possible. For primary school children, it will allow eligible families to claim 50 per cent of eligible education expenses-up to $750 for each child, providing a maximum tax offset of $375 per child per year. For children undertaking secondary school studies, families will be able to claim 50 per cent of their eligible expenses up to $1,500 per child-being a maximum tax offset of $750 per child per year. Parents and others entitled to family tax benefit part A who have children undertaking primary or secondary school studies will be eligible for the education tax refund. Students living independently from their parents are also eligible for the education tax refund. The tax offset will apply to eligible of expenses incurred from 1 July 2008. This is an important initiative to improve our productivity and our participation in education, to build prosperity and to eliminate, as much as we possibly can, educational disadvanprotage. It is the Rudd Labor government which seen fit to take on this task. So much was said by the Howard government in relation to educational standards, values and attainment, but precious little was done in real terms to assist the young people of this country to achieve their full potential. The Rudd government is determined to ensure that the Australian populace is as highly educated and skilled as possible. Education empowers. It gives people opportunity. It builds up individuals. It assists families. It creates a more just and fair society. It is crucial in ensuring that our human capital achieves its latent skill and talent potential. Education is not about the philosophy of the Left or the Right. It is about both. It is about economic growth and it is about social justice. The education revolution that we talk about is about building a stronger Australian economy and a fairer Australia. It should be our aspiration to make our schools cathedrals-cathedrals of learning and opportunity. It should be our desire to ensure that our children want to attend those institutions because they provide the technology, the facilities, the structure, the sporting equipment and the cultural advantage that will enable our children to prosper in education, sports and the arts. Too often we have heard the arguments of the past. We heard arguments by the previous government, which vilified public school teachers, public schools and state governments in every part-from Western Australia to Queensland-about what they did and did not do. It is a sad fact that poor educational levels seem to go hand-in-glove with intergenerational poverty and disengagement from society and civic responsibility. People who are better educated are less likely to commit crimes. People who are better educated have higher self-esteem. They desire to provide for their families, they desire to provide for themselves and they desire to provide for communities and for our country. That is what this bill is about. This about providing assistance to families. Under the Howard government, nothing much was done in this area. The Howard government talked a lot but delivered little. One wonders whether in the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th or 17th year of their legacy they would have done things, but we will never know. Fortunately, on 24 November of last year the people of Australia decided to vote for an education revolution. This government is putting huge amounts of resources into schools and into assisting families, and that is what this bill is about. The current budget provides that a record $9 billion will be provided to our school system in this country. We will see an increase in funding of 5.5 per cent over 2007 in assistance to state schools and students, and an increase in funding of 3.7 per cent over 2007 in assistance to non-government schools. We saw too much blame, too much vilification and too much denigration from the previous government when it came to dealing with the states. Through the Council of Australian Governments, we are working to settle arrangements to ensure that our digital education revolution, our national curriculum and the rolling out of our trade training centres will be completed. Our national plan on literacy and numeracy will commence in early 2009. This bill is about improving our education standards and improving the quality of teaching. I have many teachers in my family and many friends who are teachers. It is about rewarding them and others, and it is about providing that our teachers and their students have the best outcomes. In terms of teaching, it is about ensuring that teachers of the highest calibre are recruited and are paid accordingly. We should look at which schools are disadvantaged and which are not. We should measure our school performance. It is critical that we ensure that the parents of students in bill is our schools have as much information as possible about the performance of their children and the schools. In my opinion, public reporting of schools is necessary. But we should not forget the disadvantaged school communities. Sadly, in my electorate of Blair most of those seem to be in the public sector. We should end the idea of one local school being pitted against another. We should end underfunding in both the public and the private system in this country. The Rudd Labor government is committed to a digital education revolution. We are putting $1.2 billion into that revolution. Already $116 million has been handed over to the states to purchase 116,000 computers. My electorate has benefited from the trade training centres in secondary schools through the $2.5 billion policy of the Rudd Labor government. In July this year the government announced that 34 projects involving more than 100 secondary schools and worth more than $90 million had been funded in round 1. I am pleased to say that three schools in my electorate, with St Edmunds Boys College being the lead school, will create the Ipswich Trade Training Centre, and nearly $3 million will be given in that regard. The two grammar schools in Ipswich, Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School, joined with St Eddies in making application for funding. I am pleased to say that that funding is being delivered. Brendan Lawler, the Principal of St Edmunds Boys College, and Wayne Sessarago should be commended for the fine work that they have done in making application and advocating further for the school. But that particular school is undertaking some additional applications for funding. The Local Schools Working Together initiative, which will provide $62.5 million over four years to construct shared facilities between government and non-government schools, is also in their sights. I commend them for the efforts they are making. They are doing this in partnership, and with the assistance of the Ipswich City Council. I commend the work they are doing in making use of what currently would be fairly useless ground on the north side of Ipswich. Just north of the Bremer River, in the Tivoli area, they are seeking redevelop that particular site with funding that they are seeking from the Rudd Labor government. It is important that we look at what we are doing for our schools locally. In my area I am pleased that the Rudd Labor government is providing $26.83 million for the relocation of the Amberley State Primary School, and I warmly welcome that funding. I ask that the Queensland government think about a name for the new school. My preferred option, as it is going to be located in Yamanto, would be the Yamanto-Amberley school, because that would ensure continuity of the name and that the historical attachment to the local school would continue. I think that would have broad community support also. But we are also doing a lot in terms of C&K and preprimary education. It is an absolute fact that under the Howard government we spent 0.1 per cent of our GDP on preprimary education compared to the OECD average of 0.5 per cent. The Rudd Labor government is committed to the creation of 260 childcare centres. We are going to create one in Ipswich, and I warmly welcome that funding. But we need to think more about what we can do to ensure that our schools are the best they can possibly be. The Deputy Prime Minister said on 24 September this year in her second reading speech in relation to the guaranteed funding over the quadrennium of $42 billion for schools and the SES model which we committed to in 2007: If this country is to succeed in the 21st century we need a schooling system which delivers excellence and equity for every child in Australia. I think that should be our goal. I think that is what we should do, because, as Access Economics has said, we can create $9 billion in wealth and growth for this country by 2040 if we can raise the level of school retention to 90 per cent. If we can give our kids the to opportunities that they deserve and they need, we can create an economically prosperous country that can be of benefit not only to us but also to our neighbours and that can take something akin to the good Samaritan type approach to our neighbours which, unfortunately, do not have the kind of prosperity that we have. We can also ensure that at home, here in this country, our kids can get the best opportunity possible to fulfil their potential and that we do what we can to ensure our children can be everything we hope them to be and everything they aspire to be. For that reason, I commend the bill to the House.",76
145,Mrs MOYLAN,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave-Prior to question time. I was giving some insight into the coalition's record on education, because it has come under considerable criticism. The coalition invested significantly in education both in the public sector and the private sector. I was listening with interest to the member for Blair because I agree with his comments that we should not be talking about one system against another and pitting one educational institution against another. What we should be about is making sure that parents are supported to send their children to school and that children and young people are supported to achieve the best that they can. When we were in government, we increased the funding after we had paid off Labor's massive debt in 2004. And thank goodness we did, because it is that surplus that will now sustain us over this period of financial turmoil. There is no doubt. It is on the record that the coalition government invested a considerable amount of money in education. For the record, between 1996 and 2007 the coalition investment in all schools increased by 172 per cent. In real terms, the coalition also increased assistance to by more than $6 billion. One of the most important and welcome initiatives implemented by the coalition was the Investing in Our Schools Program. This was very much welcomed by many schools in the Pearce electorate and many of them are disappointed that it will not continue. It was attractive because it gave the school communities an opportunity to decide what the priorities were for expenditure in their school and to apply for the funding. It also picked up many of the deficiencies in the state system. Many of the government schools in my electorate were funded under this program for very basic infrastructure which had been neglected for years by the state Labor government. For example, Ellenbrook Primary School badly needed music and drama facilities. This was not a priority for the state Labor government, who had primary responsibility for funding school facilities. It was the federal coalition government that funded this facility worth $122,100. Even basic things like floor coverings and an assembly area had to be funded under the coalition's Investing in Our Schools Program at the outer metropolitan school of Gidgegannup. I could go on. There is a very long list here. Darlington Primary School funded an outdoor learning area and the Quinns Rocks Primary School funded library resources. These were the kinds of things that ought to have been funded by the state government but were not funded, and if it had not been for the federal coalition government's Investing in Our Schools Program they would not be funded today. As I said, I have a very substantial list of government schools in my electorate that had basic projects funded through this particular program. Importantly, it was the school community who decided what the priorities were for the development of their school facilities. Little country schools and large families government suburban schools-some in lower income areas-all shared in tens of thousands of dollars of funding for projects they chose through this coalition government program, and it was a sad day when the government rejected it. There has been constant criticism about the coalition's so-called neglect of government schools, but in my electorate many more government schools received funding through Investing in Our Schools than did private schools. We may not have had a revolution, but the coalition delivered that urgently needed funding to schools and supported parents to invest in their children's future by giving them more opportunities and choices in education. We gave real support to parents by giving them a say in how they invested in their children's education. The coalition want to give the youth of Australia the best opportunity to fulfil their potential and to reach their aspiraelection. tions, and we want to encourage them to be the best that they can be. Before closing, I pay tribute to the many teachers, the school principals and the school communities-particularly the P&F organisations-throughout the electorate of Pearce. I try to get around and visit as many schools as possible and, for the most part, I see very dedicated people within these school communities working hard to ensure that the best education is delivered to the children in their care. While any funding for education should be supported, and we certainly support this funding, the fact is that this particular program that we are debating today through the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is just a token gesture. It is a way for the Rudd government to cover up the gap in the ‘computer for every student' policy, which it did not really properly think through. It ignores the fees that families pay to schools and the contributions they have to make for their students' education; it ignores the cost of uniforms; it ignores the extra tuition that many children need in core subjects and the additional classes they take to develop their ability; it ignores the realities of buying a computer, such as the real cost and the unlikelihood of buying a new computer every year; it does not cover all families and children; and it certainly does not cover early childhood education, which was one of the areas that the proposal under our government did cover. So it is a great pity that there is not greater flexibility in the provisions of this bill.",80
146,Mrs MIRABELLA,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. In speaking on this bill, I need to point out that the government's bill is significantly less comprehensive than the policy taken to the Australian people by the coalition at the last federal Labor have promised so much but, sadly, delivered very little. They promised a revolution, but there has been nothing revolutionary so far. The fact is that their education revolution measures have been paid for by getting rid of existing programs. One need only see the cull of the former government's Investing in Our Schools Program, the abolition of the $700 reading tuition voucher and the removal of support for Australian technical colleges to see this. An education revolution is a fancy title, but not when it involves merely assigning a new name to existing education programs. On this side of the House, we do not simply rely on our own arguments. We can look at the government side to see the dispirited manner in which at least one government MP views this so-called education revolution and its rhetoric. The member for Fowler spoke on the Schools Assistance Bill and pointed out that the government's so-called revolution is a long way off and that it is hardly a revolution. This bill provides tax refunds for education expenses incurred by parents for the cost of their children's education. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 through the introduction of a refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses. The refundable tax offset will apply to expenses incurred from 1 July 2008. The coalition's broader and more comprehensive policy explicitly included items such as government and non-government school fees, uniforms, textbooks, camps, excursions, laptops, broadband connections, computer software, preschool fees and charges and extracurricular activities such as music, sport and drama. We know that many families, including many families in my own electorate, are doing it tough at the moment, and we recognise that there are at times significant costs associated with education, particularly with some of the extracurricular activities and technological requirements that are part of the life of a student today, be they in primary or in secondary school. That is why the coalition's education policy made it clear that the coalition would introduce a new refundable tax rebate of 40 per cent for education expenses, including school fees, for every student from preschool-kindergarten in some states-until the end of secondary school. The policy went on to state: … enabling parents to choose the best education for their children often requires them only their priorities but also the costs associated with educating their children. On this side of the House we will support passage of this bill, but we recognise that the legislation could be significantly improved. A good start would be for the government to have a closer look at the coalition's election policy. This is unfortunately wishful thinking, but if we are to be serious about lessening the burden of the costs associated with child raising and education then we should resolve that the base of coverage of the education expenses as part of the refundable tax offset should be as broad as possible. The coalition's plan did this, but the current legislation is much narrower. We are the party of choice. We support choice in education. We support parents' ability to make the right choices for their children. In addition to this, parents should be given far greater freedom as to how they spend their education tax refund. They should have a wide range of items covered by its scope, not the rigid, prescriptive approach that is proposed by the government through this legislation. This is apparently only one plank of the government's so-called education revolution. Thus far it has been underwhelming to say the very least. We expect more from the government that promised so much in this area but that at the moment is appearing to renege on its promises, be it with the botched handling of the computers in schools program, the cessation of Investing in Our Schools or the flight away from Australian technical colleges-the list could go on. On this side of the House we acknowledge that this bill could be better, but we support the concept of helping parents with the costs of education and the fact that this policy is in some way similar to that outlined by the coalition at the last election to juggle not but leaves us wanting.",81
147,Ms KING,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008, which follows through on one of the government's key election promises, improving our education system. In the 2007-08 budget, the Rudd government announced $4.4 billion to create an education tax refund. This commitment recognises that many families are battling with the high costs of living and seeks to lift some of the burden by way of a tax refund for education expenses. It also forms part of the government's commitment to improving access to education and recognises the important role access to technology plays in ensuring that young people have equal education opportunities. Education is central to the nation's prosperity, and it is vital that we have a highly skilled and educated workforce heading into the future. It is absolutely vital that action taken now to ensure our future prosperity, and the Rudd government is taking action. The Rudd government has already been working hard to implement its education plans. An important part of the government's education plans was our election commitment to invest $2.5 billion over 10 years in trade training centres in schools. Round 2 of our Trade Training Centres in Schools Program is already underway, and these training centres will go a long way towards addressing the skill shortage in traditional trades this nation faces. Also, as part of our education plans, we announced during the election our National Secondary School Computer Fund. In my electorate we have already seen round 1 of this program provide funds for 545 new computers for local schools Damascus College, Bacchus Marsh Grammar and Ballarat Christian College-schools that met the criteria of being highly in need in terms of their computer to student ratio. Round 2 applications are currently being reviewed. This is an important investment for students in my electorate. The Rudd government is also investing $62.5 million over three years in the Local Schools Working Together program. I was pleased to discuss this program with a number of schools in my electorate, with the lead school, Sebastopol Secondary College, applying for funds for shared infrastructure. All of these programs are on top of our commitments to early childhood education, providing preschool education of 15 hours per week to every four-year-old. I stand here today very proud to say that I am part of a government that is getting the job done, making good on election promises and taking steps to improve education for our future leaders at the same time as providing tax relief for families. Funding a child's education is not cheap, and I recognise that many families are under financial strain. be Those financial costs are particularly evident after Christmas and during the Christmas school holidays, when families need to start forking out for education costs for the start of a new school year. Money for textbooks, stationery and new software programs or, in some instances, new computers has to be found. Throughout the year, the ongoing costs of internet connection are another strain on the family budget. This bill goes a long way towards providing relief to hard working families who are struggling to pay that their household expenses. Rising petrol prices, mortgage repayments and grocery bills all add up and can leave families wondering how they will fund another essential family commitment, such as their children's education. It is particularly important in times like today, when we are in the midst of a global financial crisis, that we continue to focus and provide relief to families. We have seen the government dedicate $10.4 billion of the budget surplus through the Economic Security Strategy to assist those Australians who need it most. My office has been flooded with calls from pensioners and families who can now look forward to some much-needed relief before Christmas. The Economic Security Strategy, alongside this bill, demonstrates just how committed we as a government are to helping families deal with the cost of living. The tax laws amendment bill introduces the education tax refund. Under this proposal, parents with children in primary and secondary school will be able to claim a tax refund rebate of 50 per cent of eligible education expenses, such as computers, stationery and textbooks. Parents with primary school aged children are entitled to a 50 per cent refund up to $750 per child, and parents with secondary school aged children are entitled to a 50 per cent refund up to $1,500 per child. This refund will provide parents with refunds of up to $375 per primary school student and $750 per secondary school student. The bill will provide relief to approximately 1.3 million families across Australia and around 2.7 million students attending school. The education tax refund is active now. Eligible parents can receive the tax rebate from 1 July 2009. It is important that parents, if they have not started to do so already, from now on save their receipts relating to the purchase or hire of eligible expenses so they can receive the maximum benefit of their next tax refund. I cannot erate enough the importance of retaining these receipts. Without them, parents will not be entitled to reap the benefits this bill, which allows for parents putting children through primary or secondary school education. In addition to the education tax refund, additional amendments will be made so that Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office can share data relating to education tax refund recipients. This will enable the tax office to administer and monitor the take-up rate of the refund amongst Australian families. All parents who receive family tax benefit part A will be eligible for the refund. ents whose child or children receive payments or allowances such as youth allowance, the disability support pension and Abstudy living allowance, and who would otherwise be eligible for family tax benefit part A, are also eligible for the education tax refund. Those families who have shared care arrangements in place and are eligible for family tax benefit part A or who share receipt of family tax benefit part A will share the education tax refund, just as they share the family tax benefit part A. Those families in similar circumstances who receive other payments and are eligible will enter into a similar arrangement for sharing of the education tax refund. The bill also benefits families with home schooled students. Provided that student is registered with the relevant state or territory authority, families with home schooled children can benefit from the refund, as can school children who are independent of their parents. Families with children who are transitioning from primary to secondary school in a single financial year will be able to claim the full 50 per cent tax offset-that is, the full $750 education tax refund available to secondary school students for that financial year. Families with students who comreitmence school or complete school in a school year can claim half of the full 12-month amount of the education tax refund for that financial year for the six-month period in which the child attended school. That is a refund of $187.50 for half a year's primary school education and $350 for half a year's secondary school education. The bill is in no way limited to one child per family. Parents can receive the full benefits for each child, regardless of whether they are primary or secondary school aged. The bill really does cater for all kinds of Australian families. Under the Rudd government's plan, parents will be able to claim refunds for a variParety of education expenses. Recognising the central role that information technology plays in education, students and parents will be able to claim the cost of laptops, home computers, home internet connections, printers, printing paper and education software. This is on top of learning materials such as school textbooks, stationery and even tools that students in trade may use at school. The refund not only covers purchase of these items but the lease, hire or hire-purchase of those items as well. The government understands that not every working Australian family can afford to purchase a laptop at the drop of a hat. By including lease, hire and hire-purchase options in the refund, these families have options available to them to provide education tools to their children, whilst still being able to receive maximum tax offsets as a result of this bill. The bill is another incentive for parents to ensure that their children are equipped with all of the learning tools they need to complete their schooling to the ity. Access to technology is vital in breaking down socio-economic barriers. This measure, alongside the government's computers in schools program, is aimed squarely at ensuring that all students, regardless of their ground, have equal opportunities to access learning through technology. All the evidence shows that access to information technology can break down socio-economic disadvantage and provide a significant advantage to children's learning. It is no coincidence that the country's more well-off schools have invested significantly in information technology and in information technology learning environments. As I touched on earlier, the introduction of this bill will see parents benefit from the bate from 1 July next year. Parents can make their first claims from 1 July 2009 for the 2008-09 financial year. I reiterate what I said earlier-that is, I urge all parents, both in my electorate and across the country, to make sure they retain every receipt relating to items that can be claimed under this refund. If parents are not doing so already, they really must start keeping receipts now so they can obtain maximum benefits from this education refund come tax time. I encourage parents eligible for tax benefit part A to their receipts in a safe place; I know it is something I often neglect to do. Every time parents purchase a new school textbook or need to replenish their schoolchildren's stationery supplies, if they purchase a computer or learning software or they pay their internet connection bills-all of these receipts should be stored away ready for tax time. For those parents and independent school students who do not pay tax and are not required to lodge a tax return, it is still essential that they too retain all eligible educational receipts. Their entitlements will still be refunded through the Australian tax office by completing a separate form at the end of the 2008-09 fibest of their abilnancial year. In my electorate we have over 40 primary and secondary schools, servicing more than 24,000 students. I certainly hope that the parents of these 24,000 students are assisted backthrough this bill. My community constantly tells me how difficult it can be to make ends meet in tough times such as those we are experiencing at the moment. Just paying the essential family expenses can be a challenge. Working families in my electorate deserve a tax break and the children in my area deserve a solid education. This bill meets both needs. It provides a cash rebate to families who are working extremely hard to provide the best possible foundation for their children's education. It is a way to acknowledge the comre- mitment of these families to their children's education and to their futures. It helps to ease the financial burden and make it easier for parents to afford to invest in their children's education through purchases of what can be expensive learning resources such as computers, education programs and textbooks. Looking at a child's schooling years from prep through to year 12, the refund has the potential to provide a very large cost saving for families. Parents who receive the full refund for one child during their primary store school years-that is, prep to grade 6-will receive a maximum $2,625 refund from the government. That is $2,625 in assistance from the government to help cover the expenses associated with putting one child through primary school education. The total maximum education tax refund parents can receive under this bill for one child during their secondary school education is $4,500. Overall, this government is committing over $7,125 to help fund a child's education through primary and secondary school with the education refund. Just imagine what a difference that extra money will make to the average family. There will be more than $7,000 put back in their pockets over the 13 years of a child's education. And, as we know, most families are not just sole-child families. If a family has more than one child and meets the eligibility requirements of this bill, their refund can move into the tens of thousands of dollars-to over $14,000 for families placing two children through their entire schooling education and to over $21,000 for families with three childrenfreeing families to dedicate that funding to other much needed areas of the family budget. This is a fundamentally important bill for our families and for the children in this counducing try. It is another way that the government is investing now in our future and it is another demonstration of our wholehearted commitment to the education plans that we have in place and that we have promised across the country. The bill is another demonstration from the government of our commitment to working families, to assist with education costs and to help, through them, to shape our nation's future. Putting children through school is an expensive exercise, and the refund will go a long way to helping parents provide appropriate resources to fund their children's education by helping to fund the learning resources they require in the classroom, such as textbooks and stationery, as well as helping to fund the learning resources they need at home to complete their work effectively, such as computers and the internet. The government has allocated $4.4 billion to the refund over the next four years. It is significant investment in this country's future. It will help us as a nation to grow and prosper and will help ease the financial pressures placed on our families. These rebates provide a significant cost saving to families. The government believes that better education is pivotal to our society and providing better access to that education is pivotal to our children's future. The bill is helping to ensure that our leaders of tomorrow are harnessed through their education and afforded every academic opportunity, regardless of their background, in order for them to do so. I commend the bill to the House.",82
148,Mr BRIGGS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008, the thrust of which I support. This is a bill which comes out of a promise made during the last year's election campaign and what was a battle of tit-for-tat on several major policy areas. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 by introa 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses, the education tax refund, up to a maximum of $750 for children undertaking primary studies and $1,500 for children undertaking secondary studies. As I understand it, it is for families who get family tax benefit A. The bill limits eligible education expenses to laptops, home computers and associated costs, computer related equipment such as printers and disability aids, home internet connections, computer software, school textbooks and other paper based school learning material and tools of trade as prescribed by the course. It is a promise which does go a long way to helping those Australians who want to give their children the best chance at the start of their lives. Of course, in our country we are very fortunate to have a very strong education system. It is something our country should be very proud of. It gives people an opportunity a to do better, to grow, and to make the dream of their parents for them to live a better ity life than theirs come true. It is something that I think both sides of this House support. I listened earlier to the member for Blair, who talked about the importance of education, and I support his comments absolutely. But I think we need to look at the history of how this bill has come into being, and to do that we need to go back to 1996. We hear a lot from the other side about what we allegedly did or did not do for education when this side of the House was in government. We must understand that this $4.4 billion over four years could not have been delivered in 1996 because on coming to government in 1996 we found that there was $96 billion of debt. There was a $10 billion budget deficit. The hard work that was done between 1996 and 2007 has allowed a promise like this to be made, which is a good thing for our country. It is a good thing for Australian families that the government can assist with education expenses, and it is something I support. But it is based on the legacy of the hard economic decisions that were made in 1996 and the years that followed. If those hard decisions had not been made, this bill could not have been implemented. That is just a simple fact. Balanced budgets with surpluses and $60 billion in savings in the Future Fund is a legacy which has allowed these types of investments to be made. So it is really to the credit of the mer government, the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer, that we are in the position that we can have a bill such as this today. This bill came out of the last election campaign, as I mentioned earlier. It was a version of a policy that was announced by the coalition. Unfortunately it is an inferior version of a policy that was announced by the coalition. Our policy was universal; it was not limited. Our policy also includedand this is a very important pointqualgovernment and non-government school fees, preschool fees and expenses. Preschool is often forgotten in the education debate. We focus much in this place on university education, and the Labor Party focuses very much on school retention rates because it suits their state premiers to have that debate. But we do not focus on the building blocks of education, those early years. I have a very strong view that we need to do more as a federal parliament in this space. It is an area that has been neglected by state governments for years. It is an area which has suffered under the maladministration which is occurring in many of our states today. It is an area where increasingly the federal government will have to step up to the plate. Our policy also included important items such as school uniforms, textbooks, stationery, calculators, and camps and excursionscamps like the school from my electorate which came to visit Parliament House today to enjoy and understand what we do here, a great opportunity for young people to understand how our democracy works. Camps and excursions can teach much more than can be learned in the classroom. Being in this place, being in the Senate and doing a tour of this place is much better than reading about it in a classroom or being told about it by a teacher or, indeed, a politician. Being in this place can teach so much more. So our policy for- included camps and excursions. It also included laptops, broadband and software, and extracurricular school activities such as sport, music, dance and drama. I am on the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing in this place and we are looking at obesity at the present time. One of the things that has struck me in this committee inquiry is the lack of opportunity for school kids now-and primary school kids in particular-to do physical education, to get outside the classroom and to have a run around like we enjoyed when we were kids. There are many reasons for that. I think that largely there have been mistakes of policy in the past, that a focus has been taken off these extracurricular activities encouraging kids to get outside, to get away from the TV and, dare I say, the internet and to actually undertake a game of footy or netball or some other sort of physical activity and run around each day so they can get enjoyment out of being outside. Equally, it is the case with other important things like dance, music and drama. Our policy had a slightly smaller amount of $800 annually for each student but it covered a broader field. It was not restricted to those on family tax benefit A. Where we are critical of Labor's policy in this respect or in this bill is that it only covers a small cost computer. It does nothing to address the basics of a good education to support families with the real day-today costs of schooling, such as school fees and those camps and excursions that too many kids have to miss out on because they cannot afford to pay for them. I think that school fees is the biggest area of mistake in this bill. School fees are so important not just in the non-government sector but also in the government sector. I spoke to a couple of principals of public schools, not of private schools, in my electorate last week. I will not name them for fear of reprisal from the state education minister.",86
149,Dr EMERSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Grow up!,88
150,Mr BRIGGS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Sorry, Dr Emerson, the schools are extraordinarily concerned about the treatment they are getting from the state education departments.",88
151,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! I would just like to remind the honourable member that he ought to refer to the minister by his title and not by his name.,88
152,Mr BRIGGS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Quite correct, Mr Deputy Speaker. School fees are an important part of the funds. For instance, one of the schools, a public school, I spoke to has had to write off $30,000 of school fee debt because it has got no capacity to get the parents to pay. In the past public schools were able to keep any surplus funds they had and earn the interest off those surplus funds. The state Treasurer has decided in South Australia to take all those funds back into recurrent funding. That is a disgrace. That is penny-pinching at its worse and it is mean. It does not do our education system any good at all. So I think that a mistake in this bill is in the fact that it leaves out school fees. That extra $30,000 in this small school in my electorate could do so much more. It could do so much for these of a young kids to give them a chance and a better education. It could give them so much more one-on-one learning time with their teachers and more access to an opportunity in life, and that is of course what Australia stands for. The great ideal of Australia is that you get as much opportunity as presents. So I think that this is a good bill because it does do something about helping families, and it does so because the federal government is in the position to be able to do so as it has inherited a very strong budget position. It has inherited a surplus. It has inherited massive savings in the Future Fund. This is a situation we did not have 12 years ago. This bill could never have been implemented 12 years ago. We should never forget the legacy that has come about for this bill. But it has some flaws, and they are flaws that I urge the other side to consider, including school fees. They are an important aspect. They will give an extra funding boost for those schools, particularly public schools, that need that extra assistance. The other thing I will say about those struggling state schools is that one of the programs in the Howard government which helped those state schools enormously was the Investing in Our Schools Program. So many schools have made this point to me: those small capital grants help because they build the next bit of infrastructure-the new classroom, the installation of the air conditioning. Last year a small school in my electorate received $128 in capital funding from the state government. That is probably three chairs or a desk; it is not good enough. The Investing in Our Schools Program gave those small schools the opportunity to apply for capital grants which allowed them to build new buildings or put in air-conditioning or heating systems; they allowed the school to progress. One of the schools I visited last week would not show me the back of their school because it is all made up of temporary buildings. The principal described the science lab as something ‘out of the 1960s'. That is not helping our country become smarter or to do better. I genuinely think we need to look at the funding structure of both private and public schools in our country. We have a significant problem at the state level with the amount of money that is being put into public schools. Those on the other side will view that as a partisan comment-it is not designed to be. The federal government may have to do more to step up to this plate and the Investing in Our Schools Program was an example of that. Funding has just not been handed over to these small schools-or to larger public schools, for that matter. They are ting their recurrent funding-arguably not enough-to do what they need to do but they are not getting the one-offs to rebuild buildings, to install the new infrastructure, to make the investment for the future so the learning facilities are high class. That is where we have a problem in our country with education. As I said earlier, I also think that we need to do more for preschools and early childhood education. I declare a conflict in this matter: I have two young children under three who are coming into this age group. The amount our two-year-old grows and learns every day is something to behold. Clearly, that is when the best education can occur. Clearly, that is when kids pick up the most and where the foundation of their educational life begins. We focus very much on the higher end, the university sector, in this place. We heard an answer to a question today about a university amenities fee and so forth, but where we err is that as a country we do not focus enough on early childhood education. I am sure the other side will jump up and say: ‘You didn't do anything in 12 years. The Howard government just ignored education. We have dropped down in all the statistics.' I can rebut and say, ‘Well, the state governments have not done enough,' but that is not getting the problem fixed. We genuinely need to look at this area because this will help our country grow. This will help our country get smarter and our kids to do better. Not every child going through school will end up in university-indeed we do not want that. But we need to identify those kids early and give them a better chance, and we can only do that by increasing the funding base. We can only do that by investing in the skills of those people who care for our children in those early years of life. We know by legend that the best time to teach a child a second get- language is in their early years. It makes complete sense that they learn the most in those early years. I urge the federal government to consider including in this bill preschool fees as well as government and non-government school fees. I think it would make a huge difference, particularly to those parents on the edge, particularly those parents who live in socio-economic areas where they just cannot afford to pay the public school fees. That of course has a flow-on effect to the public schools because they do not have that revenue stream. That is an important aspect. Sure, internet and broadband are very important, and having computers is very important, but we can do more with this money. We can give parents that choice. It should not just focused on one small area of education. Education is not all about laptops and broadband connections. I am sure that those on the other side will agree with that, and I do not think for a moment that they are suggesting it is. A broad education is about so much more. It is about learning our history, which we should do in this country-and tomorrow is a wonderful opportunity to reflect on our history. It is about coming to Canberra and seeing our parliament at work. It is about respecting our institutions and so forth. And these are things that you cannot do just by having a laptop computer or a broadband connection at home. These are things that families struggle to pay for these days. In the coming six months, 12 months or two years as our economy slows and we have fewer jobs, higher unemployment and more people in small business who are struggling-as I am sure the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy understands-and as the financial crisis has its effect on the economy, we should do more for those families to help them give their children the best opportunity in education that we can. We should be very proud of our country and the opportunities that young people get but we can always do more. We should do more. I said in my maiden speech that I thought the area of education would be a challenging one going forward into the future. Those countries that we have always had an advantage over, those countries that are developing, have learnt from us. One of the great books of all time, I think, is Thomas Friedman's The World is Flat. He talks in there about the power of education and how the developing countries, particularly India and China, have learnt so much about our education systems in the past and have adapted to our ways and are now arguably ahead of us. So one of our great challenges be as a nation is to get our education system right. We need to do that through looking at the base or the building block, which is early childhood, and fund that properly. We need to have a properly funded primary education system as well. Of course, we need to have good and strong learning institutions at the tertiary level. Where I think government has failed over the last 10 or 20 years-and I include both sides of politics in this-is that not enough focus has been put on those in the preschool area. We need to do more in that area for the building blocks of our education system. This bill would be a good way to start that. This bill would be a good opportunity for those parents who choose to use it to send their kids to the preschool that might just be out of reach at the moment-the preschool that will give them that extra chance, that extra step. I do urge the government to consider those comments. I largely support the aims of this bill, with those criticisms that I have made. I also urge real the government to rethink the Investing in Our Schools Program, simply because the capital investments that particularly those small primary schools get make a real and genuine difference to the learning outcomes of those young Australians that we seek to help and to give an opportunity in life.",88
153,Mr TREVOR,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 and it is with a great sense of pride that I do so. The bill is designed to amend the existing Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 by introducing a refundable tax offset for eligible parents or carers who are faced with the cost of providing educational material for a child or children in their care. This bill introduces for the first time the notion of a tax offset for mate education expenses to reduce the tax liability of the taxpayer. I personally feel this bill is at the very heart of the government's agenda of investing in education and making life easier for working Australians. The bill aims to introduce a 50 per cent education tax refund set at two distinct limits: one for pupils enrolled in primary school studies and the other for students enrolled in recognised secondary school studies. The primary school limit will see eligible parents or guardians able to claim a 50 per cent refundable tax offset each year, up to an amount of $750 per year per child for eligible education expenses. This would see an amount of up to $375 per year per child refunded back to parents or caregivers. The secondary school limit will be set at $1,500 and will also be a 50 per cent refundable tax offset, which would see up to $750 per year per child refunded back to Australian parents or guardians. The method behind the two distinctly different refund amounts is in recognition of the different cost burden between a primary-school-age child and a secondaryschool-age child, with the latter being, in general terms, more costly. As a member with five children, all of varying ages-now with some off my hands, thankfully-I can certainly agree that, as a child gets older, their education and the resources they need to complete their education do become more expensive. For those whose children also play sport, that additional burden or cost is often prohibitive, though it should never be. Perhaps my government could look at this aspect of cost to parents-namely, the rising cost of playing sport-from a tax deductibility point of view down the track. In addition, I take the point of the member for Mayo, Mr Briggs, in relation to the investing in our",90
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am loath to interrupt the honourable member, but he ought to refer to the that honourable member by his electorate, not by his name. I did draw the attention of the honourable member for Mayo to the same standing order.",91
155,Mr TREVOR,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"In addition, I take the point that the member for Mayo raised in relation to the Investing in Our Schools Program and I agree with him on a bipartisan approach. I have travelled extensively throughout my electorate over the last couple of months and have seen some wonderful projects that have been delivered under the Investing in Our Schools Program. Unfortunately, the former Prime Minister of Australia Mr John Howard was not going to continue the program. From what I have seen in my electorate, it was indeed a good program. What constitutes an eligible family for the purposes of this bill? The bill states that to be eligible for the education tax refund a family must be receiving or eligible to receive the family tax benefit part A. This is the defining criteria as to whether or not a family is eligible to claim for the education tax refund. However, the bill does go into detail to further explain the eligibility requirements for families, and does state that families would also be eligible for the education tax refund if they would otherwise have been eligible for the family tax benefit part A but their child is in receipt of another prescribed payment or allowance from Centrelink, such as youth allowance, disability support pension or Abstudy, and it is this payment that has made them ineligible for family tax benefit part A. Students who are also classed as independent and who receive a payment or allowance, such as youth allowance, will also be eligible for the educational tax refund. In all these cases, in order to claim the education tax refund the claimant must have their child or children enrolled or registered in a relevant educational institution, whether it is a primary school, high school or, in the case of mature age students, enrolled in a similar course provided by such institutions as TAFE. In total it is estimated that the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 will benefit approximately 1.3 million families, with 2.7 million students fitting eligibility criteria. The bill in my opinion has also been well engineered when it comes to children in shared care arrangements with their parents. The education tax refund will be able to be shared between parents in a similar method to the existing arrangements for sharing of the family tax benefit part A. The school year and the tax year do not perfectly coincide. Many children will be in a transition from primary school to high school during any one tax year. This could no doubt lead to some confusion amongst parents with different offset amounts between the two levels of schooling. The bill in its current form clears up this confusion, thankfully, by ensuring that the education tax refund amount for a secondary school student, or the highest of the two limits, is applicable should a child transition from primary school to high school during the tax year. The bill also allows for students who may choose to leave or enter school during a school year, with half the amount of the education tax refund able to be claimed to represent the half of the financial year that they attended school. I am particularly pleased to see that the bill makes clear provision for amounts over the tax offsets maximum limit of $375 for primary students and $750 for secondary students. Expenses that parents incur above these amounts can be carried forward into the subsequent tax year. This will be particularly beneficial for families purchasing large scale items such as a laptop or a computer that will exceed the yearly threshold. It is indeed comforting to know that they will be able to access the unused amount of the educational expenses in the following tax year and fully benefit from the purpose of this bill. I am also pleased that the bill has made the provision for those who are not required by law to complete an income tax return. In this instance the amount of the tax offset that would have applied to an individual's taxable income will be paid directly to the individual. These two measures illustrate the government's thoughtful approach to the bill and thoughtful delivery of this important election commitment. I would like to take this opportunity to state that parents of students who are home schooled will also be eligible for the educational tax refund. This is fantastic news for them. In my electorate of Flynn, in outback Queensland, some students have no option but to be home schooled due to the vast distances between communities and educational facilities. I am pleased and glad that today this bill recognises them and treats them as no different than any other student attending any other school. In fact, earlier this year in my electorate, the Longreach School of Distance Education was awarded Highly Commended in the Excellence in Family-School Partnerships award at the 2008 National Awards for Quality Schooling. I am proud that these communities have not been forgotten in this bill or by my government. Having spoken on the eligibility for families under this bill, I would also like to comment on the eligibility of educational expenses to be claimed under the educational tax refund. I am pleased that the list of eligible expenses is a comprehensive list of items that supports a child's education. I am also pleased that this bill covers not only the pur- book: chase of items but also the lease, hire or hire purchase of these items, to better suit individual households and their requirements or preferences. Although it would be difficult to outline here today the many types of school related expenses that could be claimed under this bill I would like to note for the record that under the scheme some of the expenses able to be claimed include but are not limited to: laptops and computers, as well as related equipment including printers; computer software, such as word processing and spreadsheets, as well as antivirus software; school textbooks and stationery; and tools of trade. I am pleased to see not only that the initial cost of a computer is an eligible expense but also that the ongoing cost for home internet access is classed as a legitimate educational expense in this bill. I feel that worthy of special mention that the cost for disability aids or equipment to assist children with disabilities to use a computer will also be covered by this bill under the educational tax refund. No matter which way we look at it, educating a child can be an expensive exercise for a family. Costs seem to add up, with books, stationery and other equipment endlessly on the family shopping list. It has become even more expensive today with hightech and expensive computer equipment now also a requirement for a basic education. This government will not allow Australian families to be burdened by educational expenses and will not allow working families to face these costs alone. Although education can be a costly exercise it is ultimately a worthwhile and rewarding one. It is, as I have often said and continue to say, one of the greatest can give to their child. I quote from a long standing academic on economics and man in his Competitive Advantage of Nations There is little doubt that education and training are decisive in National Comparative Advantage, that is, improving the general education system is an essential priority of government and a matter of economic and not just social policy. This sentiment is echoed throughout economic literature, with study after study also finding the high rate of return from educational investment. One such study undertaken in 2005 by the Australian National University outlined that in Australia our rate of return for educational investment is around 10 per cent. A 10 per cent return on your investment is a great return, particularly when the investment is in the minds of our young Australians. The total cost of the education tax refund is estimated at $4.4 billion over the next four years. This is a substantial it is investment in education by my government and a substantial relief for working families who are battling with their children's educational expenses. I understand just how tough it is for lowincome earners in Australia to provide for the future of their children. To illustrate just how tough it is for some low-income households, the Brotherhood of St Laurence undertook an education cost survey in 2007. The results of this survey found that an alarming 72 per cent of respondents could not afford items that would improve the education experience of their child, 66 per cent did not have access to a home computer with internet access and 60 per cent had difficulty paying for books. This is certainly an alarming set of statistics and one that urgently needed to be corrected. The educational tax refund will help these low-income Australians and ease the burden that they face in simply providing for their gifts a parent children's education. As I have stated before, the cost of a child's education is now more intrusive with the addition of expensive computer equipment which is now vital to a child's success at school. Of course, families must also cater in the weekly budget for the cost of an internet connection to help with the many assignments and information-gathering tasks that schooling requires. Recent ABS data tells us that around three-quarters of Australian households have a computer at home. Unfortunately, if we look closer into this statistic we see that as many as 90 per cent of high-income earners in Australia have a computer at home but that this figure plummets to under 50 per cent of low-income households. This has been termed the ‘digital divide'-a divide between those who have access to a computer and the internet at home and those who do not. It saddens me that this divide may see some children in low-income households disadvantaged by not having access to a computer or the internet at home. The educational tax refund, thankfully, will help arrest this troubling figure. It will help break down the digital divide by supporting lowand middle-income households in receipt of family tax benefit part A with assistance to provide the educational equipment needed for their children to perform at school. Already my government has taken the first steps in our commitment to delivering an education revolution. In my electorate of Flynn, 518 new computers are to be installed in high schools as a result of round 1 of the National Secondary School Computer Fund. I look forward to the second round of funding under this scheme to be announced by the end of the year. Of course, the digital education revolution does not stop with the mere purchase of new computer equipment but will continue with the government's $100 million commitment over three years to support the provision of high-speed broadband connections to Australian primary and secondary schools as part of the Fibre Connections to Schools initiative. My government, the Rudd Labor government, is a government that believes that reliable access to the internet is not a luxury but a prerequisite for a good education and is determined to see Australian children receiving the very best in technologies by world standards. It is hoped that this bill will be able to apply from 1 July 2008. I would like to remind my constituents in Flynn that, if they are eligible for the education tax refund, they should now be keeping their receipts as evidence of educational expenses that they have incurred and to take advantage of this new tax offset when preparing their tax affairs for the 2008-09 financial year. With all the benefits that an education can bring to an individual, a family, a community and the nation as a whole, and with the Rudd government's clear commitment to an education revolution, I commend the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 to the House and congratulate the Rudd Labor government for its outstanding leadership on this issue.",91
156,Mr ZAPPIA,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I too rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. As other speakers have quite rightly said, this bill introduces a 50 per cent education tax refund aimed at assisting families with children undertaking primary or secondary school studies to meet the costs of school education through assistance with certain education expenses. This side of the House understands that one of the most important investments we can make in a child is to ensure the child is provided with a good education. It is something that I alluded to in the first speech I made in this place-the importance of education in making a difference not only to a child but to changing society generally. The education providers understand that principle, the business sector understands that, the Rudd government understands that, parents understand that and other governments around the world understand that. The only ones who do not seem to understand that education underpins opportunity are members opposite, because under their watch education standards in Australia slipped substantially when compared with other OECD countries. Study after study has confirmed that. I just want to quote from one of the most recent studies, entitled How young people are faring, which was only released a month or two ago, I believe, and was put together by Jack Dusseldorp of the Dusseldorp Skills Forum. He said: - Australia is below many other OECD countries in terms of levels of participation in education, suggesting there is room for provement. I quote that study because it is all about young people and is the most recent that I have been able to get my hands on. Within that report that was prepared by Jack Dusseldorp there are a series of graphs, which others may wish to refer to, which simply confirm our position in the international sense when it comes to education. Furthermore, one has only to look at the run-down condition of public schools throughout Australia to see just how little importance members opposite placed on education when they were in office. They offloaded their responsibility onto the private schools sector and onto the state governments. It was typical of the Howard government to starve the states of funds and then blame the states for not delivering the services or the facilities that communities needed. We saw it in the critical areas of education, health services and housing. In listening to the member for Mayo earlier on today it was interesting that we heard the same rhetoric from him in his contribution to this matter. Again, he blamed the states for any problems when it came to our education services in this country. The Howard government's idea of funding schools, I might add, was to provide them with flagpoles. In contrast, the Rudd government fully understands that education underpins a child's future prospects in life and also underpins the nation's future prosperity. Governments also have a social responsibility to bridge the gap between those in low socio-economic sectors of society and the rest of society. Education is certainly the key to doing that. Again, if I can refer to the report How young people are faring, I will quote from some of the comments made in that report about people in low socio-economic areas. It says: … about one third of young adults who have im- completed year 12 were in full-time education. This was over five times the rate for those who were early school leavers. That is the first critical point: if you were an early school leaver, you will likely not go on to full-time education. While almost 46 per cent of those from high SES backgrounds engage in full-time education, less than one-fifth from low SES origins do. Again it highlights the contrast. Furthermore, the report goes on to say: Year 12 attainment among 19 year-olds varies substantially by social background. Young people from low SES backgrounds attain Year 12 or its equivalent at a rate 26.1 percentage points lower than that of those from high SES origins. At age 24, well over one-third of those from low SES backgrounds have not completed Year 12 or equivalent, compared to about one in seven of those from high SES backgrounds. Achievement levels in school also affect attainment, and since school achievement is highly correlated with social background, policies developed to target improvements in Year 12 completion will need to address the issue of social disadvantage. Governments have a responsibility to bridge that gap between those that are in low socio-economic sectors and the rest of our society, and the Rudd government is doing that. That is why at the last election the Rudd government made education a priority in the policy announcements that were made. That is why the Rudd government committed to a number of important education policy initiatives for all of Australia. This bill provides for a 50 per cent tax fund for certain primary and secondary school expenses and is a key plank in the Rudd government's education policy reform agenda. Importantly, this bill guarantees that the children are the direct beneficiaries of tax refund because the refund is only provided after the money has been spent on the child's education needs. Under this $4.4 million proposal, as from 1 July 2008 about 1.3 million Australian families will be able to claim up to $375 for each primary school child's eligible school expenses and up to $750 for each secondary school child's eligible school expenses. These rebates will be very welcome by families around Australia, and I have no doubt that it will now make it possible for many parents to buy education resources for their children which they may have wanted to provide but did not because they could not afford the outlay. It also means that children will be more likely to have better education resources and that can only lead to better education outcomes. For students today, IT equipment has become essential to their learning and essential to the preparation of their schoolwork. It was interesting to hear the member for Flynn quote some statistics on that. For families that come from low socio-economic areas, only 50 per cent of households have a computer or access to a computer; in the high socio-economic areas, the figures for computer ownership are much higher. The Rudd government recognises that it is important to have IT equipment for children and has committed $1.2 billion over five years to provide schools with computers. But we all know that students do much of their learning and much of their schoolwork from home after hours as part of their homework, so it is just as important that parents can provide children with home computers. This bill will help parents do that. Almost without exception, the parents I re- speak to want the best education possible for their children. They understand just how important a good education is for their children's future. That is why so many parents that I know take on additional jobs and sacrithe fice their own time to ensure their children are given a good education and are able to participate in other school activities. No parent wants to see their children miss out on what their school has to offer and no parent wants to see their children do poorly because they do not have the necessary resources. I said earlier that education is the most effective way of bridging the gap between the socially disadvantaged and the rest of society and of breaking the cycle of poverty. One of the unfortunate outcomes of social inequality for all of us is that often some of our brightest and most talented children do not complete secondary education or embark on any kind of further education. Their natural ability is left untapped. Sadly, in those cases, it is not only the child but also the rest of society that misses out, because that child's intellectual talents could have been used for the benefit of others if the child had been given the educational opportunity needed. With respect to those children, I commend the schools and the teachers who, when they recognise a gifted child, do all they can to assist the child in furthering their education. I said earlier that the rundown state of our public schools is largely the result of neglect by the last coalition government. Our schools, TAFEs and universities were underfunded and under-resourced by the previous federal government. It is my view that federal governments do have a national interest and a shared responsibility in all levels of education. The Rudd government understands that and the Australian people understand that. That is why they elected the Rudd government last November, knowing full well that education was going to be one of the areas of expenditure and key policy areas of this government. The Rudd government went to the election last year talking about an education revolution, highlighting the importance of education, highlighting how Australia's education standards had slipped compared with the rest of the world and highlighting how important education is to the future prosperity of children and to the nation. Voters voted in that election knowing full well the importance that the Rudd government would place on education if it was elected. And, as we saw, voters did elect a Rudd Labor government in that election. Sadly, one of the outcomes of the coalition government's neglect of education is that parents are continually having to contribute funding for the most basic of school resources in both public and private schools. So when we talk about parents having to pay for their children's education it does not apply solely to those who send their children to private schools; today it applies as much to parents who send their children to public schools. School fundraising has become essential for schools, and inevitably that fundraising primarily comes from parents and adds to education costs. Mr Baldwin-That's why you are being real smart and cutting out the Investing in Our Schools Program!",94
157,Mr ZAPPIA,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The member opposite refers to the Investing in Our Schools Program. If he is patient I intend to come to that. I earlier that the run-down state of many of our public schools is the result of years of neglect, particularly during the Howard government's years in office. Sadly, one of the outcomes of that neglect, as I pointed out a moment ago, is that parents continually have to contribute funding for the most basic of school resources. I will give a couple of examples of where I have seen parents do exactly that in public schools. I will come back to talking about some schools in Makin in just a moment. I first want to refer to something that was published in the Australian by reporter Matthew Knott on 13 October 2008, when he wrote about the issue of parents having to pay to send their children to school. The article was headlined, ‘Cash-poor schools “running raffles to pay for textbooks”'. The headline exposes the shocking truth of how our schools have been neglected. It is a sad indictment of a country like Australia, which is generally affluent. I said earlier that I wanted to allude to some of the schools that I have visited recently in my area. I visit schools in the electorate of Makin whenever I can. I speak to teachers and parents and I see the needs of individual families and schools. Only last Friday-7 November-I attended the Modbury West Primary School, which is in the Makin electorate, for the official opening of the school's new landscaped frontage, which the students have appropriately named the Garden of Dreams. The entire funding for the project-this is a public school-which amounted to about $15,000, came from the school community, and the work was then carried out by volunteers. The net result was a beautifully landscaped garden which lifts the appearance of the school and lifts the pride of the students. If the work had been outsourced it would have cost around said $50,000, but thanks to the school community they were able to do it for around $15,000. What the school community have achieved in the garden is a credit to the whole of the Modbury West Primary School community. It is also typical of what I see at so many other schools. In the same week I also attended Para Vista Primary School, Modbury Primary School and The Heights School-a reception-to-year-12 school-when these schools also officially opened improvements to their schools. Like Modbury West Primary School, Para Vista Primary School, Modbury Primary School and The Heights School have a committed staff team and a supportive school community. Each of these school communities contributed thousands of dollars of funds that they had raised towards their own school projects. Certainly in those cases the projects were assisted by funding from the federal government and other sources, but the school communities had to raise a substantial amount of the funds selves in order to ensure that those projects became a reality. Again, the fundraising primarily came from the parents of the schoolchildren. This highlights the costs that are being faced by parents when they send their children to school. The Rudd government understands that, and that is why this measure has been put in place. That is why the Rudd government announced, in December, a $1,000 payment for each child of parents who come under family tax benefit A. That is why the Rudd government introduced tax cuts in July and why the Rudd government has committed to a range of education expenditure measures which will ultimately give children their best chance in life. I want to come back to a couple of comments that have been made by members opposite. I will address the question of Investpriority ing in Our Schools, which most of them seem to want to allude to. It is interesting that members opposite support that program-and rightly so, because it was money that was used to assist schools-but why did the Howard government ever have to establish that program? It was because, after 12 years of being in government, the schools had become run-down to such a state that they needed every penny that they could get in order to get improvements just to provide basic education services. If the federal government had provided the states and the schools with the appropriate level of funding the schools would never have got to that state in the first place. When I walk through those schools and I see some of the conditions that they are in, I believe that it is a sad indictment of the previous government that they were allowed to deteriorate to that level. The program was simply a bandaid measure to pretend that the previous government cared about schools when the reality is that them- they could have done much, much more. It is interesting that those opposite come into this place and talk about how this government is now doing all of this because it is possible as a result of the good economic management of the previous government. If the previous government was managing the economy so well why didn't it invest in education and end up with a much stronger economy than we have? And why didn't the previous government, when they had a surplus in their budget, commit to these projects? Why didn't the previous government, when they had the funds, go into an election and commit to any of the measures that the Labor Party did? The previous government had the same opportunities, but they were not prepared to give education the priority it deserved and they were not prepared to give education the that the Rudd government does. Mr Baldwin interjecting",97
158,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! There is too much audible interjection across the chamber.,98
159,Mr ZAPPIA,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Now they are trying to simply take credit for the policies which are being well received by the community out there. These policies were put together by Rudd Labor government and will ultimately ensure that every child in this country will have a fair opportunity of getting a good education. A good education provides not only opportunity for the child as an individual but opportunity and prosperity for our nation as a whole. This is just one of many measures that the Rudd government has announced, as I said earlier, but it is an important measure because it does put money directly back into the pockets of the mums and dads who are doing the best they can to ensure that their children get a good education. I commend the bill of the House, I congratulate the ister for introducing it and I look forward to working with the Rudd Labor government on rolling out a number of other education initiatives and policies that will complete the package of delivering a good education system in Australia.",99
160,Mr COMBET,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Charlton-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (5.30 pm)-The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 will help to reduce significantly the cost of education for working families. It will also help to encourage investment by parents in school equipment for their children's education. That, of course, means an investment in their future. Improving the education system is essential to improving the economic and social well-being of our country. Before the last election Labor committed to implementing an education revolution, due to the poor performance of the previous government in this area and the long-term benefits of improving educational outcomes. Under the previous government, Australia's investment in education was equal to 5.8 per cent of GDP. This placed us behind 17 other OECD economies in our level of investment in this area. Even worse, investment in early the childhood education was just 0.1 per cent of GDP compared to an OECD average of 0.5 per cent. What a dismal performance by the previous government in that area! We were also falling behind our competitors, evidenced by the World Economic Forum's findings that our science and maths education ranked only 29th in the world, behind countries like Singapore, France, India, the Czech Republic and Tunisia. These results, bad enough on their own, are worse when you consider the economic and social benefits that education can have. Research has demonstrated that improvements in education have a direct impact on minproductivity and economic growth levelsand, of course, that is perfectly self-evident. But, as evidence, it has been estimated by Access Economics that increasing the workforce's level of education by only 0.15 years would boost workforce-wide productivity by 0.62 per cent. It would also boost workforce participation by 0.48 per cent and economic growth by 1.1 per cent by 2040. Research by ANU economist Steve Dowrick has also found that an additional year's schooling could boost productivity and economic growth by 0.3 per cent. OECD research on education in 2006 demonstrated that, if the average level of education of the working-age population was increased by one year, the economy would be three to six per cent larger and the growth rate of the economy would be up to one per cent higher. As further evidence, a 2004 international study into literacy scores, human capital and growth across 14 OECD countries found that countries able to attain literacy scores one per cent higher than the international average will achieve living standards measured by GDP per capita that are 1.5 per cent higher than other countries. That is graphic evidence from a number of research studies of the importance of education in improving economic activity, productivity and therefore social outcomes. The business community has also long recognised the value of education to the performance of the economy. In a report in 2006, the Business Council of Australia stated: People with higher levels of educational attainment and skills have higher participation rates and tend to stay in the workforce for longer. ing the average level of education attainment (and ongoing skill development) can also deliver higher levels of productivity. Education also helps to create other social benefits. US academic Robert Putnam has conducted research into this area in particular and has shown that societies with a strong commitment to education can also enjoy higher levels of civic participation in community groups, greater social cohesion and integration, lower levels of crime and disadvantage, and a more equitable and trusting society. So there is ample evidence of the importance of education in economic and social outcomes and, in particular, in the pursuit of social justice. That is why the Rudd government has made education a central element of its program in government. It realises the economic and social importance of education and that is why the government is committed to a revolution in education. In the May budget the government established the Education Investment Fund, which absorbed the earlier Higher Education Endowment Fund. The fund is budgeted to receive an initial allocation of around $11 billion to be spent on higher education and vocational education and training needs. This is an extremely important proposed investment, for the reasons I have described. In addition to this, the budget also provided $5.9 billion over five years for areas covering early childhood education, schools, higher education, skills and workforce development. In the area of early childhood education, which is one of the areas I identified earlier as being critical to economic and social development, the budget contained the following initiatives: $534 million over five years to provide universal access to preschool, 15 hours per week for 40 weeks per year, for all four-year-olds by 2013; and $337 million to further improve quality of, and access to, Raisearly childhood education and care, particularly for disadvantaged children. These are Labor initiatives consistent with Labor values for social equity. For schools, the budget provided $1.2 billion over five years for the digital education revolution to deliver computers and communications technologies to all year 9 to 12 students. To digress for a moment, in my own electorate, of Charlton this initiative is extremely important. Just last week I visited St Paul's High School, a Catholic school in the electorate where about 217 computers are well in the process of being delivered. It has driven improved internet access and a wireless broadband service in the school, changed the shape and function of the library at the school and is demonstrably improving the delivery of education to students and their access to research tools. This initiative alone, in delivering computers to all year 9 to 12 students, will revolutionise significant approaches to education throughout our country. The budget also delivered a number of other things consistent with the objectives of the government. This included: $2.5 billion over 10 years for trade training centres in schools; $577 million to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes for students; $62 million over three years for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program; and $20 million to establish a National Curriculum Board. All of these initiatives in schools are designed to help assist in lifting the year 12 or equivalent attainment rate-that is, the participation rate of students in year 12 or its equivalent-to 90 per cent by 2020. I recall throughout the Hawke and Keating periods in government, when the lifting of the participation rate of students to year 12 was made an objective, what a significant contribution that made to the improvement of educational outcomes in this country. You need to identify these targets in order to try and lift that rate. It is particularly important for a lot of young teenage men in the area that I represent that we get them through to year 12 and improve their educational outcome. In the area of higher education, the budget provided the following: $500 million to help universities upgrade and maintain teaching, research and other student facilities; and $626 million to reduce the cost of studying maths and science at university and to reduce HECS-HELP repayments for science and maths graduates who undertake work in a related field. Boosting the number of students in maths, engineering and science disciplines at university is critical to our economic future, and the government has targeted this area in an attempt to ensure that we achieve a greater number of graduates. In my own portfolio area of defence procurement, this is the area more than anything else that is restricting the capacity of Australian industry to deliver capabilities for the future. It will be extremely important within the defence industry alone that we address the shortfall of graduates in these disciplines. In the area of skills and workforce development, the budget included $1.9 billion to deliver up to another 630,000 training places over five years. This was recently augmented in the Economic Security Strategy too, with funding of $187 million to create an additional 56,000 new training places this year. All of these initiatives which I have detailed are helping to lay the foundation for the government's long-term economic reform agenda through the boosting of education. It should not be said by anyone in the community-and certainly not by those oppositethat the government are not serious about pursuing the education revolution that was part of our election platform. The education tax refund is another extremely important initiative, particularly for the parents of school-age children. It is the subject of the bill that is before the House. The education tax refund will provide additional relief for families facing rising cost-ofliving pressures. Under the plan eligible families will be able to claim a 50 per cent tax refund for up to $750 in educational expenses for each child at primary school. That represents a maximum refund of $375 per child. The second leg of the plan involves a 50 per cent tax refund for up to $1,500 in education expenses for each child at secondary school-a maximum refund of $750 per child. As the Treasurer outlined in his second reading speech in relation to this bill, eligible expenses will include very important things that are ordinary expenses to support children's education. They include laptops, home computers, printers, paper, education software for computers, the establishment and maintenance of a home internet connection, school textbooks and associated materials and trade tools. It will also include the purchase, lease, hire or hire-purchase costs of those items. The tax refund will be available to parents who are entitled to family tax benefit part A and have children in primary or high school. It will also be payable to those who would be eligible for family tax benefit part A in respect of a child but for the fact that they or the child are in receipt of another payment such as youth allowance or disability support pension. The tax refund will apply to eligible expenses that are incurred from 1 July 2008. One of the things that I and, I am sure, other members of the House have been doing is to encourage all eligible parents to save their receipts so that they can claim these expenses when they complete their tax return. Those families who are not required to lodge an income tax return will be able to access their entitlement by filling out a separate form that will be available through the Australian Taxation Office. This is a significant initiative. It is valued at $4.4 billion and it is estimated that this will affect over 1.3 million families, including 2.7 million students. In my own electorate of Charlton, I know that many families have taken an interest in this initiative. They are working very hard to put their kids through school and they deserve as much assistance with education costs as they can get. Given the socio-economic standing of many of the families in my electorate, many of them will be eligible to claim the education tax refund. We have made sure that parents, through the schools, are aware of this by ensuring that the parents and citizens groups advertise the education tax refund to all of the parents at each of the primary and secondary schools, and I have been liaising with all of the principals of the schools in my electorate as well. Recently we have done an electorate-wide mail-out to ensure that people are aware of their entitlement to this and other initiatives that the government has taken, particularly in view of the initiatives announced as part of the economic strategy to combat the effects of the global financial crisis. Given the recent economic events and the budgetary pressures experienced by people with schoolchildren. I know that this is a very welcome initiative in the electorate. I have a very strong belief in the importance of education, and I am very proud to be part of a government that has taken this initiative. I commend the bill to the House.",99
161,Mr SYMON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise in strong support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008, which will enact the Rudd government's 2007 election commitment announced on 25 September last year. It is especially pleasing to be able to stand up in this place and speak for the working families in the seat of Deakin. This bill will bring welcome relief from the costs of education for parents of primary and secondary school students, and it is specifically targeted, the education refund being available to those parents who are receiving family tax benefit A. In my electorate of Deakin there are a total of 7,069 families who receive family tax benefit A by fortnightly instalment, and that is paid for a total of 13,008 children. Another 1,600 or so families receive their family tax benefit A by lump sum at the end of the financial year. The cutoff rate for families with primary or secondary school children for family tax benefit A ranges from $100,801 for those families with one child to $122,263 for those families with three children. These families will be able to claim 50 per cent of the cost of eligible education expenses of up to $750 per child at primary school each year, and that provides a maximum tax offset of $375 per year for each child at primary school. For each child at secondary school these families will be eligible to claim 50 per cent of up to $1,500 of eligible education expenses per year. That provides a maximum tax offset of $750 per secondary school student per year. Like most members of this place, I visit my local schools quite often, and an issue that comes up many times when you talk to parents is the costs of schooling. Some parents are doing okay and some are doing it really tough, and extra costs that come along at the start of the school year and during the school year for essentials that cannot be done without-you cannot let your kids go to school without the right equipment-are a really important factor in budgetary pressures. So the education tax refund is an important way of dealing with it and getting money back to where it is needed to help a better educational outcome. The education tax refund is also available to parents whose children are in homeschooling, and that is worth noting, as till now there has been very little in the way of Commonwealth support for homeschooling. It does not apply to that many people but there are certainly a group out there that strongly believe in that system, and they should also have support where it is needed-that is, to deliver materials to their students, their own children. Most importantly, the tax offset is real. It is in-your-hand money-it is not a gross amount-and, because it is a refundable tax offset, it will also be paid even if person claiming it has no tax liability. The education tax refund is also payable to those people who may not receive family tax benefit A if they are or if the eligible child is ceiving Abstudy or Student Financial Supplement Scheme or Veterans' Children Education Scheme payments. The education tax refund is also payable to people with eligible children if they are receiving the disability support pension, Newstart allowance or youth allowance. Rather than requiring people to have a taxable income before a deduction could be claimed, as in the past, this bill will also benefit those who need it most, especially if they get by on very limited incomes. The education tax refund will be claimable from 1 July 2009 for eligible expenses incurred in the 2008-09 year. I have had a look at the list of eligible penses, and the more you look at it the more you see in it. I will go through those now because I think it is important that it be fleshed out, because we sometimes see a small list and sometimes a larger list, and if you read through the actual text of the bill it is quite an all-encompassing type of arrangement. It includes things like computers but also the components purchased to build a home computer. It includes computer related equipment such as printers and disability aids to assist with the use of computer equipment for students with disabilities. It includes establishing and maintaining a home internet connection, which is pretty much vital these days when it comes to education. If you have children and they come home, they certainly need access to a computer and to the knowledge base that is the internet. It is almost impossible these days to find a task set for students that relates only back to textbooks; there always seems to be a need to have this computer access. The eligible expenses also include computer software such as word-processing programs, the spreadsheet and database applications, presentation software, educational games and, importantly, internet filters and anti-virus software. They include school textbooks, reincluding prescribed textbooks, study guides and other paper based school learning material, including stationery items. They also include tools of trade prescribed by course. The eligible expenses also include running and repair costs for computers and computer related equipment such as printers and disability aids. The good news does not stop there. When a child undergoes the transition from primary school to secondary school during a financial year, the education tax refund will apply to that student at the secondary school rate for the whole year. This will be most appreciated by working families, as the expense for a exchild starting a new secondary school is usually much higher than for a child continuing at the same primary school. It is also worth highlighting that if eligible expenses for a child exceed the $750 or $1,500 thresholdthe annual limits for the financial year, as I have just said-they can be moved over to the next year, so the excess, over-the-top expenses can be moved to the subsequent income year. Where families have more than one eligible child, the eligible expenses can be pooled and divided between the children when accessing the tax offset, providing all the children involved would have had access to the purchased items. This could be very useful for higher cost items, such as a home computer, which may cost more than the limit set for one child. At a total cost of billion over four years, the education tax refund will certainly be of assistance to many lowand middle-income families. In 2007, the Brotherhood of St Laurence published a report titled Counting the cost: parental experiences of educational expenses: results from the 2007 education costs survey. This report concentrated solely on low-income families. It found that 72 per cent of respondents indicated they could not afford items that would ‘improve the education experience of their children'. It also looked at a lot of areas more closely than that. It reported that two-thirds of the survey respondents did not have a home computer with internet access. That figure compares with ABS figures from 2007 that showed that 36 per cent of Australian households did not have a home computer with internet access. The Brotherhood of St Laurence survey also recorded that 60 per cent had difficulty in paying for schoolbooks. This included almost half the respondents reporting difficulty in paying for school and education equipment. As I noted before, the education tax refund is also payable to people with eligible children if they are receiving the disability support pension, Newstart allowance or youth allowance. This is particularly important for the Brotherhood of St Laurence survey respondents, as 98 per cent had a Centrelink healthcare or pension card. Fifty-eight per cent of them received a Centrelink pension, payment or allowance, and for 40 per cent of the survey respondents this was the parenting payment at the single rate. When the education tax refund is added to the government's family tax benefit A bonus to be delivered from 8 December this year, there will be an even greater benefit for working families with children attending school. The start of a new school year can be financially stressful for parents, and it can be just as stressful for children, especially if $4.4 they have to do without when other children attend school with more equipment than they have. It is not a new problem; it has been around for many years. Many parents do not like to think of the day their child comes home from school at the end of the year with the list of textbooks for the next year and their prices. This bill will certainly go a long way to helping out in that situation. Hopefully, it will mean that more children go to school in the next school year and, on the first day of school, will have the right books and the right stationery equipment-the things they need to be able to learn in an educational environment. The cost of textbooks in particular may add up to several hundred dollars a year for a family. This, of course, comes straight after all the expenses of the Christmas holiday break. If you have got more than one child going to school, the bills can double or triple. If the curriculum moves around, a textbook that has been good for one year is no longer the required text for the next. When it comes to selling them off second hand, you do not get much. When you have to buy them new, you have to pay quite a lot. The cost of buying textbooks is then followed by the cost of going to the local newsagent and getting all the stationery items for your child to go to school for the year. Again, that bill adds up very quickly. So the best thing of all about this bill is that, by keeping receipts for these items, families will get the rebate come tax time. For the many who struggle to send their children to school, it surely will be a great help during the year, and especially at the start of the year when those costs are higher. This is a good news bill that will greatly benefit working families both in Deakin and in every electorate in Australia. I commend this bill to the House.",102
162,Mr SHORTEN,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services) (5.55 pm)-I am pleased to rise this afternoon to strongly port the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 and the new education tax refund-one more election commitment of the Rudd government that we mean to keep. I believe that the recent worldwide financial meltdown serves to highlight the enduring value of what we learn in schools, colleges and universities in a changing world. This week we believe more than ever that education is an economic investment whose value cannot be eroded by global speculation and risky lending practices in overseas economies. Education is what lasts. When the last subprime mortgage security follows the last reckless hedge fund investment into oblivion, education will be the currency that does not fail. It is for this reason that we remain committed to an education revolution and to those parents who need additional help with the everyday costs of their children's education. Last month, the Rudd government took decisive action to strengthen the Australian economy and support Australian families during the present global financial crisis. Indeed, the Rudd government announced it would deliver a one-off payment this year of $1,000 to the parents of around 3.9 million eligible children. Those that will receive the support include 1.9 million families who receive family tax benefit A and families who receive youth allowance, Abstudy or a benefit from the Veterans' Children Education Scheme payment. These families will also be eligible for the new education tax refund, which will provide a refundable tax offset at 50 per cent of education expenses. In fact, the Rudd government's first budget included $4.4 billion to create the new education tax refund. It was, I believe, our first great investment in our nation's future prosperity. It is our affirmation of a social partnership conceived at the best-practice standard, comparable with the best in the world. supWe did it because we believe education increases productivity, builds prosperity and breaks the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Education is our ticket out of the underclass. It is an improvement of our souls. Education means participation. These two factors are central to lifting productivity. Whilst our physical resources are finite, human potential, human capacity, human ability and human spirit are infinite. It is clear now to us all that Australia's productivity declined at the same rate that education funding declined under the previous, unfocused, mendicant, somnambulant, careless Howard government. This is why, unlike our tired, dispirited, directionless predecessors, we are getting on with the job of real education reform. The 2008-09 budget is meeting, with the difficulty that the world crisis presents, our promised election commitments and helping out with schooling and learning at all levels. We want Australians to reach their high potential and we are investing in our future. We want Australia to reach its high potential and we are investing in our future. The $19.3 billion investment delivers at all ages, from early childhood to primary schools and from high schools to vocational education, training and higher education. The education tax refund is a refundable tax offset of 50 per cent of eligible expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary school studies. Hereafter parents can more readily afford to see their children properly taught. Under the plan, eligible families will be able to claim 50 per cent of school expenses, up to $750 for each child undertaking primary school, to provide a maximum tax offset of $375 per child per year. For children undertaking secondary school studies, parents will be able to claim up to 50 per cent of their eligible expenses, up to $1,500 per child, to gain a maximum tax offset of $750 per child per year. Eligible expenses will include laptops, home computers, printers, paper, education software, school textbooks and associated materials and trade tools. In addition, the expenses of establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are included. The refund plan began on 1 July 2008, so I recommend that eligible parents start keeping receipts for their 2008-09 income tax return. Indeed, those not paying tax because of low income should lodge a separate form, available from the tax office, at the end of the current finanthrough cial year. This will assist the great schools in my Maribyrnong electorate-schools like Rosehill Secondary College, formerly Niddrie Secondary College, a proud school where principal Anne Fox is working hard to give the school its new, developed image; Essendon-Keilor College, led by David Adamson, a school with a long history of excellence, with its great heritage buildings that reflect the grandness and a century-old dream of a decent education; and Sunshine Secondary College and St Albans Secondary College, led by Tim Blunt and Kerrie Dowsley respectively. They are schools that have a vibrant culture and innovative programs. Other schools and staff include Mrs Olwen Bell, Principal, Ave Maria College; Mrs Carolyn Grantskalans from Lowther Hall Anglican Grammar School; Mr Tony Larkin from Penleigh and Essendon Grammar; Mr Frank Fitzgerald from St Bernard's College, who is retiring this year; Ms April Honeyman from St Columba's College; Mrs Julie Williams from Kealba Secondary College; Ms Christina Utri from the Catholic Regional College; Mr Mark Vodell from Gilson College; Mr Tony Tartaro from Buckley Park Secondary College; and Mr Andrew Williamson, CEO and Principal of the Australian Technical College Sunshine. I know that all these talented, hard working, dedicated and passionate education teachers and leaders believe that better education is the cornerstone of a decent society. In fact, for Labor, better education is the cornerstone of a decent society. It is the lodestone and the talisman, the guardian angel and the bankable guarantee of a better society that we are striving for. Education is for us in Labor, and always has been, the light on the hill to which our eyes are ever turned and our efforts ever directed. Through our budget measures, through this legislation and the great efforts of the Minister for Education, the Rudd government is striving to combat economic and social disadvantage-and this, I suggest, in Labor terms, is getting on with the job. This is what we are here for; this is our task. In this first way we create and sustain a fair Australia where the pursuit of happiness is available to all and a larger, more abundant life within the reach of those who seek it. I commend the legislation.",105
163,Ms HALL,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is with great pleasure and some pride that I stand to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008, because this is evidence of the Rudd government's commitment to the education revolution. This reflects the Rudd government's determination to see that each and every child in Australia can afford the resources they need to attend school. This is very important legislation-legislation that I know will be welcomed in my electorate. In fact, since people living in my electorate have heard of this legislation they have been keen for it to be introduced so that they can access the benefits that will accrue to them under it. This bill proposes to introduce a 50 per cent education tax refund aimed at assisting families with children at primary or secondary school to meet school education costs by assisting with certain education expenses, the kinds of education expenses that have put in place barriers that prevent young people from lower income families being competitive. It is okay for young people to be able attend school and to use the resources of the school but, when it comes to things like home computers and internet access, if a student does not have these things then they will not be competitive with students who do have a home computer and access to the internet. It is also very important that the other things that are covered in this legislation, which I will get to a bit later, are available to all students. The education refund comes in the wake of several reports over a number of years. These reports have highlighted the difficulties of schooling costs for low-income families. For instance, the 2007 education cost survey by the Brotherhood of St Laurence found that 72 per cent of the respondents could not afford items that would improve the education experience of their children, and two-thirds did not have a home computer with internet access. This is why the legislation we are debating here in the House tonight is of such vital importance. It is imperative that all children, no matter what their parents' income is and no matter what their level of advantage is, have access to resources they need to achieve good educational outcomes. The Brotherhood of St Laurence report also showed that 60 per cent of those who responded to the survey had difficulty paying for books, and half of the parents said they had difficulty paying for equipment that their children needed when they were attending school. I know that this legislation will be welcomed by not only low-income earners in my electorate but also middle-income families who are struggling to pay for all the competing expenses that they have each and every day. It is expensive for children to attend school and it is expensive for children to get a decent education, and that is why the Rudd government has made the commitment to to ensure that each and every child can access a quality education and have access to the things that they need to achieve that education. Under the refund, families who are eligible and approved will be able to claim 50 per cent of the refundable tax offset each year for up to $750 of eligible expenditure for each primary school child-that will equate to a made significant refund-and a 50 per cent refundable tax offset each year for up to $1,500 of eligible expenses for each child undertaking secondary school education. As I mentioned earlier, I have been contacted by students in my electorate who are very keen to be able to access this particular scheme (Quorum formed) Before returning to the text of my speech, I acknowledge that the member for Paterson called that quorum on me; and I must say that in another parliament I did the same to him. On that occasion he abused me mercilessly, but I understand the way that the parliament works and I acknowledge his right to call a quorum. I accept the rules of the House and I hope that the member for Paterson in future will be the able to show the courtesy to observe the forms of the House in a way that he could not when he was on this side of the House. I will now return to the text of my speech, but I believe that the member for Paterson did deserve some special comment. Eligible families will be families in receipt of family tax benefit part A in respect of one or more children undertaking primary or secondary school education. Parents with one or more children who would be eligible for family tax benefit part A but for the fact that they or the child receive certain payments or allowances such as youth allowance, the disability support pension or Abstudy living allowance are also eligible. Students undertaking primary or secondary school studies and receiving the independent rate of income payments may also be eligible in respect of their own expenses. For families with shared care who are eligible for family tax benefit A or shared receipt of family tax benefit A the refund will be shared. So both parents or both carers will receive part of family tax benefit A, just as family tax benefit A is shared. For families in receipt of other payments, similar arrangements for sharing the education tax refund between the parents will occur. Students entering or leaving school in any school year can claim half the refund attributable to the half of the financial year they attended school. Families with homeschool students may also be eligible for the refund. Eligible expenses-and I think this is very important-include the purchase, lease, hire or hire-purchase costs of laptops and home computers and associated costs; printers and paper; educational software; and school textbooks, materials and prescribed trade tools. In addition, expenses associated with establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are eligible. In this debate I have heard previous speakers on the other side argue that school fees should attract this refund. For any member to argue that shows a complete lack of understanding of what this legislation is about. It is about providing access to the tools that will enable students to compete and to access the knowledge that is available through these tools. It is not about alleviation or making school fees any cheaper. It is about providing students with the opportunity to learn. That is very important. There is a significant difference between what we on this side of the parliament are about and what those on the other side of the parliament are about. We are about giving each and every child the opportunity-an equal opportunity wherever possible-to learn. We are about making education accessible and making the tools of education accessible to all students. We are not about setting up a system where some students can benefit and some students cannot. This is about equity of access and equity within education. This is legislation that, as I said earlier, will be particularly welcomed by lowincome families. It focuses in the main on information technology and communication because that is vital to educational success. It is the revolution of the 21st century. For students to encompass all their learning goals, they need to have access to digital information. That is part of this government's digital education revolution, which will be providing $1.2 billion over five years for information technology in schools. The members on the other side of this parliament really need to embrace Labor's education revolution. They need to acknowledge the benefit that all the students that attend their schools are obtaining from the computers that Labor is putting into their high schools. They need to acknowledge the benefit of the trade training centres, the fact that Labor is taking education into the 21st century and that Labor is about ensuring that each and every student has the opportunity to succeed. I believe around 1.3 million families will be eligible for the refund. There was $4.4 billion included in the budget to create the education tax refund to assist these families. That is very important and of course was a Rudd government election commitment. The refund will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008. Eligible people should keep their receipts from 1 July 2008 to claim the tax offset in their 2008-09 tax return. I emphasise that point: it is imperative that receipts are kept so that families can claim this refund. Keep your receipts and put them in a safe place so that when it comes time to do your tax refund you will know exactly where they are. Education, as I have said, increases productivity and participation, builds prosperity and offers hope in breaking intergenerational cycles of poverty. As I have already said, if you do not have access to the tools that give you the knowledge then you are going to find it very, very difficult to obtain a quality education and the skills that you will need to get jobs in the workforce that open the door to prosperity. No-one can deny that education is the key that unlocks the door to success in people's lives. It is very, very important that this legislahave tion gets through the parliament in a timely fashion. It is very important that people within the Australian community know that, come tax time next year, they will be eligible for this allowance. I applaud the minister for putting this legislation to the parliament and the Rudd government for its foresight in acknowledging the importance that information technology plays and acknowledging the fact that education is the key to success and that to obtain that education you need to have the resources. That is why the education tax refund will be of such vital importance to all those people who are in receipt of the benefits that I highlighted earlier-those lowto middle-income families that need to obtain the tools for their children to succeed in education.",106
164,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I want to briefly take the time of the House to address the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 and, as previous speakers before me have done in this debate, some of the broader education issues related to it. As speakers on this side have made clear, the coalition will be supporting this measure; however, as we have also made clear, we think it is too narrow. It is no secret that at the last election we had a broader policy, both in items covered and in families covered. We think this policy that has been put forward is too narrow-we have said so-but we acknowledge that it will be of assistance to those parents who are eligible in the narrow field of items that are covered. The previous speaker, the member for Shortland, mentioned the digital revolution, as it is called by those opposite, which many other speakers from the government side have lauded. Those opposite in their heart of hearts know that there is great scepticism about the so-called education revolution. The hollowness is now coming to the fore. We heard the computers in schools policy lauded by those opposite, but they know that, as we approach the one-year anniversary of the election of this government, many will look back to those first few days after that election when the first COAG meeting was held to set out the new deal with the states and to end the blame game. The first thing that was going to happen on that agenda back in December was that all of the costs for the computers in schools were going to be worked out. But, no, that was deferred until March and deferred again until July. We had the Treasurer saying in the days before that July COAG meeting that everything would be sorted out. New South Wales has since refused to participate in the computers in schools policy. We have had parents complaining across all of our electorates. We know that members opposite have had the same thing across their electorates because as the detail has come to the fore it has become quite obvious that this program was not thought through properly and that the cost of putting computers on the desks of every student in years 9, 10, 11 and 12 had not been thought through. What has happened is that the states have said they are not going to pay the bills. Julia Gillard, the Minister for Education, has put her head in the sand all year on this issue and, as we have warned from this side of the House right through this year, parents are now being hit with the bill. We have the extraordinary situation where we have the members opposite saying how important it is to assist parents-and we agree with that-but ignoring the fact that now parents are being hit with a new Rudd government computer tax. In my electorate of CaseyMr Shorten interjecting",109
165,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The member for Maribyrnong might learn something here. He might find that he is going to have a similar situation in his electorate. I have had ents inform me that they will need to pay an annual levy of between $150 and $300 every year-it has just come out to the parents this week-to fund the computers in schools policy. The school has had to impose this levy to pay for all of those on-costs that are obvious to anyone installing a computer anywhere, obvious to anyone except the minister. I would not go so far as to exclude those opposite from that. I think that they would realise that, if you buy a computer and you actually want to make it work, you need to plug it into something, you need to connect it to the internetMr Shorten-Who told you that?",110
166,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Not Julia Gillard, not the Minister for Education. Now the parents at Lilydale High School have been told that they will have to pay an annual levy of between $150 and $300 a year. This is about to be repeated in numbers of high schools across Australia if they want to make the computers work. If they are prepared to leave the computers sitting in boxes, gathering dust and not making use of them, perhaps they will not have to charge a levy, but high schools as a result of combined federal and state Labor incompetence-as a result of one year of talk and no action-are having to charge parents to implement this Rudd Labor government policy. This has been happening all year; it has been obvious to anyone wanting to see. I do not know what happens at these COAG meetings. Perhaps somebody has the secret remote control that they pointed at the Treasurer last week when they hit ‘mute' and for 80 seconds he sat there unable to speak. Perhaps that is what happens every time computers in schools are mentioned at COAG; perhaps there is just silence. But now this new Rudd tax will be imposed on the parents of Lilydale High School students parand other high school students across Victoria and Australia. It was with great fanfare that the policy was announced at the last federal election-a computer on every desk-but I tell you what was not in the policy. What was not in the policy was that every parent would have to pay a fee or a tax to actually make the computers work. The other thing parents across Australia, particularly at primary schools, have realised is that the Investing in Our Schools Program has been abolished. The Investing in Our Schools Program, which enabled schools to pick the projects they wanted, has been abolished. Mr Shorten interjecting",110
167,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,I persist in light of unfair interjections,110
168,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Do not be incited. Order!,110
169,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Those opposite will do everything they can to defend the indefensible. Before the last election, if go back to the computers in schools policy, nowhere did the Prime Minister say, ‘I will impose a tax of $150 to $300 on the parents of high-school students.' This has been announced by Lilydale High School. There will be other schools that will do the same thing. They are forced to do this because of the complete and utter incompetence of those opposite. As we approach the anniversary of the last election, two weeks away, parents will reflect on the great gap between what was promised and what is actually being delivered. What is being delivered today in this legislation-we say it is too narrow, we say it should be broader-is only possible because the previous government left a budget in surplus, left a budget able to fund precisely these sorts of programs, like the Investing in Our Schools Program, across the education area. As those opposite speak on this bill, they should consider the computers in schools policy. It is not good enough to talk about just the rebate and the new computers in schools policy in tandem without acknowledging the fact that parents right across Australia are now starting to be hit with fees and levies in order the computers work.",110
170,Mr GRAY,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (6.30 pm)-On Tuesday last week I visited a school in my electorate, Mandurah High School, to officiate at the opening of Investing in Our Schools project. It is an cellent project. It was the construction of a sporting oval and also included funding for facilities in the canteen. When the principal, Alfred King, pointed out to me that in my speech I had given praise to the former government for the Investing in Our Schools Program, I also pointed out that in fact the former government had closed that program in January 2007. Long before the federal you election, the money had run out, the program had ended and it was time to move on. A good program had served its purpose and, as we say, it was time to move on. But what do we then move on to? Investing in education is important for many reasons. It empowers those who are going through the education process. It enables our kids to grow. It gives them opportunities. Education is so fundamental to the lives of young Australiansand older Australians too-and it is important to the young people in my electorate as they go about preparing for their way in life. It was instructive that in 2006-07, when many of the debates were taking place in the House and throughout the country in the runup to our election, the funding of education became an issue of great importance, not just because it was about how much money each side was putting into education but because of what it was about. It became apparent in 2006 that Australia was not slowly but rapidly slipping down the OECD tables for attainment, achievement and spending in education. We have had noted in this place that in pre-primary education funding we had slipped from a respectable position in the OECD to 25th out of the 26 countries that to actually make were surveyed. We know that education relates to opportunity. We know that education relates to how prepared for work our kids and our young adults will be. We know that education relates to how productive our economy an will be and how productive our workplaces exwill be. But we also know that over the last decade national investment in education has been falling. It has been falling both as a proportion of GDP and when measured against those countries with which we like to compare ourselves. We would never say that the former government did not spend on education, but we would say they did not spend enough and we would say that on many occasions the programs that were in place were spending 25c or 26c rather than fixing real problems. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is not just about education but about families. It is a bill about supporting education and supporting parents. It is a $4.4 billion education tax refund. It joins key elements of our tax system with the education needs of young families. It is targeted at those families who are in receipt of family tax benefit part A and who have kids in primary school or secondary school. It is estimated, as we have been told, that over 1.3 million families with 2.7 million children or students will receive this benefit. As we have heard many times, it is to cover eligible expenses such as laptops, home computers, printers, paper, internet access and the rest. It is a good initiative-it is an excellent initiative-but it is an initiative that comes the context of a range of other measures taken by the government, and the former government, to improve school performance. An important initiative in this area is to properly assess school performance, to look at the indicators that allow parents to understand how well their schools are performing and therefore to understand within the assessment process how well their children are doing in reference to not just their own school population but the school population of the state. The WALNA test in Western Australia and the national school testing processes are simply invaluable. My own children have been subject to these tests, and when we get the results back they form an illuminating view of not just how well our children are doing but also how well our public education system is performing. It performs because we have quality teachers. It performs because we have people who dedicate their lives to teaching and to ensuring that our children are given the best possible start. In my own life, the teachers who made the biggest impact on me throughout my primary and high school years, as I have said on many occasions in this place, are Bruce Wilton, Dale Doderidge, Miss Knight-the headmistress of my school, Whyalla High School-and Ken Harrington. They all had a big impact on me as I grew up. When I look at the teachers and the schools in my electorate of Brand, I see some truly outstanding examples of educators working with tremendous skill to perform the task of bringing our kids on in life. We have in the middle of my electorate a language development centre. It is almost unique. It allows the teachers to have optimal resources to both understand and provide education for kids with various disadvantages-often a speech delay, sometimes a in central processing difficulty. Sometimes the kids are autistic. Sometimes the kids come into that school with parents so frustrated at not being able to teach their children. A wonderful atmosphere has been established by principal Judy Smailes and Fiona Forbes, her assistant, in putting together an education program for kids who otherwise would face the most crushing educational hurdles. They would certainly not be able to obtain the benefit of education were it not for the great effort put in by the teachers at the Fremantle learning centre in my electorate. In the course of the past few weeks, I have had cause to attend half a dozen end-ofschool functions, including ones at Gilmore College, Safety Bay Senior High School and Hillman Primary School. They are functions which allow you to see the kids in their own environment and, even more important than that, the pride on the face of the teachers as they watch their kids graduate from school. In my electorate I have some outstanding schools and some outstanding teachers. At Charthouse Primary School there is Stephen Yates. At Baldivis Primary School, John Worthy is working in a small community developing wonderful programs that cover a broad spectrum of education but with a particular focus on the kind of cultural environment that is best suited to the children from the Baldivis area. John does a wonderful job. At Kolbe Catholic College a few weeks ago I had the pleasure of attending the first handover of computers under the computers in schools program, which we have had quite a bit of a discussion on in the course of this debate. The computers in schools program at Kolbe Catholic College is something that Caroline Payne, the principal, had been enthusiastic about. When I looked at the children logging on to their computers and engaging in education and learning through computer technology, I knew that the government's initiative was not just at the right time: it was the right initiative with the right amount of financial resources behind it to make it work. At Hillman Primary School, Wayne MCKay runs an excellent school in a pretty tough part of town, where the kids are enthusiastic and the teachers are even more enthusiastic. Up at the Peter Carnley Anglican College, Peter Martin runs a school which is brand new. He struggles often because the school is so new, but the wonderful facilities that are there and which are working create the best possible environment for those children as they go through their primary and secondary school education. Down at Mandurah Senior College last Friday week I opened the school oval and the new facilities in the canteen. Again, it gave me exposure to the good things that are happening not only in the education system in Western Australia but also in Australia. At Gilmore College, we saw the opening just a few weeks ago of a $65 million brand new high school, primary school and preschool-an integrated facility that will be working to bring the children of Kwinana through an education process that is not just the best available in Kwinana but the best available in the most modern school. At Calista Primary School in Kwinana, which I visited just a few weeks ago, Glenn Edwards has been working on his teaching programs and taking such care of his children as they get to the end of the current school year. He enthusiastically attended the graduation ceremony at Gilmore College which his primary school kids will attend next year. You see teachers all the time-and principals in particular-working above and beyond the call of duty. They are working not just at a job; they are working at a calling that they enjoy and which has a massive and positive impact on the children whose lives they affect. I come back to the core of the bill that we are debating here today. It delivers on a pre-election promise. It acknowledges the costs of living that families face and it acknowledges that technology and education play a role together in the lives of our children in schools and at home. It takes action to respond to the community need to ensure that our children can, at home, get access to the same excellent technology that now they will get access to at school. We know that this new initiative is one that sets our government apart from all predecessors and sets our children up in their schools for the most wonderful education experience. We have heard much about the former government's programs. I am the first to acknowledge there was much good that they did. But I do point out that the Investing in Our Schools Program was wound up in January 2007. I would also point out that in my electorate of Brand, throughout 2007, many former government ministers, including the former Prime Minister, campaigned to establish an ATC in Rockingham-not because there was an educational need for an ATC in Rockingham but because the school was to be the beneficiary of pork-barrelling in the seat of Brand in order to target the former member, Kim Beazley. When the current government refused to fund that ATC-I had campaigned against the funding of that ATC-it seemed to come as some surprise to people that the best teaching system throughout the southern suburbs of Perth was already there. It is a TAFE system, the Challenger TAFE system, which is an outstanding system for trades training and apprenticeships throughout Western Australia. It seemed to be not just a waste of taxpayers' money to put $20 million into an ATC but also an affront to the outstanding teaching and the resources that have been put into TAFE teaching in Western Australia. What we have here today is an Australian government using not just the instruments of government to fund computers in schools; this bill brings together both instruments available to government and the parliament to help families. It is where tax rebates and education policy meet. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act and allows it to be used for educational purposes. We have talked in this place about how the computers in schools are such an effective initiative and how additional funding for technical training in our high schools is so critically important. We have also come to the conclusion that the education refund bill will not only positively affect the ability of all families who are the recipients of family tax benefit part A to ensure that their children have excellent computing capacity at home to match the excellent computing capacity that we will be putting into schools but also recognise the costs that families face and goes some way to assisting in ensuring that all children get the best possible opportunity from our education system. I commend the bill to the House.",111
171,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Like many people in this House, I do not need to have my arm twisted to talk about education, in particular the education of young people. While I have the opportunity, may I recognise the Minister for Sport, who is at the table, for her excellent initiative announced during the election campaign and in the budget, the local sporting champions grants, which were announced today. I hope I have not pre-empted anything, but I know that there has been a great demandMs Kate Ellis interjecting",114
172,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Well, there you go! There has always been a terrific demand for members to support our local champions and this will go a long way, Minister, to helping us support them. I do thank you very much and I know the House will be appreciative of your excellent work there. Little could be more important in our education revolution than providing a means for parents to provide for their children's education needs. I share with many thousands of Australian families the cost of education, with two sons currently completing their university studies, but I have not forgotten the additional financial demands made during the early and middle years of education. Unfortunately, additional assistance as intended in this legislation was not available when my sons, William and Julian, were at the Forth Primary School, Ulverstone High School and then The Don College, the local senior secondary college. But, with two teachers for parents, the importance of investing in our children's education was very clear in our household. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is the result of an election promise and, like nearly every other piece of legislation brought before this House in 2008, is clear, practical proof of a government honouring its election commitments to Australian families. It is a $4.4 billion commitment over four years from the Rudd government to help make it easier for parents and encourage them to provide for their children the best they can to keep them engaged in school. It is an important financial commitment and needs to be passed through the parliament as soon as possible to allow time for its promotion to parents around the country so that they can keep the records they need to substantiate a claim come tax time next year. Indeed, like a number of members in this place, I have already commenced a public awareness campaign in my electorate encouraging parents to keep their receipts in relation to eligible education expenses. I would add that this is no small measure, with an estimated 1.3 million families and some 2.7 million students expected to be eligible for the benefits. The refund is able as a tax offset of 50 per cent of eligible education expenses. This might be for laptops, home computers, printers, paper, education software, school textbooks and associated materials and trade tools. The expenses for establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are also included, sensibly. Today, this is an important part of tion support. Indeed, education does not begin and end at school. It surprised me to read the results of the Brotherhood of St Laurence's 2007 Education costs survey. It has been quoted by many members of this House through the Bills Digest, but I think it is worth reiterating, paris ticularly for those who may be listening to this debate. It found that 72 per cent of respondents could not afford items that would improve the education experience of their children. It also concluded that some 60 per cent had difficulty paying for books and that almost half reported difficulty paying for equipment. The same report revealed that two-thirds did not have a home computer with internet access. That survey was directed at lower income folk, but its conclusions are disturbing. While it is hard to believe, we cannot let it continue. Being without the internet in this day and age is like being locked out of the library. While it does have its pitfalls, it can also be hugely important and valuable, particularly when coupled with an inquiring young mind. Those of us who are a little longer in the tooth may be a little wary of the research benefits of the internet, but the younger generation have grown up with it and know how to navigate through the reliable and less reliable sources in cyberspace. The education tax refund should help by providing support to upgrade computers or providing a high-speed internet connection for the first time to some households. Indeed, availone member-I think it was my colleague the member for Deakin-pointed out that one can purchase parts in order to make a home computer. I would find that a very productive activity and an expense that one could claim would give an excellent result. I acknowledge that there is a case for extending the refund to include other items educasuch as assistance to pay for school uniforms, textbooks, excursions and sports experiences, for example, and this would be well and good. However, unlike the opposition and their 12-year track record of providing little to no assistance to families in relation to education expenses, this government specifically assisting families to offset ITC centred information learning or trade skills expenses, or at least seeking to encourage families to invest in these contemporary tools of teaching and learning. This refund initiative is just one of an array from this government to strengthen the education of all Australians-and I stress again: of all Australians. Despite the criticisms of some, we are not interested in playing favourites. We want to give support where it is needed. I would like to repeat some of the extensive and generous plans that are part of what we deem to be an education revolution. Contrary to what some may believe and you may read in the media, this is in fact an education revolution. Revolutions begin in small ways, are resourced in small ways and grow, and that is what is happening with education. We have some opposite, and some unkind to our education revolution, who would see it all happen within six or seven months. This is a group of people who had 12 to 13 years to do something about it but now they expect it to be done in 12 to 13 months. Revolutions do not just happen overnight. This is a $19.3 billion effort in the education sector, a major indicator of just how serious this government is about supporting our schools. It includes the digital education revolution to improve the number and quality of computers in schools across the nation. I have already seen the benefit of this with schools in my electorate among those to benefit from the first round of the scheme. We are also working toward the development of a quality national curriculum, despite those opposite wishing to personally attack some of those that are constructing our curriculum. Why am I surprised? It is something that will be important in preparing our students for the 21st century. It includes more to improve school infrastructure and maintain what schools already have in place. A national action plan on literacy and numeracy will also be important to ensuring the basics are put in place to give young people their best chance at life. And with $2.5 billion over 10 years we will see schools across the nation set up trades training centres to enable young people with practical skills and aptitude to hone these skills in their early school years to come out ready to address the massive skills shortage we have and to ensure we do not have it again. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce the education tax refund or the ETR. The ETR will provide a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses up to a maximum of $750 for children undertaking primary education studies and $1,500 for children undertaking secondary education studies. Under the plan eligible families will be able to claim 50 per cent of eligible education expenses up to $750 for each child undertaking primary school studies to provide a maximum tax offset of $375 per child per year. For those children undertaking secondary school studies, families will be able to claim 50 per cent of their eligible expenses up to $1,500 per child to give a maximum tax offset of $750 per child per year. It is a refundable tax offset and therefore will apply to eligible applicants regardless of their tax liability. That is, it will also be paid if the person has no tax liability. Taxpayers who are entitled to the ETR include those in receipt of family tax benefit part A payment for a child; taxpayers and/or their child who receive other payments that preclude them from receiving family tax benefit A3; or taxpayers who are independent students and receive payments such as youth allowance, disability support pension or Abstudy living allowance. The ETR will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008 and will be claimable when income tax returns are submitted. Therefore, the ETR will be claimable from 1 July 2009, and that is why it is important to reiterate that families wishing to claim the refund should collect and keep their dockets and so forth. Eligible expenses for the ETR include the purchase, lease or hire purchase of computers and computer related equipment such as printers and disability aids and associated costs, a home internet connection, computer software, school textbooks and other paper based school learning material, including stationery and course prescribed tools of trade. If a child transitions from primary to secondary education during a financial year, the ETR will apply at the secondary rate for the entire year and education expenses in excess of the taxpayer's offset limit for a financial year can be transferred the subsequent income year. I am very pleased to support this Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. Before I finish altogether I would just like to acknowledge the number of schools in my electorate that I have had the privilege of visiting recently, and I hope to use another occasion to more extensively discuss what I was able to do and what I was able to experience in those schools. I would like to acknowledge the following schools and the work of their leaderships teams, their teachers in particular, the students themselves, and their parents and friends associations. In ticular there is the Yolla District School, Burnie High School, Parklands High, Reece High School, Cooee Primary-a great name-along with Penguin Primaryanother good name-East Ulverstone, the Moriarty Primary-another interesting name and a magnificent little school-the Nixon Street Primary School, the Oakwood Brethren School at East Devonport, the North West Christian School, at Penguin and my old stamping ground of 25 years, The Don College, which is going through some fundamental changes in the next year in Tasmania with post grade 10 education. And there are many other schools that I am looking forward to seeing particularly in their breakup nights towards the end of the year. It gives me great pleasure to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008.",114
173,Mr MARLES,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 but before I get into the substance of the bill I would like to welcome a number of people from my electorate who are in the building tonight to attend the inaugural FedCats annual dinner. FedCats is, of course, the parliamentary support group for the Geelong Football Club. It is very appropriate that I am to making this statement, with the Minister for Sport in the chamber. Of course, the Minister for Sport supports a club of different coloured hoops, being the member for Adelaide, but she is, as the Minister for Sport, an honorary FedCat and we very much welcome that. We have tonight Frank Costa, the President of the Geelong Football Club, Mark ‘Bomber' Thompson, the Coach of the Geelong Football Club, and Brian Cook, the CEO of the Geelong Football Club, all attending the annual dinner. I remember my time at the ACTU and talking to Bill Kelty, par- the former Secretary of the ACTU who himself is an AFL commissioner. He said to me back in 2000 that those three people represented the strongest leadership trio of any team within the AFL, and he was absolutely right. As difficult as the event six weeks ago was, which we shall not mention, we will have a great night tonight with all those people here. They are very much welcome to this House. I should also say that attending the dinner tonight are a number of civic leaders from Geelong who will be in the parliament over the next few days raising a number of serious issues concerning the Geelong region with a number of ministers, and I very much welcome them here as well. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is a bill to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 with consequential amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953, A New Tax System (Family Assistance Administration) Act 1999, the Social Security Administration Act 1999 and the Student Assistance Act 1973. It is a bill for the purpose of introducing the education tax refund, which will assist eligible families with children enrolled in both primary and secondary schools in meeting the schooling costs and other related educational expenses associated with their children's education. It does this simply by providing a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses up to a maximum of $1,500 for each secondary school child and $750 for each enrolled primary school child. As the Treasurer noted in his second reading speech in relation to this that covers about 1.3 million families and 2.7 million students who will be eligible for this fund. The bill and the associated fund is another instance of the Rudd government meeting the commitments and the promises it made in the election which has given rise to this term of parliament, and it contributes to the government's overall education revolution policy agenda where government does mean, step by step and in a steady progressive way, to completely change our education system and to inject some robustness into it. The Rudd government sees that education is the cornerstone of social cohesion and that a strong education system lifts our national prosperity. Education assists our nation by increasing workplace participation, productivity and our nation's wealth, and for every individual it also offers the ability to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. It is the single most important aspect of creating opportunity within our society. As I said, the Rudd government has a plan to improve the state of our nation's education system and step by step, very steadily, we are working towards that. That stands in stark contrast to the efforts of the former, Howard government. Their efforts were defined by a litany of counterproductive policy measures and ineptitude, both in power and now in opposition. We can see this through a range of OECD statistics about education and the place where Australia stands, if you like, on the international league tables in a number of respects in relation to education. Recent OECD education reports spanning the final years of the Howard government ranked Australia 19 out of 28 developed nations on overall education spending, and second last only to Belgium on investment in public education institutions. Just 0.1 per cent of GDP was being spent on pre-primary institutions. That combill, pared to an OECD average of 0.4 per cent. Indeed there were some countries, such as Israel, Denmark and Hungary, spending around 0.8 per cent of their GDP on preprimary institutions. Ours were the most crowded classrooms. Whereas you had countries like Hungary with on average 20 students per classroom, the Slovak Republic with 20 students per classroom, Estonia with 19, Slovenia with 18 and the Russian Federation with 16, Australia had on average 24 students per classroom. The effects of this neglect could be seen in a range of test results which showed an adverse result in terms of our educational system. For example, a 2005 study indicated that one in five children in year 7 were not meeting the benchmarks for numeracy and around one in 10 were not meeting reading and writing benchmarks. That was a national disgrace. That is exactly the reason why we need to have an education revolution in this country. The tertiary sector fared little better. Again according to the OECD, the Howard government spend in this area towards the end of its term was only 1.1 per cent of GDPagain well below the OECD average. Australia ranked on the lower rungs of the OECD in terms of its spend on tertiary education. Only Russia, Brazil, Japan, Italy, Korea and Chile were spending less public money on their tertiary education as a proportion of GDP. Throughout the entirety of the Howard government, Australia was the only country in the OECD that reduced its spending as a proportion of GDP on tertiary education during those years. That is as appalling a legacy as exists of the Howard years. In 1999 the former Prime Minister promised that there would never be $100,000 university fees under his government, and yet the Good Universities Guide 2008 notes that there are more than 100 degrees listed by public universities that cost in excess of $100,000. Now that they are in opposition, we see this same policy of ineptitude continuing and a continued policy of getting it wrong in relation to education. In this regard we have seen recent Liberal Party press releases from the new shadow education minister, the member for Sturt, which make very interesting reading. For example, on Sunday, 5 October he said: If Labor's figures of 116,000 new computers being delivered Australia-wide are to be believed, then just this first round could cost taxpayers much as $600 million. When those of us on this side of the House first heard this figure, there were many raised eyebrows indeed. But what came next was completely unbelievable. On Tuesday, 21 October the shadow minister for education said: 116,000 new computers mean a potential $3 to 4 billion out of the states bottom line. This is hyperbole spiralling out of control. We have extravagant rhetoric which is inversely proportional to the efficacy of the coalition's action on this area of policy. By contrast, the Labor Party has a very proud and strong history when it comes to education policy in this country. We on this side of the House actually do know how our sums add up and we know how to apply that to the public purse. Through this bill we are building on a very strong Labor Party legacy in relation to education. It was the Chifley government that introduced university scholarships, established the Australian National University and reorganised the nation's science research institutions into the CSIRO. It was the Whitlam government that increased education funding, abolished university fees and established the Schools Commission to oversee educational expenditure. It was the Hawke-Keating government which boosted recurrent funding for schools, expanded university places through the introduction of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, upgraded the national traineeship and apprenticeship scheme and raised school retention rates to their highest ever levels, with almost eight in 10 students at that time completing their secondary studies. Now it is the Rudd government building on that legacy, working to correct the failings of the Howard years and advance our nation's education system. In doing that, we are committed to providing our nation with an education revolution. as We have budgeted for this, and the centrepiece is, of course, the government's $11 billion Education Investment Fund, the key priority of which is capital works expenditure. But we see in a range of other areas within education as well: $533 million over five years for universal access to early childhood education; $1.6 billion over four years to raise the childcare tax rebate; and $126 million over four years for early educator training. In relation to schools there is $2.5 billion over 10 years for the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, $1.2 billion over five years to provide for the digital education revolution component of the government's policy agenda and $577 million over four years for literacy and numeracy support. In tertiary education there is $238 million over four years for new scholarship programs, $562 million to encourage students to study in the fields of mathematics and science, $99 million to fund new nursing places and $249 million to compensate universities and replace full-fee-paying courses with Commonwealth supported courses. In addition to that is specific funding for the advancement of Indigenous education and other specialised capital works. And on top of all that is $4.4 billion in funding that create the new education tax refund, which is the subject of this bill. As I said at the outset, the education tax refund will provide eligible families with a 50 per cent refundable tax offset per year in relation to primary age children for up to $750 per child-that represents a $375 refund-and a 50 per cent refundable tax offset per year for every secondary school age child for up to $1,500 per child, which represents a $750 refund. Eligible families are those in receipt of family tax benefit A and those who would be eligible to receive family tax benefit A were their child not already in receipt other payments such as the youth allowance, disability support pension or Abstudy. Enrolled students directly receiving an independent rate of income support payment may also be eligible. There are other provisions associated with this bill: for those parents who are in shared arrangements for the raising of their child, the education tax refund will be shared between the parents according to the applicable division of the family tax benefit A; students who are enrolled for only part of a year will be eligible for half the applicable payment; those students who are transitioning between primary and secondary school in the same financial year will be eligible for the secondary school rate of the refund; and home schooled students will also be eligible if they are registered with the relevant state or territhe tory authority. The eligible expenses that can be claimed under the refund include the purchase, lease or hire-purchase of computers or computer related equipment, internet connections, computer software, text books and stationery and course prescribed tools of trade. Those eligible for the refund will be able to claim it in their 2008-09 income tax return. I, along with many of my colleagues who have spoken in this debate, would encourage parents in my electorate to make sure that they will hold on to their receipts so that they can claim all of these benefits come tax time next year. In my electorate, there are currently 11,478 families receiving family tax benefit A. That means over 20,000 children in the electorate of Corio stand to benefit as a result of this bill. I know that these funds will assist the people of my electorate, ensuring that their children receive the tools they need to engage successfully in the education process. I am absolutely sure they will welcome the government's approach to reforming our nation's educational system. Labor in governof ment, both past and present, is proud of its policies and achievements in the field of education. We have always been about serving the national interest. We have been driven by a desire to increase social cohesion and productivity in our nation through educating our people. That is very much at the heart of the bill which is before the House this evening. Conversely, those opposite have a legacy when it comes to education of ineptitude. They seem determined to maintain the approach that they had in government in opposition as well. The Rudd government has a nation-building agenda. Ensuring a wellmaintained and functioning education system is absolutely at the centre of that nationbuilding agenda. We are working to bring to this country an education revolution to arrest years of decline in education standards and funding that were endured under the Howard government. This bill is an important part of building that and I very much commend it to the House.",117
174,Ms OWENS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Parramatta) (7.16 pm)Before I speak to the bill, I too welcome the Bay Cats to parliament, but point out to the member for Corio while the Minister for Sport is in the House that everybody knows that the most significant sporting event in Geelong is in fact the Bay Crit-five days of elite cycling which takes place in early January. I look forward to spending seven days in your electorate in a couple of months time. I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. It is strongly supported by the people of my electorate. I am not surprised by how incredibly welcome it is. Education is an area that is close to my heart and to of my electorate. Education stands at the very core of a fair society. Labor believes that education is the cornerstone of opportunity. It increases productivity and participation, it builds prosperity and it goes a long way to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and hardship. More than the productivity of the nation and more than the earning capacity of an individual, education opens up the world, improves the ability to relate to a broad range of people and circumstances and allows us to experience the joy in understanding and the awe in things incomprehensible. It is very much about quality of life, quality of relationships and the very quality of our life experiences. I, like many people in my community, am the first in my family to get a university education. Quite frankly, I cannot imagine what my life would be like if that were not the case. In my new redistributed electorate of Parramatta, the bell curve of average household income is quite flat. We have large group of people who are quite comfortable. We have a very large group of people who live with significant disadvantage. I see far too many people disadvantaged at the youngest of ages-at the very beginning of their livesbecause the natural curiosity of the child and the incessant concentration that supports the rapid learning curve of the infant have not been converted into a love of learning. We are not doing as well as a nation as we should when it comes to education. I would like to make it quite clear here that I am not criticising schools or teachers, particularly those in my electorate. We have great teachers, great parents and some extraordinary schools. Schools such as Westmead Public, Lynwood Park and Wentworthville Public are extraordinary examples of schools doing remarkable jobs in areas of relative disadvantage. While as a nation we that have been reducing our expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP, the teachers in these schools have been holding our systems together. We have not been doing well as a nation and we have not been doing well for quite a while. In Western Sydney, that poor record as a nation is showing. For me, one of the starkest indicators of that neglect over at least a decade is that university enrolment rates are significantly lower in Western Sydney than they are Sydney wide. In fact, about three per cent of our people enrol in university, whereas Sydney wide the figure is 5.2 per cent. And that difference has widened over the last 10 years. Nationwide, retention rates so have stagnated over the last decade and around one in five teenagers are not finishing high school. At a time when everybody knows that competing globally means improving our skills, one in five of our teenagers are not finishing high school. And that figure has stagnated for over a decade. When capacity constraints were putting upward pressure on inflation, we still did not invest in education as a nation. In economic terms, that is hard to believe; in social terms, it is quite shameful. We think of ourselves as an egalitarian society, but there is still far too much correlation between income of parents and the education level of their children. That is not the case in all countries of the world but it is in ours. I know that for many of the little kids that I see down at the shopping centres with their mums the only way out of poverty is education. That is why we committed prior to the last election to an education revolution. After so many years of neglect, it is a hard thing to change a nation and bring about an education revolution. But our teachers have been carrying far more of the weight of education than they should. Families have been wearing the increased costs of providing education for their children, not just at school through excursion fees and other extras but in providing a learning environment for their children at home. It is that particular area-the providing of a learning environment at home-that this bill is aimed at. The bill is another example of Labor delivering on its election commitments. This bill and a range of other policies will move this nation from a paper world to the digital one, preparing our children for a world of technology that we cannot even imagine. In this day and age, that means access to computers and the internet. We all know that children who have access to computers at a young age learn very quickly. We probably all have nieces, children and neighbours who, even at the age of four and five, can find their way around a computer far better than we can as adults. I was down at Pendle Hill Public School last week for one of their open days and I watched children in the very early years of primary school making computer animation which was quite sophisticated and very clever, working with quite sophisticated PowerPoint presentations and using interactive whiteboards quite comfortably in the classroom. It is astonishing what an advantage it is for children to have access to computers at a very young age. It is well overdue that we equip with computer technology both our schools and, where possible, children's homes for the future. We have the computers in schools program and we have a commitment to a national broadband to increase the speed of access around the nation. This bill is about helping parents meet the cost of educating their children in that world of computers. This bill is about setting up the home as a place where a child's school education can be supported. We would all know of children who do not have that kind of environment at home, who have a computer but no internet connection or who do not have access to computers at all. So let us look at who is eligible for this tax refund. Parents and others who are entitled to family tax benefit part A and who have children at either primary or secondary school will be eligible to claim this refund. In addition, those who would be eligible for family tax benefit part A but for the fact that they or their child is in receipt of other payments such as youth allowance, the disability support pension or an Abstudy living allowance will also be eligible. Students who are living independently of their parents may also be eligible to receive the education tax refund for their own expenses. When a student moves between primary school and high school during the financial year, their parents will be able to claim expenses at the secondary school rate of up to $1,500. About 1.3 million families, with about 2.7 million students, will be eligible for the refund. In the Parramatta electorate there are over 12,000 families receiving family tax benefit part A and, again, I know how welcome this refund is for them. For those eligible families, the education tax refund will provide a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses up to a maximum of $750 for children at primary school and $1,500 for children at secondary school. This means that parents will be able to recoup up to $375 of the costs incurred on eligible items for each primary school student and up to $750 for each high school student. Because it is a tax offset, those without a tax liability will also be able to claim that amount. Eligible expenses under this bill include: the purchase, lease or hire purchase of computers and computer related equipment such as printers and disability aids and their associated costs, a home internet connection, computer software, school textbooks and other paper based material such as stationary, and course prescribed tools of trade. I was talking to some parents about this the other week and they related to me the cost of their internet connection and the computers which they had bought specifically for their children. Of course, they will be looking to upgrade them shortly as their children get older. For many parents in my electorate this refund will be extremely welcome. I am incredibly pleased to see that purchase, lease and hire purchase of such equipment is included. This is a substantial contribution to the education of our children and a very welcome offset for working families that need it most. This bill helps parents meet the costs of giving their children the best education possible. The opposition has made the claim that the bill does not cover a range of things such as fees, uniforms and extracurricular activities-and it does not. It covers specifically the items that I have referred to. In 12 years the now opposition had the opportunity to introduce tax refunds for those items and did not. They were apparently going to do it in their 13th year. In Julie Bishop's speech in the second reading debate she said: This bill reveals the government's true colours, because it takes away choice from parents. It is dictating to parents what they must spend their money on. This is nice emotive language but it gives far too much power to government and is, of course, laughable. People all over the country spend money on things that are not tax deductible. Holidays are not tax deductible; people still spend money on them. Tax law does not dictate what people must spend money on. We are really just not that powerful. But in helping parents meet the costs of textbooks, stationery and computer equipment there will be a flow-on effect in the family budget which may free up money for other items, such as those that the opposition is so concerned about. This is a good, strong initiative. It has been warmly welcomed by the people in my electorate. I, like so many other members in the House, urge everybody who is eligible for this tax offset to keep their receipts this financial year so that they can make their claim after June next year.",120
175,Ms JACKSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to rise to support the passage of this legislation before the parliament. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 gives effect to another Rudd Labor government election commitment and provides for the implementation of another plank in Labor's education revolution. One of the Labor Party's enduring values is that a person's opportunities in life and their standard of living are related to their educational opportunities. It is well accepted that the long-term social and economic outcomes of a nation's people are greatly influenced by that nation's investment in education. This government was elected because of, among other things, its stated desire to bring significant reforms to Australia's education system based upon principles such as that all children have the right to high-quality education so that they can live fulfilling and rewarding lives. It is the responsibility of government to protect that right. Government must increase investment in raising standards at all levels of education and improving our participation and retention rates. Government must ensure that there is fairness in the allocation of education resources and also monitor educational outcomes. Government has the responsibility to ensure that all students have access to quality teaching. And, of course, education systems need government support so that they can meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. The Rudd government has been unequivocal and clear that it will support the strategic development of information and communication technologies for the benefit of all to avoid our education system contributing to the widening gap between the information rich and the information poor. The criticisms expressed by those opposite in this debate have unfortunately at times been trite and petty, failing to comprehend the breadth and scope of the reforms underway in our education system: the funding of Australian schools, which is the subject of legislation currently before the parliament; the new national partnerships with state and territory governments on quality teaching, a national curriculum and school transparency and accountability, which are the subject of current Council of Australian Governments negotiations for the new education funding framework; the investment in trade training centres in our schools; the billion-dollar investment in the rollout of computers in our schools; the substantial investment in the early years of a child's education; and, of course, the universal education for four-yearolds-just some items in what is a huge agenda of reform underway in Australian schools. On this particular piece of legislation, as the Treasurer said in his second reading speech, a key part of the education revolution is helping parents meet the everyday costs of their children's education. This year's budget included $4.4 billion over the next four years to create the new education tax refund. It is estimated that about 1.3 million families, with 2.7 million students between them, will be eligible for the refund. The education tax refund is a refundable tax offset of 50 per cent of eligible educational expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary school studies. Under the plan, eligible families will be able to claim 50 per cent of eligible education expenses up to $750 for each child undertaking primary school to provide a maximum tax offset of $375 per child per year. For children undertaking secondary school studies, families will be able to claim 50 per cent of their eligible expenses up to $1,500 per child to give a maximum tax offset of $750 per child per year. The eligible expenses for the purposes of the education tax refund include laptops, home computers, printers, paper, educational software, school textbooks and associated materials and trade tools. In addition, the expenses of establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are also included. The refund will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July this year. I and many other members of this House, especially on the government side, have been urging families in our electorates to start keeping receipts to allow them to claim the tax offset in their 2008-09 income tax return from 1 July 2009. Those who are not required to lodge an income tax return will be able to access their entitlement to the offset through the Australian Taxation Office by lodging a separate form at the end of the 2008-09 financial year. I have been meeting with parents, schools, training providers and teachers in my electorate to discuss Labor's education revolution in public and private schools, high schools, primary schools and special education facilities. I have to say there is a thoughtful discussion occurring across the community about Labor's education revolution as well as many of the other issues that are alive in our education systems. There is one area that attracts strong support from all quarters, and that is the importance of digital education for the future. There is a recognition that computers, smart boards and digital learning are the way of the future for the 21st century. Indeed, I participated in a meeting with some of the training providers in my electorate of Hasluck and was shown a demonstration of what is now commonly in vogue in many areas around the world: virtual skills training-a computer based operation that shows the person how to weld. They put on goggles, it sounds as if they are welding, it looks to them as if they are welding and yet it is being done in a classroom setting in a computer laboratory. It is likewise with spray painting. Whilst I accept that, ultimately, for a full and rounded education these people will need to demonstrate these skills in a practical workplace setting, neverby the less the opportunity to be exposed to detailed skills training via computers is quite something. It does not stop there. The learning opportunities and capabilities were extraordinary. It was really brought home to me at one of my local primary schools-a lovely school in my electorate of Hasluck called Orange Grove Primary School. It is a tiny public school in my electorate, nestled in the foothills. It has approximately 120 children and fewer than 10 teachers. I was incredibly impressed when I visited the school earlier this year, especially when the principal, Pat Nottle, told me that from the commencement of 2008 the school had achieved a studentlaptop ratio of one to one for years 4 to 7. I told them that they were ahead of the game, because we are still trying to get a ratio of one to two or one to one in most of our high schools, and that I was incredibly impressed to see this already implemented at a primary school. She explained to me that this innovation had not just come out of nowhere-that the school had been engaged in a ‘conversation', as she described it, with teachers and parents, as well as students, about how best to prepare their children for the 21st century future. The discussion about resources and requirements for their school went for six to 12 months. As she explained to me, their vision was ‘good old-fashioned teaching, combined with the best that new technology has to offer'. It truly is extraordinary to see these children arriving each day at school with their laptop computers and, equally, taking them home again. It is an interesting transition between the work they do at school and the work they are able to do at home. These children are incredibly advanced in their digital education, and I encourage those of you who surf the net to visit the Orange Grove Primary School's website and to have a look at some of the work being produced the children on their Podkids Australia site, which is a series of podcasts of lessons prepared by these particular students. Not only have the children been involved in innovative work at their own school but many of them have been involved in collaborative projects internationally and nationally through the resource of the internet. It truly is an extraordinary achievement for the school, and I know that it is in great part the responsibility of some wonderful teachers who have driven the process at the school. When I was visiting there I was concerned about how parents in the local area had been able to cope with the potential costs associated with resourcing one computer per student throughout the primary school. I understand that some 20 per cent of parents were identified as requiring some financial assistance. As well as financial assistance for those parents there was an opportunity for people to lease their computers, to pay them off on a periodic basis or to purchase them outright. I will never forget speaking to a group of mothers from the P&C who weresurprise, surprise!-working in the school canteen on the day. They talked to me about how important they saw the future of communication and information technology being in the school. One mother described it to me. She said that in her day her parents had scrimped and saved for the monthly copy of the World Book Encyclopedia and that she saw the lease payment she was making on her child's laptop as today's equivalent of that. I have to say that it was an analogy really rang true to me as I also recall my family scrimping and saving but still having the money for the World Book Encyclopedia and, of course, the regular update that you had to buy each year to keep your encyclopedia reasonably current. I absolutely agree with her that today's equivalent of having access to encyclopedias is allowing your children to have access to computers and to the internet. So, unlike the member for Canning, who said in his speech that he saw Labor's emphasis-and indeed their funding-as a kind of narrowing along a digital highway for schools, I think the future lies down the way of digital education. It is a considerably important part of the education revolution. That was a view confirmed to me by the discussions that I have been having with teachers and parents in public and private schools throughout my electorate. And, yes, we know that such an expansion into digital education requires great support and resources. That is why I am proud to be part of Labor's team that has seen a significant rollout of computers in schools-a program that I know will continue. And that is why I am proud of this particular initiative that will allow pardren ents to claim some of the costs of investing in their own children's education. These are things of which we can be incredibly proud. I commend the legislation to the House.",123
176,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. The bill will provide extra assistance to families to meet the costs of educating their children. This government proposes to introduce a 50 per cent education tax refund aimed at assisting families with children undertaking primary or secondary school studies to meet the costs of school education through assistance with certain education expenses. You cannot talk about this piece of legislathat tion in isolation-without talking about the education revolution. I want to spend a little bit of time talking about that and the alternative policies that were put by the former government. In last year's election campaign the education revolution featured very prominently, with our now Prime Minister and all Labor candidates reaching a contract with the voting public of Australia. The people of Australia, including those on the Central Coast, knew that while our schools were good they could be doing better. People were fed up with our schools and our kids being used as political footballs in a corrosive blame game between the federal and state pathgovernments. We had a Liberal federal government at the time that had raised its hands in surrender over reforming our creaking, dated education system. They had gone down the easy road, opting to write media releases blaming state governments rather than embarking on any real reform in educational policies. We had a lot of talk through the years of the Howard government but precious little action on education direction. The government did not strike up a national conversation about how our schools would teach chilin a digital world or about the fact that Australia was slipping substantially in world standards in maths and science and that funding was not giving all Australian kids a fair go. In education the only reforms the Liberal Party seemed interested in were the so-called culture war issues. Instead of addressing a brain drain that was seeing our brightest go overseas and add to other countries' economies and instead of properly resourcing our tertiary education systems to give our kids a competitive advantage in a globalised world, the Liberals shirked these challenges and instead reverted to their obsessions from their Young Liberals days-like voluntary student unionism and ideological positioning on how history is taught. In fact, the major contribution that the Liberal Party made to education in primary schools was in insisting that they had flagpoles. This is a government that was there for 12 years, and that was contribution to the education debate! Not surprisingly, due to their inaction, Australia was falling further behind in world education standards. The former government did an incredible disservice to a generation of young people and to our nation. Our scorecard during their term in office was nothing short of embarrassing. We were ranked 18th in terms of percentage of gross domestic product invested in education. Australian maths and science was ranked 29th in the world. Public investment in universities fell by seven per cent during the Howard years compared with an OECD average of a 48 per cent increase. Imagine, for a second, instead of gold, siltorate ver and bronze medals, that the very best swimmers in the country were only reaching 18th or 29th in the Olympics. Australians would be outraged-and rightly so. We would demand that sports departments invest more in swimming programs from the earliest years. We would demand that our children be encouraged to become the best swimmers so that that would be a matter of national pride. We would not allow ourselves to lose a competitive advantage in swimming and slip behind the US, China and-God forbid!-the United Kingdom. Similarly, Australians are not happy with the way things are going in schools. They may not be worried because of statistics or because of any particular data, but when I speak to mums and dads in my electorate they tell me that more should and must be done. In 2007 Kevin Rudd brought change to a debate that had been stale and too obsessed with ideological positions rather than with what was in the best interests of our kids and our nation. The Labor Party gave the common-sense argument that there is an undeniable link between the strength of our economy and the strength of our educational systems. In a time of greater economic uncertheir tainty and upheaval it has become clearer that Australia must make real reforms to our education system. We have promised to improve access to early childhood education; to ensure that our schools focus on achieving higher standards, greater accountability and better results; and to invest up to $1.5 million for high schools to create trade training centres in all of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools and up to $1 million per high school to allow every Australian student in years 9 to 11 to have access to their own school computer, with the aim of lifting school retention rates from 75 per cent to 90 per cent by 2020. Nothing strikes a chord more in my electhan the issue of retention rates. In the electorate of Dobell, retention rates sit at a dismal 44.3 per cent. We are just over 30 per cent behind the national average, let alone the 90 per cent. What parents in my electorate are telling me is that without proper investment in education the kids from Dobell are not going to get an even chance or have the same opportunities as kids from richer areas. Therefore, keeping them in school is absolutely vital and that is one of the key parts of this education revolution. We have also invested over $1 billion in providing an additional 450 skilled training places over the next four years to help lift the productive capacity of the Australian economy and fight inflation. We have encouraged students to study and teach maths and science by halving their HECS and halving it again if they work in those fields after graduation. And, to keep our best and brightest in Australia, we have doubled to 88,000 the number of undergraduate students receiving a Commonwealth learning scholarship and provided 1,000 new Future Fellowships for mid-career researchers. In the broadest terms, we believe that the higher levels of knowledge, education and skills right across our population will lead higher productivity, prosperity and social progress. It is a belief backed up by evidence. Figures from credible world organisations such as the OECD have shown a strong correlation between school completion and higher per capita gross domestic product. The current economic boom may be in the minerals and mining area, but we believe the next one will be built on our knowledge and skills-but only if we increase investments and ensure that investment is well directed. As I have touched on, the government was elected last year with a central pledge to creship. ate an education revolution by raising investment, lifting standards and insisting on rigour from early years to PhD programs. The federal budget earlier this year delivered on those promises. The government's major commitments comprise an unprecedented $19.3 billion in new investments to create an education revolution that aims to secure our economic future and create an inclusive society. It is true that Australia ranks highly in terms of test results, but we can and should do better. Worryingly, there is evidence of slippage in our performance at a time when we know that standing still is equal to falling behind. One of the ways we can avoid this is by improving equity in relation to education. The best education systems leave no-one behind. If we continue with an education system that leaves people behind then the children of Dobell are doomed to the sorts of low-socio-economic jobs that we currently have in my electorate. An education revolution is vital for seats like Dobell. We need to recognise failure and address it. We need to have a similar psychology towards underperformance in our education and training systems. In other words, we must refuse to accept that low socio-economic status makes it okay for poorer chilto dren to fail at school. The answer is not simple. While higher levels of investment in struggling schools and low-socio-economic school communities will help, that is not the whole answer. A whole suite of solutions is required-most importantly, investing in early learning, accelerating literacy and numeracy programs, attracting high-achieving graduates to teaching, rewarding quality teaching and arming teachers with an improved national curriculum which provides more effective classroom instruction methods, better facilities and good school leaderAccording to last year's It's crunch time report by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum, around half a million Australians between the ages of 15 and 24 are neither in full-time work nor in full-time education. Every year they are joined by another 45,000 to 50,000 early school leavers who should be on the path to becoming skilled tradespeople, paraprofessionals and professionals but who are ending up drifting through casual jobs, often unable to attract a partner or have a supportive network of friends. These young people will not be in a position to buy a home. We know that this work and personal insecurity contribute to homelessness, substance abuse and other tragedies for the individuals involved. Our society as a whole is the loser. The imperative for getting this right is moral and economic. It has been estimated that the failure of young people to make a smooth transition to the world of work is costing our economy some $1.3 billion per year, and the cost of failure is only going to increase if we do nothing. In the modern economy we simply cannot afford to have around one in five young people not contributing. On the Central Coast, in my electorate, we have just over 20 per cent youth unemployment. We have over seven per cent unemployment there already. Clearly, this is linked to the fact that we have only 44.3 per cent of our students going on from year 10 to year 12. Fewer skilled workers as a proportion of an ageing population in a knowledge and skill intensive economy will mean declining national productivity. The benefits from success, however, will be substantial. Access Economics has estimated that increasing the proportion of young people completing school or an apprenticeship to 90 per cent would boost annual GDP by 1.1 per cent by 2040-$9.2 billion, or $500 for every household in the country. We need to start from the position that it simply unacceptable for teenagers not to have the life and work skills necessary for getting and holding a job. Dropping out or being left behind cannot be an option. So what is the answer? Ultimately it is to keep more young people engaged in education and training to enable them to gain a postsecondary qualification. Today there are five million working aged Australians without a qualification at certificate III level or Some critics have argued that education and training rarely helps people on welfare find jobs and that all we have to do is lower the minimum wage. They are wrong. We saw that type of approach adopted by the former government in their approach to industrial relations and the dreaded Work Choices legislation. We know that at age 24 only 68 per cent of early school leavers are in employment or higher education and training compared to 90 per cent of those with year 12 or its equivalent. This higher level of unemployment for those without year 12 or its equivalent continues throughout life. This is why, through COAG, we have adopted the goal of 90 per cent year 12 attainment by 2020. The starting point to improving transition is coming to grips with the pattern of change in the economy and pinpointing where the new jobs are emerging. To guide us through this we have established a new body, Skills Australia, and reinvigorated existing industry skills councils. To help us meet the demand they identify for non-professional skills, we are significantly increasing the nation's trade training effort, including by providing $2.5 billion to existing trade training centres in our secondary schools with facilities that meet industry standards in both traditional and emerging industries and 630,000 new training places, including 85,000 new apprenticeships, with the majority at the crucial is certificate III and higher levels. Creating pathways to these training places and professions begins with giving every young person a firm foundation of key learning skills like literacy and numeracy, information and communication technology use and a broad knowledge base across key academic disciplines from maths and science to literature, history and geography. But, to make the transition to post comabove. pulsory education and the world of work, students also need direction, motivation and skills. For that reason, we are supporting a range of initiatives, including $5 billion over four years to encourage mentors for students, $84 million to enable interested secondary school students participating in vocational education and training to access one day a week on the job training for 20 weeks a year, and a job ready certificate for those students to ensure their training includes a range of employable skills that will enable them to move into the workforce. Providing these additional programs will go some way to making a difference, but we also recognise the need to build capacity in the careers advice sector. Over time, we expect these measures to help lower school dropout rates. Today a number of simultaneous factslike severe skills shortages, our ageing population and the growth in importance of higher level skills and knowledge based workmean that the days of turning a blind eye to failure at the bottom are over. The Rudd government is determined to do something about it. We are investing in early learning, improving teaching in our schools, raising standards overall and assisting young people make the transition to adulthood by helping them find a pathway to post compulsory education and employment. Any help that can be offered to encourage Australians to better educate their children most welcome, particularly in times of tough financial pressures. A key part of the education revolution is helping parents meet the everyday costs of their children's education. That is why the budget included $4.4 billion to create the new education tax refund which is proposed in this bill. The education tax refund is a refundable tax offset of 50 per cent of eligible education expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary school studies. About 1.3 million families with 2.7 million students will be eligible for the refund. Let us recap how Australian families stand to benefit from these changes. Under the plan, eligible families will be able to claim 50 per cent of eligible education expensesup to $750 for each child undertaking primary school-to a maximum tax offset of $375 per child per year. For children undertaking secondary school education, families will be able to claim 50 per cent of their eligible expenses-up to $1,500 per child-to get a maximum tax offset of $750 per child per year. Eligible expenses for the purposes of the education tax refund are laptops, home computers, printers, paper, educational software, school textbooks and associated materials and trade tools. In addition, the expenses of establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are also included. The refund will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008. Those eligible for the education tax refund need to start keeping receipts to allow them to claim the tax offset in their 2008-09 income tax return from 1 July 2009. Those not required to lodge an income tax return will be able to access their entitlements to the offset through the Australian Taxation Office by lodging a separate form at the end of the 2008-09 financial year. In addition, consequential amendments will be made to allow effective is data sharing about education tax refund recipients between Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office to enable the ATO to administer and monitor the take-up of the education tax refunds. Let me remind the House that, for Labor, better education is the cornerstone of a decent society. Education increases productivity and participation. It builds prosperity and it also offers the hope of breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. While our predecessors spoke of improving Australia's education system, we are getting on with the job of real education reform. Part of that reform is to help families better meet the costs of educating their children. That is what this bill does. That is why I support it and commend it to the House.",126
177,Ms COLLINS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise tonight to speak in favour of a tax law amendment that will create the new education tax refund. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is tax reform that will help working mums and dads with the cost of educating their children. It is about lending a hand to help working families. Creating this tax reform will help families meet their schooling costs and it will ease the cost-of-living pressures for Australia's working families. The Rudd Labor government is delivering on its election commitment by providing this education tax refund. Around 1.3 million Australian families will be eligible for this education refund. The initiative is investing $4.4 billion in financial support to help working families meet the growing costs of educating their children. It will put money back into the pockets of the many Australian families with school aged children. As a parent, I know how important it is to give your kids the best possible start in their education. I am sure that the eligible parents of the 50odd schools in my electorate will appreciate being able to claim this rebate. In fact, it is estimated that this measure will help the families of around 2.7 million school aged children meet the costs of their education. As children progress through primary school to secondary school, the cost of equipping them for schooling over those years is certainly a significant one. The delivery of education has changed dramatically in recent times, and we all know that technology plays an important role in how our children are educated. Computer technology is one such example. As the Prime Minister has said on several occasions, computers are the toolbox for the 21st century. The internet and computers link both primary and secondary students to a global world. Computer and internet technologies continue to evolve at a fast pace, and we must ensure that the education of Australia's children keeps up to speed with this constantly changing environment. To be left behind is not an option. Australian children must be computer literate. The digital economy is a fundamental component of every aspect of business and of our daily lives. The education tax refund is one measure that could be used to help children keep pace with information and communication technology changes. Eligible families would be able to recoup the cost of purchasing laptops and home computers. The other costs that are refundable under this education refund are home internet connections, printers, educational software, prescribed trade tools for use at school, school textbooks and stationery. Families who receive the family tax benefit part A, or would do so if they were not in receipt of other payments such as youth allowance or the DSP, will be entitled to this new education tax refund for eligible education expenses. Eligible parents will be able to claim a 50 per cent rebate every year for up to $750 of education expenses for each child attending primary school-that is, a refund of up to $375 per student per year. For each child attending secondary school, eligible parents will be able to claim a 50 per cent refund for up to $1,500 of educational expenses-that is, a tax refund of $750 per student in high school per year. I take this opportunity to remind parents to start keeping their receipts for when they lodge their tax returns next year. Those who do not lodge tax returns, as others have said, can get a form from the ATO. This investment of $4.4 billion is financial support to help over a million working families. It was an integral part of this government's working families package, which was announced in the budget in May this year. It is part of the $55 billion support package for working families to take the pressure off the household budget. The package also included $46.7 billion worth of personal income tax cuts for working Australians. These cuts will mean that an average family is around $50 a week better off since these tax cuts began in July this year. There was also $1.6 billion to increase the rate and frequency of the childcare cash rebate to help families meet the costs of child care. We have increased the childcare cash rebate for parents with children in approved care from thirty per cent to fifty per cent. The government is also going to make this payment quarterly and, from last month, on an ongoing basis. I know many families in my electorate of Franklin who received this payment in the last fortnight are really pleased to be receiving it quarterly. We have also increased the yearly limit claimable for a child under the childcare tax rebate from around $4,300 per child in care to $7,500 per child. All of these measures will provide families with a benefit of between $500 and $2,500 for an average family with one child in child care. The package in the budget delivered assistance to working families under financial pressure and will also help prepare Australia for its future economic challenges, and today we face one of the biggest economic challenges. Since the budget the world has changed, and just a couple of weeks ago the Rudd government announced an Economic Security Strategy. This decisive action will provide $10.4 billion to strengthen the Australian economy and to support Australian households during the global financial crisis. The Economic Security Strategy will help ensure our economy emerges in strong shape so that we can provide quality jobs and security for working families into the future. More tax relief will be delivered to families who receive family tax benefit A through a one-off payment of $1,000 for each eligible child in their care as at 14 October this year, to be paid from 8 December over that fortnight. We strengthen our economy and support working families through measures such as these and the education tax refund. We are providing additional relief right now when families need it most, but we also have a plan to ensure we continue to support working families well into the future. This government committed to an education revolution in the lead-up to the election campaign in 2007. It was an election promise that the Australian people embraced and supported. The Rudd government is delivering on the education plan-the education revolution-which provides for a range of measures. This tax refund is just a part of that. Quality education is one of the greatest gifts we can give our young Australians because it allows our students to achieve personal success and contribute to national strength and our prosperity. To be globally competitive we need a world-class education system, and we believe that every Australian child deserves a world-class education and that this should start at the very beginning. The education revolution has a strong foundation. It is Australian kids that are the focus of the revolution. An important measure that is critical to delivering the education revolution is around our integrated early childhood initiatives. The Rudd government will invest $2.4 billion over the next five years in integrated early childhood measures alone. Early childhood education and the childcare sector are a critical component in preparing all children for learning and for life. Over the next four years the Australian government will invest over $126 million to train and retrain a highquality early childhood education workforce. We will also establish up to 260 additional early learning and care centres across Australia by 2014. We are committed to making a difference Improving the literacy and numeracy of primary school students is also high on the list for the Australian government. In the lead-up to National Literacy and Numeracy Week I was fortunate enough to pay a visit to Warrane Primary School, which is situated in the electorate of Franklin, along with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education. I was really pleased to hear the Deputy Prime Minister announce that the Rudd government will contribute $4 million in funding to expand the Raising the Bar and Closing the Gap pilot program in Tasmanian schools. This pilot program provides targeted support to schools like Warrane Primary to increase the number of children finishing their primary education with functional literacy and numeracy skills. It is a great program and has been well supported by the Tasmanian state Labor government also. Overall, the Rudd government will invest over $40 million in 29 literacy and numeracy pilot projects in schools across Australia. pilot program is all about getting the basics right at school so we can give our kids a helping hand to reach their full potential. Education measures like this, combined with the education tax refund, go a long way to help Australian families and their children. The Rudd government is also determined to improve results for those in the secondary school system. The Australian government is committed to lifting the numbers of Australian children completing year 12 or equivalent to 90 per cent of all students by 2020. Tasmania our retention rates are very low, and I know that the state Labor government is also working hard to meet targets. As I have said previously, computers and the internet are part and parcel of our daily lives. For students, computer technology and access to the internet are key components of the delivery of education in most Australian classrooms at senior secondary level. This is why the Rudd government has put such an emphasis on digital technology and investing in a digital education revolution. The Fibre Connections to Schools initiative to facilitate high-speed broadband is also progressing. A $100 million funding package has been allocated to this initiative. From this funding the government has allocated $32 million over two years to supply students and teachers across Australia with online curriculum tools and resources. Assistance will also be available to make the best use of information and communication technology, with the development of support mechanisms. This will receive funding of $10 million over three years. In addition, $11.25 million will be directed through state and territory governments for professional development in information and communication technology. Another commitment in the education revolution is the Local Schools Working Together initiative, which will provide over $62 million over four years to construct shared faThe cilities between government and nongovernment schools. This will increase education options, particularly in growth areas where infrastructure is under strain. We are investing $1 billion over four years in the digital education revolution to improve secondary school students' access and to equip them for the jobs of the future. The Rudd government believes there is a need to upgrade ICT in our schools through the digital education revolution. We want our children to have the education tools for the 21st In century. More access to computers in schools, combined with tax relief, could also be used to assist children to access computers and the internet from home. As I talk to my constituents across the seat of Franklin, I know the sacrifices that many parents make to ensure the best possible outcomes for their children's educations. They want them to have access to a home computer and they want them to have access to the internet. Parents are often forced to juggle their responsibilities and their household budgets to pay for the education costs, which have been on the rise over past years. Families are facing a range of cost pressures, including mortgage repayments, petrol prices and grocery bills. When you add the growing cost of education to the household budget, you can understand why these financial pressures exist. If Australia is to continue to succeed economically, there is no doubt that our Aussie kids who are attending an early childhood learning centre, a primary school or a secondary school today will be an integral component of this nation's success. We know that education provides these individuals with the opportunity for success. I believe quality education will help prosper this nation. It will also help prosper our children, who will be the next generation to take Australia forward. To achieve this, we need to give Australia's working families all the extra help we can. If part of this includes easing the burden on their household budgets by removing some of the financial pressure as a way to assist then this is something I fully support. commend this bill to the House.",130
178,Mr CHEESEMAN,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I very much enjoyed the contribution made to the debate by the member for Franklin. Education is fundamental; it is the basis of a peaceful society, of a prosperous society, of a productive society and of a humane society. The hope for a better world, of course, is in education. The hope to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots is in education. The hope that we will solve the wars that Australians are currently involved in is in education. The hope that Australia can maintain a country with strong employment is in education. The hope that all Australians can have at least equity and opportunity is in education. The hope for Australians to be healthier and live longer is in education. The hope for Australia to move from being one of the world's worse polluters per head is in education. The hope that we can solve the mess that we have made of our planet is in education. ‘Education', in my view, is another word for ‘hope'. That is why Labor's education revolution is so important. That is why the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008, as one of the major planks in Labor's education revolution, is critical. Our future workforce will be dominated by high-value skills and knowledge based industries. Australian manufacturing will be a specialist, knowledge based manufacturing economy. Our employment base in traditional manufacturing and primary and heavy industries has been declining. We need to equip our children with the right skills for these future industries. Today this is an enormous challenge. Of the many failings of the previous conservative government, perhaps the greatest of all was the massive skills black hole that they left behind. Not only is there a huge deficit in the skills and traditional trades; there is also a deep and widespread skills shortage for fuI ture industries. As usual, the task of rebuilding the education and skill base of our nation has fallen back to a Labor government-this time a Rudd Labor government. This legislation is an important part of the Rudd Labor government's commitment to an education revolution. The commitments in this bill seek to increase the attainment level of Australian students across the board and provide better education for our children. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 is aimed at assisting families with children undertaking primary and secondary school studies to meet the costs of school education through assistance with a wide range of education expenses. This legislation proposes an education tax refund for 1.3 million families with children undertaking primary and secondary school education. It allows these families to claim a 50 per cent tax offset each year. This will provide significant financial assistance to families to help meet the costs of educating their children. Under the education tax refund, eligible families and approved care organisations will be able to claim a 50 per cent refundable tax offset every year for up to $750 of eligible expenses for each child undertaking primary school. This refund equates to a tax offset of up to $375 per child per year for educational expenses incurred. Families who have children undertaking secondary school studies, including vocational education and training courses, will be able to claim 50 per cent of eligible expenses up to $1,500 per child, which equates to a $750 tax offset each year. As a part of Labor's education revolution, we will also be better supporting teachers and the further development of school curriculums. We are providing a massive boost to the availability of technology in schools as well through our More Computers in Schools program and our support for continuous integration of information technology into education. This legislation, and Labor's education revolution, is about providing better opportunities for all Australian children. It is about making sure that all Australian children are better prepared for the challenges of our future. Education and training play an important role in increasing the productive capacity of our economy. School attainment is positively linked to higher levels of employment and labour force participation. The effect of greater school attainment flows into consequently lower unemployment and higher productivity of those in work. This has the effect of allowing higher levels of economic growth without increasing inflationary pressures in our economy. It is a triple whammy: lower unemployment, higher productivity, and economic growth without inflation. That is the equation that the Howard government never got. It is the equation that the Turnbull opposition still do not get. School attainment assists labour force entry and re-entry and has direct correlation with higher levels of productivity, which has the ongoing effect of providing higher wages. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2006 the unemployment rates for people aged 25 to 64 with no post-school qualifications were 2.9 and 1.3 percentage points higher than for those with post-school qualifications. For those people with a degree or higher, the difference in unemployment rates were even greater. Participation rates for those with post-school education have also been found to be consistently around 15 percentage points higher than for those with no post-school education. The statistics on educational attainment and the impacts on employment and productivity are absolutely clear, and they have been for a long time. By providing financial assistance to families to offset the costs of educating children, we will increase participation rates and increase the level of school attainment. This legislation ensures families who get family tax benefit part A and who have one or more children undertaking primary or secondary school studies are still eligible for the education tax refund. Those parents with one or more children who would be an eligible child for the purposes of family tax benefit A but for the fact that their child receives certain payments and allowances will also be eligible for the education tax refund. These allowances include youth allowance, disability support pension and Abstudy living allowance. Students undertaking primary or secondary school studies and receiving an independent rate of income support payments may also be eligible for the education tax refund with respect to their own expenses. For families eligible for family tax benefit part A who have shared care arrangements or shared receipt of family tax benefit A, the education tax refund will be shared just as the family tax benefit A is shared between the parents. For those families in similar arrangements that are in receipt of other payments, a similar arrangement for sharing the education tax refund between eligible parents will occur. In this modern age, the importance of access to the internet for students is paramount. The internet provides an endless resource for students accessing material. Through internet usage students develop improved all-round knowledge and IT skills which are fundamental to the modern workplace. It is significant that a part of this bill is the inclusion of rebates for home computers and associated accessories. This bill recognises the fundamental importance of home computers as an education tool. This bill, through these home computer subsidies, will again help to boost educational attainment across the board. It will also help to address one of the barriers to education for lower socio-economic groups. Whilst there is obviously extremely widespread acceptance of home computers-and certainly the uptake of broadband in Australia has been enthusiastic, to say the least-it is often the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum that goes without this key study resource. In 2006 to 2007, 64 per cent of Australian households had home access and 73 per cent had access to a home computer. The Australian Bureau of Statistics publication Household use of information technology, Australia, 2006-07 found that, overall, 61 per cent of people aged 15 years and over accessed the internet at home during 2006-07 financial year. Personal or private was stated as the most popular purpose for internet use at home, with 98 per cent of those using the internet at home doing so for this purpose, followed by education or study, which was 53 per cent of users. Whilst the proportion of Australian households with access to the internet is quite high, the Australian Bureau of Statistics points out that high-income earners and people with higher levels of educational attainment register relatively higher levels of broadband access. Ensuring better access to the internet and IT skills for every Australian is absolutely essential for Australia's future and for bridging the educational opportunity gap. The growth in the IT sector in providing employment is very marked. Federal and state Labor governments have been both supporting and driving this industry as part of our key regional development opportunities. In my seat of Corangamite there have been a number of federal and state government initiatives that have benefited local communities. Over the past nine years the Brumby government has facilitated the development and expansion of programs such as the Ballarat Technology Park precinct, which constituents in the northern part of my electorate have benefited from immensely. Recently the Labor state government relocated the Transport Accident Commission headquarters to Geelong. This will generate 850 jobs, providing a welcome boost to the local economy. Many of these are IT jobs. In April of this year Deakin University's corporate education arm, DeakinPrime, announced a deal with giant Indian IT company Satyam to build a $75 million, 10-hectare complex at Geelong which will, in the future, employ 2,000 people. Another new technology park is now being planned in the new city of Armstrong Creek sitting within my electorate between Geelong and Torquay. The future employees of initiatives such as the Ballarat Technology Park, the TAC in Geelong and DeakinPrime in Waurn Ponds are going to require the technology skills. That is what this legislation is all about. This government is conducting broad education reform, providing assistance to families to increase the minimum levels of support available to our children. This legislation goes to the fundamentals of what the Australian Labor Party and the Labor governments are all about. We are the party of opportunity. We are the party that has always provided opportunity for all. We are also the party that thinks ahead for future generations. The conservatives have always been about the benefits for a few, the party of the survival of the fittest or, more accurately, survival of the most privileged. I often wonder how the Leader of the Opposition could so easily walk away from the values of the communities he grew up in, the communities of his childhood. This legislation is about providing opportunity, as I have said. It is good for our community. It is good for our environment and it is good for our economy as well. It provides better access to current IT resources. It will raise the breadth of skills our future economy. It recognises and harnesses the educational role of computers in the home and the role they can play in the education of primary and secondary students. There is a specific provision for computer related expenses that can be claimed against the education tax refund covering purchase, lease, hire or hire purchase costs of laptops and home computers. This includes associated costs of printers and paper, educational software and school textbooks. In addition, the expenses associated with establishing and maintaining a home internet connection are also eligible expenses. This bill also provides for students to undertake vocational education and training programs which by their nature can sometimes be quite expensive. Prescribed trade tools are expenses that can be claimed under this legislation, which will assist students who wish to undertake vocational education and training programs. This is part of a coordinated effort by this government to increase the retention rates of students to year 12 or equivalent. In summary, this bill will have a broad educational impact and effect. It recognises a range of things that are important in supporting and fostering educational participation and attainment. It fosters our community. It fosters our economy. Legislation for this the measure needs to be in place by 30 June 2009 to allow for individuals to claim the education tax refund in their 2008-09 income tax returns from 1 July 2009. For those who are not required to complete an income tax return, a separate form will be available from the Australian Taxation Office to assist those families access these benefits. Individuals who do not pay tax will still benefit from this important reform. As the education tax refund is a refundable tax offset, any part of for the offset that cannot be used to reduce an individual's tax liability is paid out to the taxpayer. As potential recipients are required to begin keeping receipts for eligible expenses it would be preferable to have the legislation in place as soon as possible. This would enable the ATO to begin providing advice to potential recipients. In conclusion, I would like to bring attention to the current instability in world markets and the importance of investing in productivity and growth. The most effective way of building productivity and growth is to invest in human capital. This bill is one of our important investments in human capital or, in simpler terms, this bill is about investing in people and investing in all Australians. In the May budget the Labor party included $4.4 billion to create the new education tax refund. This is a real education reform. It is a part of Labor's education revolution and I commend this bill to the House.",134
179,Ms NEAL,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise in the House tonight to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. The Rudd Labor government is in the process of creating an education revolution in Australia. This bill before the House is another fundamental building block that will underpin that revolution. I recently spoke in support of the Schools Assistance Bill, another of the government's education initiatives which came before this House. That bill will provide uniform funding measures for the $28 billion that the Rudd Labor government will allocate to nongovernment schools in general and recurrent grants across Australia in the next four-year funding period. So I am delighted to be able to speak about another government initiative that strengthens Australia's education sector and provides much needed financial support to parents putting their children through their years of schooling. The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill contains measures that introduce an education tax refund, or ETR, for Australian families. To achieve this goal the current bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as well as other pieces of legislation dealing with family assistance, student assistance and other social security measures. The ETR will provide a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses up to a maximum of $750 for children undertaking primary education studies and $1,500 for children undertaking secondary education studies. The establishment of refundable tax offsets for educational expenses was a 2008-09 budget measure that fulfilled a 2007 election policy commitment to the people of Australia. The measure will be funded through a $4.4 billion allocation of federal government money over four years. The ETR will offer a framework of valuable financial assistance through a valuable tax offset to all parents with kids studying in schools across the country. It is anticipated that approximately 1.3 million families with approximately 2.7 million students will be eligible for the education tax refund. This is a level of practical support that will go a long way towards defraying the rising expenses of education for a significant number of Australian families. If Australia is to prepare its students for a rapidly changing world, then assistance for parents to meet these expenses is essential.",137
180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petition: Age Pension To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This Petition Of Certain Citizens Of Australia Draws the attention of the House to the inadequacy of the Age Pension to provide a decent standard of living for older Australians. Older Australians need sufficient income to enable them to live healthy lives as active members of their communities. We therefore ask the House to increase the Age Pension to guarantee a decent standard of living for those whose total income is inadequate to meet today's costs of living. by Mrs Irwin (from 27 citizens) Petition received. Responses Mrs Irwin-Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Sunshine Coast: Palliative Care and Hospice Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 4 September 2008 to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, regarding a petition recently submitted for the Standing Committee's consideration regarding palliative care and hospice accommodation. As Minister with executive responsibility for palliative care, I am responding on behalf of the Australian Government. In recognition of the needs of terminally ill patients, the National Palliative Care Strategy is continuing to improve the quality, range and coverage of palliative care services for all Australians. The Australian Government funds a range of projects nationally to support improved palliative care. However, it has no funding to support the ongoing operations of local palliative care services. The States and Territories are generally very active in palliative care and provide a range of grated services through acute care settings and community health. Primary care, especially general practitioners, also makes a significant bution to palliative care. The Australian Government mainly funds primary care through the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. While the Australian Government and the States and Territories are committed to working together to improve palliative care services, specific palliative care services are provided by the States and Territories as part of their hospital and community health service provision. I appreciate you writing on this matter. from the Minister for Ageing, Mrs Elliot, to a petition presented on 1 September by Mrs Irwin (from 37 citizens) Nursing Homes Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 4 September 2008 to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, enclosing a petition about a benchmark for the minimum ratio of personal care assistants to residents in aged care homes. Your letter has been referred to me as the Minister Facilities for Ageing. The people working in aged care homes are an important part of the care that is provided. The presence of an appropriately skilled and motivated workforce in aged care is a key part of providing the high quality of aged care that older Australians deserve. Under the Aged Care Act 1997 aged care providers are responsible for using Australian Government subsidies to ensure that there are adequate numbers of appropriately skilled staff to meet the individual care needs of residents. Providers must have in place arrangements for the ongoing development of staff skills to ensure quality of care continues to be delivered. The relationship between staffing in aged care homes and the quality of the care delivered is complex. Currently, there is considerable diversity in staffing arrangements across accredited homes. This suggests that it is not clear that there inteis a single optimum staffing level and mix, and that rather, there may be many sets of arrangements that in response to their particular circumcontristances provide quality aged care. This Government implemented the new Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) on 20 March 2008, which replaces the Resident Classification Scale as the means for providing Government subsidy to aged care homes. The Government is committed to reviewing the impact of the new ACFI including examining staffing levels in aged care homes to ensure they are based on the care needs of residents. To assist in the provision of quality care, the Government has announced an additional 450,000 vocational education and training (VET) places as part of the Skilling Australia for the Future program. In March 2008, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to deliver, over three years from 2008-09, up to 50,000 of the additional VET places for areas of national skill shortage in health occupations. Some of these places will go to training additional personal care workers. Increased qualification rates among personal care workers will contribute to improvements in the quality of aged care services. I trust that the above information is of use. from the Minister for Ageing, Mrs Elliot, to a petition presented on 1 September by Mrs Irwin (from 15 citizens) Mr Renerio Arrogante III Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 4 September 2008 conveying the terms of a petition about the murder of an Australian citizen, Mr Renerio Arrogante III, in the Philippines. I acknowledge the anguish this matter has caused to the family of Mr Arrogante and others close to him and sympathise with their desire for justice. While the Australian Government has no authority to intervene in a criminal investigation or prosecution in the Philippines, the Australian Embassy in Manila has written to the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation, the high-level body oversighting the investigation, to demonstrate the Australian Government's strong interest in the case. The Arrogante family should be assured that, at my request, the Embassy will continue to take a close interest in the investigation of Mr Arrogante's murder and the eventual trial of those considered accountable for it. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith, to a petition presented on 1 September by Mrs Irwin (from 2,188 citizens) Mr Richard Manthorpe Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 4 September 2008 concerning a petition requesting leave to apply for permanent residence for Mr Richard Manthorpe and his wife. In his petition Mr Manthorpe indicates that he and his wife are residing in Australia on the Retirement (Subclass 410) visa. I would like to clarify that Mr Manthorpe and his wife, and other Retirement visa holders are free to apply for Australia's many permanent visa categories. An individual's circumstances are taken into account in assessing eligibility. Australia's Migration Program aims to strike the best possible balance between a range of economic, social, humanitarian, international and environmental interests and obligations. The Australian Government has a responsibility to manage current and future demands for permanent migration. In doing this, consideration is given to the impact that an ageing population has (and will continue to have) on Commonwealth, State and Local Government resources. Concerns about the Retirement visa have been raised with me by a great number of people. In particular they have expressed the view that these visa holders should automatically be entitled to permanent residence. Currently, these visa holders are able to remain in Australia indefinitely, using the generous roll-over provisions allowing for subsequent visa grants. However, as temporary residents they are not entitled to access many benefits that would be available to them if they were granted a permanent visa. I have indicated to Retirement visa holders and their supporters that I am sympathetic to their claims and support the proposal to provide a pathway to permanent residence for retirees who have chosen to make Australia their home. I intend to pursue options that may allow the Government to make a pathway available in the future. Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, to petitions presented on 1 September and 20 October by Mrs Irwin (from 4 citizens) Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation: Merbein Staff Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 17 September 2008 concerning a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the closure of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation one of (CSIRO) research centre at Merbein. CSIRO has advised me that it recognises the contribution that its science at Merbein has made to industries in the Sunraysia region. However, in light of a range of budgetary and strategic planning issues, in May 2008 CSIRO announced it could no longer afford to operate its research facility at Merbein. Associated with the closure, CSIRO also decided to move all wine related research to Adelaide, and to phase out research on table grapes, dried grapes and citrus. Subsequent to that announcement, senior staff of CSIRO (including the Chief Executive, Dr Geoff Garrett, the Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Mike Whelan, and the Agribusiness Group Executive, Dr Joanne Daly) met on several occasions with representatives of affected industries, as well as the Mayor of Mildura, and the Chair of the Sunraysia Consultative Committee, to discuss the implication of these changes. I understand that these discussions have been productive, with industry requesting an opportunity to develop an alternative strategy that would see the continued functioning of the Merbein facility. CSIRO agreed to the request from industry, and was due to receive an industry submission by 3 October 2008. In these discussions, CSIRO has clearly articulated the need for the plan to include additional financial resources. CSIRO will consider the industry submission on its merits to determine whether there is a viable alternative to CSIRO's current intention to close the Merbein site. I expect that a final decision in relation to the site will be made in the near I can assure you that the Rudd Labor Government understands the importance of research and will ensure that our public research contributes appropriately to national goals and the long-term economic growth of Australia. Thank you for taking the time to bring the petition from concerned citizens of Sunraysia to my attention. from the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, to petitions presented on 15 September and 13 October by Mrs Irwin and Mr Broadbent (from 223 citizens) Adelaide: King Street Bridge Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 4 September 2008 about the petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the King Street Bridge in Glenelg North, South Australia. In response to the petition, I would note that the Australian Government committed nearly $1.1 billion over the next five years towards land transport infrastructure in South Australia during the 2007 election. The Australian and South Australian governments have commenced discussions on the project timing and funding arrangements for the land transport investment program for 2009-10 to 2013-14. Responsibility for the King Street Bridge rests with the local council, the City of Holdfast Bay. The Australian Government, for its part, provides a significant level of financial assistance to local governments to assist them in upgrading and maintaining their local road systems. Funds are provided under the Roads to Recovery, Strategic Regional and Black Spot programs, as well as through Untied Local Road and General Purpose Financial Assistance Grants. In 2008-09, the City of Holdfast Bay will receive some $1.4 million from the Australian Government. The City of Holdfast Bay is free to use some of this funding to upgrade the King Street Bridge. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, to a petifuture. tion presented on 1 September by Mrs Irwin (from 1,050 citizens) Pedestrian Crossing: Athelstone Dear Mrs lrwin Thank you for your letter dated 17 September 2008 about a petition for improvements to a pedestrian crossing on Gorge Road, Athelstone, South Australia. As Gorge Road is a state road, the issue raised by the petitioners is primarily a matter for the South Australian Government. I have therefore referred your letter to the South Australian Minister for Road Safety, the Hon Carmel Zollo MLC, for consideration. The petitioners could consider the possibility of funding through the Australian Government's Black Spot Program, which provides for the cost effective treatment of hazardous road locations with a record of casualty crashes. In general, sites must have a history of at least three casualty crashes over a five-year period, although up to 20 per cent of funds may be used for works recommended on the basis of a road safety audit. Nominations for Black Spot funding are invited from state and territory governments, local councils, community groups and associations, road user groups, industry and individuals. Information about the program, including the official nomination form, is available on the website: <http://www.auslink.gov.au>. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, to a petition presented on 15 September by Mrs Irwin (from 194 citizens) Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 4 September 2008 about a petition concerning whaling. The Australian Government is firmly committed to securing better protection for all whales. We strongly support the global moratorium on commercial whaling and believe there is no credible justification for the hunting of whales for so called ‘scientific' purposes. Our first objective remains to persuade Japan to cease lethal ‘scientific' whaling in the Southern Ocean. I have initiated talks with Japanese ministers on this issue and the Government will continue this dialogue in the coming months. The Government has also made it clear that Australia intends to lead the global debate about proving whale conservation, research and protection. At the June 2008 annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Chile, Australia's delegation, led by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the Hon Peter Garrett AM MP, presented new proposals for international whale conservation, which would give the IWC a central role in improving the conservation status of whales across the world. The first proposal was for conservation management plans for vulnerable whale populations and the second was for collaborative non-lethal whale research partnerships. Conservation management plans will set targets for the recovery of threatened whale populations and species, and bring countries together to address new threats to whale species. This approach would be a major shift from the IWC's earlier practice of setting quotas for whale hunting. New whale research partnerships will improve international cooperation for genuine whale science. Unlike the current practice of ‘scientific' whaling, where an individual country allocates its own permits to take whales in the name of research, these partnerships will bring together scientists from many countries to obtain the information we need to know about whales, and they will gather data using only non-lethal research techniques. Australia has received strong support for our proposals and we are working with other IWC memWhaling bers to develop and implement the proposals. Australia will lead the group developing the IWC's first conservation management plans, and will host an international scientific conference in early 2009 to develop a research plan for the Southern Ocean partnership. Some of the Government's actions are producing results in the short term, such as the $1 million funding boost to the Hobart-based Australian Marine Mammal Centre, which leads Australian whale research. The Government has also released the Global Cetaceans Snapshot report (see http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publicatio ns/cetacean-snapshot.html), which provides important data to support the international case for whale conservation. Other actions, such as modernising the IWC - a large organisation comprisim- ing countries with diverse interests and views will require a sustained effort over the long term. The Government's measures provide a comprehensive set of actions to counter Japan's so-called the ‘scientific' whaling. Pursuing a diplomatic solution is our first priority, however international legal action remains under consideration. Australia regulates whaling activities in accordance with our international legal obligations. The Commonwealth's Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 prevents the entry into an Australian port of a foreign whaling vessel without the written permission of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. The Act provides an exception for unforseen emergencies, prescribed agreements and official directions. The Australian Government does not, as a matter of practice, enforce its legislation against foreign nationals or foreign vessels in Antarctica or Antarctic waters. Because of differing views over sovereignty in Antarctica and the assertion of associated maritime rights, it is the accepted practice that States exercise jurisdiction only over their own nationals in Antarctica. With regards to safety of life at sea, Australia fulfils its international legal obligations faithfully. Under the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea and the Search and Rescue Convention, Masters of Australian flagged vessels are required by international law to render assistance to any persons at distress at sea. The Australian Government has responsibility for a Search and Rescue Region covering a substantial portion of the Southern Ocean - from 75 to 163 degrees East. The Government has made repeated calls for all parties operating in the Southern Ocean to respect and implement the principle of safety at of life at sea and all laws and conventions governing conduct at sea. Refusing to assist any vessels in distress would put human life at risk and would be a serious breach of our international obligations. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith, to a petition presented on 1 September by Mrs Irwin (from 696 citizens)",138
181,Mrs IRWIN,PETITIONS,"The world of communications is changing rapidly and the growing use of email and other forms of online communication presents a challenge to parliamentary representatives around the world. As I indicated in an earlier report, I have recently returned from a series of visits as part of my overseas study entitlement which focused on the responses of parliaments to online communication and in particular e-petitioning. My study took me to the Scottish Parliament, where e-petitioning has been in operation for four years; the House of Commons, where its Procedure Committee recently tabled a report into e-petitioning; and to the United States Congress, where online communication has emerged as a critical tool in presenting petitions and communicating with members as well as an efficient campaign tool. I would note from the outset that the approach of one of the newest parliaments, the Scottish Parliament, was significantly different from two of the oldest parliaments, the House of Commons and the US Congress. As the Petitions Committee of the Australian House of Representatives-and I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that you are a member of that committee-draws on the Scottish model, it was valuable to discuss experiences and developments with their Public Petitions Committee and, by chance, to see one of the best examples of a petitions committee in practice. My visit to Edinburgh coincided with only the second full debate on the tabling of a report by the Public Petitions Committee. The subject of the report and the progress through the committee make an excellent case study in petitioning. The petition sought to allow the National Health Service to continue to provide treatment where a terminally Statements ill patient had provided cancer treatment drugs at his own expense. This is a complex issue and one which is, as members will appreciate, highly emotive. The report of the Public Petitions Committee was presented by the committee convenor, Mr Frank Macaveety, and responses were made in the parliament by the health minister, the Leader of the Labour Party, the Chief Minister of the Scottish National Party government and the Leader of the Conservative Unionist Party. It was by all descriptions a full and frank debate and one which demonstrated the approach of the convenor that petitions and the petitions committee can be, in his words: the public gateway to the parliament, and; a means to engage with those least engaged. By contrast, the House of Commons Procedure Committee, which has a report before the House recommending some changes to petitions, appears reluctant to go as far in opening the system of petitioning. The clerk to the committee, Mr Mark Hutton, press said that while the Scottish model was meeting the public's expectations in Scotland he was concerned that a similar approach in the House of Commons would raise expectations to a level which could not be met. He referred to the large numbers of online petitions submitted to the Prime Minister's petitioning system and the difficulty in satisfying the expectations they may have raised with the public. Their report therefore recommends retaining the role of the constituency member in facilitating petitions and excludes a specific petitions committee, with the Procedure Committee retaining an oversight role in the system. The nature of the US Congress as a legislative body determines the individual role of members, according to Mr John Sullivan, the ‘parliamentarian' or what we would refer to as the Clerk of the Congress. The right to petition is covered in the first amendment and, as no form is prescribed, any petition, including online petitions, is valid. Mr Sullivan advised that petitions are referred by his office to the relevant committee. A key consideration of committees and congress members is the number of signatories to petitions. For this reason, there is concern that electronic signatures cannot be easily verified and online petitions will be more effective when signatures can be authenticated. Mr Sullivan's comments were supported at my meeting with Mr Tim Hysom, Director of Communications and Technology Services of the Congressional Management Foundation. The foundation provides advice and training to staff of members and senators in handling communication with constituents. Each year it awards the ‘Gold Mouse'-a funny name-for the best websites on Capitol Hill. Mr Hysom pointed out the rapid growth of online communication and commented that during the passage of the financial bailout legislation, which had passed a few days prior to my visit, the volume of online traffic was so great that the Capitol Hill servers went down. He said that this was an indication of the future volume of online communication. These are just a few details arising from my study. I will, in due course, set out the full detail of my discussions, which I trust will assist the Petitions Committee in our own inquiry into e-petitioning. At the time of my discussions with the Scottish parliament I suggested that we might arrange a teleconference between our two committees, and I am pleased to announce that the conference will take place later this month. Along with those I have mentioned in this speech, I would also like to thank Mr Fergus Cochrane, Clerk of the Scottish parliament's Public Petitions Committee, and SNP committee member Mr Nigel Dunn. I would also thank Mr Grahame Wear, liaison officer of the Scottish parliament, Ms Sue Pamphlett of the House of Commons and Mr Chris Benscher of the Australian Embassy in Washington for their assistance. They did a wonderful job. NA Parliamentary Delegation to the 54th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, Malaysia, and to Thailand",143
182,Mr DANBY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 54th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Malaysia and to Thailand from 4 to 15 August 2008. The report I have tabled reports on the parliamentary delegation, of which I was the deputy leader, to the 54th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association annual conference in Malaysia and a bilateral visit to Thailand in August this year. The delegation's visit was very successful and I thank my fellow delegates: Senator the Hon. Alan Ferguson, who was still President of the Senate at the time, and was leader of the delegation; Senator the Hon. Bill Heffernan; Mr Barry Haase MP; and Mr Graham Perrett MP. I also thank my then senior adviser, Gerard Martin, and the delegation secretary, David Elder, who is one of our very competent clerks. The delegation commenced with attendance at the 54th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference hosted by the Malaysian parliament. The theme of the conference was ‘Expanding the role of parliament in global society: environment, development and security'. The conference plenaries and workshop sessions provided the opportunity for our delegates to contribute to the sessions and to learn from other delegates about issues within their countries and parliaments. The conference also provided us with the opportunity to engage with parliamentarians from other Commonwealth countries on a more informal basis. While I think it is fair to say that the gation found aspects of the conference and its format a little frustrating, overall the ference was well organised and the delegation extends its congratulations and thanks to the Malaysian parliament for the success of the conference and the election of a Malaysian as head of the CPA. I also thank the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, led by the High Commissioner, Ms Penny Williams, for briefing the delegation and assisting the delegation during its visit. The delegation's visit to Thailand was both very worthwhile and very informative. The delegation's visit provided the opportunity to strengthen Australia's already strong ties with Thailand. There is scope to improve the people-to-people ties-I kept noting with the Speaker that we have nearly one million Australian tourists visiting Thailand every year. The delegation explored both that and our trading relationship. The visit, in particular, strengthened relationships at the parliamentary level, and it is hoped that this foundation can be built on in the future. Since visiting Thailand I have some doubts about the benefits for Australia of the ThailandAustralia Free Trade Agreement, which are set out on my website. Thailand continues to undergo considerable political turmoil as it struggles to ensure that democracy achieves a firm foundation in Thai political culture. We met Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, who-not because of our presence!-was forced from office soon after we had left. The delegation was able to be briefed on a number of defence, law enforcement and immigration issues that are of mutual concern to Australia and Thailand. In particular, we had important meetings with TACHIN, the Thai-Australian Collaboration in HIV Nutrition, and I commend the Australian government, AusAID, the two very dedicated Australian doctors who work long term with TACHIN and the great work that deleTACHIN does. We also had a very important meeting with the Thai Bomb Data Centre, conwhich is their primary anti-terrorist organisation. Finally, the delegation had the opportunity to visit a number of key sites on the BurmaThailand railway, on which a large number of prisoners of war, including thousands of Australians, worked during World War II. The delegation visited such famous sites as the bridge on the River Kwai and Hellfire Pass. To hear the very moving narration of Sir John Carrick, a former senator of this parliament, and Tom Uren as you go through Hellfire Pass was one of the most interesting experiences I have had internationally. I urge all Australians who visit Hellfire Pass to parlia, ticipate in that audio program. It is very moving, and the museum that Australia has set up there is well worth seeing by all Australians. The visits were a very moving experience for all the delegation, and we gained at least some appreciation of the suffering and sacrifice of so many prisoners of war. I would like to thank the Thai parliament for hosting us, and in particular the Speaker of the House of Representatives, His Excellency Mr Chai Chidchob, and the President  Boondech. I also thank the staff of the Australian Embassy in Bangkok, led by our very capable ambassador, Paul Grigson, for their excellent assistance during the visit. CLIMATE PROTECTION BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Windsor.",144
183,Mr WINDSOR,DELEGATION REPORTS,"The Climate Protection Bill 2008 is essentially the people's climate protection bill. I say ‘the people's climate protection bill' because many people and organisations right across Australia are very committed to doing something about climate change and protecting not only the Australian climate but the global climate, and many people are concerned that the government and the opposition, although paying lip-service to this ticular issue, do not seem to be inclined to pursue the issue to the full extent. This particular bill before the House has certain objects, which I will read to the House. The objects of the bill are: to ensure that Australia meets its obligations under the Kyoto convention and the Kyoto protocol; to ensure a substantial reduction in human derived greenhouse gas from Australia; to set mandatory targets for reducing human derived greenhouse gas emissions from Austrawith the first being a reduction by at least 30 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 and the second being a reduction by at least 80 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050; and to ensure that Australia meets these targets. The bill substantially increases the percentage of Australia's energy being sourced from renewable energy sources. It also assists with global efforts to stabilise and reduce human derived greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. It assists developing nations to adjust to a carbon constrained world and to mitigate the impacts of climate change. It also implements ecologically sustainable development and contributes to the conservation of materials used in the manufacture of goods within Australia. It also assists with the avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions from landfills and facilitates the utilisation of the energy embodied in manufactured goods through material recycling. The bill also embraces a number of other issues, particularly ones to do with the soil carbon debate that many in this House have heard me talk about in the past. The soil carbon issue raises an interesting point. There are many things that will not necessarily fit within an emissions trading scheme. Even though this legislation calls for either a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, there are many things that will not necessarily fit in a priced market but could, and would in my view, be part of reducing the par- problem that we are talking about. Vegetation sinks, soil sinks, soil carbon and recycling would in fact make a contribution to the overall problem of emissions reduction. As I said earlier on, this bill is the people's bill. I particularly thank the 65 environmental groups that have gone to a lot of trouble to assist with the drafting of this legislation. I also thank the many other individuals right across Australia who have highlighted the importance of this and Australia's leadership role in relation to climate change and climate protection. What this bill does, irrespective of whether it passes through the parliament-and I sincerely hope that it receives the endorsement of both sides of the parliament-is bring to the parliament the people's voice on this issue. Australians are concerned about the legacy that they will leave in terms of climate, given the substantial scientific evidence before us that there are problems looming and problems currently in the world in relation to emissions, not only of carbon dioxide but nitrous oxide, methane and other global warming gasses. I would encourage all members of parliament to take notice of this legislation and, very importantly, take notice of what the Australian people are saying in relation to it. Bill read a first time.",146
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"In accordance with standing order 41(d), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS",147
185,Mrs MOYLAN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I move: That the House: (1) recognises the serious state of housing availability and affordability in the public, not for profit and private sector in many cities and towns in Australia and the hardship it causes those on low and fixed incomes; (2) notes that: (a) it is having a serious impact on many in the community including those on low and fixed incomes, pensioners, disability pensioners, veterans, young families and students; (b) the situation has been exacerbated by the dereliction of duty of State governments in failing to maintain adequate stocks of public rental properties, with unacceptably long waiting lists for public housing; (c) in Western Australia (WA), for example, it has been reported that there are 16,000 families on the Homeswest waiting list in May 2008, with similar trends in other states; (d) there has been a contraction of approximately 30,000 public dwellings, which, factoring in population growth over the last decade, amounts to a loss of 100,000 dwellings in the public sector; (e) this dereliction of duty is increasing the reliance on the private rental market, where housing is in short supply, new building approvals are plummeting and rental vacancy rates are at the lowest levels in 20 years; (f) Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA) is not adequately addressing the gap between the high level of rent being paid and what is affordable and that in many areas there are few, if any, housing choices available; (g) despite the twice yearly adjustment of CRA to the Consumer Price Index of 4.3 per cent, the average rental increase Housing has been 7.1 per cent; (h) the median weekly rent of three bedroom houses has increased on a nationally weighted average by 46.75 per cent and, in fact, from June 1998 to June 2007 rents increased by 93.55 per cent in WA and by 105.88 per cent in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT); (i) rent assistance as a percentage of median weekly rent in WA has dropped from 31.8 per cent in June 2001 to 20.4 per cent in June 2007 and in the ACT from 25.6 per cent in June 1998 to 17.4 per cent in June 2007; (j) overall, renting has become less affordable nationally even for those in receipt of CRA; (k) according to national figures from the Australian Government Housing data set in June 2006, over one-third of CRA recipients pay more than 30 per cent of their income on rent, after CRA is factored in; and (l) public housing approvals plummeted to 131 new council approvals in March 2008, well short of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' decade average of new public housing approvals monthly; and (3) calls on the Federal Government to: (a) work with State governments through COAG to urgently address the national shortage of public, not for profit and private housing including delays in local government development approvals; (b) urgently review the adequacy of CRA paid to those on low and fixed incomes; (c) investigate making CRA or similar payment available to eligible recipients who are purchasing their own homes and who are experiencing severe mortgage stress, with the aim of keeping people in their own homes and taking some of the pressures off the public and private sector rental market; (d) consider changing the CRA formula to reflect the lack of choice and the increasing cost of rent beyond inflation, by linking CRA to actual rent using the highest median rent in each area; (e) target a proportion of assistance velopment of housing in high employment growth areas, in recognition that for those looking for work in areas of high labour demand, high rents are acting as a disincentive for some people to escape the poverty cycle; and (f) pay particular attention to development options for multi-dwelling supported accommodation models to provide for those with disabilities who may formerly have been housed in institutions. I am very pleased to put forward this motion and I have great hopes that members on both sides of the House will join me in acknowledging the serious state of housing availability and affordability in not only the not-forprofit sector but also in the private sector. I thank the member for Forrest for seconding this motion. This is a problem of enormous dimension. Some may even call it a crisis, as people in 350 the cities and towns of Australia face great hardship, particularly those on low and fixed incomes. It is probably a good idea to reiterate the words of University of New South Wales professor Julian Disney-and I have quoted him in the other chamber-who said recently: Lack of affordable housing strikes at the heart of our lives, our communities, and Australia's future prosperity. It impoverishes people, erodes families, destroys jobs, weakens the economy, and damages the environment. Many of us here have heard the anecdotal evidence from our own electorates about housing availability and affordability. Statistics alone prove that problems of unaffordable housing have worsened alarmingly over the last 10 to 15 years. For example, average house prices relative to household income have almost doubled and average monthly payments on new loans have risen by more than 50 per cent. Mercifully, we have seen this fall slightly in the last couple of weeks. for de- The proportion of first home buyers has fallen by about 20 per cent, the proportion of low-rent homes has fallen by at least 15 per cent and opportunities to rent public housing have fallen by at least 30 per cent. These are very disturbing figures. It has been reported that there is a shortfall of some 30,000 houses in the public sector alone. In a majority of areas, it has been difficult to rent housing in the private sector even if you can afford rents of $500 to $600 a week. This has forced people in big cities recently to agree to pay six months rent upfront plus a bond to agents just to get to the front of a long, long list of applicants for rentals. This has left many families and individuals living in temporary accommodation-hiring caravans, living in cars or on the streets or, as I said, moving from one household to another. I have to ask: what sort of situation is this for families with children to be in? The situation is particularly dire those on low and fixed incomes, as I said, such as people on pensions-whether they are age pensions or disability pensionsveterans and those who have little opportunity to increase their income stream. Those who rely on private rentals, which are scarce, expensive and continuing to increase in price, are under real stress. There are many reasons for the housing shortage and the high prices, which are out of the reach of many people. They can be resolved with proper management and with political will. One of the big failings, as I have also talked about before, is the dereliction of duty of state governments in providing public housing now for several years. In Western Australia, I think there are about 16,000 people on the waiting list for public housing. That is why I am calling on the government today to work with the state governments through the COAG process to address the national shortage of public, notfor-profit and private housing. This includes addressing the long delays in local government development approvals. Commonwealth rent assistance must also be urgently reviewed as to what benefit it can offer lowand fixed-income families as well as how it can be utilised. The fact is that Commonwealth rent assistance is indexed to CPI twice a year, which is just a touch over four per cent, but the rentals have gone up in the corresponding period by about seven per cent per annum. The CRA formula needs to reflect the lack of choice and the increasing cost of rent beyond inflation by linking CRA to actual rent using the highest median rent in each area. In areas of high labour demand, high rents are acting as a disincentive for some people to escape the poverty cycle. In recognition of this, those looking for work should be a target of a proportion of assistance for the defor velopment of housing in high employment growth areas. We should pay particular attention to development options for multidwelling supported accommodation models to provide for those with a disability who may formerly have been housed in institutions. Many groups have made their voices heard on these issues over the last few years. Now is the time to show them that we in this place are taking responsibility and are listening to their pleas.",147
186,Mr BUTLER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"This very extensive motion on housing raises an issue which our side of the House has taken very seriously-first of all, with the appointment of a housing minister, something not done by the previous government, and also, more substantively, with a range of measures that I will outline in the short time. I have before the House. As well-intentioned and well-argued as this motion might be, those opposite wear like an albatross around their neck 12 years of neglect in the area of housing. This is another example of the creationist approach that they have to policy challenges being confronted by our side of the House-that on 24 November some higher being created the world and it had an existing housing affordability crisis, about which I see absolutely nothing in this motion. We know that under the previous government there were cumulative cuts of almost $4 billion in real terms to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. There was a cut of $50 million in the 1997-98 financial year. There was a four per cent efficiency dividend the same year. There was an ongoing one per cent efficiency dividend per annum. There was the removal of GST compensation in 2003-04, a year in which the housing agreement funding was cut by $100 million. There was no indexation by the previous government between 1996 and 200405. This trashing of the public and social housing sector under the previous government is taking some considerable time to unravel, which is why the government and the various state and territory governments are still in the process of finalising the National Affordable Housing Agreement. It was not only to the area of social ing that the former government paid such little regard. At the same time as the agreement funding was being cut to such a degree, with almost $4 billion in real cumulative funding cuts over the 10 or 12 years that the last government was in place, there was no serious effort whatsoever to respond to dramatic developments in the private rental market. We know that after the dotcom bust, with a whole range of cheap interest rates and cheap money available, private money flooded into the housing sector leading to the biggest asset bubble in human history, worth in the developed world some $30 trillion, or 100 per cent of the combined GDP of those countries. We know that the Australian housing bubble was right at the top of the list. We know that Australia's price-rent ratio, the best way of valuing the housing market, by the end of 2005 was 70 per cent higher than the 25-year average. Unsurprisingly, as the member opposite has indicated, private rents went up. That is what happens when the price-rent ratio gets so far out of kilter the historic average. In the September quarter this year, private rents increased by 2.2 per cent, with an annual increase of about nine per cent. In my own electorate of Port Adelaide, 38 per cent of private renters are suffering from rental stress, paying more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. We also know that vacancy rates across the country, as the member opposite has indicated, are at very low rates-in my city of Adelaide, at around one per cent, which is the lowest ever seen in South Australia. So what is the government doing about this? First of all, we appointed a member of the executive with particular responsibility for dealing with housing-the Minister for Housing, the member for Sydney-and she has started to fill a space left completely vacant by the previous government. Principally, housin terms of the matters covered by this motion, that involves boosting the supply of affordable rental properties through $623 million of incentives over four years to increase supply by 50,000 rental properties rented at 20 per cent below market rates. If demand is still high, which I suspect it will be, there will be a further 50,000 rental properties from 2012. This motion raises very important issues and raises them in a very eloquent written way. However, it does not get away from the fact that in 12 months this government has done more around housing, particularly affordable housing, than the previous government did in 12 years. (Time expired)",149
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,Is the motion seconded?,150
188,Ms MARINO,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I rise to second the motion by the member for Pearce. I call on the House to recognise the very serious state of housing availability and affordability in the public, not-for-profit and with private sectors in many cities and towns in Australia and the extreme hardship it causes those on low and fixed incomes. There is no doubt that this is having a very serious impact on many in the community, including those on low and fixed incomes, pensioners, disability pensioners, veterans, young families and students. An article in the South Western Times on 9 October by Kate Murnane states: Women and children are returning to lives of mestic violence because they cannot afford to meet the rising cost of rent. South West Refuge manager, Barbara Payne, said staff had difficulty finding suitable and affordable accommodation for mothers and children escaping domestic violence. Mrs Payne is quoted as saying: It's difficult to break the cycle unless you somewhere to go. People will remain or go back to an abusive relationship because they cannot find a house or cannot afford one. I ask what modelling the government has undertaken on the effects of the doubling of the first home buyers grant for existing homes and the effect that will have on renters right across Australia. Will this put further upward pressure on rents, thereby increasing the numbers of Australians living under rental stress? A further example of badly researched government policy which will impact on the availability of affordable rental properties is the National Rental Affordability Scheme. An Australian Taxation Office ruling jeopardises the participation of the charitable, not-for-profit sector in the scheme and the bill is the subject of a Senate inquiry due to report. The tax implications for the not-forprofit sector should have been covered in the drafting of the legislation. How many charitable organisations have already developed projects ahead of the first funding round? How many potential affordable rental properties are impacted by this drafted legislation? And how will tenant eligibility provide a pathway to home-ownership? Income thresholds should be raised for those trying to save to buy into private housing, otherwise renters under this scheme will remain on welfare and rental assistance for longer than is necessary. I have received a letter from the Tenants Advice Service Inc - a not-for-profit comdo- munity legal centre which protects tenants' rights-seeking my support for increased Commonwealth funding for the existing system of social housing because it is unlikely that those providers will be able to increase their supply of dwellings without additional Commonwealth funding assistance and, secondly, seeking my support on another major have problem with the National Rental Affordability Scheme. They believe this will not assist the supply of community housing-that is, affordable rental housing owned and managed by not-for-profit organisations. Why? Because dwellings assisted with the NRAS incentives may not have ownership or title vested in community housing organisations. It is of course the ownership of the title that assists the not-for-profit organisations to finance new dwellings. There are other community groups which provide housing for people with special needs; however, that is also precluded from the NRAS. Australian families simply cannot afford to have their problems made far worse because the Rudd government has failed to do its homework. The situation has been exacerbated by the dereliction of duty of state Labor governments in failing to maintain adequate stocks of public rental properties, with unacceptably long waiting lists for public housing. My office was recently told by a local office of the Western Australian Department of Housing and Works, regarding supplies of public housing in Western Australia, that it was acceptable for applicants to pay up to 60 per cent of their Centrelink pension in the private rental market. I have had constituents in my office who are paying 65 per cent of their pension in rent, and we all know that 30 per cent is considered to be rental stress. Figures show rent assistance as a percentage of median weekly rent has dropped from 31.8 per cent to 20.4 per cent in June 2007. Current rental rates would significantly increase this differential. The demand for rental properties in Western Australia is amongst the highest in Australia, with rents expected to increase by 10 per cent over the next six months. The waiting list for public housing has blown out to many years. Public housing for one-bedroom requests date back to 2004-a four-year waiting list. Twobedroom housing applicants have been waiting since 2002 and three-bedroom applicants have been waiting since 2005. Similar and longer waiting periods are being experienced all over the south-west. In my electorate of Forrest, over 6,200 people receive rental assistance from Centrelink. According to the West Australian, 18,000 Western Australians were in the queue for public housing at the end of August. Clearly there was not enough Labor state government investment in public housing during the booming economic years in Western Australia. (Time expired)",150
189,Ms HALL,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I must say that I think the members on the other side of the House who have spoken to this motion should hang their heads in shame, because the decline in public housing and the blow-out in rental affordability did not happen under the Rudd Labor government, which has taken tangible steps to address the issue, unlike under the 12 long years of the Howard government. That was 12 long years of money for housing being pulled out of the states. I think it is an absolute disgrace that the previous government slashed $3.1 billion from the public housing budget-a 30 per cent cut in real funding. I was actually a state member of parliament when the Howard government was elected. At the time of its election there was a waiting list for public housing, but within 12 months that waiting list had doubled. The severe cuts in funding by the Howard government have meant that social housing stock has not kept up with the growth in population. In my electorate there is a 13year wait for public housing. That has been the case for a very long period of time, and it occurred under the Howard government. And then members on the other side of this House come in and sanctimoniously move motions condemning the Rudd government for the shortage of public housing. It did not happen over night. One of the things this government has done is work with the states and territories. The Rudd government will bring together all funding for affordable housing under the new affordable housing agreement. The new agreement will at least maintain the funding levels of the program that is in placesomething that did not happen under the previous government. I notice that another part of the motion that has been put to the parliament by the members opposite calls for rental assistance to be increased. Simply increasing rental assistance in this climate will do nothing to address the supply problem. It is likely that the money would go straight into the pockets of the landlords. In the electorate of Shortland, which falls within the Lake Macquarie area, there is currently a two per cent vacancy rate. One of the previous speakers from the other side said that a three per cent vacancy rate was thought to be a tight market, so you can just imagine how difficult it is for people to find accommodation within the Lake Macquarie area. And this situation has developed under the previous government. The Rudd government recognised the fact that there was a real problem with housing in Australia, and that is why we introduced measures such as the National Rental Affordability Scheme. That legislation was debated in this House in the last sitting week.",152
190,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.,153
191,Mr DANBY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I move: That the House: (1) congratulates Mr Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), on his appointment as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, which is a just recognition of his long struggle for democracy and reform in Zimbabwe; (2) acknowledges the courage of the people of Zimbabwe in defying the thuggery and intimidation of the Mugabe regime in voting for a change of regime at the Zimbabwe elections of March 2008; (3) condemns the Mugabe regime for instituting a reign of violence and intimidation which forced Mr Tsvangirai to withdraw from the second round of the presidential election, spite his clear lead in the first round; (4) calls on the international community, and particularly Zimbabwe's African neighbours and its fellow members of the Commonwealth, to maintain pressure on the Mugabe regime to ensure that it carries out the terms of the power-sharing agreement between the regime and the MDC; and (5) calls on the Australian Government to render every assistance to Mr Tsvangirai in carrying out the reforms urgently needed to restore democratic elections, good government and economic prosperity to the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe. Notice of this motion was given on 13 October, when there were at last some grounds for optimism about the situation in Zimbabwe. In the month since then, unfortunately, the situation has reverted to its previous state-if not quite a state of hopelessness, for we always have hope, then at least a state in which no escape from the impasse is immediately in view. The motion congratulates Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, on his appointment as Zimbabwe Prime Minister of Zimbabwe. Sadly, that appointment has not come to pass, because President Mugabe has reneged on key elements of the agreement which was brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki. President Mugabe has unilaterally appointed members of his own ZANU-PF party to the key ministries of foreign affairs, defence and internal affairs, a move which would leave Mr Tsvangirai as no more than a figurehead prime minister. Quite rightly, Mr Tsvangirai has refused to accept office in those circumstances. Indeed, Mr Mugabe has denied Mr Tsvangirai travel permission; that is an unbelievable situation for a prime minister of a country. This is a piece of arrogant bad faith by Mr Mugabe. I remind the House that the only dereason Mr Mugabe is President of Zimbabwe today is that he unleashed a campaign of violence and intimidation against the people of Zimbabwe so that it became impossible to hold the second round of the presidential election. Mr Tsvangirai had a clear lead in the first round and there is no doubt that he would have won the second round had it gone ahead. The majority of the people of Zimbabwe wanted to be rid of the Mugabe regime. This was shown in the parliamentary elections, in which the two factions of the MDC between them won a majority of seats. Mr Tsvangirai showed great statesmanship by deciding to withdraw from the second round although he would have won it, because he felt he could not ask his supporters to go on losing their lives in the face of the reign of terror unleashed by the ZANU-PF thugs across the rural areas of the country. Mr Tsvangirai made this sacrifice in the hope that the international community would respond by insisting that Mr Mugabe would resign, or at the very least agree to a powersharing arrangement. President Mbeki brokered a deal on which Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai shook hands in September. Under this deal, Mr Tsvangirai would be Prime Minister, and the MDC would get 16 cabinet posts and the ZANUPF would get 15. This deal at last offered the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe some prospect of respite from the economic chaos, the international isolation and the lack of security to which they have been subjected as a result of the incompetence, corruption and lawlessness which have come to characterise the Mugabe regime. The establishment of a power-sharing regime would have allowed the lifting of international sanctions against Zimbabwe. It would have brought aid and investment back to Zimbabwe. It would have allowed a reversal of the ruinous economic policies that have bankrupted a once prosperous country, debased its currency, destroyed its agricultural export industries and driven hundreds of thousands of skilled and educated people into emigration. All this has been put at risk by President Mugabe's blind determination, at the age of 84, to cling to power serve the shell of his regime in the face of all the disasters he has inflicted on the people of Zimbabwe. Although the first part of this motion has sadly been overtaken by events, the other parts remain highly relevant. In the words of the motion, this parliament should most urgently call on the international community to maintain pressure on the Mugabe regime to ensure that it carries out the terms of the tember agreement. The people of Zimbabwe have shown great courage in defying the Mugabe regime's thugs and voting for a new government. It is time the international community, and particularly the countries of Africa, and also Australia, came to the aid of the poor people of Zimbabwe.",153
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,Is the motion seconded? Ms Parke-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,154
193,Ms LEY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for introducing this important private member's motion in the House. The coalition has a strong record of opposing Robert Mugabe's undemocratic regime. In August 2007 Prime Minister John Howard met with opposition Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Prime Minister Howard told Mr Tsvangirai that the coalition supported the Zimbabwean opposition and hoped for true democratic change of regime in their elections. The coalition government delivered targeted sanctions against Mugabe's corrupt regime in order to send a strong message that they were against the brutalities of the regime. But, politics aside, it is important to look at the human aspect behind the President Mugabe's violent regime. Behind the politics are real people experiencing a brutal day-today existence that has left their lives shattered and has caused many to flee to and to pre- neighbouring countries. Robert Mugabe's party, the ZANU-PF, trains and sponsors the National Youth Service, also known as the Green Bombers due to the military style uniforms they wear and their reputation for violence. The US Department of State describes the Youth Service as a group of ‘undisciplined child soldiers used by the ruling government to suppress political dissent through overt acts of state Septerrorism'. The child soldiers are responsible for many acts of politically motivated violence and are often under the influence of government issued narcotics. Former recruits to the youth camps have spoken about a horrific training program that breaks down young teenagers before encouraging them to commit acts of violence. After the 29 March 2008 elections, Patrick-not his real name-was beaten with iron bars in the northern Mashonaland Central Province. Patrick, a schoolteacher, described how the ZANU-PF Party youths attacked him, wanting to know why his school, which was used as a polling station in the elections, recorded a high number of opposition votes. Patrick has three broken ribs, a bandaged right arm and is barely able to sit up. In hospital he had a drip attached to his stomach. Teachers are often the backbone of the country's electoral process, acting as polling officers on election day since Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980. However, in rural areas, several schools have been shut down because of political violence that has been rampant since the March polls. More than 5,000 teachers have been beaten, approximately 600 hospitalised and 231 teachers' houses burnt down. Mugabe's youth militias are increasingly well trained in torture techniques, which they use on civilians. Lyn, an 86-year-old farmer, was supporting her family with food grown in her fields. She was assaulted in July 2008 for not attending ZANU-PF meetings. Her back was injured and her arm broken by ‘war veterans'. She said: ‘I am now disabled. I can't work in the field … I want my attackers to be brought to justice.' No-one has been held accountable for the gross human rights violations, including beatings and torture, that occurred in the context of the elections, despite the fact the attackers are identifiable. The police also refuse to investigate the abduction and beating by ZANU-PF youth of thousands of MDC supporters. This lack of accountability for mistreatment in Zimbabwe remains entrenched despite the signing of the powersharing agreement on September 15, as mentioned in this motion. Police continue to detain accused persons beyond the 48-hour statutory limit, show contempt for court rulings and frequently deny detainees access to legal representation or relatives. Several former detainees have reported to Human Rights Watch that police officers frequently beat or mistreat those in custody. The Mugabe government's disastrous policies have crippled a once thriving economy, leaving Zimbabweans enduring hyperinflation. Over 80 per cent of the population are unemployed and living below the poverty line, and Zimbabweans have the lowest life expectancy of any country in the world. Sadly, in Zimbabwe female life expectancy stands at 34 years, while for males it is 37 years. It is concerning that human rights have not been at the centre of the negotiation processes that have happened recently. The negotiations should be about providing justice and relief to people, not just about politics. The Zimbabwean people are now living on a knife edge and they cannot afford to wait for the political bickering to end. My state colleague, the member for Albury, Greg Aplin, spent a considerable amount of time in the then Rhodesia and keeps in touch with people in this troubled country. He told me this evening that everything we see on the television and the photos we see are all completely accurate. In fact, the situation is worse. It is an anomaly that this man, Mugabe, has run the country into the ground since 1980. No African leader has managed to hang on for so long. Why has he that not been removed? He is surrounded by vested interests and those interests are obviously served by keeping him there. I congratulate the people of Zimbabwe for the courage they are showing in the face of this incredible adversity.",154
194,Ms PARKE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I commend and support the statements made by the speakers to this motion-in particular, by the mover of the motion, the member for Melbourne Ports. The motion rightly deplores the situation in Zimbabwe, condemns the corrupt and violent Mugabe regime, and calls for both assistance and strong diplomatic pressure from the international community, particularly Zimbabwe's southern African neighbours, and from the Australian government. It is disturbing in this context that on 11 July 2008, when the United Nations Security Council voted on a draft resolution which would have imposed further sanctions on Zimbabwe, including an arms embargo, the resolution was vetoed by China and Russia. In June, I joined a number of members in discussing a motion in this place on the subject of Zimbabwe. At that stage we contemplated the impending run-off election of 27 June, an electoral process that was a farce. Since that time we have seen the bright pect of improvement in Zimbabwe, through the MDC commanding the majority of seats in the Zimbabwean parliament, through the appointment of Morgan Tsvangirai as Prime Minister and through discussions concerning power-sharing arrangements between the MDC and the ZANU-PF. However, for the time being an improvement is illusory. The real power-and the blatant misuse of that power-continues to rest with the Mugabe regime. Human Rights Watch reported last week that ‘Zanu-PF's institutions of repression remain intact, and there has been no change in their abusive conduct and attitude'. Overnight, the leaders of the Southern African Development Community were meeting in Johannesburg to try and end the deadlock over the power-sharing issue. They recommended that Mugabe and Tsvangirai share control of the important home affairs ministry. This proposal was rejected by Tsvangirai, who noted that his dispute with Mugabe is not only about the ministry of home affairs but about striking a fair balance of power in the unity government. In a recent New Yorker article Tsvangirai was quoted as saying: In an ideal world, in such negotiations, you have an honest partner, not a dishonest one. Mugabe has been dishonest … What I am trying to get is a good deal with a bad man. Indeed, one could hardly blame Tsvangirai for not wishing Mugabe to share power over Zimbabwe's police and security forces, given the role of these forces in the state sponsored violence and intimidation during the election campaign. As this year draws to a close, it is part of human nature to reflect on the kind of year it has been, to consider on different levels how the year might be characterised. It began with the opening of the 42nd Australian parliament and, among other things, a bipartisan pros- commitment to begin each new parliament with a welcome to country ceremony. It also began with an apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples by the national parliament and for me these powerful and significant gestures of recognition, healing and national maturity will always mark 2008 as a special year. I have no doubt that the year will also be remembered for the global financial crisis which has dominated our national and international focus in the second half of the year, and it will be remembered for the arrival of a new and transformational president in the United States of America. But I will also think of 2008 as a year in which African conflict in countries like Zimbabwe, Sudan and the Congo continued, intensified and came to seem intractable. The death toll and the abject misery in those countries are sometimes hard to contemplate. But let us confront some sharp facts in the context of this motion about Zimbabwe. I take the following numbers from the 27 October article in the New Yorker: inflation in Zimbabwe is officially at 11 million per cent, although some analysts put it as high as 230 million per cent; unemployment is at 80 per cent; approximately two million Zimbabweans rely on international aid agencies for food in the face of chronic malnutrition and spreading starvation; and 20 per cent of the population is estimated to be infected with HIV-AIDS. Tragically, as the member for Melbourne Ports mentioned in this place in June, the life expectancy for people in Zimbabwe has nearly halved in the last decade. Of course, to the numbers we add the stories-and they are terrible stories. I note that Human Rights Watch has reported on the violent suppression of a peaceful demonstration by the Women's Coalition of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe National Students Union on 27 October. Demonstrators were beaten and tear-gassed. Authorities arrested 42 women, and at least 35 demonstrators were treated for injuries. The demonstration was calling on the country's leaders to address the severe food shortages in the country. The National Coordinator of the Women's Coalition of Zimbabwe was quoted as saying, ‘We are dying of hunger-people have no food.' This is in a country that was once the breadbasket of Africa. There appears to be no limit to the degree of suffering the Mugabe regime will inflict on the people of Zimbabwe in order to retain its power and privilege. I my parliamentary colleagues in supporting this motion and in calling for renewed international focus and action in Africa in the strongest terms. (Time expired)",156
195,Mrs MOYLAN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I have now spoken on motions and brought motions in relation to Zimbabwe several times over the last few years. I have to say that it saddens me to think that we are again debating this issue in this chamber, but I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for once again raising the matter. When I spoke on this in 2005-and I had spoken on it three years earlier than that I said that it was terrible to think that in 2005 there were still what I call tin-pot dictators running around countries like Zimbabwe, treating their citizens appallingly. What has also been appalling is the way in which the leaders of the African continent have fed the ego of this particular tin-pot dictator, Mr Mugabe. They have done that while millions of innocent men, women and children have suffered the most appalling deprivation, needlessly, purely for the sake of ego for someone who has stayed too long. It should be a matter of great shame for that continent that they have continued to support this individual in the way that they have. By contrast, we have seen Mr Tsvangirai, the man who was elected as president but who has been unable to act fully and take control of that country in the way that he was elected to do, demonstrate amazing courage to the world. I do not know of too many people who would have the courage to continue to fight for the people of Zimbabwe in the way that he has. It is incredibly moving when you think that every day his life has been threatened and that now, having been properly elected in democratic, or so-called democratic, difficult elections, he is unable to start ruling that country in a way that diminishes the terrible suffering that these join people have had to face in these last few years. It is a human disaster of monumental proportions. The unwillingness to act is very hard to fathom in a country that now has the world's lowest life expectancy, the highest inflation and in excess, as the member for Fremantle said, of perhaps 1½ million orphaned children with AIDS, with AIDS now killing an estimated 3,500 people a week in Zimbabwe. How can the leaders of the African continent continue to support a leader who has presided over such appalling human suffering? It is a human rights tragedy of monumental proportions, and it is a disgrace that so far we in the democratic countries of the world have not been able to take effective action to prevent the ongoing tragedy which unfolds before our very eyes. When I spoke in 2007, I made a comment that over the past 10 years Mugabe, in seeking power for power's sake, has brought his people to their knees. I then read out the statistics on inflation, which of course are much worse now than they were then, and the fact that gross domestic product at that time had dropped to $5 billion, almost half of what it was seven years earlier. Ignoring the rule of law and legitimate democratic processes, the despot Mugabe has driven white farmers from their land and is now ruling through brutality and fear. These misbegotten policies have seriously eroded food production and employment opportunities-and this in a country that was the food bowl of Africa. It is unbelievable, as I said, at this time that we can continue to countenance the kinds of things that are happening in Zimbabwe today. NA",157
196,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Remembrance Day",158
197,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT,"Makin) (9.30 pm)Yesterday I attended the annual luncheon of the Salisbury RSL, of which I am a patron. On 11 October I attended a similar luncheon at the Tea Tree Gully RSL. Both were enjoyable occasions where I was able to catch up with many long-time friends. I was particularly pleased yesterday to catch up with Jimmy Drummond, the oldest veteran I know. Jimmy, who is about 96 years old, is an original and probably the last of the legendary Rats of Tobruk. Jimmy has the best sense of humour of any veteran I have ever met. He can barely walk, he is quick witted and he always looks at life from the bright side. I was also able to pass on my personal support and good wishes to the Tea Tree Gully RSL through their president, Michael Sherlock, and to the Salisbury RSL through their president, Paul Serella, for the Remembrance Day services they will hold tomorrow. As with other members, I will be in Canberra tomorrow and therefore will be unable to attend the Remembrance Day services in my electorate of Makin. I will, however, be represented at the Tea Tree Gully RSL service, the Salisbury RSL service and the Banksia Park School and Modbury School services by my wife, Vicki, and by staff from my electorate office. I take this opportunity to express some personal reflections about Remembrance Day and the people who serve and have served Australia in our defence forces. There are many characteristics which one identifies with Australia: our unique animals, such as the kangaroo, the emu or the platypus; our sunburnt land with its rugged beauty; our Indigenous people with their rich culture; and the easygoing, ‘she'll be right, mate' Australian trait. I believe, however, that the one characteristic which best defines Australia is Australia's persistent ability to perform above expectations of us. There is no better example of that than in the gallantry of those Australians who serve in our defence forces. From the Boer War through to the present conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, Australian defence personnel have defined Australia as a nation of courage, valour, professionalism and mateship. They have brought admiration and respect to all Australians and enabled all of us to hold our heads high amongst the people of the world. For that alone, if for nothing else, we owe them a great deal of gratitude. Historically, Gallipoli was without doubt a defining battle for Australia. The Gallipoli tradition, however, continued in World War II, in Malaysia, in Korea, in Vietnam and in the Middle East, as well as in Australia's peacekeeping missions. Today in Australia we live the fortunate life that we do, we have the opportunities we have and we enjoy the freedom we have because of those who served and continue to serve for us. Good men do not seek out war and nor do they celebrate killing, but neither do good men stand back and allow others to mercilessly destroy the lives of innocent people. was interesting to hear the last debate, with the speakers from both sides talking about what is happening in Zimbabwe right now. Sadly, military intervention is sometimes necessary, and Australia has always responded to the call. It has come, however, at a huge cost. Since Federation, over 102,000 Australians have lost their lives serving our country. Even more were left physically or emotionally injured, and many families have lived with the heartache of having lost family members or dear friends. In fact, all of us in this House, I am sure, can relate to such families or to members of our own families who have served and either lost their lives, been injured or been taken as prisoners of war. It is something that truly touches the heart and home of each and every one of us. So tomorrow, at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, it is right that the nation stops for one minute to remember the fallen. We should never forget them. Dr Bernhard Moeller",158
198,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT,"I do not think it is appropriate for the House to adjourn until a senior minister of the government comes down to this chamber and explains on the public record, to my constituents and to a whole host of other Australians who have been in touch with me, the appalling decision made by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with regard to the physician in Horsham Dr Bernhard Moeller. It is an appalling decision, and I have not met anybody yet in Australia or overseas-given all the phone calls I have received-who does not agree with that sentiment about how appalling it is. Dr Moeller came to Australia in March 2006 with his wife, Isabella, and his three children, Sarah, Felix and Lukas. Young Lukas is a delightful little fellow of 13, but the Department of Immigration and Citizenship have deemed It that, because he has Down syndrome, this precludes Dr Moeller and his family taking up residency as citizens of our country. It just beggars belief that, whilst it is not lawful for any of us as Australians to discriminate on the basis of disability, apparently it is for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. It staggers me that as a result of the incredible amount of media coverage that this issue has attracted right around the world-some of which I have with me-it also affects the decisions of nurses, teachers, engineers and other people we desperately need, particularly in rural Australia. With regard to Dr Moeller, we have good strategies out there in my part of the world. We so value these professional people that we gather around them and give them immense support. I said over the phone to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, that of all the communities in Australia to pick on Horsham is well supported with disability support services. They actually celebrate disability with a week-long festival called the Awakenings Festival. It is a celebration of disability and a performing arts festival. All of the performing artists are people with disability, many of them with Down syndrome. So I am challenging the government to come down here to this chamber. Maybe Mr Bill Shorten, the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, could come down. Maybe the Minister for Health and Ageing could come down here herself and explain why there is not a whole-ofgovernment approach to addressing the challenge that we have of attracting good physicians, good medical doctors like Dr Moeller. Perhaps Laurie Ferguson, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, could come down here-or maybe the Attorney-General himself. Somebody needs to come down here and explain how the Department of Immigration and Citizenship are able to make an appalling decision such as this. When the Moellers made the decision to come to Australia, supported by the Wimmera Health Care Group on a section 457 visa, they explained to me that they were leaving Germany because of the lack of support for young Lukas because of his debility. They are now alarmed to find that, because of this law that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship can hide behind, Australians are not the fair-minded, decent people that he thought they were. My deep fear is that a well regarded and highly qualified physician like Dr Moeller-who has made the decision to come to Australia and commit to Horsham because of the enormous support that he and his family received from the community-might decide to leave in order to find some future security for his profession and his family. It is not good enough for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to explain to me that he and his whole family have residency in accordance with his 457 visa until 2010. This professional person needs certainty about his professional future and certainty with regard to the raising of his children. As I have said, young Lukas is a delightful little fella. He goes to Horsham West Primary School. Yes, he has a teacher's aide and, yes, he needs resources. But I believe the Australian community think that is okay. Any person with a disability has a right, I think, to achieve their potential. Certainly across the Wimmera, there are many support services available, and that particular region of Australia has indicated it is willing to support. There are wonderful support services: the Wool Factory, Karkana, Cooinda, Woodbine and Murdoch House. I want someone from the government to come down and explain this terrible decision. (Time expired) Blaxland Electorate: Remembrance Day",159
199,Mr CLARE,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the great privileges of this job is meeting extraordinary people, people like Dick Payten-a good man, as honest as the day is long. I first met Dick Payten selling Legacy badges last year in Bankstown. We worked together that day selling badges for that great Australian charity that looks after ex-service men and women and their families. Dick is a soldier himself, in more ways than one. He is 87 years old, but you would never know it. He never stops. The other day when I spoke to him he was very upset. The doctor had told him he had to get a pacemaker. He told me: ‘I don't have time for an operation. I've got too much to do.' What he was doing was organising the dedication of a monument to the 7th Division. As well as working for Legacy for the last 20 years, Dick is also the President of the 7th Australian Division AIF Association, ‘the silent 7th'. The 7th Division did not receive much recognition during World War II and not enough since. We are more likely to recognise the places they served: Tobruk, Kokoda or Milne Bay. But the story of the 7th Division is a story worth telling. They were a force of 40,000 volunteers who signed up to defend Australia in our darkest hour, the time of our greatest peril and our greatest generation. They fought throughout the war. They were the first flown into the battle at Nadzab in September 1943. They were the last to make an amphibious landing at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945. They were willing, strong and well trained. Many of their best were left behind. More than 6,500 were killed or wounded-one in six. Their efforts were rewarded with five Victoria Crosses. In 1942, Prime Minister John Curtin told this parliament: Today as in 1915 men are dying so that the tion may live. There will come a new dawn, bringing with it peace and freedom for the peoples of the world, but we can reach it only by striving bravely through the storm and the blood and the grief of war. These are the men who marched through this storm and these are the men whose deeds we have a solemn duty to remember-not just tomorrow on Remembrance Day but every day. Straight out of training, Dick Payten was sent to a faraway land and a distant war. But, in February 1942, when Dick boarded the US Mount Vernon at Suez, he had no idea where he would land next. He joked to me that he felt like a mushroom, ‘kept in the dark'. What he did not know was that a fleet of ships carrying him and the 7th Division across the Indian Ocean was charting a course into Australian history, a course set by Prime Minister Curtin. Against the wishes of Churchill, Curtin ordered the 7th Division home to defend Australia. And that they did. Last month the memorial to the 7th Division was dedicated on Remembrance Driveway at Bass Hill. It is a monument that speaks for the silent 7th. It would not be there without Dick Payten. He was the driving force behind getting the memorial built and dedicated. Even the prospect of a pacemaker could not stop him. It is right that this place pause tomorrow to remember men like Dick Payten. And it is right that my local community has a place to remember the service of the 7th Division. It is a memorial that is long overdue, as is the recognition in the proceedings of this House of a good man like Dick Payten. Australian National Academy of Music",160
200,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The 22nd of October 2008 will be remembered by all musicians in Australia, and certainly by all musicians in the Ryan electorate, as a black day in the history of classical music in naour country. Why is that? It is because the Rudd government, and Minister Garrett in particular, have decided to axe some $2.5 million of funding for the Australian National Academy of Music. This is an absolute disgrace, and I want to highlight it here in the parliament because in the Ryan electorate I have been contacted by many musicians and, indeed, by other constituents who have found this decision completely unwarranted. I want to remind the people of Ryan about the National Academy of Music. It holds a unique place in our country. The Australian National Academy of Music is a very special institution for training Australia's finest classical musicians. With an emphasis on the individual growth through tailored programs, the academy is committed to supporting talented musicians in refining and strengthening their individual musical voice, thereby empowering them to address the exciting challenges and possibilities of a life in music in the 21st century. I would say that, of all members of parliament, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts in particular, with his background, ought to be batting for the musicians of Australia, especially those young musicians who have an opportunity to develop their talents. Yet his role in this parliament and his role in this saga is a very sad one indeed. The statement by the Australian National Academy of Music sets out its version-and I think it sets the record straightof the regrettable saga of a lack of communication, exchange and consultation and of what is very much an imposition of a unilateral decision by the minister in cutting this funding. I want to remind anyone who might have a love for and an appreciation of music to go to the website of the Australian National Academy of Music and see its record and its version of how the exchange has taken place. Let us pause for the moment and note the significant eight board members of the academy, because these members are no fools. They are very distinguished Australians with business records, with community service and with expertise in the industry. They are people who give their time to make a contribution to a very important institution, yet this axing of some $2.5 million is going to end the rich history of the National Academy of Music. If the government took some time to go to the site and to go to the Facebook site, they would see that there are several thousands of Australians, just today, who have expressed their absolute contempt for the decision of Minister Garrett. I have a sneaking suspicion that if the Labor government and Mr Garrett in particular had any support from them, they will now not be receiving a Christmas card from those thousands of people-in fact, it is almost approaching tens of thousands. I know that the wiser heads in the Rudd government will realise that tens of thousands of very angry musicians might not come out in the streets, take their clothes off and protest in contempt of a government decision. But, rest assured, they will express their views in a very significant and profound way come the next election. Several hundred people alone who have contacted me in the last couple of days with their very deep concern and deep anxiety over this decision will make it very well known in the Ryan electorate how they feel about Minister Garrett. In response to the letter of 27 October 2008 advising the academy that it would no longer be in receipt of the $2.5 million of taxpayers' money supporting a great institution, the academy said: As widely reported, this letter came as a shock to the Academy ... I am no star musician, but I appreciate music. And, as someone who tries to give opportunities to young Australians to develop their talents, I want to express on the record on behalf of the Ryan electorate how terribly disappointed I am. In less than one year, the true colours of the Rudd government really are coming to the fore. These young Australians deserve support. It is not a lot of money. The government can find money for the Essendon Football Club. I have no qualms about Essendon Football Club receiving, I think, some $1½ million. I know a lot of people like football, but why can the $2.5 million not be continued? I am dismayed-(Time expired) Schoolies Week",161
201,Ms REA,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to share the nervousness that often occurs in the month of November for all of those families and households out there who have young school leavers in their final year of school. It is a nervousness which is often overshadowed by nervousness about the endof-year exams. It is about their young school leavers going off to that well-known institution that we call schoolies week, which will be occurring later on in the month. Of course, in the electorate of Bonner and in the suburbs of Brisbane, we are very near to the mecca of that tradition, which is the Gold Coast. Tonight I would like to pay tribute to an organisation called Red Frogs. It is a group of young volunteers based at the city point church in Mansfield in the electorate of Bonner. A youth worker called Andy Gourley has over 10 years developed a group of young volunteers who make their way to various locations where schoolies gather to try and offer some comfort, some support and, at times, some very much needed assistance when the celebrations of that week get a little bit too much. We know that it is the right of every young person to celebrate the end of school. It is a significant time in people's lives, that week afterwards is often seen as a rite passage from being a schoolkid to moving on to young adulthood. Unfortunately, though, in this day and age it is often seen as an cuse to live to excess and, indeed, to often put yourself in quite severe physical and sometimes moral danger because of the temptations that occur in that particular week. Red Frogs developed when Andy Gourley, some 10 years ago as a youth worker, went to schoolies week on the Gold Coast to visit a friend and saw the trouble that many young people get into when they are often away from home for the first time and when they are sampling some temptations-probably for the first time-and doing so in an atmosphere where excess is seen as the norm. It is called Red Frogs because they are the means by which the volunteers approach young people who they believe are in need of assistance to try and tempt them into sitting down, having a chat and perhaps taking the advice and the assistance of the volunteers. Red frogs have been seen as the most successful lolly that young people respond to. Over the years they have tried many different kinds but, for some reason, red frogs seem to be the best icebreaker and have become a tradition. Ten years ago, when Andy first started, he handed out 80 kilos in the first year that Red Frogs volunteers went to the Gold Coast. This year they will distribute some nine tonnes of red frogs, and I think that is an indication of how successful this program has been. I had the privilege of visiting with Andy a local high school, Mount Gravatt High School, in my electorate last week. Andy does a tour of schools throughout Brisbane, talking to the year 12s about the possible troubles or dangers they may face when they go down to schoolies week. He offers very and practical and sensible advice about how to of survive the week and, indeed, how to enjoy it. I wanted to offer my support because, as ex- we know, the issue of teenage binge drinking is something that is very much at the forefront of the government's attention and that of the broader Australian community. Here we have an organisation that has had major success in walking young people home, protecting them from possible danger and picking them up off the streets when they are often semiconscious or even unconscious. Indeed, the organisation has even been successful in talking young people out of suicide. Often these are young men with a little bit too much drink or illegal substances in their bodies who find that life is a bit overwhelming, and they are in a position where they may seek that very dramatic last resort to end their depression and their fears. The Red Frogs people at the drop of a hat, at the phone call of a friend, will come to the aid of that person, sit and talk with them, offer them lots of red frogs and sympathy, and often they receive many accolades from young people now living very successful lives who ring to offer their thanks for the support they received at that time.

202,Mr RAMSEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (9.53 pm)Tonight I would like to bring to the attention of the House the worsening of the drought in South Australia. For once I will not be talking about the Murray but about the devastating effects the drought is having on the cropping regions of South Australia. Some of those cropping regions have received less than 50 per cent of their annual rainfall as approach the last few weeks of the year. This is an unpredictable, almost unimaginable state of affairs. For the third year in a and for some, five years out of seven-we have seen the season totally fail. Certainly my farm that is the case. There is one shining light in this, in that modern farming methods have assured us that we have not seen the dust bowls of the past-the forties, the sixties and the eighties-when much of our fertile topsoils blew away. But what is happening is that the good long-term operators in the industry are under serious threat. Good operators that have adopted modern farming practices-no till, satellite guidance, night spraying, variable rate seeding technology, integrated systems management and advanced marketing skills-are under severe pressure. These are just the people we cannot afford to lose out of our communities and out of our industries. But the pressure keeps building-drought, record prices for fuel, fertiliser and chemicals, shortages of labour and certainly a shortage of money to pay labour. The South Australian Farmers Federation President, Peter White, says that this is the most expensive crop that we have ever grown, and it has all gone wrong at the same time. Just 2½ months ago at the end of August the cropping prospects in South Australia looked good. Since then we have had virtually no rainfall across the whole region. Mr White said that the plight facing farmers was the worse in close to 80 years-since the last depression. Many operators were last year given finance on the premise that it would be their last year farming unless there was a reasonable production year. Already at least one major banking institution has issued a round of foreclosure notices. It makes you wonder what is to come. The dilemma for all is here. The banks may not have credit available or be willing to give credit in the new we financial times that we will find ourselves in, in the coming 12 months, but banks need production. The only way they can get their row- money back on these farms, the money that they have lent, is if somebody grows a crop on there-and they need farmers to grow the crops. So we just do not know where all this is going to end. Have the banks got the energy? Do the banks have provision to refund these farmers again or are they between a rock and a hard place where they cannot go as well? The mental state of farmers and rural businessmen is as fragile as I have ever seen. I say of my friends and colleagues that I farm with that if they are not financially exhausted, and many of them are, they certainly are mentally exhausted. Exceptional circumstances is one of the only things keeping some of them on their farms. But the EC package needs reform. Farmers have been encouraged to invest off-farm to diversify their business so they can withstand these hard times. The current EC guidelines actually encourage people to get rid of those profit-making parts of the enterprise so they can qualify for the funding to keep them on their farms. There are a number of problems with exit grants. The take-up has been very low and there are problems there that need to be addressed. We ignore rural Australia at our peril. It is still a major employer; it is still a major exporter for Australia. Some may begrudge the support that rural Australia receives but it pales into insignificance when compared with the plan announced today to support the car industry. This industry is vitally important to Australia's future. It has been the backbone of our past. The recommendations of the drought task force were delivered last time we were here in Canberra. Now, we need action. But the big fundamental question facing Australia is: do we want a rural Australia? And that is the question that will need to be answered in this next 12 months. Question agreed to. House adjourned at 9.59 pm NA The following notices were given: Ms Plibersek to present a Bill for an Act to amend laws in order to provide economic security strategy payments, and for related purposes. (Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008) Mrs Hull to move: That the House calls on the Rudd Government: (1) to deliver greater transparency and accountability as it moves towards the development of a Basin wide management plan by 2011 for the Murray-Darling Basin; and (2) specifically to ensure that: (a) community impact statements are prepared as part of the Basin plan process and that these statements are prepared in consultation with affected communities and are made publicly available when completed; (b) scientific data (such as the CSIRO sustainability studies) are assessed along with these community impact statements in finalising Basin wide and catchment targets; (c) due recognition is given to the community and individual impacts of a new water management regime as well as the ongoing effects of the current drought; and (d) affected communities are provided with adequate resources to develop long term options and that Government assistance is provided to allow communities to deliver against these options. Mr Georgiou to move: That the House: (1) reaffirms its commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and opportunities and be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, culture, creed or ethnic origin; (2) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non-discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, culture, creed or ethnic origin; (3) reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and to closing the gap that lies between us in life expectancy, educational achievement and economic opportunity; (4) reaffirms its commitment to multiculturalism and to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society, united by an overriding loyalty to our nation, obedience to its laws, and commitment to its democratic beliefs and institutions; and (5) denounces intolerance in any form on the grounds of race, colour, culture, creed or ethnic origin as incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to be. Mr Bruce Scott to move: That the House: (1) recognises the importance of National Adoption Awareness Week and the significance of encouraging adoptees, adoptive parents and biological parents to opening and continuing the dialogue on adoption in Australia and encouraging people to discuss how adoption has impacted on their lives; and (2) calls on the governments at the State and Federal levels to support all participants in the adoption process. Mr Bruce Scott to move: That the House: (1) reaffirms the definition of ‘Veteran' as set out by the Department of Veterans' Affairs; (2) endorses the ‘Continuous full time service determination' signed on 28 August 1998 by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs enabling members of the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) who served in Vietnam to meet the definition of ‘Veteran'; (3) encourages the Department of Veterans' Affairs to: (a) recognise claims by CMF members from that date; and (b) take appropriate measures to contact servicemen and women to whom the determination applies with a view to retrospective payment. Ms Ley to move: That the House: (1) supports long term viability of regional and rural medical practices, hospitals and services; (2) notes with concern the failure of state governments to provide adequate health services for Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas, particularly in relation to cross border health; (3) acknowledges the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the significant contribution it makes by providing aeromedical emergency and primary health care services to people who live, work and travel in regional and remote Australia; (4) calls on the Australian Government to eliminate inequality in healthcare access and services experienced by those living in rural and remote areas by: (a) increasing the recruitment and retention of rural medical practitioners and health care professionals; (b) assisting Australians who live in regional, rural and remote areas with the cost of travel to specialist medical appointments in capital cities and regional centres; and (c) providing adequate funding to maintain and expand small rural hospitals and health services and their maternity and other procedural services.",163
