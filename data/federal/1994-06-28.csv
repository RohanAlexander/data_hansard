1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 June, on motion by Mr Tickner: That the bill be now read a second time.",11
2,Mr LES SCOTT,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I but am pleased to have the opportunity in the few minutes available to me this afternoon to the sea. continue in the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission AmendcalIy ment Bill. This bill plays an important part the wider process of indigenous self-deterof· mination in this country. In this particular case, that self-determination is for the Torres Strait Islanders. Following on the enormous changes brought about by the native title legislation and the changes toATSIC, this bill joins the list of positive changes that have been made to improve conditions for Australia's indigenous citizens. The changes in this bill grant increased autonomy to the TSRA and strengthen ability to preserve the unique cultural identity of the Torres Strait. Sometimes it is overand looked by the wider community that these people differ substantially from the mainland Aboriginal population in their customs, This traditions and beliefs. As a result, unfortunatestand ly, specific recognition is not always given Islanders' culture and it is not always acunderstanding knowledged and respected as a separate entity in its own right. It is hoped that measures like those in this bill can go some way towards addressing this situation. Provided that it furthers the ic and cultural development of the Torres Strait population, the TSRA will be able to make grants and loans to Queensland. This is particularly important because it will help ensure that the TSRA can financialIy service its regional councils. In terms of a broad push to improve the level of indigenous involvement in decision making that affects their future, that is a very positive development indeed. Currently, the money in the authority's land and natural resources fund can be used for acquiring an interest in land. Quite rightly, it is felt that this focus on land overlooks the unique connection that Torres Strait Islanders have with the sea and marine environment. In the vision statement of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, there is a reference to the attachment to land and sea. It is important to realise that indigenous people feel deeply for the land, in the case of Aboriginal people, there is a distinction in the case of Torres Strait Islanders; they feel just as deeply for In the past, our legislation has not specifirecognised this distinction. Proposed in section 144W will take this into account. Use money will be extended to include the development and implementation of the marine strategy in·the Torres Strait Islander development plan, the development and maintenance of real estate and the acquisition of land. This change facilitates the implementation of a comprehensive conservation and sustainable development strategy in the region, as called for by the Torres Strait Islanders in 1991 in Principles and Objectives its Jor the Future oJ the Torres Strait. The urgent need for localised coordination management structure within the Torres Strait region was also endorsed in Towards a Marine Strategy Jor the Torres Strait in 1993. biII will assist this process. To under-:the needs of Torres Strait Islanders to to organise autonomously also requires an that their relationship with the sea is the fundamental part of their culture, traditional economy and activities. It is crucial that Torres Strait Islanders have authority over these areas of land and sea, as well as authsocial, economority over themselves. This bill and the supplementary amendments also outline the process for authority elections. While the changes to elections are mainly administrative, the additional amendments stiII allow for extra members to the authorities, but set a maximum of 23. Other changes relate to zone and other elections, including the division of wards, detennination of boundaries and the number to be elected in each ward. This is all part of the important process of self-detennination for Torres Strait Islander people. I commend the changes in this bill to the House. The Aboriginal· and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission's report appropriately summarises the changes as follows: The recognition of the deep and distinctive connection of the Torres Strait Islander people with land a!ld seas and their desire in goodwill and cooperation with others, to Care for, sustain and develop their traditional estate presents no threat . . . It could be the catalyst for distinct gains. As I said earlier, the bill before us is a very important one. I was particularly disappointed last night when I was interrupted by a quorum being called and an honourable member opposite subsequently taking Ii point of order. I believe that we need to work very closely to ensure that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are well represented in this place. It was regrettable that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) in particular took the opportunity last night to correct my grammar. I do not suggest that I am the greatest of orators or that I have the greatest grasp of the English language. I often use Australian slang, as do many other people in this place. It seems that when we speak on bills in this place all we are going to get from the honourable member-and I am pleased that she has come into the chamber-is an English lesson. I suppose that is the new rhetoric we can also expect from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). I would suggest that no matter how often she corrects us on our grammar in this place and no matter how good is her grammar or how great is her control of the English language, she will never be able to get into the Adelaide Club. I believe that this bill needs bipartisan support and the very strong commitment of all honourable members in this place. I know that the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), who is to follow me in this debate, is certainly a good advocate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I will leave it to him to espouse his concern for those people.",11
3,Mr NUGENT,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"After such an introduction, what can I say? I would, however, just make brief mention of the matter to which the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) referred to in his concluding remarks. I think we all acknowledge the very severe disadvantage of indigenous people in this country. This is a serious issue and I think it would be sad if we degenerated into debating personalities. I suggest to the their honourable member that responding in kind is not perhaps as helpful as he might think. I would like to see us try to put those things behind us. I would like to preface my remarks on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 by making two comments. The first concerns the departure of the former chief executive of ATSIC, Dr Peter Shergold; In his 21/2 years as chief executive of ATSIC, Dr Shergold was given a very difficult task-a task that required great sensitivity, great dedication and great loyalty; and a task which I believe he carried out admirably. As a former shadow minister in this portfolio, there were many occasions on which I had dealings with him both on a fonnal and infonnal basis. I always found him to be helpful, cooperative and extremely supportive. I wish him well in the new job. Secondly, I will comment briefly on the appointment of the new chief executive of ATSIC, Ms Pat Turner, whom I have known on and off for three or four years. I wish her well as she comes into her task at a time when ATSIC is entering a new phase of its life. ATSIC is not now in thefonnative stage that we have seen for the last three or four years; it is in a period of change and consolidation. She has a very critical and fundamental role to play in the future success and, indeed, even the survival of that organisation. I certainly wish her well in that task. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill seeks to set up the Torres Strait Regional Authority. We are told that the purpose of the bill is to allow the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the Torres Strait Regional Authority; for the minister to confer a departmental function of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission on the authority; and also to allow the authority to make grants or loans within Queensland specifically for the purposes of furthering social, economic or cultural development of the Torres Strait Islanders or Aboriginal persons living in the Torres Strait area. The legislation enables the authority elections to be run, specifically setting up a number of wards, and it allows the minister to make rules for the determination of the ward boundaries in relation to who may vote. The authority is a body corporate. Its functions include the recognition and maintenance of the special and unique Ailan Kastom of Torres Strait Islanders; the formulation and implementation of programs for Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal persons living in the Torres Strait; and the development of policy proposals to meet national- state and regional needs and priorities. . There are a number of other matters that I could go through in a routine way-many of which have been mentioned---:but it is perhaps important to remind ourselves of the particular powers of the authority. The authority has a number of new powers: to negotiate and cooperate with other Commonwealth, state, territory and local government bodies; to enter into grant or loan arrangements under section 142GA, which allows the authority to act as guarantor of certain loans, with the state of Queensland or an authority of that state; and to enter into an agreement, other than an agreement referred to previously, with a state or territory. So, in essence, it means that the authority can deal with the Queensland government. The authority has a number of responsibilities regarding land and natural resources. It also has major responsibilities regarding not only its own elections but also the way it sets up those elections, the ward system, the system of voting that applies and so on. I will not deal at any length with the techniall calities of this bill, because I think previous speakers have dealt with a number of them, but I do want to make a number of generalised comments. In the last four years, since I was elected to this place, I have been fortunate to visit the Torres Strait Islands on about five or six occasions. It is probably not an opportunity that many Australians have. Certainly, before I came to this place; I had never been there. As I said, now I have been there on a number of occasions. I have been to places like Thursday Island, which is the main administrative centre. To get to Thursday Island, I had to fly to Horn Island and then take the little ferry across to the main island. I was also fortunate to visit Saibai Island in the last parliament with the House of Representatives standing committee. Saibai is a small island. My lasting impression of it is the mosquitos. It is very low lying, very wet, and is not the place that I would choose to live. Saibai is about four kilometres from the Papua New Guinea border. People can stand on the seashore and look out across the strait, and PNG is very close indeed. I have been to Murray Island on two separate occasions. Murray Island is where the historic Mabo decision originally emanated from. Murray Island is one of those places that really bring home how remote the Torres Strait can be and how difficult it can be to live and survive there. I flew into Murray Island on a little plane, because big planes cannot get in. The runway is at the top of a mountain. The plane has to be pulled up in time, otherwise it would tip over the end of the runway and fall down several hundred feet. So it is a challenging experience. Whilst I would not dare name him, one member of this chamber-on the government side, I hasten to add-declined to fly in that little aeroplane the first time that I went there. More importantly, when I arrived on Murray Island, I found only about one or two vehicles. I went down the hill to a little coastal strip, along to the school and saw the community. The reality is that the living standards and the facilities provided on the island are far below-as they are on virtually of the islands-the facilities provided on the mainland. There are difficulties with communication. Foodstuffs and other items are prohibitively expensive because of the cost of getting them in. There are poor landing facilities for boats with provisions for island and so on. My visit brought home to me the need to deal with this unique region of Australia. In the last few months I also spent time, and stayed overnight, on Yorke Island. When I arrived on Yorke Island, I went to the new and much needed medical aid post, one of seven that have been established around the islands in the last 12 months. When I went and looked at this excellent facility-where some Islanders were trained by mainland nurses to help run it-I saw a splendid new hospital bed. However, the splendid .new hospital bed did not have a mattress. When the bed was ordered, there was an administrative muck-up in ordering a mattress. A couple of days later, when I went to Thursday Island I took up that matter with regional administration and was told, 'Don't be surprised or complain about Yorke Island. It has actually happened on seven of the islands.' It seems that when those sorts of things are organised from a long way away, as in this case, people do not have an appreciation of the local conditions. So the point I would make in light of my experience is that we need to see more local decision making, particularly on day-today issues. That is what this bill endeavours to do through the Torres Strait Regional Authority-to have local people with an appreciation of the situation making the decisions. Over the last few years I have been fortunate i.n coming to know a number of Torres Strait Islanders through my role as the coalition's representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The overwhelming lesson I have learnt from that experience and exposure-again, this is something I feel most Australians do not understand-is that the Torres Strait Islanders have a close affinity with the sea. We hear a lot about the very special relationship that Aboriginal people in this country have with the land, and that is very important, but we also need to recognise that Torres Strait Islanders have a very special affinity with the sea. Many people do not realise that there are a large number of Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland. Many of them retain family, the property and cultural links to the islands and travel back on a regular basis. On the mainland they feel as outnumbered by the Aboriginal community as the Aboriginal community generally does by the non-indigenous cOmmunity. So there are special needs for mainland Torres Strait Islanders. I have· been to places such as Townsville where Islander groups are struggling to maintain their culture and identity. It is a different world for Torres Strait Islanders, in the same way as for Aboriginal communities it is a different world than it is for the broader community. But perhaps one of the things that, again, many Australians do not appreciate is the proximity of the islands to Papua New Guinea and the very real and unique issues that entails. The islands form an international border and, apart from any potential defence issues-whether it is with PNG, Indonesia or anywhere else-there is also the issue of the joint economic zone. On a more practical day-today basis, one of the reasons Torres Strait· Islanders want more say in their own affairs is that a flood of people from Papua New Guinea is coming across in canoes and small boats to the Torres Strait islands. Those people use the store and the medical facilities, possibly intermarry or stay longer than they are welcome. That causes friction in some communities. They are u'sing resources that they cannot get in their own country and that often strains resources which are already stretched to breaking point. I found it interesting to talk to the Island Coordinating Council, and to its chairman over the last two or three years, Getano Lui, because there has been a consistent push for a new arrangement in respect of the Torres Strait islands. I do not think Getano Lui has ever suggested full independence, but he and his council, with which I have met on a number of occasions, feel that there is a need for some local autonomy. When the minister and I jointly visited the Torres Strait islands a couple of years ago to talk to the ICC and the ATSIC Regional Council, we flew into the airport on Hom Island. Having left the airport we then had to drive down the road to get the ferry to Thursday Island, but there was no main road. We were' at the main point of entry into the Torres Strait islands, yet even now in 1994, the main point of entry is an unsealed road. It is not a particularly long stretch of and it does not need to be a dual carriageway but it is ludicrous that in this day and age, with all the federal, state and other sorts authorities-I understand there are some 37 different government authorities visiting and way to go. having dealings with the islands-we cannot have a sealed road as the main entry point into the Torres Strait. This is a specific example of why the Torres Strait Islanders want to have more control over their own affairs, and gives a graphic entry into that world and its differences. There are economic problems, international boundary issues and those sorts of things up there. I have mentioned already that there Islanders on the mainland. They are conwill cerned about their representation on the islands. There are also other practical probhave lems. For example, quite often Islanders who have medical problems get transferred to the mainland for treatment. Should they die, there is the' problem of getting the bodies back to the islands for burial. There are everyday, practical, logistical problems and the islanders say, 'People down south don't understand the practicalities.' The Islanders want to have some control. I hope that the Torres Strait Regional Authority start to give them some control. I have talked. about transportation roads. Let us look at the cost of goods and the method of getting goods around. Most of those islands might get a boat once a week. The kids can go to primary schools on most of the islands but if they want a secondary education they have to go to Thursday Island and board, stay with relations or something like that. There are unique problems in children an education. Once they have their education there are very real problems with developing an economy. Mr Dodd-There is a hostel there.",12
4,Mr NUGENT,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Of course there is, but service there are unique problems and the Islanders want the ability to make their own decisions about the best way to resolve them. I have not gone on a kick of attacking the government for not doing anything. I am saying that there are unique problems that need to be addressed and they need local decision making and road input. That is one of the reasons why the coalition, three or four years ago, first suggested something like the Torres Strait Reof gional Authority. I commend the government for picking up the idea, because it is the right There has been discussion and talk about independence. The coalition does not support full independence for the Torres Strait-we have made that clear-but we do believe that regionalised decision making on those local matters is most important. It also needs to be said that, if the Torres Strait Islanders want to see the current Torres Strait Regional Authority go a little further in local administration are and take on more functions of government, it be important to make sure that those nonIslanders who live on the islands and who lived on the islands for a long time are we find that also represented. I have some concerns, after conversations on the islands with some of the Torres Strait Islanders, that when they talk about wanting to run their own affairs they are quite often actually talking about not taking those people into account. I am not saying that all of them say that, but there is that view. I think it is important that, if we are going to devolve will some decision making to the region, all people who live in that region have a say in and that decision making process. Clearly: on the ground issues are quite important. Health is a significant problem and other speakers in this debate have listed some of the health problems and statistics which are not good. Housing is obviously difficult and standard of housing is often a major problem. I have already alluded to education and getting employment which are big issues. It is also worth remembering that this is an important part of Australia not only because of its international boundaries, oil factors and tourism potential, but also because of the that this part of Australia gave this country during the war. We seem to forget about that. Of a population of 3,000 Torres Strait Islanders, some 800 joined up, That is a higher proportion of the population joining the forces than in any other part of Australia. These people have earned the right over a long period to the same standards and regionwith al decision making authority as any other Australian. In conclusion, I and the rest of the coalition welcome the setting up of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. We do not see it as a to full independence but we do see it as a Australia. critical step to righting many of the problems that are there on the ground today. It will surely help the Torres Strait Islanders and others who live in the region and I wish it every success in the future.",15
5,Mr DODD,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"As the member for Leichhardt, which encompassquestion es the Torres Strait, it is a great pleasure support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner Amendment Bill. the Before I go on to the body of my speech, would like to echo the comments of the process. honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) on Dr Peter Shergold and wish him well in his future career. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was substantially amended during 1993 to give effect to the Strait recommendations arising from the review the act by ATSIC. One of the more signifiwith cant changes was the establishment of Torres Strait Regional Authority, the TSRA, which is to exercise ATSIC powers and .point functions with respect to the Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal persons in the Torres Strait area. On 1 July 1994 the Torres Strait Regional Authority will be constituted in exactly the same way as the Torres Strait Regional by Council. I am pleased to say that I will be going with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) those celebrations on Thursday Island on Friday. Those persons elected in March this year will automatically become members the Torres Strait Regional Authority. The TSRA has been established in recogniIslanders tion of the desire of Torres Strait Islander today. people to govern themselves. There has been some call for sovereignty for the Torres Strait. The honourable member for Aston indicated that it is coalition policy to reject that. The government has a different approach. In line self-determination, it is fair to say that there is not a great deal of support for sovereigntyand independence in the Torres Strait. Some people have advocated that. Most of the people that advocate that do not live in the step Torres Strait; they live in other parts of So the government can truly say that it is responding to the will of the people in the Torres Strait on this issue. The people of the Torres Strait certainly do support, as a general issue, some degree of self-determination and some degree of extra autonomy. On the of the degree of extra autonomy and to self-determination, one would probably get a myriad of views in the Torres Strait. That is very nature of the process that is going on I at the moment; it is part of th{) democratic I am sure that, as the years progress-and there has been some suggestion by the new authority that the year 200 1 is some sort of goal or aim for a greater degree of self-determination and a greater degree of self-autonomy-the views of the people of the Torres will crystallise. Certainly, this governof ment is quite willing and able to sit down people in the Torres Strait and determine the newer and more innovative structures. But it has taken a long time to get to this that now, with the passage of this bill, the Torres Strait Islanders will be empowered to make important decisions about funding priorities. and resource allocations themselves. For the last 200 years, the Torres Strait Islanders have been subject to control, firstly, missionaries and then various state and, to a lesser extent, federal governments, culminat to Killoran who was then head of the Queensland Department ,of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs under the National Party government. of The department and the church exerted a degree of control over the individual lives of that simply would not be tolerated The establishment of ATSIC by the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, gave Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders around Australia real political power in deciding how limited federal government resources would be allocated. The TSRA goes one step further and recognises the unique Ailan Kastom of the Torres Strait-that is, the body of customs, traditions, observances and beliefs of some or all of the Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait area. Any further move towards regional autonomy will necessarily involve the Queensland state government and the Torres Shire Council. The Commonwealth has led the way with ATSIC in forming the TSRA and it has led the way in introducing the mechanisms to facilitate self-determination and regional autonomy. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has written to the Queensland government about the need for further consultation concerning the role of the Island Coordinating Council and the devolution of power. So the ball is, to some extent, in the Queensland government's court. This is not to say that the issue is an easy one. Obviously, there would be great complexities in further devolution of powers, especially from a state government. Obviously, important state functions in areas such as education and health would not be easy to devolve and would necessitate long consultation. These matters involve financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states. This would add to the complexity of the issue. Nevertheless, I think it is a challenge for the Queensland government to address these further calls for self-determination in the Torres Strait. I am confident that, if the Queensland government sits down with the ICC and the new regional authority, they will be able to come up with some sort of plan and strategy for the future which will satisfy the fiscal difficulties of both the Commonwealth and the state and which will satisfy Islanders' wish for greater self-determination. As I said, there are difficulties involved. The northern peninsula area will present a problem if there is further self-determination or autonomy. The NPA consists of both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In effect, it is a geographical mix of Aboriginal and Islander people. That would create some difficulty if there were some sort of territory status conferred on the Torres Strait. The communities of Bamaga and Seisia wish to associate with the Torres Strait. They were founded, as it were, from Torres Strait Islander communities. So there needs to be long and hard thinking about the structure of any future arrangement. Some steps need to be taken. Even this government could take some steps to assist in the future. Despite some opposition by For""; eign Affairs, I think it would be possible in the future to allow representatives from the Torres Strait to attend, at least with an observer status, the South-Pacific Forum. I know there has been some objection to that in the past, but I think that would be a significant gesture to the people of the Torres Strait and I think it would assist further autonomy. The establishment of the authority formed part of the Commonwealth government's response to the 1993 report of the commission entitled Review of the operation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. The commission believed that consideration should be given to advancing the autonomy of the Torres Strait area. In the report, the commission spoke of the need to recognise Torres Strait Islanders as a different and separate group of indigenous Australians who continue to assert their cultural identity. The report further noted the commission's belief that there is a case for a movement towards further autonomy for the Torres Strait associated with the political steps being taken to secure a form of self-government for the Torres Strait. The bill before the House allows the minister, by notice in the Gazette, to increase the number on the TSRA from the current ceiling of 20 to a maximum of 23. This is a the very significant amendment. It was introduced as a result of a review of the constitutional electoral process of the Torres Strait Regional real Authority, which was commissioned by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The review was conducted by Professor Jeremy Beckett, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Sydney, who was chairperson, and Pastor Allan Mosby of Thursday Island, who is also a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The review committee expressed concern at the lack of representation given to Thursday Island in proportion to its population. Its report states that, according to the 1991 census, Thursday Island has approximately 35 per cent of the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal population of the Torres Strait area, but it is currently represented by only two of 20 regional councillors. For that reason, not only has the minister introduced the amendments before the House, but he has also commissioned Messrs Beckett and Mosby to further consult with people in the Torres Strait, assuming, of course, that bill goes through the House,· to determine which way the new positions-presumably three-will be distributed. I welcome the minister's decision as outlined in his second reading speech that, once that process is concluded, there will be a by-election. We are not going to wait until the next election. There will be a by-election and I think that will satisfy a lot of the concerns of people in the Torres Strait, especially in the Port Kennedy region, that there has been some underrepresentation of that area on the new authority. Obviously in all these discussions, as I said earlier,both the Port Kennedy Association and the Torres Shire Council will have something to say to Messrs Beckett and Mosby. I would like to digress for just a moment to congratulate Pedro Stephen, who was elected Mayor of the Torres Shire Council in March this year. Pedro is the first Torres Strait Islander to be elected to the Torres Shire Council and he is already showing vision and integrity and a desire to properly consult with his people. That is evidenced by a regular column in the Torres News and his reporting of council activities on TSIMA, which is the Torres Strait radio. The Torres Strait Regional Authority will deal with many difficult decisions over the next decade and beyond. It will have to make choices regarding infrastructure and environmental health as well as range of other issues that will have a great effect on the well-being of Torres Strait Islanders. I commend the contribution by the honourable member for Aston. I think it was a balanced. and very worthwhile contribution to the debate. But I think it is gross hypocrisy for coalition members, especially National Party members, after years of neglect and after a 10 per cent cut in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island funding promised in Fightback, to make speeches in this House, which they continue to do, suggesting that things like land acquisition and this legislation are not important and that we should concentrate on Aboriginal health or other issues. It is becoming increasingly obvious to me that there is a campaign going on. I think that the some people are unwittingly assisting this campaign-I would not suggest that they are part of this campaign--:'by suggesting that there is waste and corruption in expenditure on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The honourable member for Aston hit the nail on the head when he pointed to the cost of providing services to remote communities in Australia and, of course, the Torres Strait is only one point in question there. I know that the coalition spokesman referred to Ms Irene Moss's report. I think that when people say that money has been expended on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the results are not there, they forget the point that was made by the honourable member for Aston, and that is that the cost of housing in the Torres Strait is three or four times the cost of housing in capital cities. If a million dollars is expended on housing in the Torres Strait, someone in Canberra might ask, 'Where are the results?' , but the fact is that in the Torres Strait they get only a quarter of the number of houses that we get in Canberra for the same expenditure. I think that is what has happened. Irene Moss's report highlights difficulties that we are all aware of. Although there might be some misallocation of resources and there may even be some corruption somewhere, the reality is that we are in a total catch-up situation. There is no way that, in the short time there has been a Labor government in the Commonwealth or the state, any government could provide the catch-up to deal with the enonnous problems faced by remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commuIslander nities. ThaUs the real problem. Just last week someone from an island community said to me, 'We are in a catch-up situation here,' I think that is exactly right. I have already mentioned the years of neglect in Queensland by the National Party government. We have to analyse the question of allocation to Aboriginal communities as a whole. I realise that we have to be responsible to the taxpayer and that the taxpayer provides limits on Aboriginal funding, but if we are going to catch up we have to face the reality that we have to increase expenditure. The coalition has to face that reality. It cannot be two-faced about this matter. If the coalition is going to come into this House and complain about Aboriginal health, it has to face the fact that we are going to have to spend more money on Aboriginal health. I am sure that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and other people on this side of the House would quite happily welcome a bipartisan approach on (TIme expired) these issues. They would be quite happy for the coalition to come into this place and say, 'Let us set aside all the debates we have this place about deficits and expenditure, let us decide that we have to spend a lot money on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islandand er people.' If the coalition were serious about this matter, it would come into this House say that. It has not done that so far. It makes the right noises, it puts forward policies to expenditure by 10 per cent, and that is all hear. It is about time we took a approach on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. In the very short time left to me, I will refer to a problem which applies to Torres Strait Islander communities as much as it applies to Aboriginal communities in Australia. The question of native title has been somewhat resolved. The No. 1 problem for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is that of housing. If there is not a resolution of the housing problem, there will not be a resolupeople tion of the health problem and of all the other problems that beset Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Every remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait community in my electorate-I have visited almost all of them in the past two or three months-has up to 20 people living in and the one house. All of these communities are calling out more for more housing. The existing housing is overcrowded. That obvi. ously has effects on sewerage and on the provision of a whole range of health services. I am pleased that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), is looking at that question in talks with ATSIC at the moment. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who is at the table, is also involved in those· discussions. The states have to live up to their responsibilities in the area of housing. I am not in any way saying that other issues are not important. Of course, the land issue is developing. The government's priority should be to address the problem of housing. If it is addressed, we will be part of the way towards addressing the problem of Aboriginal health.",16
6,Mr HOLDING,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Melbourne Ports) (1.15 in p.m.}-I commend the Aboriginal and Torres and Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill more and I commend the Minister for Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the government for the initiative and they have taken in this matter. This is one further step along the road to political autonocut my for an important part of Australia, a part we where the voice of the indigenous people has bipartisan for too long been ignored. We have to ask ourselves: why is it so? Is it just a question of geography? Is it just a question of the remoteness of the Torres Strait Islands from the mainland of Australia? How is it that there is a greater level of political autonomy for the Norfolk Islanders, the descendants of the Bounty mutineers, than there is for our indigenous people in the Torres Strait Islands? I think there are p6s·sibly two explanations for that. One is that the of the Torres Strait Islands have always fiercely defended both their traditions and their culture. Their culture has been affected, and they are probably the most Christian community that we could find any part of Australia. I do not ever recall having been to an important meeting in the Torres Strait Islands where one did not begin or end with a Torres Strait Island hymn. I think the reason that we are so far in dealing with their legitimate aspirations self-government is that for years they were part of a state administration. The reality is ment. that, in terms of perceptions and social attitudes, Brisbane, the centre of state governhas ment, was probably in many ways far more remote in its thinking about the rights of Islander people than was Canberra. It .is interesting to note, when we look at the development of self-determination for our indigenous Aboriginal people and now our Torres Strait Island people, that it has been the initiative from Canberra which has set the pace. Despite the evidence, there is still view prevailing within significant elements the coalition that Aboriginal and Islander affairs are really the property of the state; that they are a matter for state administration are best left to state administration. We have that argument currently running fairly heavily in Western Australia following the Mabo case, which was centred in the Torres Strait Islands. When one looks at legislative record one should not forget attempts that were made by the Queensland government to deny Eddie Mabo his fundathinks mental rights by the passing of legislation which was aimed at denying him access to the legal process. I was reminded by one of my colleagues the opposition of the great record of Torres Strait Islanders in defending Australia in the last war. I remind the House, before those opposite. get too enthusiastic about it,. that was not until there was a Hawke Labor government that the real entitlements to pay for those who had served in that conflict were the subject of attention. The prevailing attitude, which is still to be found in areas the coalition, Wa!';, 'Out of sight, out of mind.' This bill goes some real distance towards saying to the Torres Strait Islander people, 'You are going to be responsible at the end the day for making the important decisions about the future of your island, the future of ment. in your children and the way in which your culture and your economic development will take place.' The important aspe£t about that is that it can best be done if we· treat the Torres Strait as part of a self-governing region behind of Australia, and if the Commonwealth for accepts its responsibility in this matter to provide the funds that will assist that developThe sooner the state of Queensland feels it nothing more than a very small administrative, supportive role to play the sooner we its can move to a situation where Torres Strait Islanders can ultimately accept responsibility for their development. This is not to say that all aspects of Commonwealth administration in the past have been as advanced as they should be. But, basically, in dealing with the rights of our indigenous people, all ministers a have had to deal with the problem in many of parts of Australia where attitudes which are basically racist, attitudes which basically do not recognise the legitimate aspirations of our and indigenous people be they Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islander people, still exist. This bill goes some distance, but there is still a long way to go, in providing hope and .encouragement to the Torres Strait Islander the people. I commend the bill to the House. I the commend the minister for his initiative in guiding this legislation through. Anybody who that is a simple role, given the problems that bedevil ministers for Aboriginal affairs, simply does not understand the political pressures that are continually applied. I in hope the bill has a speedy passage through the House. Clearly, the fact that the opposition is supporting the bill is one indication that it is starting to catch up with the it government's views on these important areas.",19
7,Mr CAMPBELL,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The quote 'Two men looked out two prison bars; one saw mud and the other saw stars' brings to my mind the different of perspectives this legislation can have. I support this legislation because I believe it is an improvement on what is fundamentally bad legislation. I believe that history has shown of that ATSIC has not been successful; and anything to change it would be an improveIt worries me, however, to hear talk of selfmanagement' management, independence, and all those sorts of things because I get lobbied continually by my very large Aboriginal constituency who are concerned about what they see as the establishment of a black state. They are aware of the United Nations' resolution of the International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples which. calls for full political autonomy for indigenous people, including the right to self-determination. This nation was founded on the basis of 'a nation for a continent and a continent for a nation'. There can be no subdivision of this nation if it is to survive. If subdivision is allowed-the establishment of autonomous regions with autonomous power-Australia as a nation will fail. This fact is understood by my constituents who continually say to me, 'We are Australians, we are part of Australia and we want to be recognised as such.' When I stood for election in 1980, I was told I could not win in the Kimberleys unless I got the support of a certain Mr Bieundurry. I duly went to see him and he said he would support me provided I supported the creation of a black state. I refused and fought the election without his support. As it turned out, the t\boriginal people did not vote at all in the federal election, which followed a week after the state election, and I still won. I have a very, very good Aboriginal vote despite the fact that I make my position very clear. The reason I get that vote is that my view is the view they share. I attended a meeting at Margaret River just recently with the Kimberley Aboriginal Association, a group of tribal people, including 75 elders, who genuinely represent their people-not like the ragtag of the Kimberley Land Council, which is recognised by the government. They were not against mining, they were calling for direct consultation on the matter with the council. They were unanimously opposed to the KC, although many of them said they had been foremost in setting up the KC some 20 years ago. I want to touch on self-management because the expression 'Aboriginal people must have self-management' is often used as a catch phrase. The problem with 'selfis that it is used as a device to deny exactly that. I will give an example of how it works. I was at Jagajaga recently, a satellite community set up out of Balga. It was set up by the then minister against the advice of the local community, against the advice of the regional estate manager of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and against my strong advice. We spent a large sum of money, over $5 million, on this. Jagajaga is the only community that is now occupied. It was built in an area that tends to flood in the winter. When I asked the consultant, who got 15 per cent of the contract price for setting it up, why he had put it there he said, 'That is where the people wanted it.' That was not true. When the people said they wanted it 'here', they meant they wanted it in that region. They did not mean right in that spot. Had he suggested, as a responsible consultant would have, that they move up the hill where they would have had better drainage, it would have, been much better for all concerned. As it was, when I arrived there they were pumping water out of the ground in one place and 200 metres away sewage was swilling around on the surface. There is an aquifer very close to the surface. We wonder why there are three hepatitis B and an encephalitis case in a small community. This is a case of self-management being abused. We say to these people, 'You must have management,' but we do not give them the tools. ATSIC had appointed a bookkeeper to this community. There is no doubt that the bookkeeper'was there at the instigation of ATSIC. He was there for over a year then he just got up and left. No money appeared to have been taken but the books were in a mess. ATSIC approached the local man and said, 'Will you take on the job? I know the community is a mess and I want the books audited.' They were duly audited and there was found to be a $40,000 hole in the community account. With the wet season coming on there was an urgent need to fill that hole, which could have been done by transferring money from the wages component of CDEP into a store account. The person involved and the auditor both told me that they consulted the ATSIC officers, who said, 'Yes, you can do that.' Immediately it was done, however, they were told it was against the law, and the wrath of ATSIC descended on this community. ATSIC people flew out there, took them off the CDEP and left the town in tunnoil. There were people there for two weeks with no money at all because it took that long to get them onto unemployment benefits. Here was a clear case of the community being blamed for the deficiencies of the organisation. It all done in the name of self-management. Many communities are endeavouring to function well. Some of the cattle stations that have been acquired in the Fitzroy Valley and in other areas, in tenns of the quality of improvements and the land care, the quality of general land management, are better today than they ever were under white management. The problem is that they cannot be selfsufficient because they cannot get stock. We allocate funds on a five-year plan. We do not allocate the funds early; so they cannot be spent. At the end of the year they are rolled over and the same funds are applied again. If the funds arrive halfway through the year, the Aboriginal community spends them by getting in white contractors, simply because they know they cannot do the work themselves. We then say, 'Look at these people; you give them this money and they get the whites to do the work for them.' The Aboriginal people do that only because they know there is no alternative in that short time scale. Time and time again we see ATSIC not funding the stations on time and not funding them where funding would lead to self-sufficiency. Noonkanbah, which in tenns of the land is now a picture-a lot of the land degradation has been cured and the land has been restored in many areas to pristine condition-should have 5,000 head of cattle. The dire consequence of Noonkanbah having 5,000 head of cattle is that it would be completely self-sufficient! It would not need the ongoing ATSIC support and control. One wonders whether that is why it does not happen. I believe, as do many Aboriginals, that welfare is killing Aboriginal people. The solution of a great· school of thought is to increase welfare. There will never be any real advancement until Aboriginal people are prepared to take responsibility for their actions and to demand that their views be heard. At the moment, it is being left to pressure groups that have the ear of the minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). These representatives are not supwas ported by the great bulk of Aboriginal people. Their agenda is clearly not the agenda of an Aboriginal community that is crying out to be recognised as Australian and part of Australia.",20
8,Mr TICKNER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (1.30 p.m.)-in reply-I take this opportunity to respond to the comments that have been made in the course of the debate. Obviously, I am not able to respond to each and every one of them, but I will begin by thanking members for their contribution to the debate. Having read the Hansard for those parts of the debate that I could not directly hear and having heard the remainder, I have found the contributions to the debate to be overwhelmingly positive. However, I want .to raise a number of matters that have been referred to in the course of those remarks. Firstly, I want to put in context the legislation that is before the House. There has been a great deal of public debate about the native title legislation in the aftennathof the High Court decision in the Mabo case, but there has been very little deb-te about the aspirations of Torres Strait Islanders in the aftermath of that very significant and historic High Court decision. The fact is that the native title legislation is of very little real relevance to Torres Strait Islanders. As they see it, they have won their epic battle in the High Court of Australia, and they see themselves as the owners of the Torres Strait Islands. Instead of seeking recourse to the native title legislation, they have a very different agenda. It is one that both sides of politics in this place can quite easily accommodate. The former minister, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), was right to allude to the unique and distinct race of the Torres Strait Islanders. They are proudly Australian. One only has to visit those islands that abut the coastline of Papua New Guinea, such as Saibai and Boigu, to find the tallest flagpoles in this country flying the Australian flag. Those Torres Strait Islanders are very proud Australians. They are also very proud to be one of the indigenous peoples of this country; Their unique culture and circumstances have caused them to aspire to a fonn of self-government by the year 2001. What they are talking about at the leadership level is not some claim to sovereignty or to break away from Australia. What they are saying is perfectly reasonable: given their great remoteness, not only from Canberra but from Brisbane and even Cairns, and given the fact that 30-plus government authorities each have a role in the administration of the Torres Strait, they believe that a far better system of government, more accountable to them and more effective in its delivery, would be a fonn of self-government. The national government has not taken a policy position on this issue of self government. There are obviously a great many issues to be worked through and negotiated if that aspiration of Torres Strait Islanders is to be adopted by the government. I hope that, if iUs adopted, it is done so by the whole parliament. The important point to stress is that this is not a threatening propositime tion. This is not one that adversely impacts on the rights of non-indigenous Australians or, I believe, on any other aspect of Australian government policy. I hope that, as we move forward over the remainder of this decade, whoever is in government, as well as the minister and the shadow minister, can negotiate with the Torres Strait Islanders, listen to their· aspirations and, to the greatest possible extent, move with them to accommodate their aspirations for self-government. I read the contribution to the debate by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and· Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). I strongly agree with some of the things she said, but I do want to take this opportunity in the public forum of the parliament to repeat my very deep commitment to encouraging the greatest possible cross-party cooperation in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. That does not mean that we cannot have a disagreement on issues of principle. I think it is very important that that discussion take place but, where things are said on the record that are patently false, it is my responsibility to correct them. One thing that the honourable member for Hindmarsh said was: ... a fundamental weakness of Labor's approach to the Torres Strait Islands has been its failure to recognise the unique civilisation of islanders and their need, living in a distant region of Australia, to manage their own affairs. I want to tell honourable members about the background to the relationship of this parliament with Torres Strait Islanders. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs was fonned in 1973. My being on that committee gave me the opportunity, in I think 1989 or 1990, to go to the Torres Strait Islands on a parliamentary committee inquiry. We were the first parlia. mentary committee ever in the recollection of officials and the Torres Strait Islanders themselves to go north of Thursday Island. No-one who was officially representing this parliament had ever been north of Thursday Island. It was very much my decision to change the name of my portfolio so that I could be called the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. My shadow minister at the changed the opposition's portfolio title, and the parliamentary committee also changed its name. I think that those name changes are very powerful and important symbols. If we do not even recognise the existence of Torres Strait Islanders, we can hardly expect them to believe we have credibility in our. dealings with them. This legislation is the fifth set of amendments in a series of amendments to the ATSIC Act. Every one of those amending packages has been passed through this parliament unanimously, except for a difference of opinion we had on whether or not the chairperson of ATSIC should be elected. To the great credit of the opposition and the Australian Democrats, they changed their minds and came to accept the view that there should be an elected chair of ATSIC. Now we unanimously agree that that will occur at the time of the next ATSIC elections. In the course of the debate a number of people have said some things about Peter Shergold, the former CEO of ATSIC. I take this opportunity to put on the public record my own comments about Dr Shergold. I say, modestly, that I am very grateful for the involvement I have had in public life-having had six years experience as an alderman, or a councillor as they are now more properly called, of the Sydney City Council, and 10 years in this place, with three years as the chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and now some four years as a minister. I say those things because in· all my time in public life I have not met a more competent, more effective, efficient and dedicated public servant than Peter Shergold. He is simply the best public servant that I have ever had the privilege to work with. When Peter Shergold finally passes from this earth he can look back on his time as the CEO of ATSIC with great pride. Although the story about how the native title legislation came to pass has never been publicly told, and there are probably 100 different versions of how it did come to pass, the fact is that Peter Shergold, with the chairperson of ATSIC and some other key negotiators, played a simply magnificent role and a quite proper role in the nature of his being a public servant in assisting that process. But Peter Shergold did much more than that. As all honourable members who have dealt with him know, he has been straight down the line when dealing with parliamentarians. It is his great work that has enabled ATSIC to develop to the extent that it has and to achieve what is now the cross-party support in this place that it properly deserves. I Dr Shergold well. He could earn a salary in the private sector probably four or five times greater than he can in the public sector, but he is very much committed to public life and to good government. I am very grateful for the opportunity to have worked with him. Pat Turner is already becoming a very prominent indigenous Australian, having taken over as the new CEO of ATSIC. She comes to that position with a great deal of experience, not only because of her own Aboriginal heritage but also her own public administration experience, having been a deputy in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet before coming to ATSIC. I think members will enjoy working with her. She is a very forthright person. Sometimes that may prove difficult for people from both sides of politics, but I think she will serve ATSIC well. I look forward to the very great contributions she will make in that position. I want to refer to a number of other matters that have been referred to in the course of the debate. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) spoke of the recent comments of Premier Wayne Goss when he suggested that the Commonwealth ought to take over, or at least take a greater responsibility for, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I want to say on the record that the government at the national level has taken no policy position on this issue. I did make a number of public comments, some of which were not reported accurately. My position is this: in the course of developing the social justice package of measuresthe government's third stage response to Mabo-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are going to ask us all to think very carefully about whether the present system of intergovernmental relations is the best system to properly deliver services and human rights to indigenous people, whether we have the best arrangements to tackle that disadvantage. They are asking us to think about whether there should be some shift in the Commonwealth, perhaps through ATSIC or through other mainstream government departments playing a greater role. I believe in cooperation. There is no area of wish public administration at the Commonwealth level where the Commonwealth has been as successful in getting intergovernmental cooperation. We have a national agreement signed by heads of government to cooperate in this area. After four years in this job I have very deep concerns about whether the present system is able to deliver to indigenous pe()ple. I believe that, as we head towards the centenary of Australia's federation, we cannot simply sit back and let indigenous people be the poorest and the sickest or the people with the worse housing, the highest levels of unemployment and the poorest standards of education. I think we can do better. I personally believe that there may be merit in exploring Premier Goss's suggestion; but this must be done in a very sensitive manner. I am not interested in buying a fight with state governments. I am certainly not interested in buying a fight with the coalition. I ask the coalition to keep an open mind on these questions. Noone is going to gazump the coalition. No-one is going to come from behind and lock it into a radical shift in policy. But the government is being asked by indigenous people to seriou-ly examine these issues, and we hope that the opposition will give those consultations no lesser respect than we intend to pay to them. I want to refer to the contribution by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). He made a number of very important points about. cross-party cooperation. I endorse his remarks. As the federal 'member representing the Torres Strait, he is a very powerful advocate in this place and publicly for the rights of Torres Strait Islanders. I to thank him for his contribution to this debate. The honourabl- member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), a National Party member, began his contribution by congratulating the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), a Labor member, on his contribution to the debate. I think that is the style of debate and personal relations that we should try to develop in this portfolio. Let us elevate this area of public affairs above what is often, as I am sure we all agree, at least privately, the occasional rather irrelevant head kicking and daily party political point scoring that will not take public policy in indigenous affairs very far. The member for Wide Bay, however, was critical of the election process for ATSIC. I too have some concerns about aspects of that election process, but the point I make to him is that none of the problems that have ev.entuated in the course of the election were anything to do with ATSIC. .ATSIC did not conduct the elections; they were conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. I think it is unfortunate, when criticisms are. made of the election process, that the point that it is not the fault of ATSIC is not clearly made. I am tempted to suggest that within this parliament we should fonn an organisation to be called 'The friends of ATSIC·. As Commissioner Mick Dodson said, ATSIC gets blamed for just about everything, including the weather. Therefore, we need to be vigilant in defending the commission. I thank the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) for his contribution, and especially his emphasis on stressing the extent of public accountability that existed over the work of ATSIC. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the former shadow minister, deserves commendation as well for his balanced contribution. In the time available to me I want to tum to the central part of myretnarks. There are still quite significant difficulties in achieving a genuine and deep basis of cross-party cooperation in indigenous affairs. I cannot fudge those issues and want to put them on the record at this time. The first is the opposition by the coalition want to the land fund. As I have pointed out on earlier occasions, the establishment of a land fund is not a radical proposition. The coalition back in 1974 supported the establishment of an earlier form of land fund, which was not progressed in the way we intend it to progress the 1994 version. The speakers in that debate included the former member for Moore, Mr John Hyde, one of the driest economists this parliament has ever seen. Further supporting him in the debate was the predecessor to the present Deputy Leader of the NationalParty. A land fund should be directly in line with coalition philosophy. It is about greater self reliance. It is about redressing a wrong of the past, but one that continues' to have a real impact on the lives of indigenous people today. That is the first issue where I believe the coalition must shift if it is to be respected by the wider community-the churches and other concerned Australians. The second issue is the question of the maintenance of expenditure in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. We have an inter-governmental agreement that commits each government not to reduce expenditure. When the coalition went to the election on the last occasion, as honourable members will recall from Fightback 1, there were cuts to the third time. CDEP; even in Fightback 2 cuts to education and employment programs still remain. The honourable member for Leichhardt was right to say that we should elevate this whole area above any suggestion of cutbacks in expenditure. We might have differences of opinion about where the money goes, and let us argue about that, but let us not use Aboriginal affairs as a football and suggest that we will cut the funding. I have mentioned the importance of the coalition adopting an open-minded approach to the question of the consultations on the social justice package. They are being conducted by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation· with ATSIC. None of us-neither government nor opposition-must seek to preempt the outcome of those consultations. Let us seriously engage in dialogue, debate, and indeed negotiation with indigenous people on those issues. Finally, I turn my attention to the question of the NativeTitle Act. I ask people to think ahead to the next election. Are we really going to go into the next election with a coalition having a public commitment to repealing the most important legislation that this parliament has ever passed, using the power given to us by the 1967 referendum? Are we really going to have the coalition out there in those rural seats beating the racist drum-that is what it will be in many casesof prejudice, whipping up fear and hysteria against the operation of the Native Title Act? Are we going to see the coalition threaten to repeal the Native Title Act and thus strike most savage blow to the process of reconciliation and to Australia's standing in the eyes of the world? I hope we are not. I am going to make it my business to put the coalition on the spot and to push the coalition to adopt a more moral, ethical, responsible and moderate approach to this issue. (TIme expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

9,Mr LINDSAY,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (LSI p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Automotive Industry Authority was established in 1984 to guide the automotive industry through the substantial changes imposed on it by the introduction of the car plan. The focus of the car plan has been on industry restructuring and the promotion of an internationally competitive automotive manufacturing sector. Reviews in 1988 and 1991 have maintained this approach through the continuation of a policy of reduced assistance complemented by various mechanisms to promote rationalisation and increased economies of scale from export production. The automotive industry has responded to this policy with the rationalisation of manufacturing activity and is emerging as an efficient manufacturer and exporter of world-class vehicles and components. The Automotive Industry Authority has made a substantial contribution to this development. The government remains committed to maintaining an Australian automotive manufacturing capability. It is cognisant of the strategic value of this capability not only in terms of direct employment and productive the capacity in the automotive sector but also as a catalyst for the development of new technologies and new production techniques relevant across Australian manufacturing. The key .issue now is whether the industry is able to continue to improve its competitiveness within the existing policy framework and administrative arrangements under the car plan. Many of these factors that affect the industry'S competitiveness cut across a number of Commonwealth portfolios and may require a response at state level. It is true that as a result of the reviews undertaken in 1988 and 1991 the policy arid the administrative structure itself have become progressively less complex. The direction for automotive policy is to work with the industry not only to monitor its response to existing policy but also to address the basic industry development and business environment issues which impact on its performance. The decicant sion to repeal the Automotive Industry Authority Act reflects these changing demands. In future, activities relating to automotive policy development and implementation, consideration of strategic issues impacting on lyindustry the automotive industry, delivery of generic programs to automotive firms and monitoring will be consolidated within the Department of IIidustry, Science and Technology. IIi repealing the legislation, the government has allocated the equivalent of the AutomoIn tive IIidustry Authority's annual appropriation of $1.1 million to cover the costs of winding down the authority, meeting financial obligastopped tions and relocating staff. Following this initial expenditure, there will be an ongoing saving of $600,000 annually. I commend the bill to honourable members.  Automotive Industry Authority Repeal Bill is ments. fairly straightforward. It provides the legislative basis for closing down the Automotive IIidustry Authority. The decision to wind up the authority was recently taken by the ernment and announced in the Working Nation document. Since 1984 a range of measures has been in place to encourage the rationalisation and substantial international competitiveness of the Australian passenger motor vehicle and component tariff industry. These measures are collectively known as the passenger motor vehicle plan or the car plan. The car plan was developed consultation with the automotive industry has the dual aims of winding back protection of the industry, while at the same time proving its performance by reducing the number of domestic producers, reducing the number of models of motor vehicles, improvvehicles ing productivity· within the industry, and improving export performance. The car plan was reviewed and modified in 1988. The changes introduced at that time included the abolition of the local content rule and the introduction of a new, more flexible export facilitation scheme. The plan was again reviewed in 1990 by the Industry Commission. The IIidustry Commission found that, even after six years, there was still a signifiamount of protection afforded to the . industry. In recognising this, it stated in its report: The primary objective of the post 1992 assistance arrangements for the passenger motor vehicle must therefore be to remove or significantreduce the extent of the preferred treatment which the industry currently receives. In the Commission's view, only that production which can survive without special treatment from the government can be regarded as truly viable and internationally competitive. line with these comments the commission recommended that protection be reduced to 15 per cent by the year 2000. The commission short of recommending the complete removal of tariff protection because it was concerned to avoid undue disruption to the industry. The commission wanted to ensure that the automotive industry was given a suitable transition period in which to arrange its affairs to accommodate the new arrangeThe Industry Commission also recommended that the duty free entitlement and export facilitation scheme be retained to the year gov2000. Again I quote from the commission's report: A concern to avoid introducing additional adjustment pressures and uncertainties at the time of tariff reductions and the fact that the significance of these measures will diminish as the falls, were the dominant considerations underlying its decision on this matter. Subsequent to this review a new set of initiain tives was announced in the March 1991 and industry statement. The present passenger motor vehicle plan is intended to take the imindustry through to the year 2000 and includes the following key elements: a reduction in tariffs applying to passenger motor of 2.5 per cent per year, phasing down to 15 per cent at the end of the decade; the continuation of the 15 per cent entitlement to duty free import of passenger motor vehicle products; and the continuation of the export facilitation scheme, including its extension component manufactures. The car plan is to be reviewed again in 1996, with policy directions and new arrangements for the post 2000 period to be announced· in 1997. The coalition welcomes this review. We also welcome the time lag between when the changes were announced and when they will take effect. As I have consistently said, business makes investment decisions well before these decisions are actually put in place. Business continuity to facilitate long-term planning. Moreover, parent companies need some degree of certainty about government policy before they will sanction major changes at their subsidiary level. It will thus be of benefit to the automobile companies that they will know the direction of industry policy the 21st century before or about the time when they are making these decisions on activities for that particular period. The automotive industry has made huge changes and achieved a great deal in the last few years. Productivity, exports, quality, employee training and skill levels, product development and technical expertise have all increased. Productivity alone grew by 17 per cent in 1993 and a total of 31 per cent in the last two years. The introduction of new production techniques such as quality circles and just-in-time manufacturing have made a big contribution to the improved performance of the industry.. But a large proportion of these gains can be attributed to employees and their willingness to adopt new ways of doing things. Investment, too, is on the increase, with Mitsubishi, Toyota and GMH all committing themselves to upgrades of their existing plant or the introduction of new facilities. Investment spending is forecast to increase to $2 billion by 1997. Investment from 1994 to 1997 is projected to be 41 per cent higher in real terms than it was in the period from 1982 to 1985. The industry has recorded growth. in exports over recent years. Since 1984, exports have increased by a massive 282 per cent. In 1993 alone, exports grew by 17.5 per cent to $L5 to billion. This achievement is all the more impressive when one considers the recession induced weakness of the European and Japa... nese markets and the decline of the Ford Capri. In quality terms, too, there have been big gains. 9f the six models produced in 1993, four recorded lower faults than in 1992. Over the period from 1988 to 1993, the number of owner reported faults in locally produced cars fell by 39 per cent, while owner satisfaction increased by 14.3 per cent. The growth of the automotive industry does needs not end there. The automotive component industry has also been going great guns, to say the least. Production is on the increase and this sector now exports to Asia, Europe and the US. One of our domestic manufacturers is supplying instruments to Merecedes Benz in Germany, while Bosch Australia is into exporting automotive components to Germany, the US, Mexico and SQuth-East Asia. There is no doubt that the industry has done it fairly hard over the last few years, but talk to any of the players and they will say that they are largely over the' hurdles and do face quite a bright and challenging future. In saying this, and as the era of the Automotive Industry Authority comes to an end, I congratulate the management of major car companies for taking the tough decisions and applaud the faith placed in, the Australian subsidiaries by their overseas parent companies. I know that sometimes it has not been easy, but I think the outcomes have been well worth it. The Automotive Industry Authority was established in 1984. Its charter is to administer the car plan, monitor the industry and advise the government on the state of the industry as well as any other issues which may be impacting on that sector. The key mechanism by which the authority provides this information is its annual publication, titled Report on the state of the automotive industry, which is tabled in parliament each year. This is a very constructive and useful document. It was of considerable benefit to me in my time as shadow minister for industry. B-ause of its usefulness and the ongoing contribution of the automotive industry to manufacturing in Australia, I would have been concerned to see the demise of this annual report. Accordingly, I was reassured to note that in the debate of this bill in the Senate government advised that this report would continue to be produced but that it would be incorporated in the annual report of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. The Automotive Industry Authority currently has an annual administrative budget of just on $1.1 million and employs nine people. The wind-up will cost $1.1 million. This will meet costs incurred by making redundancy payments, relocating staff and paying out building lease obligations. The government expects to make annual savings of $600,000 as a result of the closure of the authority, and $500,000 of the current budget will be transferred to the department of industry as it takes over some of the outstanding responsibilities of the authority. These functions will include monitoring the state of the industry, identifying any problems and advising on policy. To assist in this, four of the automotive authority staff will be transferred to the department. The integration of the automotive sector with the rest of industry in an administrative sense has merit, and the coalition is happy to support it. Indeed, we consider that this new proposal will ensure consistency in industry policy and reduce duplication. Members may be aware that the Department of Industry, Science and Technology already has an automotive unit that undertakes policy coordination and advises on industry development. However, there is some concern that discussions and any new policy proposals will emanate out of Canberra. Given that the industry is largely based in Melbourne, I am concerned that the Canberra bureaucrats may become out of touch with what is actually happening in the industry and that this will be reflected in policy measures, especially the post-2ooo arrangements. The government must give its assurance that it will guard against this. Apart from those very minor concerns, I make it known-as I have made it known in this House on previous occasions-that the coalition does support this bill.",26
10,Mr TUCKEY,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"I can give the shadow minister for finance, the  the an assurance that our government will ensure that this industry is properly operated in the year 2000. In fact, we will probably be commencing our activities in 1996, which I notice is also a period of review. In that regard, we will not need any advice from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) because the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) will be able to give that guarantee when he becomes Prime Minister. I enter this debate on the Automotive Industry Authority Repeal Bill because I would like to see a few issues in regard to the motor car industry in Australia put on the record and to highlight some of the issues that were addressed by the Fraser government. The second reading speech gives us some clear advice on the history of the authority, which is to be disbanded under this legislation. It outlines how certain reviews were conducted and certain policies were outlined in the beginning. I recollect that one of the initial proposals was that there be a reduction in the number of models of motor cars actually manufactured or assembled in Australia to six. At the time. I thought that was a bit strange because I thought it was forgetting history. History had told us that many years ago the General Motors group and the American manufacturing sector, which were victims of a very inflexible mass production system which took up to a year to change a production line for a new model, took the option in responding to that problem of having a 'world car'-a Volkswagen, if you like-something that could be manufactured in every part of the world on the same production line. That is the way they proposed to achieve economies. At the same time the Japanese, recognising technological advances and change, put their mind to the production line and produced a flexible production line that could actually be changed almost daily to produce different models of motor cars. This was the huge watershed in the production of cars around the world. The Japanese offered the consumer a mass of models and the Americans were trying to focus on a single model. As history records, the Americans lost. Yet this government years ago decided that Australia must confine the number of models it produced-at a time when the world, and particularly Australian buyers, wanted as many models as possible. At that particular time, we saw a decline in the number of Australian manufactured cars, particularly the Ford Falcon and the Commodore, because of this decision. But we have forgotten that, as this was recognised and other facilities were put in place. In fact, so-called export facilitation scheme eventually became the basis upon which the Australian car industry started to grow. This was because there are segments within the Australian car industry in which we are highly efficient or competitive. I make the differentiation between efficient and competitive. We are often competitive because, for instance, we have huge resources of raw materials, particularly aluminium and steel, which are fundamental to the manufacture of an engine, a transmission or mag wheels. These are three of the areas where car manufacturers have managed to export in large quantity. We now have a super-efficient operation in Tasmania where a mag wheels factory has been put alongside an aluminium smelter. It produces wheels from the liquid product, which is the ultimate of energy conservation and efficiency. That is to be commended. We should be doing more of it. We should be asking ourselves why we melt steel more than once if we can turn it into an engine block at the first attempt. People talk about the house effect and all those things. This is where the government should be focusing its attention, not on carbon taxes, which is the absolute negative to efficient and competitive industry. I come back to the words 'efficient' and 'competitive'. Efficiency creates a competitive status, but even when lacking raw materials, as the Japanese have proved, an industry can still be efficient and highly competitive. I think the other factor that needs to go on the record is that the recent improvement in the number of sales of locally manufactured motor cars has been significantly attached to the growth in the value of the Japanese yen. As that yen has increased in value, and consequently the cost of items produced in Japan, our cars have become more competitive. That has been affected just recently. For all the pride we take in seeing our dollar increase in value, it is particularly bad news for our manufacturers and people producing exportable commodities. I think that issue must be understood. For that reason, I am rather pleased that, probably reflecting the government's mismanagement and its inability to contain its desire to borrow money, as the the government continues to borrow money in these more propitious times, the value of the Australian dollar fell one cent against the American dollar yesterday. These are some of the issues. It is silly to think that this legislation, which does away with an authority we did not need in the first instance,is necessary. The principles on which it was based, which were to reduce the number of models made in Australia, were not necessarily right. A lot of other aspects of the car industry need to be considered. Again, I will give a bit of history. I remember-I have never heard what the outcome was-when Toyota and Holden were encouraged to create a joint venture. Consequently, that resulted in the rebadged Commodore becoming the Lexcen and the Camry becoming the Holden Apollo. This re-badging within the Australian industry was probably a good proposal. It is interesting to note that at one stage in time, when certain of the activities of these two green- companies were amalgamated, there were some property transfers. In stepped the tax commissioner, who said that he wanted $160 million in capital gains tax on account of the transactions. I never heard what the government did about that. I would have gone out and shot him. Here is a government authority-the very authority that today we will dismantle-saying to two car manufacturers, 'Thou wilt join together. I have spoken.' Because they were forced to join and in that process some properties had to change hands and valuations had to be properly made, as the company law and other government statutes provide, the tax commissioner wanted $160 million. I think he was told that he was just about to lose a car industry and he probably never went ahead with it, but it raises a particularly interesting aspect. If we are trying to promote the car industry and we think the only solution is a car authority, the tax commissioner should not be out there trying to kill the industry. I take that a little further in the context the overall debate. This government, to its absolute discredit, fought tooth and nail in the interests of power over responsibility when it fought us at the last election. To this day, the indirect taxes imposed by this government's regime-namely, fuel tax, sales tax and the only tax that the state governments have left that brings them any substantial revenue, payroll tax-are putting $800 of lead into the saddlebags of our local manufacturers. That figure is probably higher now because of that iniquitous increase in fuel taxes in the previous budget, the first one after the last election. There is no contesting that figure. It is probably more than $800 by now. That is probably a conservative figure. That figure, produced by the federal Treasury, is the flow-on amount from the sales tax, payroll tax and fuel tax on the mining of iron ore and coal. Nobody can exactly identify where that figure comes from but we all know it is there. We then say to our local manufacturers, 'Go out and compete with the Japanese, the Europeans and the Americans who are coming back into our market with locally manufactured, products.' We are told that they are going to cease designing Falcons and Commodores in Australia simply because it is cheaper to do it somewhere else. This is the situation in Australia. Why should we load up the industry with these sorts of taxes when there are mechanisms to avoid this happening? This industry competes not only in the export market-competition we desperately need to develop in order to repay the debts that this government has contracted for our kids; an international debt of some $200 billion-but also at home. With reduced tariff regimes, which the opposition does not oppose because we perceive it as a sensible arrangement, the real challenge for Australian car manufacturers and others is to make sure they are competitive. They must use every component available to them to be competitive. We have given them the benefit of local raw materials. The industry is in a great position to compete, as it has demonstrated with the technology available and the automation applicable particularly to engine manufacture. The of industry is competing but it is getting the additional benefit of the export facilitation scheme. The export facilitation scheme was introduced by Phil Lynch. It is a bit like the family assistance supplement, which was a Malcolm Fraser initiative in the first place. The government makes some peripheral changes to both schemes and then says that it invented them. Those opposite did not invent either scheme, and I want to put that on the record. The simple fact is that the export facilitation scheme, the idea of giving manufacturers export credits for being able to export certain components of a motor car which we happen to make more efficiently than other parts of the world and then being able to import things that those other places make most efficiently, is very sensible. I want honourable members to remember that the late Phil Lynch introduced this scheme into this parliament; it has only been revamped. This scheme was eventually found to be the better solution and the one that was most effective in getting the industry up and going. It is better than the earlier more socialist proposal of forming an automotive industry authority and telling companies what sort of cars they would make and not consulting the buyers on what sort of cars they wanted to buy. These are the sorts of silly things that can result when a country has a socialist solution instead of a market oriented solution. By evolution the authority discovered some of these problems and eventually returned to the export facilitation scheme. That has been quite productive for the industry. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Forrest, said, we welcome the removal of this authority. We as the future government will monitor the effect of returning some of the powers to Canberra. I think we hold the view that Canberra is not necessarily the best place to make some of th-se decisions because it is too remote from where things are happening. That is a matter of time. We will look at this matter very closely as time goes by. We are pleased to see the prosperity that has returned to the industry and we hope it survives. It will survive if the government gets its economic program correct. Letting interest rates go up is no way to encourage the sale of motor cars, which are mostly financed on credit. Motor car sales will not be encouraged if the government is in the same marketplace for money, competing with people who want to buy motor cars. That is exactly what is happening at the moment. We are going to have interest rate increases simply because the government will not take the obvious option available to it, which is to reduce its own expenditure as a cooling mechanism for the economy and vacate the loan market so that the private sector can invest, buy the motor vehicles and do all those things that will keep people in jobs. The government borrows money principally to pay people who do not have jobs. However, if the government gave the private sector the chance and did not compete with it and if the government created a circumstance where interest rates were not likely to rise, it is probable that those people would have jobs and would not need the government's assistance.",29
11,Mr LINDSAY,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (2.20 p.m.)-in reply-In concluding the debate on the Automotive Industry Authority Repeal Bill, let me thank the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) for a detailed and sensible contribution to the debate. The contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was largely irrelevant to the bill. Let me assure him that the government and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology are working with the industry to identify any indirect costs and ways to attempt to reduce them. A working party, which was an initiative of the white paper, is to be established in order to address these particular issues. I assure the House that the government will work closely with state governments on all issues in connection with reducing indirect costs and attempting to improve the productivity of the automotive industry. I notice that the honourable member for O'Connor is still hankering for the return of Fightback, that disastrous policy that would have inflicted such great damage on the Australian people. It proposed cuts to expenditure of over $10 billion annually and, above all, the horror goods and services tax of 15 per cent which would have applied to all goods and services, with the exception of basic foodstuffs. So thank God that at the last election the people of Australia rejected Fightback, which proposed a goods and services tax, and are now enjoying the benefits of a good government, the Keating Labor . government, which provides good, stable economic direction for this country, as is evidenced by virtually every economic index that could be applied. This important bill deals with an industry which is now emerging confidently from the difficult year of 1991-92. There has been· improvement in productivity, improvement in domestic sales, improvement in efficiency and improvement generally in employment opportunities. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 27 June. Second Reading",32
12,Mr LINDSAY,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (2.24 p.m.)-I move: . That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill is to give effect to changes to operational rules applying to pooled development funds, announced as part of a wide range of measures by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 4 May 1994 in the white paper on employment, industry and regional development. The pooled development fund program, which was introduced in June 1992, is a mechanism for channelling patient equity capital to small and medium sized enterprises. Pooled development funds are concessionally taxed investment companies that may be established under the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992 for the purpose of investing in equity in eligible businesses. The program arose out of a recognition that there are imperfections in the capital markets and that small and medium sized firms often have difficulty in obtaining equity capital, especially those that are in the early stages development. The availability of development capital for such firms is unduly constrained by several factors, with the main ones being a tendency to excessive risk aversion and shortterm investment outlook by many suppliers of capital, the lack of a ready market for trading in their equity securities, and some general adverse perceptions about the risk of such investments. The program has not had the anticipated impact on creating a pool of investment funds, as only $35 million has been raised by pooled development funds. This is because there is a view that the incentive available under the program is not sufficient to compensate for the risk associated with this class of investment, and because some of the operational rules have been seen as being overly restrictive. The Keating Labor government is committed to ensuring that the program makes an impact on ameliorating the difficulties faced by small and medium sized enterprises in accessing capital. It was with this objeCt in mind that the Prime Minister announced the changes to improve the tax incentive under the program, and the flexibility of the pooled development fund operational rules. Under the revised taxation arrangements the existing incentives available under the pooled development fund program have been improved by reducing the concessional tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent on the profits pooled development funds derive from investing in businesses. It should be noted that the tax rate on the profits of a pooled development fund derived from non-small and medium sized enterprise investments, such as interest earned from securities, will remain at 25 per cent. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) will be introducing legislation to give effect to this measure. This bill introduces a range of measures to revamp the program by freeing up the rules under which pooled development funds operate, in line with the experience of the scheme and having regard to the views of the development capital industry. The rules are to be relaxed in the following ways. Firstly, a of pooled development fund will be able· to invest in companies with total assets up to $50 million, which is an increase of $20 million above the existing limit of $30 million for investee businesses. Secondly, a pooled development fund will no longer be restricted in its investments in start-up businesses. Thirdly, pooled development funds will be allowed to invest up to 30 per cent of their raised capital in anyone in vestee business. This is an increase from the existing 20 per cent limit. Fourthly, the Pooled Development Fund Registration Board will be given a discretionary power to allow pooled development funds to invest more than the prescribed 30 per cent limit in anyone small andmedium sized enterprise investment under conditions agreed by the board. Finally, individual ownership in pooled development funds will be raised from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, except for banks and life offices for whom there is no limit. The board's discretionary power to vary this restriction has been retained. The amendments also increase the percentage of raised capital that a pooled development fund must invest in investee companies from 50 per cent to 65 per cent. The eligibility criteria definetf'in the Pooled Development Fund Act are essentially unchanged. A company applying for pooled development fund registration must convince the Pooled Development Fund Registration Board that it can and will raise capital and will use that capital to purchase new equity in Australian companies in a manner consistent with the various operational rules applying to pooled development funds. An applicant must provide the pooled development fund registration board with investment and capital raising plans. The new arrangements will apply to existing pooled development funds. The new tax rate and pooled development fund operational rules will apply from 1 July 1994. The Keating Labor government is-aware of the vital contribution to employment, economic growth, and export potential made by the small and medium sized business sector. The pooled development fund program is but one element of a range of measures that the Keating Labor government has introduced to assist this sector. I believe that the program is ness. an important initiative tIlat will improve the accessibility of small business to capital, and assist in economic growth. I commend the bill to honourable members.",32
13,Mr ROCHER,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"The Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill amends the Pooled ""Development Funds Act 1992 in accordance with the changes announced in the government's white paper published on 4 May. The coalition does not oppose the bill. However, we do believe the PDF scheme is indicative of Labor's lack of understanding of what small and medium sized businesses need and want. Access to equity is important, but the general or broad policy environment in which small business operates is the most important factor. One of the most important measures the government can take is in its budget. As we all know, responsible commentators are saying increasingly that the government's fiscal policy, as represented in its previous two budgets, is totally irresponsible and will not foster the broad policy environment so necessary for the growth and success of the small business sector. The pooled development funds program, the PDF p'rogram, was introduGEd in June 1992 as part of the now largely irrelevant One Nation statement. This program provides for the establishment of concessionally taxed investment companies. Companies must invest in established small and medium sized firms that have as their sole purpose the provision of patient equity capital for eligible investments in companies which are resident in Australia. These companies must also have assets of less than $30 million. Distribution of dividends from the funds and capital gains on the disposal by taxpayers of PDF shares are tax exempt. The income of PDFs was originally taxed at the rate of 30 per cent, as you might recall, Mr Deputy Speaker. In last year's budget the tax rate on the income of PDFs was lowered from 30 per cent to 25 per cent of taxable income. The government will be introducing legislation into this place to reduce the concessional rate on PDFs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent on the income derived from investing in busiThe bill now before the House aims to improve the operation of the pooled development funds, which to date have been an abject failure. The government freely admits this, as does the PDF Registration Board. Some of the registered pooled development funds also claim that the current legislation is inadequate to provide increased amounts of capital for small and medium businesses. The bill relaxes a number of rules currently applying to the PDFs. Clause 4 of the bill enables a PDF to invest in companies with total assets of up to $50 million, which is an increase of $20 million on the existing limit of $30 million for investee businesses. Clause 6 provides for decisions taken by the PDF Registration Board under the discretionary powers proposed· in clause 7 to be subject to review, and that is welcome. Clause 7 of the bill allows a PDF to invest up to 30 per cent of its raised capital in any one investee business, that is, an increase over the existing 20 per cent. This clause will also provide the PDF Registration Board with a discretionary power to exceed this new limit in certain circumstances. The PDF Registration Board will be provided with a discretionary power to allow PDFs to invest in excess of the prescribed 30 per cent limit in anyone business at any point in time. However, the board may not exercise its discretion if it believes that an investment exceeding the prescribed limit is being sought for the pur:' pose of avoiding taxation provisions. A discretion exercised by the board will require agreement by the PDF to meet the prescribed 30 per cent limit within a specified time. Clause 9 contains a new provision to allow the PDF Registration Board to revoke the registration of a PDF in the event it fails to comply with the board's conditions for exceeding the 30 per cent limit of the proportion of a PDF's raised capital that a PDF may invest in anyone business. Clause 10 sets the penalty for the failure to comply with an undertaking to the PDF Registration Board under, once again, its discretionary powers provided under clause 7. Clause 13 of the bill removes the restriction on the level of investments in start-up businesses by a PDF. Clause 16 allows individual ownership in PDFs to be raised from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, except for banks and life offices for which there is no limit, while retaining the PDF Registration Board's discretionary power to vary the restriction. Clause 32 of the bill increases the percentage of raised capital that PDFs must invest in investee companies from 50 per cent to 65 per cent. We are assured by the government that no financial impact arises from the amendments to the PDF Act. On 27 January 1994, almost two years after the launch of the now infamous One Nation statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when interviewed on the ABC's AM program, faced the following question from Maxine MCKew: Why not (give) more assistance to specifi- industries to help promote value added proguctlOn? The Prime Minister'& response was: Well, we've got a number of quite innovative tax measures here. We've got pooled-we've got pooled development funds to provide funds for small and medium businesses that can't get equity on the stock markets, that just can't get equity privately. He then went on to enunciate other One Nation proposals that have largely been unsuccessful or even less successful than the PDFs. When addressing the House during the second reading speech for the Pooled Development Funds Bill 1992, the then Minister for Science and Technology said: This program is an important element in the Government's overall strategy of removing impediments to the growth of Australian industry and improving the employment prospects of all Australians. He went on to say: The Government is aware that this program will not meet all the needs for channelling capital to small and medium sized firms. It is somewhat reassuring to note that the government was aware that the PDF scheme would not be able to provide all the capital that small and medium sized businesses require because to date-two years on-only about $35 million has been raised. I put it to the House that $35 million does not go very far and should be regarded in the light of the extravagant claims made for the scheme earlier and repeated here today by the gentleman at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). It is hard to believe that many small or medium sized firms have received any benefit from the PDF scheme. John Kavanagh stated in the Business Review Weekly on 2 July 1993: Paul Keating's One Nation statement in February 1992 launched a fiscal program designed to help revive the Australian economy. The slow take-offit is very slowof many of the government's initiatives has been well documented, but One Nation has other problems that are just coming to light. The package included two tax advantaged investment incentives: pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds. This was in 1993. He went on to say: So far, not a single dollar has been invested through these pools. Kavanagh went Oil to write: Some in the investment banking community are critical of the government's approach in putting the to: PDF structure together. One says: They have learned nothing from the failure of the Management and Investment Company (MIC) scheme. That is the old MIC scheme. It continues: In the earlier case they gave some tax incentives but made them so conditional the funds were unattractive. They have done the same things with the PDFs. The 1992-93 annual report of the PDF Registration Board had this to say: As at 30 June 1993 no other registered pooled development fund has raised; or had attempted to raise, capital. In fact, the PDFs have reported great difficulty in generating investor interest, given the limited incentives that the program offers. There is no incentive for superannuation funds to invest in a PDF, and there has been a lack of general enthusiasm from banks and large corporations, who obviously perceive the incentives to be insufficient. Even the second reading speech on this bill by the gentleman at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, highlights the failure of the PDF scheme to prove itself attractive to investors. That is either acknowledged or inherent in what he had to say. The Greenchip group is now the biggest participant in the PDF scheme. It is interesting to note what it has to say on the performance of the PDF scheme. Greenchip freely admits that there is a perception the PDF scheme has failed and the regulatory framework applying to the scheme is too conservative. However, Greenchip believes that the basic soundness of the PDF scheme principles are borne out by the British equivalent of our PDF scheme which it claims has been a success. Perhaps it was not introduced by Margaret Thatcher but, if it were, it would have removed one of those old hoary chestnuts those opposite trot out about Tory governments in the United Kingdom because the British equivalent of our scheme appears to be a model in which the one practising investment company, Greenchip, seems to have confidence. Greenchip suggests that any improvements to the PDF scheme should aim Minimise the degree of detailed regulation in the scheme, allowing more scope for the established mechanisms of the market; maintain, or even increase, the emphasis on performance; increase the reward-to-risk ratio, perhaps dramatically, for a relatively short period, then moving to a lesser, long-term level; and adjustment to the realities and language of the financial sector (as in such matters as the size of investee companies, the financial instruments that are acceptable, and the name of the scheme). There are six weaknesses in the PDF scheme that Greenchip refers to of which this bill rectifies only one and foreshadows one other. This bill increases the ceiling of an in vestee company's total assets from $30 million to $50 million and a future treasury bill will reduce the concessional tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. They are the two matters that the government has addressed, whereas in the considered opinion of Greenchip, a prominent practitioner in the PDF scheme, there are six. However, there are other aspects of this bill which increasingly free up the operations of the PDF scheme, as I have mentioned previously. Even allowing for Greenchip's belief that the PDF scheme can be improved, with which the coalition agrees, as of April 1994 Greenchip resources had made 17 investments and Greenchip development had made 15 with both portfolios having a combined market value of $23 million. Many of these investments were taken up via the placement of new shares and the subunderwriting of new share issues. One would question whether underwriting and subunderwriting could not be arranged through existing markets. However, I can only speculate 6n that at this time. But I would suggest that, if the PDFs are going to be involved in merely subunderwriting, it is a function that might very well be carried out adequately in the private sector as is the case with most capital raisings. If a subunderwriting project is successful, it does not matter very much whether it is written by taxpayer funded PDFs or by stockbrokers and their clients. Many of these investments were taken up, as I said, via the placement of new shares and the subunderwriting of new shares. Some investee companies were either being relisted or listed for the first time. Gr.eenchip Resources invests in companies operating in the resource sector-that is gold, oil, gas and the like-and Greenchip Development invests in companies that clearly demonstrate a strategic niche in their industry, either through product differentiation or geographical location. Greenchip, in its reports to shareholders, has detailed several success stories, the details which time will not allow me to go into here. Greenchip, however, is the exception rather than the norm in the PDF scheme. Eleven companies are currently registered under the Pooled Development Funds Act by the PDF Registration Board. One previously registered fund requested the board to revoke its registration and the request was granted. To date, only three PDFs have raised funds totalling $35 million, as has been mentioned both by my friend at the table and by me previously. Obviously the scheme is not working adequately. Hopefully this amendment bill currently before us will provide it with some much needed stimulus. Only when the financial markets are more familiar with the PDF scheme and believe it to be a worthwhile scheme will the necessary funds flow into PDFs. If the sole aim of the PDP Act is to provide equity capital for small and medium sized enterprises that cannot raise capital on the markets, then to date the PDF scheme has been a failure. It is as simple as that. The pooled development fund proposal constitutes another failut,e by Labor to implement its One Nation proposals of February 1992. One Nation, as you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, was rushed out at great speed and not thought through. It was a panic measure in response to the coalition's Fightback policy document that had been released a couple of months earlier. It is interesting to look at some of the absurd claims that were made in the One Nation statement. I remind the House'that it is not much more than a couple of years ago that these statements and assertions were made. First, the budget was going to be in surplus by 1995-96. Second, there was going to be a $5 billion tax cut in the second tranche of tax cuts. One Nation itself proposed tax cuts of approximately $8.3 billion in two tranches, the second of which was in excess of $5 billion. That was going to be delivered in 1995-96. There were going to be 800,000 new jobs by f996. The unemployment rate was going to be down to 8.25 per cent by this year, 1994. There was going to be an 'avalanche'-remember the word?-of of new investment. It was claimed by the government that $130 billion was likely to result from the 10 per cent development allowance. We know what investment figures are telling us and we know that it is very nearly in a minus situation. At times during the past 12 months it has been minus. The pooled development fund scheme that is now proposed to be amended was also going to provide huge benefits. Under One Nation, Labor was going to sell off Qantas, increase aviation competition, establish a national electricity grid, introduce foreign branch banking and establish effective offshore banking units. Where have all the promises gone? They have gone to the graveyard, every one of them. We were also going have infrastructure bonds, which have been a dismal failure-I will speak a little bit more about that later-a national rail network, which is still struggling on, and so on. In the One Nation statement a total of no less than $16.6 billion worth of new promises was made, It would be interesting to compare that situation with where we are now. We still have 10 per cent unemployment; 900,000 Australians are still unemployed. Far from having tax cuts, we had massive tax hikes in the previous year's budget and bracket induced tax rises in this year's budget. Despite these massive tax hikes in last year's budget, which are flowing through this year and resulting in huge increases in the government's revenue, in 1994-95 we will still have a budget deficit of $12 billion, and we will still have a projected-and savagely deteriorating-Commonwealth debt of $95 billion within the next year or so. We cannot get a broad fiscal and financial policy setting when we are going into debt like it is going out of style and when we are spending money we do not have, like a drunken sailor-as is Labor. One Nation guaranteed that the current account deficit would not increase, yet it continues to mushroom. Just as the PDFs have failed to meet the government's unrealistically high expectations, infrastructure bonds have been a resounding failure. It was hoped by the government that infrastructure bonds would provide billions of dollars to fund various infrastructure projects. With these bonds being tax free, there was possibly some justification for the government to expect funds to flow into the infrastructure projects. But Labor botched the scheme. David Williams, a BT director, says: After One Nation, people were talking about billions of dollars worth of bonds coming onto the market. Measured against those optimistic forecasts, the bond initiative has failed to bear fruit. The limitations placed on infrastructure bonds restricted them to land transport, sea transport and electricity generating projects. Furthermore, bonds are structured as 1O-year issues, and losses are not deductible. To date, the financial markets have been unimpressed with the infrastructure bonds, to say the very least. Ten years is considered to be too long a time frame, with the average time horizon on other investments being three to four years. It is acknowledged that infrastructure by its very nature is more long term, needing a time span in excess of the average, although 10 years is obviously considered too long a time frame by the financial markets and potential investors. Who can blame them, given the turmoil in the bond markets these days? Nevertheless, despite that turmoil, the failure to attract funds existed long before the present upheavals. It appears that only institutional investors see merit in infrastructure bonds. As mentioned in the introduction ito this bill, PDFs could prove to be a valuable source of equity for small and medium sized businesses, which I will refer to as 'small business'. However, Labor only pays lip-service to the interests of small business. This is a government that has inundated small business with paperwork, a cumbersome tax system and an archaic industrial relations system masquerading under Labor's claims of reform. The tax system is overly complex. The tax law is changed so often by Labor that small business people simply cannot maintain the knowledge of what their tax obligations are. This causes small firms to inadvertently commit errors when completing tax returns. Even the tax professionals cannot keep up with the multitude of changes to tax law. Then there are the multitude of taxes that small firms have to pay. Larger firms also have to pay these taxes but are usually better able to absorb the taxes and thereby keep the cost of compliance to a lower percentage of taxable income. These various taxes are both federal and state based. Fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the superannuation guarantee charge and the training levy have all been imposts that business has had to pay and bear the expense of complying with. If small business is supposed to be the great hope of future employment growth, it is about time anti-job taxes at both federal and state levels were curbed. Payroll tax permanently discourages employers from employing more staff. The same can be said for excessive workers compensation premiums in some states. It should be no surprise to anyone that many firms would prefer to have staff work overtime at onerous rates rather than incur the excessive on-costs associated with employing new staff. The industrial relations system pays scant regard to the interests of small business. Most small businesses are non-unionised, yet these firms cannot establish the working conditions that will apply to their own staff. The union movement has to be involved because Labor always looks after its mates. The award system is, in many industries, a nightmare to comprehend and is in urgent need of genuine reform. Many small businesses,' when wanting to clarify the entitlements of their staff, have to contact an employer association or even a union to seek guidance. Contractors are this government's No. 1 enemy in the industrial arena, especially in industries where unions are traditionally strong. Funnily enough it is the contractors, in conjunction with regular employees, who so often provide firms with the necessary flexibility to improvise and meet special requirements as they arise. So much for Labor's concern about small .and medium sized businesses. As stated earlier, the coalition does not oppose this The pooled development fund scheme was to provide a mechanism for channelling equity capital into small and medium sized businesses. The objective is commendable. But, like so many of the One Nation statement initiatives, the program has failed to live up to expectations and the pooled development funds have failed to attract institutional support. Though it is unlikely the PDFs will ever come close to meeting the expectations placed on them in the One Nation statement, this bill is a positive development that could assist in the provision of equity capital for small and medium sized businesses. We look forward to the day when that might become an achievement, however sceptical-for good reason-we may seem at the moment.",34
14,Mr LES SCOTT,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"It seems to be a regular occurrence that I speak before question time! The Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill is a very important bill, particularly for small business. I am pleased that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has acknowledged that the opposition is going to support this bill, despite his 30-minute rhetoric about why it is not going to support the bill. He seems to be in a .bit of a time warp. He is still trotting out Flghtback as a great model. His leader might like to explain to him some time what the party's policies are. It obviously still has the policies of Fightback. Over the term of this government, there have been many changes to create incentives for business, particularly in the taxation area. Company tax, for instance, has been reduced from 42 per cent to 30 per' cent. In the Fightback package, opposition members indicated that they wanted to maintain high levels of company taxation and to increase it. The double dipping aspect has been addressed by the Labor government with dividend imputation, again giving many incentives to small business. ' The honourable member talked about the GST and other things, and he made reference to the training levy proposal as well. We have addressed the training levy in the Working Nation document. This is known to most members in the House, although obviously bill. not to the honourable member for Curtin who will find out about that in due cours-. We have changed many incentives over at least the last decade to improve the opportunities for business in this country. The pooled development funds was one of those initiatives. Some improvements are needed. This !egislation is all about addressing those Improvements and increasing initiatives and incentives for investment in the pooled development funds so, in tum, they can invest particularly in the small and medium sized business area. As the honourable member for Curtin rightly pointed out, this is a very important area for employment. I hope to expand· further on that later in the debate today.",39
15,Mr SPEAKER,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"Order! It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The honourable member for Oxley will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA Interest Rates",39
16,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Treasurer believe that, because of substantial rises in long-term bond rates in Australia, the four large banks are li-ely to raise their fixed term mortgage rates In the very near future?",39
17,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The way in which the financial institutions react to the increase in bond yields is a matter for them. Judging from remarks by various spokesmen that I have heard I do not think it likely that there would be any such increase simply because bond rates have increased. There has been some increase announced by a few banks in - e1ation to their fixed term mortgages, but this IS a very small proportion of the overall mortgage market. Since the funding for fixed term mortgages is essentially raised on the financial markets, the cost of those funds has gone up. Therefore, some banks have moved to increase their fixed mortgage rates. That does not mean that rates for the great majority of mortgages-the variable rate mortgageswill increase. I think the more likely situation is that they would not increase unless there was an increase in official rates, and that is not likely in the near future. Taxation: Low Income Rebate",39
18,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, which relates to the income tax rebate for low income earners introduced by the government last year, is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer provide the House with details of the low income rebate? In particular, can the Treasurer advise the· House as to how soon the rebate will be available? MrWILLlS-I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question, which draws attention to the fact that, as a result of action taken by the government last year, there is a $150 low income tax rebate available to income earners with incomes up to $20,700 for the year 1993-94 and subsequent income years. Above that level the rebate phases out at a rate of 4c in the dollar and is completely phased out at the level of $24,450. The effect of this rebate is to increase the free threshold from $5,400 to $6,150 and, in so doing, to extinguish completely the tax liability for about 145,000 taxpayers. It is expected that all up about four million taxpayers will benefit from the low income rebate. This new tax rebate ensures that the benefits of the tax cuts which commenced last November extend to all taxpayers. They will now be in receipt of either the income tax rate cuts, which took effect in November last year, or the $150 tax rebate. The low income rebate is expected to cost $530 million in the financial year 1994-95, which is money well spent as it ensures that the benefits of the tax cuts are extended to all taxpayers. To receive the $150 tax rebate, eligible taxpayers need take no action other than to lodge their tax return. The tax office will assess eligibility for the rebate, and the $150 will be automatically included in the taxpayer's refund. To assist t.axpayers in the task of filling in their tax returns, the tax office now provides every household with a Tax Pack. All households in Australia should have received their Tax Packs by now. This year low income earners in particular have an additional incentive to get their returns in as soon as possible so that they can access the $150 rebate. The tax office is generally able to provide refunds within eight weeks of a taxpayer lodging a return, but most taxpayers can expect to receive their refunds within four to six weeks. In the case of electronically lodged returns, the turnaround is about two weeks. Electronic lodgement can be made either through a tax agent or a post office. So I remind low income earners that the sooner they get their tax returns in, the sooner they can benefit from the $150 low income tax rebate. Bond Rates",40
19,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Why is it that since January bond rates in Australia have increased from around 6.5 per cent to close to 10 per cent, whereas in the United States rates have only increased from around 5.5 per cent to 7 per cent? Do Australia's domestic policy settings have anything to do with the fact that bond taxyields have risen by far more in Australia than in other major economies?",40
20,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the second part of the question is no, absolutely no. If you look at our fiscal policy, which is what this question is really about, then fiscal policy in Australia is quite tight compared to the fiscal policy in most OECD countries. If you look at our deficit and the deficits of other OECD countries, we are towards the bottom end of the scale. The National Australia Bank published a table last week which showed the deficits of 17 OECD countries. Of those 17 countries, there were only four that had a deficit as a proportion of GDP which was less than ours. For those that were above us-bearing in mind that for this year, 1993-94, our figure is 3.2 per cent-the range was from 4.4 per cent to 12112 per cent. These are the Western industrial countries. If you are going to talk about our fiscal policy being the basis for an increase in bond yields in this country and the reason for some differential, then that is a complete nonsense proposition. The fact is that our fiscal policy is tighter than that of most other countries. If you look at countries which have annoilnced a deficit reduction target-that is, the G7 countries, the seven largest countries, minus Japan, and Australia-there is only one country which is aiming for a deficit below one per cent of GDP in 1996-97, and that is Australia. We do not have a slack fiscal policy in this country; we have fiscal policy which is tighter than that of most other Western countries. It is an absolute nonsense to say that because we have slack fiscal policyqour bond yields are increasing more in this country. If one looks at the rationale which is trotted out by those people who try to explain what is happening on the bond markets, the basic proposition seems to be that those who involved in the bond markets around the world are nervous about increasing inflation and, because of the prospect of increasing inflation, particularly in the United States, there has been a movement in respect of bonds there. The resultant increase in bond yields in that country has flowed on to other countries. Of course that has had differential impacts in different countries. Mr Costello-Why Australia?",40
21,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You ask, 'Why Australia?' It is not easy to say why our yields have a little bit higher. Let me give one possible reason. The rationale which lies behind the assumption that increased growth might mean increased inflation, given that growth than any otherOECD country, might lead to the simplistic proposition that tralia faces more inflation concerns than other countries. That would be an absolute absurdipeople ty because there is simply no sign of infor creased inflation in this country. We have an inflation rate of 1112 per cent; we are at 'the bottom end of the inflation scale, not the top; we do not have any sign inflationary expectations breaking out in country; and we have inflation very much under control and intend to keep it that way. covered. If there is some concern about increased inflation being in prospect in Australia bond markets then people should forget it; is not going to happen. Employment",41
22,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and relates to the government's recent white paper on employment. What progress has been made in implementing key initiatives in the white paper, particularly those aimed at assisting the long-term unemployed into work?",41
23,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Significant progress has been made in implementing the initiatives announced recently in the government's white paper. Yesterday I had the opportunity to inform the.House of progress in negotiations with employers to secure the training wage, which is an important plank in the initiatives. I can inform the House that tomorrow the are Industrial Relations Commission will be convening a conference to advance that issue. In addition to that, there are some important initiatives that this House ought to be aware of and promote. As from next Monday, 4 July, a new wage subsidy regime, together with a new training subsidy regime, will be in place. These subsidies will increase depending on the training undertaken and the length of time that a person has been out of work. When combined with the training wage and our commitment to getting the long-term unemployed back into work, we will see a been situation whereby employers can employ people for as little as $10 per week under these combined initiatives or can access a range of subsidies of between $3,000 and we have higher $8-260 per annum. Next Monday the job compact also comAusmences. The job compact is a commitment by this government to ensure that all of those who have been long-term unemployed in excess of 18 months will be guaranteed a job. Our commitment is to ensure that in the first year of operation of the compact 77,000 people will be covered, rising to 165,000 per of year ata peak. Over the four-year period th-t this our commitment is in place, we will ensure that 560,000 of the long-term unemployed are At the same time as we are introducing the in job compact, we are ensuring, through the it reciprocal obligation requirements, that we tighten the compliance procedures for people obtaining the benefits. From that date we are moving to introduce the case management regime. I will be introducing to the House later this week the legislation to establish the body responsible for overseeing the development of case management through not only the CES but also private providers. uist week I had the opportunity to indicate that, pending this legislation being passed by the House, an interim board will be put in place to perform the same functions as the new body under the legislation. In addition, from next Monday our commitment and funding to expand entry level training places will commence. Our commitment as a government is to ensure 50,000 extra training places per year by the end of 1995-96. Also from next week, the training guarantee levy will be suspended. These are all initiatives that build on the commitments that the government made in the white paper. Substantial progress has been made in getting unemployment down. We are below double. digit employment for the first time since 1991. We have created 270,000 jobs, which is more than half of our election commitment and in one-third of the time, and the number of people who are long-term unemployed has fallen for the third successive month. These initiatives will give added impetus to ensuring that Australians are encouraged back into work and, in particular, that the long-term unemployed are given special attention in order to get them back into employment and training. Fiscal Policy  the Treasurer. Last August the Prime Minister declared in this House that the government had reached the end of the road on spending cuts. He said: ... we are not cutting. outlays any further ... because it is irresponsible, it is indecent, it and it is just not smart. On Sunday, you said that fiscal policy may need to be tightened. Do you plan to tighten fiscal policy by being irresponsible, indecent and unfair with cuts to outlays or will you just increase taxes?",41
24,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A similar question was asked of the Prime Minister yesterday. The position, as I speIt out on the Sunday program, was simply that if it became necessary at some stage-I was not in any way saying it was necessary-then, of course, we would tighten fiscal policy. The point I was making was that we would not shrink from using an important arm of macro-economic policy to keep inflation under control. That remains the case. We seem to have an opposition which wants to say, 'You should absolutely never increase interest rates because that is a terrible thing and that would be bad for people,' even though that might be important at some stage-not now-in order to moderate inflation and to keep control of growth. The opposition is saying that we should never increase taxes for the same reason. Presumably all we should ever do is cut expenditure. The opposition's position on all of this is obviously quite ludicrous. It wants us to tie up virtually every arm of macro-economic policy. The government is in a position where It believes its fiscal policy is appropriate to the current circumstances. It is a policy which, as I indicated in answer to an earlier question, is at the tighter end of the scale for Western industrial countries. It is nevertheless one which is conducive to continued substantial growth of the economy, with low inflation. If that should change, if there should be some change in the future which requires us to make some adjustment to macro-economic policy, then we will do so. Exactly how we wilI do so, we will determine should that situation arise. ABC: Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings",42
25,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. In light of the recent interim report of is unfair the inquiry into the radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings, can the minister inform the House whether there will be an expansion of the role of the ABC in increasing the community's awareness of parliamentary proceedings and public affairs generally?",42
26,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Reid for his continuing interest in and support for the ABC. The ABC has had a long tradition, as you would know, MrSpeakerMr Tim Fischer-They hate the lower house.",43
27,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I beg your pardon? Mr Tim Fischer-They hate· the lower house.,43
28,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Who hates the lower house? Mr Tim Fischer-The ABC.,43
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister might not respond to interjections and the Leader of the National Party might not give him a lead.,43
30,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Despite the views of the Leader of the National Party, the ABC has had a long tradition of providing a high quality radio news service to Australians and, for many years, has been broadcasting the parliamentary debates. At the moment the ABC broadcasts the parliamentary broadcasts live and question time gets rebroadcast later each evening. But the parliamentary network is unused at other times. There are some days when question time is more live, or more alive, than other times, I suppose. The ABC has recently put to you, Mr Speaker, and the other members of the parliamentary broadcast committee, a proposal for a new free to air parliamentary and news radio service to be run on the down time on the parliamentary broadcast network. The committee recommended that there should be a number of issues considered before that takes place. In particular, the committee was concerned that there be a need for the ABC to recognise that it must abide by all decisions and determinations of the committee concerning those parliamentary broadcasts. Having recently consulted you, Mr Speaker, the President and my ministerial colleagues, I am now in a position to approve the implementation of this new service. The new ABC service will be known as the parliamentary and news network and will be the first of its kind in Australia. It represents an efficient and cost-effective means of utilising efficient resources, the current resources that are allocated to the ABC, and also allows the existing transmission infrastructure to broadcast a greater range of programs to Australians. In addition to parliamentary proceedings, the service will provide comprehensive, continuous, national and international news programs 24 hours a day when the parliament is not using the service. As well as providing a new outlet for the many news stories that are filed by the 56 ABC radio stations right around the country and the ABC's international news bureaus, it will give Australians a better chance to hear some of the programs that are prepared for Radio Australia. Australians in many cases do not have a chance to listen to some of those high quality stories put to air on Radio Australia. This new service is expected to be in operation by the August sittings, subject to the agreement of the parliamentary broadcast committee., In extending the range of news and current affairs programs provided by the ABC, that is further evidence of the ABC meeting its charter obligations and responsibilities. Mr MCGauran-David made it happen.",43
31,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the interest of the honourable member for Gippsland's listeners and his constituents, providing this new service might mean that a few more constituents in Gippsland will tune into the parliamentary broadcasts. Perhaps even one or two people in the electorate of Farrer might hear the Leader of the National Party.",43
32,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,43
33,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fact is that those opposite do not listen.,43
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will come back to the answer.,43
35,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Finance will be pleased to know that the ABC will provide this service without additional funding because it will use its existing triennial funding. The service will not have its own reporters; it will simply make greater use of the ABC's existing resources rather than duplicate existing news gathering activities. I put on the record that the ABC has given me two assurances. Firstly, it assures me that the pre-eminence of parliament on the network will be preserved. I think it is important that. at some later date we leave open the possibility of greater coverage of committee hearings-and it is also important that the ABC acknowledges this possibility. Secondly, the ABC has given an assurance that it will abide by the decisions and determinations of the parliamentary broadcasting committee and will consult with the committee prior to the service starting up. I have received a number of letters from people on both sides of the House saying that they believe that the parliamentary broadcast network should be extended from its existing eight metropolitan areas. But I make it clear that the government has no plans to extend the network at the moment. National Party members-Shame! Shame! Shame!",43
36,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know what has happened to the opposition's calls for fixed fiscal rectitude. We have the National Party rump over there saying that government spending should be increased and we have people. in the Liberal Party saying that government spending should be cut. I am sure those opposite will work it out one day. It is clear that this proposal is based on using existing resources more efficiently. It is not a matter of providing additional government funds. Finally, I am very pleased that in approving this initiative we will get a new free to air ABC service that will provide a better service to listeners, abetter service to the Australian community and give greater access to the ABC's core responsibility of news programming. Interest Rates",44
37,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confirm that a one per cent rise in interest rates for a small business with an overdraft of $200,000 would cost that business an additional $170 per month and would this extra cost detract from that business's ability to invest and create jobs?",44
38,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that we have interest rates at the lowest level now for 20 years, and small businesses are benefiting considerably from that. We have certainly gone out of our way to ensure that small business beneqts not only from low interest rates but also from the much better efforts made by the banking system to provide debt finance to small business. We have introduced a number of initiatives both in the budget and before to assist and encourage the banks to provide more assistance to small business. Also in the budget we made special efforts to make pooled development funds more attractive so that equity could be made available to small businesses on a much more tax preferred basis than is the case at the present time. A great deal of effort has gone into increasing the environment for small business and small business will certainly benefit from all of those measures, including the current level of interest rates. Any increase in interest rates is not to be seen as some kind of measure to disadvantage all the participants in the economy but, rather, as a kind of measure to ensure that we can continue to have recovery and growth of the economy without inflation. We cannot expect to keep all the levers sort of stationary during an economic cycle. The basis upon which the opposition pursues its attack on the government seems to be that we should keep everything in some sort of frozen state, particularly in relation to monetary policy. If there is an increase in interest rates at some stage of the cycle it will enable us to maintain an extended period of growth of the economy for much longer than would otherwise be the case. An increase is not something which will be to the disadvantage of business, rather the increase in the longer term will be of benefit to business. Wages: Safety Net",44
39,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. In his speech to the Australian Bankers Association on Friday, he said that the Reserve Bank, in monitoring the inflation outlook, is also monitoring closely wage agreements in Australia. Does this imply that the government is reviewing its commitment to support safety net wage increases over the next two years? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, 1 raise a point of order. I listened very closely to that question. I put it to you that the second part of that question was a dear breach of the standing .orders concerning the framing of questions without notice, so it should be ruled out of order.",44
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I understand it, the question was seeking information. As it is seeking information, it is in order.",45
41,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. It is true that in the speech· I gave to the Australian Bankers Association on Friday night I said that wage agreements were one of five factors that needed to be monitored closely in keeping guard against any resurgence of inflation in Australia. As I have indicated, we are concerned to keep hold of low inflation in this country. In deciding whether there is any need to adjust policy, we will continue to take close analysis of what is happening to the economy, particularly in areas like wages, prices, inflationary expectations and the exchange rate. These sorts of factors can impact on the inflationary outcome in the future. Wage increases which are now bem-e determined on an enterprise by enterprise basis rather than in some centralised way more difficult to analyse because they are differential, reflecting productivity movements enterprise by enterprise. They are for differing periods of time. They are much more difficult to assess in terms <,If whether there is inflationary component or not. But, to the of our ability, we wiJ] be keeping track those wage agreements. Those parties who are making decisions about future enterprise agreements should bear in mind that the priate government is keeping that sort of track them. We wiJ] be concerned to ensure that we safety nets. do not have any move back to higher inflation. In doing that,the parties should also bear in mind that the Reserve Bankis saying that we should keep inflation in the range of two to three per cent over the cycle. We agree with that as an appropriate target. In that sense, the participants in the economy who are setting wage agreements should bear that in mind. It is also true that, in giving thM commitment to enterprise bargaining and looking for responsible enterprise bargaining-which I believe we are by and large having-we are also concerned about people who cannot get an enterprise bargain. That means that we have given our commitment to some safety net increases. There has already been one such increase implemented. We recently announced a commitment to two further such increases of $8 each in a stepped way for the next two financial years. That is a very important commitment, because we cannot have a system where the recovery goes on with some wage earners in poor bargaining positions not being able to get wage increases at all. The government is very committed to the need to ensure that everyone in the economy participates in the recovery and that we do not leave whole sections of the community behind. . In that respect, 1 notice with interest that the opposition has been saying that it also supports the safety net increases. Indeed, when the shadow Treasurer was asked on ABC radio's PM program on 1 June whether supported a safety net, he said, 'We supPort safety nets. Of course we support safety are nets.""w,-always have.' I must say that I found this SOmewhat ironic, thinking back to the mid-1980s when he was an advocate in a national wage case. He advocated the reduction of all award wages-not just the lowest any ones-to $175 per week, which was $25 less best than the then lowest award wage. He wanted of all award wages to be brought down to $25 less than the lowest award wage. That is the position that he was arguing for as an approsafety net at that time, yet the opposion tion now says that it supports appropriate . When the member for Higgins was asked by a member of the commission whether that should be done immediately or phased in over a period of time, the honourable member for Higgins said, 'If it were to be done, it is best that it be done quickly.' In other words, if you are going to do something really nasty and rotten, you do not want to do it over a long time; you want to do it really quickly and get the hell out of it. That is the sort of approach that he had to it. It is also interesting to note that the member for Higgins is given to quoting Shakespeare. That statement is a paraphrase of Macbeth. Macbeth said: If it were done, when 't is done, then 't were It were done quickly. He was talking about the intended assassination of his leader. If I were the Leader of the Opposition I would be a bit worried. A deputy with Macbethian tendencies should be a bit of a worry. I draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the fact that in the same passage-and I think this fits the member for Higgins very well-Macbeth went on to say: I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself, And falls on the other. I think that fits the Deputy· Leader of the Opposition very well. Superannuation",45

44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House!,46

52,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can the Treasurer confirm that he has told the banks that they would have no role. in collecting superannuation payments provided for in awards because the unions would not tolerate well their involvement? Is this not yet another case of the government playing 'super' monkey to the union organ-grinder?",46
53,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not told the banks that. What I have said to the banks is that there are various factors which we will take into account in looking at whether superannuation could be provided directly by the banks on their books, rather than indirectly, which is the case at the moment. They provide superannuation to customers who walk through the door, but it goes through to associate or subsidiary life insurance companies, rather than being directly provided on the banks' books. There are cases which have been put by the banks to us about that matter. They have not had a response to that at this stage. They will get one in the course of the next hour or so. I suggest to the honourable member for Bennelong that he wait till then. South-East Forest Agreement",46
54,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can. the Minister for Resources report on what progress has been made in putting forward arrangements for the implementation of the south-east forest agreement?,46
55,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I know his long standing interest in the region of the south-east forest. As members would know, last December the Commonwealth government and the New South Wales government signed a south-east forest agreement. This agreement set aside additional forest areas for conservation and additional areas to be available for multiple use. As part of the agreement, the Commonwealth is to provide $10 million to set up an advisory committee to recommend how these funds are to be spent. Under the agreement, the committee is to be drawn from the forestry industry, unions, local conservation and community groups, councils and government agencies. I am pleased to advise, after consultation with the member for Eden-Monaro, that I was able to write to 12 groups last week. These groups will form the committee that will play a very important role in restructuring for the future prosperity of the timber region in the south-east. Local groups themselves, for the first time. I think in this type of arrangement, will have a direct say in their future. The $10 million provided by the Commopwealth will be available for research such as biological surveys and inventories, regrowth and plantation studies, as well as intensive forest management research. It will also be available for work on industry restructuring, value adding, skills education and workplace reform, public awareness and private forest management. I expect the committee to hold its first meeting shortly. We all know what the sensitive issues on multiple use of forests are. That is why I think this initiative is sensible. It involves the community and the people who are most directly affected. In the south-east of New South Wales and the adjacent northern areas of Victoria, we have a rich forest resource. It is important that we get the management of the forest values right. We must strike the right balance between the commercial, conservation, heritage and other values. This committee will give people in the region a direct involvement in their future. Australian Government Credit Card",46
56,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I refer to the minister's whitewash answer to a question on 1 March this year concerning the improper use of government credit cards and the Auditor General's report No. 41. In light of the amazing allegations made by the Auditor-General, including purchases of lingerie, surf wear and golf lessons, is the minister aware that the settlement account for the Australian government credit card is a massive $34 million overdrawn? Why has the minister allowed the settlement account to reach such an absurd level of overdraft when it was always supposed to remain in credit?",47
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am glad the honourable member has asked a question about credit cards because it does give me an Opportu!\ity to placeMr MCGauran-It is specific:,47
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is not; it is a general question with that ending to it. The fact of the matter is that the credit card system that has been put in place is well supported by the Auditor-General, as his report makes quite clear, because it contains a sensible proposition; that is, that small suppliers of the government should be capable of getting a rapid response in payment terms to the purchases that are made from them. Poor payment response has been a source of considerable complaint over a long period of time, so it is sensible that this proposition should occur. In the particular report referred to, the various instances given totalled some 336 out of 1,866 transactions that the auditor had a look at. Dr Kemp-That is a third of them.",47
59,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thos'e 1,866 transactions-the honourable member says that that is a third of them-were not a random sample. They were a product of a specific target group that had been classified as 'interesting'. That 1,866 was classified as interesting from a group of 184,185 transactions. When we look at one or two other aspects of this, we see similar sorts of statistics. In fact, there have been 46 actual reported cases of fraud, as opposed to those that are merely interesting, since 1987. The amounts involved total some $1.8 million. In that period of time there have been 2.7 million transactions and payments totalling $1.6 billion. The fact of the matter is that this is a reasonably sensible way of doing business, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, with a very low level ofMr Tim Fischer-Rorting.",47
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You use the word-a very low ievel of rorting'associated with it. There are from time to time, unfortunately, cases of fraud against the Commonwealth, and those cases of fraud do not simply occur in the use of credit cards. They occur, unfortunately, in a number of other areas. This is not a product unique to the last decade. That is one of the reasons we have had since 1901 an Auditor-General whose specific tasks have included a capacity to get to grips with those issues. The Auditor-General has brought down a useful report in some areas and he has made a number of recommendations. The department has picked up a substantial number of those recommendations and is going to pursue them by putting out a best practice guide to various departments. But what we are not going to do is take over from the various departments the financial management of the credit card system, apart from providing. those guidelines, because in our Public Service arrangements we have sensibly decentralised control of programs. That includes control of purchasing. It is up to the departments to decide from time to time, albeit within the appropriate approvals, what ought to be purchased. I think this is a system which is fairly new to the operations of the Commonwealth. It is a system which the Auditor-General himself says is basically working well, and if those guidelines are observed to the letter by the various departments that are concerned then no problems of the nature that the honourable member refers to will arise in the future. But from the point of view of small business in this country which supplies government, this has been a very important and very effective innovation. The process has been somewhat demeaned by some fairly silly publicity given to a series of purchases by virtue of the fact that the focus was on, if you like, the retailer of the particular product or good. So we had much chortling over the provision of sunglasses, for example, from some exotically entitled sunglass sales office. That happened to be the purchase of sunglasses for. the use of troops operating in the Sahara as part of our peacekeeping operations. Then there was a floridly named florist from whom flowers were purchased. This was given some degree of publicity in focusing on that florist. We find in that case that they were ANZAC Day wreaths being purchased from that florist. What is revealed in these propositions is a very small problem, with 46· actual· cases of fraud in six years, totalling $1.8 million, out of $1.6 billion worth of transactions; I think it is useful that the Auditor-General would refer to these things, and it is entirely appropriate that he do so.

70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for La Trobe!,49
71,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that existed before the Victorian government moved as misguidedly as it has to try to deal with this issue. We are seeking to preserve the autonomy of the universities and to enter into discussions with their democratically elected student bodies about the way in which funds are collected and disbursed to provide a whole range of worthy· student services. Unfortunately, the Victorian government has chosen to confuse the issue of compulsory unionism, which this is not about, with the provision of services. The reality is that, student fees were not collected, then the range of services provided by the student unions would not be available or universities would have to fund them out of recurrent expenditure. State governments make no contribution financially to universities, yet they want to intrude into arrangements upon which decisions are taken by the university bodies and the student union bodies. Last year we as a government legislated to ensure that, where state governments were seeking to go past this provision of services, we would legislate to override. The Victorian government has sought to introduce legislation that prevents our making direct payments to the universities. The legislation that we introduce on Thursday will enable those funds to be made to the student bodies, which under section 51(xxiiiA) of the constitution we have constitutional power to do. To the extent to which we have to make that contribution, we wil1 deduct the appropriate amount from the recurrent funds going to the states. This is a political issue. From the Victorian government's point of view, it has got nothing to do with addressing the real needs of universities and the provision of their services. It has been driven by ideologues sitting on the back bench in the Victorian parliament who see this as a flag of faith.",49

By this time, he had acquired so many goods that he 'had come to own properties in several states'. The report went on to say that the of many of these Commonwealth goods he had delivered to his own home is not known, the cost of the prosecution is not known to date, and that stock records collected during the investigation alone comprise nearly two cubic metres in volume.

81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would not begin to justify it. If those facts have, over time, involved breaches of the responsibilities of particular officers, then they would be the subject of further investigations than the ones merely made by the Auditor-General. As I pointed out in my previous answer, since 1987 there have been 46 proven cases of fraud associated with it out of 2.7 million transactions. In the 2.7 million transactions that have occurred, there have been cases of fraud. Subject to any inquiries by the police or whatever into the matters the honourable gentleman raises and until any processes associated with that have been completed, I would not care to comment on that, except to say the obvious point: all areas of Commonwealth activity are viewed by the Auditor General from time to time for ·the possibility that cases of fraud have arisen, not just in this particular area. Mrs Bishop-Two years ago your department said it would do something about this point.",50
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Mackellar.,50
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point about the operation of the credit card is that the level of fraud associated with it and with a number of transactions, by any reasonable test, is very small. To move away from that system, to the very great inconvenience of a very large number of small businesses in this country, cost would be an absurdity. We have no advice from the Auditor-General in that regard. In fact, in report No. 41 the Auditor-General recommends the credit card system as a good one that ought to be sustained. He has a few points of advice to improve the safety of the credit card system. Upon that advice, a number of departments have acted, and the Department of Finance is acting. As I said before, we will produce a further set of guidelines to departments on how they should operate. There is nothing in this report, or in any of the J?articular cases in this report, that would suggest the system ought to be abandoned, which seems to be what the honourable member is inviting me to contemplate. Tourism",50
84,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Tourism. I draw his attention to an article in the Australian Financial Review of June 17 that the US and Canada had conceded that they are losing tourists to Australia because of our public sector led marketing effort. Can the minister inform the House what strategies the government has developed which are now setting an example for international tourism marketing?,50
85,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his continuing interest in the Australian tourism industry. The article that the honourable member mentioned is good news for Australia. It is very clear that the Australian model is now held up in certain countries, such as the United States and Canada, as the best way to promote a country's tourism industry overseas. In the last 11 years in Australia, federal public support has gone from about $10 million to about $80 million. That has helped us boost the number of international travellers coming to Australia from one million to three million. In the week before last, the Australian Tourist Commission continued its efforts in marketing Australia by hosting the largest tourism trade show in the Southern Hemisphere, at Sydney's Darling Harbour. At the Australian tourism exchange, we had over 1,000 Australian tourism sellers and 700 overseas buyers. The number of people exhibiting at the Australian tourism exchange was up by about 25 per cent. The Australian Tourist Commission has advised me that its understanding is that at least $1.2 billion in new business was written over those five days-$1.2 billion of foreign exchange earnings for Australia-something which I would have hoped all honourable members would have supported. A lot of interest has also been expressed the Partnership Australia model, which we have developed here in Australia, to bring federal and state tourism promotion bodies gether. The Canadians, in particular, are keen on perhaps modelling a cooperative program based on the partnership Australia model. We have also had interest expressed from South Africa, Peru, Colombia, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden and Zimbabwe in our national ecotourism strategy-another area where we believe that the government, by putting in funding, can help expand an important .segment of the Australian tourism market; a segment where people with high disposable incomes are prepared to come to Australia, see some of our unique national parks, see some of the special places in Australia and help protect them at the same time. By generating greater economic return from those national parks, we can ensure a greater commitment to protecting those national parks by the local residents and ensuring that future generations will have access to them. Whether it is whale watching at Hervey Bay or bushwalking in the Daintree, it can all be done. So, whereas tourism in Australia was left to wither by the opposition, with only $10 million provided for overseas promotion, today the government is providing eight times that amount. We have three times as many tourists coming here. The result of that is greater foreign exchange earnings, greater investment in the tourism industry and ultimately more jobs.",50

96,Mr WILLIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-This statement confinns the fundamental elements of the government's superannuation policies and announces a number of important new initiatives to substantially improve the effectiveness of these arrangements. Since 1983, the government has transformed the role of superannuation in Australia. From its beginnings as a tax advantaged form of remuneration for a minority generally of those already better off, superannuation has been progressively developed as a key component of the government's retirement incomes policy. It has also been a major means by which the government has sought to increase national saving. The age pension and associated social security arrangements will always remain central elements of that policy, providing for everyone the essential safety net standard of retirement living. However, superannuation, with both compulsory and voluntary components, has been developed as the principal means of providing for a higher standard of retirement living. This has involved a complete reform of superannuation, to ensure that superannuation savings are used equitably for retirement income purposes, are invested wisely and safely and are affordable to the taxpayer. For equity and social justice reasons, the government has placed particular emphasis on the need to achieve the widest possible spread of superannuation. In 1992, the government introduced the superannuation guarantee arrangements. The superannuation guarantee is designed to ensure that employers provide a prescribed minimum level of superannuation support for employees. For large employers, the minimum support is now five per cent of earnings and this will be progressively increased to nine per cent by the year 2002. Small business employers have slightly lower rates of contribution over the first few years of the scheme. These new rules have been very successful, so that we now have superannuation coverage for the overwhelming majority of employees. The latest ABS statistics show that in November 1993, 96 per cent of full-time permanent employees had superannuation compared with 88 per cent in November 1991. In his national saving report, Dr FitzGerald estimated that the superannuation guarantee arrangements would eventually increase total private saving by about 11/4 per cent of GDP. Moreover, I believe there is now widespread recognition of the need for savings to meet ·the needs of an ageing population structure. · Most people recognise that superannuation can at least supplement the pension to provide for a more comfortable and enjoyable retirement. Inevitably, with major changes of this kind, there have been operational difficulties in some areas of the legislation and practical issues have arisen. These have been acknowledged by the government and the superannuation industry, and considerable efforts have been undertaken by both over the past year to find solutions to these difficulties. In seeking ways of further improving the arrangements, there has been a very strong commitment to the fundamental objectives of the government's superannuation policies. The improvements and finetuning of the arrangements which I am announcing today reflect that commitment. This statement meets the community's desire for stability and consoli·dation in superannuation policy. There will be no substantive reduction in the coverage of the compulsory superannuation arrangements. At the same time, all of the other main elements of the government's superannuation policies are confirmed: there are no changes to the taxation rates on superannuation; the predominant role of private sector superannuation funds is retained; and the reasonable benefit limits on access to superannuation concessions are unchanged. My statement today has three purposes. Firstly, it announces a series of measures which will improve the operation of the compulsory superannuation system, particularly to provide a much better outcome for employees who have small superannuation amounts. These measures will especially help women, possibly the largest group affected by the small amounts problem. Secondly, it provides a response to some policy issues raised by Dr FitzGerald in his report on national saving presented to .the former Treasurer last year. The key theme in this response is to confirm and strengthen the basic framework of the existing superannuation policies of the government. Finally, it announces a number of other relatively minor superannuation policy measures, including the measure to improve the interaction between award superannuation and the superannuation guarantee. I will now provide an .outline of the measures announced today. A detailed description of the measures is being released concurrently with this statement. Superannuation small amounts It is clear that the major difficulty experiminimising enced with the compulsory spread of superannuation has been the performance of small superannuation accounts. The problem with small accounts is that the fees and charges imposed on them may be greater than the investment income they earn, so the capital value of the account erodes. For small accounts not receiving further contributions, as when a casual worker ceases work, the balance of the account can eventually be reduced to zero. This is a totally unacceptable situation. Such outcomes mean that little or nothing in the way of retirement savings is being generated for many people, and it represents a substantial loss of potential national saving. At the present time, there are a large number of small accounts because the new superannuation arrangements have been established for only two years. Many people have become fund members for the first time. The number of small accounts, believed to be presently between one and two million, is likely to fall over the next few years, particularly as the contribution rate increases towards nine per cent. However, it is inevitable that small superannuation accounts will always arise because virtually every new employee begins with a small entitlement to superannuation contributions. This can arise even for full-time employees and is particularly so for casual and part-time employees. This government is determined to achieve a comprehensive solution which will offer full protection for all members with small amounts. Over the past few months, the life insurance and superannuation industries and other interested parties, including the ACTU and welfare and consumer groups, have been engaged in intensive discussions with the government to find a solution to this problem. I commend all· of those organisations for the considerable efforts which they committed to that task. While there are differences of view on some of the elements, it was generally agreed that a package of measures-rather than a single initiative-would be necessary to comprehensively address the small amounts problem. The package of measures announced today is aimed at three related objectives: the number of small superannuation accounts; reducing the actual costs of administering small accounts; and ensuring, as far as possible, that those small accounts which remain in the superannuation system are not eroded by fees and charges in excess of investment earnings. Central to this package of measures will be the introduction of two initiatives directly addressing the erosion of members' benefits. Trustees will be obliged to make a choice either to redesign their fee structure to protect members with small balances from the erosion of their accounts by administrative fees or not to offer or maintain small accounts and have their members utilise the new 'safety net' alternative which will be established in conjunction with these rules. The government will establish a new collection mechanism, administered by the Australian Taxation Office, to receive small superannuation contributions required by the superannuation guarantee. This mechanism will be available for employers in the event that superannuation funds elect not to receive small contributions. The new mechanism will not be a superannuation fund, rather it is a holding mechanism which allows individuals to consolidate their superannuation. It will collect and amalgamate small contributions on behalf of employees prior to the money being transferred into superannuation funds on application by the employee. Member protection rules From 1 July 1995, the new member protecing tion rules will require that any superannuation account with a balance of less than $1,000, and which is in receipt of compulsory pi oyer contributions, cannot be reduced by fund administration fees and charges. In other words, in any year, funds will charge only up to the interest earned on the balances of these accounts in that year. Of course, fund trustees will still be obliged to deduct any taxes payable from these accounts and there will be no restriction on the ability of funds to charge for death and disability insurance. It is clear, nevertheless, that not all will be able or willing to impose the cross subsidy costs involved with these new memsuperannuation ber rules. Funds will not, therefore, be pelled to continue to manage their existing small balance accounts, nor will they be compelled to accept contributions on behalf of new members where they believe, for tion system. example, that the account is unlikely to accumulate to a self-sustaining level. Where funds choose not to apply the new member protection rules, they will be obliged to close existing small accounts and to transcounts fer these, free of charge, to one of the eligible rollover funds being established under the new superannuation industry supervision legislation. They will also be inform members and employers of this action. The new member protection rules, therefore, will ensure that small balance accounts of up to $1,000 will not be reduced by administration charges, wherever they occur. ATO collection mechanism The member protection rules could present a problem for some employers who may be unable to readily find a fund willing to accept small, particularly one-off, contributions behalf of their employees. To address concern, the government will establish within the Australian Tax Office an alternative and convenient 'collection mechanism' into employers can make superannuation contribuaccounts. tions for their employees. Subject to any obligation they may have under an industrial award, employers will be able to make contributions to the tax office of up to $1,200 per employee per year in satisfytheir superannuation guarantee obligations. Moneys paid to the tax office will be allocated to an account of the employee and emheld in a trust fund. No administration charges. will be applied and the moneys will remain untaxed until paid into a complying be allowed to superannuation fund. Moneys of the trust fund will be invested in Commonwealth government instruments and the earnings will be applied first to meeting the costs of operating the collection mechanism. Any surplus will be paid as interest on account balances up to $1,200. Moneys will be paid out of the ATO mechanism into funds accounts with a complying superannuation fund on the instruction of the employee or a fund acting on the employee's combehalf. These arrangements will allow small superannuation contributions to be accumulated and amalgamated at minimum cost, prior to the moneys entering the formal superannuaThe ATO mechanism will contribute significantly towards reducing the overall costs of administering small superannuation accounts and reduce the numbers of such acin the superannuation system. It is expected that the ATO mechanism will be established in time to receive superannuation guarantee contributions in respect of the obliged to 1994-95 financial year. Other measures to assist small amounts The government will also be introducing a range of other measures directed towards assisting in the identification and amalgamation of multiple accounts in the system and reducing the regulatory costs of administering small balance accounts. The superannuation guarantee legislation will be amended to maintain the present annual basis for contribuon tions until such time as the superannuation this guarantee system becomes more settled. Legislation will be introduced to allow the extended usage of tax file numbers in identiwhich fying and amalgamating superannuation Consistent with all current applications of the tax file number it would not be compulsory for employees to quote or authorise extended usage of their tax file numbers. Rather, the· focus will be on educating employees of the benefits of voluntarily providing their tax file number for superannuation purposes. The government will also be encouraging and supporting initiatives already commenced by the industry aimed at producing more cost effective procedures for transferring accounts between superannuation funds through the development of a transfer protocol. To assist in this action, measures will be introduced to reduce or eliminate much of the present taxation reporting requirements presently required when making such transfers. As well, we will be amending the member reporting provisions of the superannuation industry supervision legislation to provide that, where a fund implements the new member protection rules, they will be subject to less rigorous reporting requirements in respect of such small accounts. This measure recognises that members with small accounts are benefiting from the new member protection rules and will have fewer risks than others. However, members will continue to have the right to request information which is provided under normal disclosure requirements for larger amounts. The government expects that this package of measures will comprehensively address the small accounts problem while at the same time minimising any adverse effects on the industry and the returns to superannuation saving more generally. This will greatly enhance the community's confidence in the superannuation system. To further ensure that there is full understanding of how employees can best gain advantage from superannuation, the government, in close consultation with the industry, will conduct a further community education program on the new superannuation arrangements. Capital gains tax rollover It is possible that the measures announced today will give rise to some structural in the industry. The government welcomes moves to improve efficiency through mergers of the very large number of funds in the superannuation industry. To encourage this process, the government will allow· certain eligible superannuation funds which merge on or after 1 July 1994 and before 1 July 1997 to roll over their capital gains tax liabilities or losses. Responses to F.itzGerald proposals The former Treasurer's national saving and superannuation statement of 17 August 1993 foreshadowed that the government would respond to a number of recommendations on superannuation issues made by Dr FitzGerald in the context of his report on national saving. Superannuation and housing One recommendation of Dr FitzGerald was that the government reconsider its. then announced policy to allow access to superannuation for house purchases. The government has already responded to this recommendation with my announcement on 19 April that the proposal will not proceed. Subsequently, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has recommended that the government give further consideration to introducing a targeted measure-although chapter 6 of this report highlighted the cost and administrativedifficulties associated with this measure. The government remains of the view that it should not introduce such a scheme. Moreover, analysis has shown that it would very adversely affect the government's retirement incomes policies, with up to half the gains to superannuation saving expected to accrue from the superannuation guarantee being forgone. Even a more targeted approach would result in a loss of saving. Employee co-contributions and the selfemployed The 1992 security in retirement statement reaffirmed the government's intention to consider 'a taxation trade-off to allow a universal employee contribution of three per cent later in the superannuation guarantee implementation period'. Dr FitzGerald suggested that the timing of this initiative, and for extending the superannuation guarantee to changes the self-employed, be settled. However, such initiatives would entail substantial fiscal implications. It is not possible at this time to make detailed commitments on such matters years in advance of their implementation. There are many practical issues which need to be resolved before the introduction of such a measure could be contemplated. Accordingly, while the government affirms its original intention to consider these extensions to the superannuation tee towards the end of the phased implementation period, it will not be seeking to set a firm timetable at this early stage. Superannuation savings accounts (SSAs) Dr FitzGerald recommended examination of the possibility of developing a generic superannuation savings account vehicle to be offered by banks and other financial institutions. The government has decided not to introduce a special tax and regulatory regime for such accounts. A number of banking groups already offer over-the-counter superannuation savings accounts. through their branch networks, but these are provided by way of the banks' life office subsidiaries or their associates. The present arrangements ensure that superannuation products offered by banks are subject to the same rules and conditions as for other providers of superannuation. The government considers this prevents anyone sector gaining an unfair advantage over competitors in the superannuation market, and ensures that members of all funds enjoy similar regulatory protection. The banks have argued that a major benefit of SSAs would be their contribution to resolving the small amounts problem. However, the package of measures that we are announcing today provides a comprehensive solution for all small amounts. Superannuation taxation concessions Dr FitzGerald proposed that the tax on employer contributions be increased in order to fund increased concessions for personal superannuation contributions. As highlighted by my predecessor in his 17 August 1993 response, this proposal raises major equity considerations. The principal beneficiaries would be those on higher incomes who are able to make additional superannuation savings, while it would impact adversely on those whose only superannuation is the compulsory employer or award contribution. The government has decided that it will not make any changes to the superannuation tax mix along the lines that Dr FitzGerald has suggested. Preservation age and encouragement of guaranincome streams Dr FitzGerald recommended that consideration be given to accelerating the already arinounced timetable for increasing the superannuation preservation age to 60. The government only recently announced this policy, and people have a right to certainty in such areas. There will be no acceleration of the announced timetable. Dr FitzGerald also made some recommendations concerning the interaction of the pension and superannuation rules. The former Treasurer, in his earlier response to the FitzGerald report, ruled out any change to the taxation treatment· of lump sums and noted that these other matters would be considered in the context of a government review of the interaction of the age pension and superannuation; This review will follow the outcome of a report by an independent consultant, now looking at the means testing of social security pensions, due to report to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) later this year. Life cycle savings vehicle Dr FitzGerald proposed that, once fiscal circumstances allow, consideration should be given to introducing a new type of tax advantaged saving vehicle. As the previous Treasurer stated last August, the government agrees with Dr FitzGerald that priority should be given at this stage to increasing public sector saving. It will be important that any initiative in this area provide a boost to total national saving and not merely increase private saving at the expense of public saving. The government is continuing to examine various possible approaches to such a vehicle with a view to the introduction of the most cost-effective arrangement. Other superannuation policy measures In the context of resolving the small amounts problem, the government will also be implementing a number of other measures designed to improve the operation of the superannuation guarantee and some other areas of policy. Interaction with awards The government's intention in introducing the superannuation guarantee was that it should complement rather than replace existing superannuation arrangements in the economy, including the superannuation provisions of industrial awards. It seems, however, that doubt has been expressed in some circles as to whether the superannuation guarantee legislation in fact achieves this objective. In particular, there has been some suggestion that the enactment of the superannuation guarantee has undermined the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals to continue to arbitrate disputes over superannuation matters, including the choice of fund to which employers must contribute. The government will, accordingly, legislate to make clear its original policy intention that the superannuation guarantee legislation in no way alters the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial tions Commission and other tribunals to continue to arbitrate in industrial disputes over superannuation matters. Another concern is that payment of the superannuation guarantee charge by an employer may not extinguish any corresponding legal liability it may have to make superannuation contributions, in arrears, under an award. The government will legislate to remove this anomaly. Earnings bases A number of practical problems have been experienced in the way that the superannuation guarantee legislation specifies the employee earnings bases which may be used by employers determining their superannuation liabilities. The government will be legislating to further refine the definition of 'ordinary time earnings' in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act. The amendments will allow,· in particular, for a more stable ordinary time earnings base to be determined for use, especially in defined benefit schemes. It is intended to also relax the present restrictions involved in using the earnings bases of superannuation schemes to which employers were contributing prior to 21 August 1991 by allowing such earnings bases to be transferred to 'successor schemes'. This will facilitate the desirable rationalisation of superannuation funds following, for example, corporate takeovers and reorganisations. The government will also ·legislate to resolve problems and complexities associated with so called 'flat dollar' superannuation contributions which are required under some industrial awards. Excess benefits Under the superannuation guarantee, employers are obliged to continue contributing on behalf of employees who have already accumulated benefits in excess of their reain sonable benefits limits. These moneys will be taxed at the 15 per cent fund rate and subsequently the top marginal rate. The government considers this outcome does not assist retirement income objectives and. therefore will legislate to exempt employees from the superannuation guarantee where they can Rela- show evidence to their employer that they have vested benefits in excess of the $800,000 pension limit. Encumbrance of rollover annuities The government will also be legislating to remove, with effect after today, a present loophole in the law which allows certain rollover annuities to be encumbered by a mortgage or other surety. Allowing any superannuation savings to be encumbered in this way is inconsistent with the government's intention that such savings must be preserved until retirement. Local government councillors and prize money The government accepts that the superannuation guarantee has had unintended consequences for many elected local government councillors. The requirement for councils to make often relatively minor superannuation contributions in respect of the meeting and travelling allowances that they pay to councillors has, in particular, had the effect of denying many self-employed councillors the taxation concessions they could otherwise claim for contributions to their own personal superannuation schemes. The government has decided to exempt from the scope of the superannuation guarantee the allowances which local government councillors receive in the course of performing their duties as councillors. This will not preclude councils from continuing to provide superannuation support on behalf of councillors who, are effectively full-time employees. The government previously announced that it would', exempt prize money won by nonresidents. In the light of further advice received from major Australian sporting organisations we have decided to broaden the exemption to cover all prize money won, whether in sporting or other fields. Most professional sportspersons and others who receive prizes are effectively self-employed and prize money won is essentially equivalent to gross income' from which substantial expenses must be met. Conclusion The changes which I have announced today represent a further major instalment in the development of Australia's superannuation system. They demonstrate again the government's firm commitment to its retirement incomes policies and its resolve that superannuation plays the fullest possible role. The government is committed to the equity of the superannuation system. The changes will ensure that superannuation works well for everyone in Australia, including the lower paid, part-time and casual workers and others who were previously excluded from the system and, as I have said, it will especially help women. From now on, part-time and casual workers can be confident that their superannuation benefits will not be eroded by fees and administrative charges. With these reforms, and the other improvements which I have announced today, public confidence in the superannuation system should further increase. The vital dual role superannuation-increasing the nation's savings and providing for increased retirement living standards-will be pursued with even greater vigour, confidence and equity.",53
97,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Last year the former Treasurer commissioned a report by Dr FitzGerald on Australia's savings position. Dr FitzGerald found that Australia's underlying structural rate of national savings had fallen to around 18 per cent of GDP, five percentage points below the average for the past three decades. The main contributor to the long-term decline in national saving was in fact the decline in public sector saving. In order to lift Australia's level of national savings, Dr FitzGerald recommended the Commonwealth should seek to return its general government overall deficit to a persistent surplus. The report warned: We cannot, on a sustainable basis, continue to finance the investment we need to grow over the 1990s, and into the new century, by going progressively further into foreign debt. The low level of national savings imposes a speed'limit on how fast the Australian economy can grow in the future. It is critical for the government to get its own house in order and lessen its call upon Australia's scarce pool of national savings. However, households also need to play their part. The March national accounts figures showed that the trend household savings ratio, that proportion of household disposable income devoted to savings, had fallen to 3.9 per cent in March 1994 from a recent high of eight per cent in June 1990, the lowest point for more than a decade. The trend is unmistakable. Australians are saving less when there is a critical shortage and need for more savings. Superannuation plays an important role in helping to improve Australia's poor national savings performance, but the superannuation policy of this government has been an appalling mismatch of competing policy ideas. It started off as an industrial demand pursued in the Industrial Relations Commission. It then had added to it the Prime Minister's desire to deliver substantial financial power to the of ACTU. There was then an attempt to turn it into a national retirement savings policy. The government's policy in relation to superannuation has been a disaster for itinerant employees, for part-time employees and particularly for women who move in and out of the work force. They find their contributions being locked up in different funds with small amounts being eaten up by administration charges. The government's answer to this disaster for those who are itinerant or part-time or women moving in and out of the work force, the government's answer for those seeing their contributions being eaten up in administrative charges, is to now have these contributions collected by the tax office. As a result of the Treasurer's statement, Australian Taxation Office has been given the mandate to intrude further into the lives of ordinary Australians. The coalition believes that the primary function and purpose of the tax office is to collect taxation. Let me state categorically: the tax office should not be in the business of superannuation and funds management. The tax office is a bureaucracy out there contracting out as a collection agency, using powers that have been vested in it to collect revenue for some kind of freelance activity. Those who believe the tax office solution to the problem of small contributions is a good idea and truly has the best interests of casual, part-time and itinerant workers at heart should take the time to read Audit Report No. 39 1993-94: efficiency audit: Australian Taxation Office: management of the Child Support AgencyWe in the opposition hold the Auditor General's reports in very high regard. The Auditor-General found in relation to the Child Support Agency that there were 'serious deficiencies in the management and administration of the scheme, a major consequence of which is an unsatisfactory standard of service to clients'. The saga of the Child Support Agency is an unfortunate example of what happens when the tax office becomes involved in activities which are not its primary function. Now the government proposes to get the tax office into the business of collecting superannuation payments. The FitzGerald report recommended competitive neutrality in handling superannuation-competitive neutrality between financial institutions in relation to superannuation contributions. Yet one cannot help but conclude that the government's desire to get the tax office into the business of collecting low superannuation contributions is as much as anything else motivated by a desire to lock out other financial institutions, such as banks and building societies, that are quite keento get into this business and that could offer a service to people making low contributions by holding their contributions in accounts with zero or low negotiated fees, where people could see their contributions in relation to their bank accounts, where there )Vould be the multi-point receiving and where itlcould be held on their behalf. The government, however, believes that it is the tax office'sbusiness to get into this. One cannot help but conclude that this is an attempt not to be neutral but to lock out other financial institutions as part of the desire, especially of the ACTU, to ensure that financial power is locked up in institutions where they believe they have maximal influence. In his Security in retirement-planning for tomorrow today statement in 1992, the then Treasurer, John Dawkins, also committed the government to examining the possibility of introducing a generic superannuation savings account. That statement said: The Government considers that the development of a SSA vehicle could offer scope to increase the level of competition in the superannuation industry, with consequent benefits for fund members. Yet the government has apparently now abandoned this idea. The government has given no reasons why it does not want further competition in relation to the superannuation industry. It has given no reasons as to why it would not be in the interests of consumers to have that as an option. It has given no convincing reason as to why it has backtracked on the indication that was made in the statement in 1992. Since 1988 the coalition has advocated that Australians should be provided with more choice and flexibility in superannuation and that Australians on low incomes should be able to choose a low cost superannuation product to meet their needs through the implementation of savings accounts. That has been the coalition's consistent position. In 1992 the government had come to the position of considering that and realising the benefits it could bring, yet in this statement it has walked away from it without any convincing reason for doing so. In this statement the government also finally lays to rest another broken promise of the last election campaign. At the last the coalition advocated allowing first home buyers to use up to 75 per cent of superannuation benefits for the deposit on a home. During the campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) committed Labor to allowing home buyers to withdraw up to $lO,OOO of their vested superannuation benefit to cover up to 50 per cent of the deposit on a home. .This promise has finally been broken and given the last rights in this statement. Just like the promise of tax cuts, which were supposed to be l-a-w, law, it too has turned out to be l-o-r-e-folk1orific. The promise was made before the election and, finally, abandoned. In fairness to the Treasurer, back in April of this year he was talking about breaking the promise, when he said· that the government had decided not to proceed with the election commitment, but today he finally pronounced the last rights on yet another broken election promise in relation to home buyers. The FitzGerald report was much heralded. Never have we seen a report so heralded by this government, which of course used it as the basis for breaking its promises in relation to tax increases. Never has there been a report so much buried, in relation to savings accounts, competitive neutrality regarding financial intermediaries, and all of the other aspects that were raised by that report and have been buried today. The government's response has been poor, pre-emptory, narrow and corrupted by extraneous factors relating not to superannuation and the best deal for superannuants but to who is going to get control of the funds, relating to the pressure that has been exerted on this government by the ACTU and relating to policy aims and objectives far outside the purview of a good superannuation policy. I ask the minister to table a copy of the statement and to move that the House take note of the paper so that the House can debate the many other important and technical issues that are raised in his statement. Mr Connolly- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a statement. Leave not granted.",59

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",61

101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will resume his seat. ,61
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There were barely eight or nine.,61
103,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to talk about the very unfortunate circumstance occurring across the country again: the re-emergence of significant and serious drought. As has been the case for so many years in recent times, the problem is much exacerbated by the sorts of policies inflicted upon the farm community, in particular, and those involved in business, and export businesses in general, by those opposite. It is very interesting that from time to time this is actually acknowledged by those opposite in their more honest moments. A couple of years ago a senior and quite prominent member of the government actually went on the public record-we have it in print-to acknowledge this problem. He said: Quite clearly our Government made a range of mistakes on monetary issues and we led the world into recession ., . It is regrettable that our largely efficient farmers have their hands tied behind their backs because of wider policies ... The wider policies of the government that the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) is representative of! I will be interested in his response today. No-one should underestimate the importance of agriculture to Australia. Noone should underestimate its role in undergirding our prosperity, the role it can play in rebuilding our economy and the role it can play in winding back our foreign debt-that underrated and very serious problem that I want to talk more about in a moment. We especially should not underestimate the impact on our national economic and social fabric that occurs when agriculture is in trouble. As I said at the outset, today yet again we face the most unwelcome prospect of drought creeping across this nation. As of the announcement today, a half of New South Wales is now drought declared and much of the rest of it is badly affected and looking at a fairly grim prospect for the winter. Onethird of Queensland is drought declared, and it is likely that another third will follow very shortly. This drought threatens not just the fledgling rural recovery that we have all awaited for so long but also, by extension, the national economic recovery, which is also extremely fledgling at this stage. Mr Andrew-Fragile.",61
104,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is fragile, as my colleague comments. This is of critical importance-not just to farmers-and the parliament needs to be forcefully reminded of the importance and significance of the rural sector to the nation's well-being. I will give the House a couple of basic reminders. Australia's farmers feed and clothe some 55 million people. There are only 17 million people in Australia, which means that we are doing a mighty job towards helping 38 million others around the globe. Around 560,000 Australians depend upon agriculture and downstream agricultural value adding industries for their jobs. Many of those are to be found in our food processing sector. It needs to be remembered that the food processing sector, dependent as it is upon the ready and reliable supply of clean agricultural product delivered at good, economical prices, is still our biggest manufacturing sector. A great slab of our national export income is still farm derived. There is scope for enormous expansion-particularly, as we are so often told in this place, in those Asian markets on our northern doorstep. We are often told that by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the same Prime Minister who gratuitously tells us that it is time Australia grew up a bit and was more than just a place that exported a bit of coal, a bit of wheat and a bit of wool-as though that is somehow a mark of our being a backward sort of place. The truth is that agriculture and food processing in Australia are great users of the world's best production and genetic technology, and they have been for a very long time. It is also true to say that agriculture and downstream related activities still earn this country an enormous proportion of our export income. This is particularly critical in an Australia facing a very real problem in terms of our trade imbalance and our accumulating external debt. I draw the House's attention to an interesting article that appeared in this morning's A-stralian Financial Review headed 'Chamber's foreign debt warning'. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned that Australia's foreign debt servicing burden could readily slip back into the critical category if there is any upward movement in global interest rates. According to a risk assessment released by that organisation yesterday: ... another blowout in Australia's current account deficit could see a sharp fall in the Australian dollar and ""markedly higher interest rates"". That is what is at stake if our export performance drops off. Given the problems facing the rural sector with encroaching drought, there is one very substantial case now to be made out that that is going to happen, tragic as that may be. The article continues: The ACCI risk assessment noted lite foreign debt burdenthis government really deserves some condemIiation on this; it gets off far too lightly--': was running at about 230 per cent of export income, wen. above the 150 per cent level regarded as being - ritical by international financial tions. Mr Andrew-I wonder who ran that debt up.",62
105,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I wonder under whose policies it was run up and continues to be run up. The article goes on: The ACCI risk management noted that in nominal dollar terms Australia's foreign debt had surged from about $20 billion in 1981-82remember who was in government thento more than $170 billion just over a decade later. It said Australia's foreign debt had risen from less than 70 per cent of our export income in the early 1980s to a currentstaggeringfigure of about 230 per cent. It went to on to warn again: Australia is wen into the over-ISO per cent level considered critical by international financial markets-the warning bens have been flashing for almost a decade . . . What has the government done about it? The article continues: Australia remains vulnerable to adverse movements in the international economy and financial markets. Why vulnerable? I repeat: surely we acknowledge the need for every export dollar we can get our hands on. Yet the government has gone on ignoring the very real need to completely overhaul the economic environment in which our farmers have to operate; our farmers who are still major and critically important contributors to· this nation's wealth and this nation's capacity to offer jobs to young people, let alone those who have lost their jobs in later working years. What happens? We simply see a continuation of this willingness to sacrifice the real interests of the nation in the interests of the short-term, politically expedient needs of maintaining office. I will repeat the famous remarks I made earlier: Quite clearly our government made a range of mistakes on monetary issues and we led the world into recession ... It is regrettable that our efficient farmers have their hands tied behind their backs because of wider policies. Who made those remarks? It was the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), who was then a minister in the government. He said this in Dunedoo in February 1992, which instituis not long ago. We are always hearing from this government what we did 10, 15 or 20 years ago. It is not long ago since the honourable member rightly made those remarks, yet we see a continuation of the very policies which are cutting away our capacity to deal with those very real problems of the vagaries of seasons which affect us in rural Australia. Those policies have had two devastating effects: firstly, they have seriously undermined the capacity of our farmers to cope with things like drought and, secondly-this is very important and often misunderstoodthey have very seriously undermined the morale of people in the bush. A week ago I was out at Carinda, a great little community in the western area of my electorate that has been devastated by drought largely, as I keep repeating, because people are so weakened in their capacity to cope with drought by what has happened in recent years. I met a group of men and women in the main street. A feIlow about my age-a bloke I have the utmost respect for-who has battled through the last four or five almost impossible situations with wool, drought and so forth, said to me, 'I don't know why 1 continue. 1I have never been so disheartened in all my life.' He is one of a whole series of farm families out there facing yet another dry winter. They are facing the prospect, yet again, of having to handfeed their sheep, yet they contemplate that the market indicator for the sort of wool they grow is sitting obstinately on about 480. This is admittedly better than last year, but farmers are not getting the benefits of it because they are being heavily discounted for burr and dust in that area. A series of social problems are emerging. It is wryly said out there that the latest form of child abuse is wanting your kid to follow you onto the land. Maybe the sense of humour is not completely dead but there are not largely the kids around to follow on anyway. Only three or four years ago there were 70 kids at the local school; today there are 20. Many of these communities feel that they are left out, undervalued, under-recognised and not supported in doing what they do best: to make a massive contribution to the economic and social well-being of this country. When I questioned the Minister for Resources, who is at the table, on what the government's response was to all of this-I suppose it would be too much to ask the government to put in place policies which might help economically by creating a stable low cost environment where interest rates remain low and where the dollar was always competitive-he said that the rural adjustment scheme was in place and that this was the cornerstone of government assistance to the rural sector. He said that it was in place to ensure that, in times of difficulty, farmers were able to get the assistance that they deserved. He went on to say that any farmer would always be able to apply for RAS under normal circumstances and that, if the difficulover ties continued for Queensland and New South Wales, the government would respond to those state governments. Farmers struggling to stay on their farms would have been very interested to realise that the government believes farmers can apply for assistance from the rural adjustment scheme. In fact, thousands of farmers are regularly refused assistance through the so called normal RAS because normal RAS is available only to those farmers who are expanding or undertaking some other program to improve their productivity. The money is simply not available to battlers facing the sorts of drought circumstances that are now facing so many out there. The head of the New South Wales rural assistance authority was heard to say just the other day, 'The trouble is that we haven't got a drought scheme.' The government has spent years avoiding this issue yet we still have not got a drought scheme. He went on to say that, if no rain came in the next couple of weeks in most areas of New South Wales, some consideration would have to be given to this drought situation, which is getting worse rapidly. Many crops have just not been planted. I reckon that only one-fifth of the eastern states' wheat has been sown. If there is no alleviation soon, that will cost the country billions in export income this year. There is no water where most of our cottonnow a billion dollar plus - xport industry-is grown. There are nil allocatiorls in the Gwydir and Namoi Valleys, so another devastating outcome is coming up. There are continuing problems in the wool industry. It is a very . serious situation. We are facing a critical situation which the government needs to respond to. I have mentioned the human side of the· tragedy. I want to refer to the economic costs. Frankly, we have seen some pretty misleading headlines recently about recovery in the bush, and no-one wishes more than I do that they were true. But, despite the predictions of better times, the fact is that next year will be the fifth successive year of farm business losses. Cumulative losses in the sectors are as follows: the broadacre sector, around $74,000 the last five years; the mixed livestock and cropping industry, $66,000; the beef industry, $47,000; the mixed livestock industries, $90,000 per farm; and wool, a horrifying $150,000-or close to it. Total farm debt is now $17.3 billion. Every one per cent increase in interest rates pushes farm costs up by $170 million to $200 million. I am told by rural councillors in my electorate that the average farmer in trouble out there is still paying interest at about 13 112 per cent. What are they going to be paying when, as a result of what the mob opposite is doing, interest rates start to hike again? There are three vital messages for the parliament in all of this. Firstly, current economic policies are still wrong, as they were when in 1992 the honourable member for Calare confessed them to have been misguided. We will see a continuing high and unacceptable pressure on costs, especially interest rates in the dollar, which will do as they have done for years: devastate the capacity. of the bush to cope. Secondly, the implications for the economy are profound and we would do well to acknowledge them and to act. We need policy adjustments now to boost the ability of the farm sector to recover and contribute. Thirdly, RAS funding is too narrowly focused and under-funded. This is counter to the interests of our fanners which, of course, is counter to the national interest as well. (TIme expired)",63
106,Mr BEDDALL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is with great pleasure that I respond to the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), in this debate on what is a very important issue for rural Australia. No-'one on this side of House-and, I acknowledge, no-one on that side of the House-tries to deny how important the rural sector is to this country. As a representative of non-metropolitan Australia, I know how difficult it is for people on the land. No-one disputes that Australia is a harsh environment to live and work in. In fact, it is one of the unique competitive advantages that we have. Our businesses have had to cope with climatic extremes and come up with innovative solutions to them. We have a reputation around the world as an exporter of commodities, goods and services that stems from the nature of our country-flexible, tough and reliable. Our activities have had to adjust to the conditions we have-a large, arid continent. Drought is certainly a difficult feature of our way of life, particularly for rural families businesses. That is something that is recognised and something that we have to cope with. Its impact on rural communities is not something to be understated. This government has recognised this and, along with the state and rural sector, has acted. Australia has a proud agricultural tradition. I do not want to downplay the importance of the issue that we are discussing today. However, our rural sector is facing a recovery, along with the rest of the Australian economy. Increased wool demand and higher prices for wool, meat and wheat are all expected to contribute to the improved outlook. However-and I will be the first to admit it-a shortage of rainfall in New South Wales and Queensland in recent months has constrained pasture growth and delayed crop planting. In 1994 improving returns from livestock products will underpin growth in fann incomes. In 1994 the net value of fann production-the gross value of fann production less costs-is expected to be 10 per cent higher than in 1993-94. Earnings from fann exports are forecast to increase by $1 billion to $17.8 billion in 1994-95-the fourth consecutive increase since 1990-91. I now tum to the future outlook of some individual commodities. In spite of falls in the cattle prices since April, on average beef prices in 1993-94 are estimated to be around 16 per cent higher than the previous year. Further increases of around 19 per cent are forecast for 1994-95. Yes, recent falls in Australian saleyard prices reflected the continued high tum-off due to dry conditions and, to a lesser extent, the short-tenn fall in US import demand for manufactured beef. Wool prices are now around 600c. The strengthening of the market is due to a pickup in demand from western Europe and continuing finn demand from Asian countries. At this time of the year, expected world wheat prices are largely influenced by the development of the Northern Hemisphere crop. ABARE's current assessment is for a three per cent increase in the world indicator price for wheat in 1994-95. Australia is expected to achieve its third and consecutive year of record production of sugar in 1994-95 and become the world's largest raw sugar exporter. Australian milk production is expected to continue. to increase in 1994-95, although manufactured milk returns will fall by five per cent because of lower international prices and the strengthening of the Australian dollar. Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer to these commodity prices to give you and the House a broader view of what is happening in Australia. Unfortunately, because of the vastness of our continent, we are always facing extremes. When I sat down and looked at this matter of public importance today, I saw two exceptional circumstances in my question time briefone on drought and one on the impact of heavy rainfalls on the wool producers of Western Australia. So it is a very difficult task to balance the climatic conditions of this great continent. All is not doom and gloom. As one honourable member opposite-whom I will later name-recently said in this place: . . . all of us welcome an apparent pick-up in economic activity ... The honourable member opposite also said: I note with enonnous relief that itthe farm sectorhas managed to put in a very sound perfonnance over the last little while. The honourable member continued: ... fanning has made an outstanding contribution to economic recovery, despite the extraordinarily difficult· circumstances that the through in recent times. The honourable member also said, 'We are now seeing a turnaround,' and, 'It is better than it has ever been.' The honourable member who said that earlier this month is the Deputy Leader of the National Party. He claims that the government does not have the best interests of the rural sector at heart. I dispute that- Let me remind him what our policies are. We have implemented a range of policies aimed at continuing the process of efficient structural· change, one that promotes sustainable development in rural areas. The main mechanism is the rural adjustment scheme. The opposition may decry the rural adjustment scheme, but let me remind the House that over $187 million was allocated to the rural adjustment scheme for 1993-94, and over $433 million will be available under RAS from 1993-94 to 1996-97. In response to the needs of the rural communities, the government has in place a range of programs, including the rural counselling program, telecentres, business advice for rural areas, the Australian country information service, the rural access program and the very popular Countrylink. The 1994-95 budget amalgamated these programs into the rural communities access program, which is to receive more than $45 million over the next four years. The national Landcare program is the Commonwealth's main mechanism for encouraging ecologically sustainable development in rural areas. In 1993-94, $105.2 million was provided to enhance the long term productivity of Australia's natural resources. The government has committed similar funding in 1994-95 . An agribusiness programs board was established to provide a one stop shop for delivery of six agribusiness programs, including three new ones which received funding of $22.6 million for 1993-94 to 1995-96. Funding of $5 million was announced in the 1992 Australian agrifood industries statement for the clean food export program, which included a $3 million pilot promotion in Taiwan aimed at boosting exports of high quality fresh and sector has been processed foods. It is critical that we keep the momentum in the reform of international trade rules. Winning better access to markets is crucial to our success in rural export markets. Before Australia can sign on to these GATT reforms and receive the concessions negotiated under the Uruguay Round, the parliament will be required to pass legislative amendments this year to enable commitments undertaken by Australia in the round to be met. The commitments required by Australia under the agricultural agreement will be minimal due to reform already undertaken since the commencement of negotiations in 1986. However, Australia will be required to reduce export subsidies on dairy products; convert the current cheese import tariff quota to a tariff equivalent; abolish the current local leaf content scheme for tobacco and convert it to a tariff equivalent; abolish the current differential sales tax on fruit juice, which discriminates between imported and local product, and convert it to a tariff equivalent; and bind all agricultural tariffs in the GATT. Industry ha..c; been regularly consulted over the required changes and Australian strategy during the round's negotiation. In the case of tobacco and fruit juice, the current arrangements are due to terminate in 1995, regardless of the outcome of the round. Let me now return to the subject of today's MPI: drought and its impact on rural communities. Of course, the government is aware of the drought situation in many areas of Australia. The object of the government's national drought policy is to assist fanners manage risk of drought and maximise their self-reliseasonal ance. For unusually severe drought circumAreas stances, the rural adjustment .scheme has exceptional drought circumstances provisions which help long-tenn profitable fann enterregion prises that are temporarily in severe financial difficulties. Applications are considered, they should be, on a case by case basis. The government recognises that the current drought in Queensland, which commenced in mid-1991, is in many areas the most severe on record and that, while the drought may have broken in some places, other areas remain in exceptional drought RAS exceptional circumstances support to Queensland will be extended to 31 December 1994. Additional funding of $4 112 million bring total funding for drought exceptional circumstances in Queensland to $31.2 miIIion, including a supplement of $2 million for nonnal RAS. Revised guidelines for detenninbeen ing exceptional drought circumstances and criteria for detennining sustainable restructurareas ing restocking levels are currently being developed in consultation with the Queensvery land RAS authority and will be in place by the end of June 1994 to implement the packcant age. According to ABARE, the Queensland drought has had a significant effect on Queensland agriculture, causing substantial falls in income and, in many cases, increases in debt levels. The general outlook, however, is for an improvement in perfonnance. The drought has resulted in pasture damage caused by overgrazing and critically low soil moisterns ture and ground water levels. The government is concerned to protect the resource base will assist producers to gradually restock to prevent land degradation and ensure full recovery. In regions which have experienced little any rain or where ground water levels remain low, the most important issue is income maintenance over the next six months-that is, until a crop can be harvested or until livestock can be purchased and sold for turnharvested off or breeding stock recovery. When I was told about the topic of today's the MPI I asked for some information on the climatic outlook for winter 1994. most likely to receive above average total winter rainfall are in Western Australia, in inland areas and the south-east, and a small in the south-east of South Australia. Unfortunately, there are indications that the as central coast and highlands of Queensland . may again receive below average rainfall over the next three months. Should this occur, the central highlands area of Queensland will have been suffering drought conditions since 1991. Anybody, particularly Queenslanders, who has seen the effect of that drought will have nothing but great sympathy for those circumstances. who are affected. I noticed that the Deputy Leader of the will National Party said that New South Wales was about to declare 50 per cent of the state drought affected. The figures I have show that currently 34 per cent of New South Wales has drought declared. This is mainly in the northern areas of New South Wales, including adjacent to Queensland. lam sure parts of the honourable member's electorate are badly affected by drought. The affected area extends down through the very signifihard wheat belt of New South Wales. At present the situation is being closely monitored, particularly in Queensland. I take this opportunity to look a little closer at the weather forecast. In a monthly review of the seasonal outlook for June the Bureau of Meteorology indicated that conditions across the equatorial Pacific are near nonnal. There was a change in general weather patin the latter part of May, with the south of the country, particularly Western Australia, and experiencing significant cold fronts. Conditions in Queensland have indicated persistent drought conditions in the central highlands, with a lack of follow-up rains in if the Darling Downs. This has resulted in only 10 per cent of the winter cereal crop area in Queensland being sown by mid-May. However, there was some relief for cereal growers with some very good sorghum crops being in the Roma area. Unfortunately, these yields are very patchy. At the end of April, 38 per cent of Queensland was still, drought declared. The wet season failed to come in the area adjacent to the Northern Territory. The Lockyer Valley, which is close to my electorate, has limited surface water and the ground water is rapidly diminishing. This may have a significant effect on the potential for this area to recover economically after rain. Some rain fell in north and north-west New South Wales late last year. Farmers had been assisted under special circumstances criteria and Minister Crean decided that there would be no continuation of special circumstances at that time for New South Wales. However, I point out that, if the New South Wales gov.ernment considers that it 'needs to go back into special circumstances or the National Farmers Federation equivalent in New South Wales wishes to make an application, the government will consider those applications. The availability of exceptional circumstances assistance enables those producers with long-term prospects to better deal with those situations without undermining the RAS objectives of enhancing self-reliance, productivity and resilience on a sustainable basis. Normal RAS rather than exceptional circumstances will pick up what we hope will be the recovery phase. Additional pressure will be placed on normal RAS for training advice and productivity enhancement as viable producers rebuild their enterprises. Re-establishment also play an important role as non-viable producers exit the industry. RAS exceptional circumstances provisions are intended to provide short-term targeted assistance to cover circumstances which farmers cannot reasonably take into account in their farm planning and are not intended to substitute for risk management principles and the RAS objectives of self-reliance, competitiveness and long-term sustainability. I remind the House that normal RAS support includes interest rate subsidies up to 50 per cent on commercial finance for productivity improvements, grants for training and access to professional advice to enhance farm productivity and the provision of a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 to assist farmers without future prospects to leave farms with dignity. Exceptional circumstances support is available for productivity improvements, debt restructuring and carry-on finance. (TIme expired)",65
107,Mr WAKELIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was interested in the comments of the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) on self-reliance. I come from the driest area in the driest state of the driest continent on earth. My electorate produces 50 per cent of South Australia's exports and at least 50 per cent of its grain. It exports high quality wheat to the eastern states during times of drought, which tragically do strike this country from time to time. The Tent Hills, to the east of the Gawler Ranges, are what remains of a much higher plateau. The winds of time have worn the soil away over millions of years. This land, so respected by many Aboriginals, represents their life on the land and their survival on the land. Their lifestyle has been altered dramatically because of government intervention. I compare the lifestyle of the 95 per cent of Australians living in cities and towns with the lifestyle of the remaining five per cent of nonAboriginal people who live on the land and who have just as deep a feeling for their land. I refer, of course, to our farmers. Imagine the frustration of our farmers when they see a $1.5 billion land fund set up for Aboriginal people and all they have access to will is the rural adjustment scheme, involving a measly few million-and the farmers produce $20 billion of export income per annum. Ultimately our survival as a country and as individuals depends on production from the land, whether it be from farming or mining. Farmers very much depend on the rain, yet the 95 per cent of Australians who live in the cities and towns lament the rain. This is the most highly urbanised society on earth. A social scientist by the name of MCKay made mention in a recent publication of the culture in urban Australia, with people owning four-wheel drives that never really get off the bitumen. They love their rural image but this country has got so cosseted that it forgets most of the time that people are actually out there producing. This is a double standard. Our early settlers came to this land and created a productive nation. Bill Kelty followed in their path last year, a couple of hundred years later, and rediscovered regional Australia and what everyone alr-ady knewthere is still an independent spirit and not even 11 years of Labor could drag the people into the cities. We have had many droughts in my region; some of the more notable were in 1914, the late 1940s, 1957, 1959, 1967, 1977 and the big one in 1985-88. I acknowledge that the minister mentioned that this is a natural fact of life in regional Australia and that that is particularly so for those involved in agriculture. The greatest irony of the 1988 drought, for South Australia and in particular the Eyre Peninsula, was that that was the time the government chose to withdraw natural disaster funding for drought. At the most critical time, what did the government do? It withdrew natural disaster funding for drought. The government did not allow people to get up off their knees. It kicked them in the groin while they were down. Many honourable members may recall that that was accompanied by a crash in commodity prices, a fall in the value of the dollar and the deregulation of the banking system. Many of my colleagues in the farming sector were not prepared for this. Record high interest rates have led to the depopulation of much of regional Australia. This has been a very politically selective approach-an approach demonstrated by former Treasurer Keating and Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the ACTU. I note the comments of last week that interest rates are rising so we need a wage rise. The government gives no consideration at all to the effect of higher interest rates on small business, including farmers .. I note in the paper yesterday that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) reminded the ALP about its roots of a hundred years ago-that it had come from the working people, from the shearers. I have written to the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) regularly for the last four months to see whether he will come and have a look at the Eyre Peninsula and those regions that have suffered dry seasons, or at least a bad patch last year. To this point I have not even got a response. I keep saying to the people in my electorate that I might hear from the minister when it rains. Ultimately, it is farming which is the productive sector of this country and which lays the foundation for revenue raising. The bureaucracy expects farmers and rural communities to adapt when these minor hiccups occur. We hear much about risk management. The bureaucracy expects farmers simply to adapt and manage. There is no consideration 'by the government or the public sector of the huge 'variables that mother nature brings, particularly to agriculture. I say to the government: only when it, the public sector and many in the urban centres accept these huge variations-and sometimes it is a factor of 10 from one year to the next-will we maximise ourselves as a nation in a social and economic sense. One of the cruelest factors that this government ignores is the indirect tax system, which has to be paid regardless of whether a farmer makes a profit. Let us think back to the 1993 budget-the I-a-w bit and all those increases in excises. Honourable members should remember that a farmer has to pay indirect tax regardless of whether he makes a profit. These tax increases are still flowing through to farmers. Of course, drought means no profit at all. In fact, it means a loss, which has to be made up in subsequent years. At the same time, this politically selective process allows me and 90 per cent of Australians to be paid regularly, regardless of rainfall or commodity prices. We say, 'To hell with those people out there on variable incomes.' I regard this as the most serious social justice issue that this country currently faces. After numerous committees and reports, drought still remains shrouded with ignorance and a sense of schizophrenia. The government is incapable of a fair and just solution which recognises the interdependence of urban and regional areas. Agriculture is taken for granted and political games are played, such as with the World Heritage listing of Lake Eyre. There was no consideration for the local people or the effect that it would have on the economy of those regions. The UN treaty on desertification is another example. In recent years, farmers earnt less than half the average wage. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) talked about the accumulated losses over the last five years. But I will be generous. It is said that in recent years farmers have earned less than half the average wage. But 20 years ago it was expected that !hey would earn twice the average wage. The Impact of the assets test and the availability of education just compounds the effect, as people are forced by the cruel imp,act of government policy, combined with the impact of drought, to look at options outside their productive land. Australian farmers are a tough and resilient lot, but there is a limit. This government of 11 years has failed to acknowledge their value and put in place economic policies which allow rural Australia an even chance a sporting chance, to share in the natidnal wealth sufficiently to encourage them to continue in agriculture with a positive sense of building for' the future. Regional Australia is predominantly about small business and its employees, of which farmers are an integral part. The challenge for the.future must be to rebuild the region, with agnculture as an essential part of restoration, to at least an equal standard of living comparable with the rest of Australia. I happen to be of the school of thought which believesalthough sadly it is not the case now-that the best time to talk about drought is when - ou are walking through the mud; that the tll-e to pyepare for drought is when you have a lIttle bIt tn your pocket. With this government there is little chance of that. That is the challenge. Only when we as a nation adapt our systems to the systems of nature, which is our heritage as Australians, will we have truly come to terms with our national destiny.",68
108,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"page) (5.14 p.m.)Drought in Australia is a serious problem. I think all members would have a genuine concern for farmers who face difficultiesand, in some cases"" severe difficulties-as a result of drought. When listening to' the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who spoke on policy matters, I found it interesting to consider where we would have been under the opposition's policies. When those opposite were in government, their policies resulted in high tariffs to the manufacturing industry, the costs of which were largely paid for by the primary industry sector. Its policies led to high inflation in the early 1980s and showed no signs of restruc!uring the work force. Its policies gave no Impetus to assisting our manufacturing industry to export. The signs were there then that, alt-ough we recognise that rural exports are gOIng to be of continuing importance, it is absolutely essential that we develop a more - fficient and a greater exporting manufacturlfIg sector. The policies of this government have led to that. . Over the. last 10 years, we have seen large tncreases tn our exports of manufactured goods and elaborately enhanced goods. For opposition members to come in here with genuine concern but without policies of their own and without recognising the success of the policies of this government is, in my - iew, hYp?critical. Not only that, those opposIte come tn here and depict the way that they would do it. Yet we know the real way that they would do it, and it really does laugh in the face of people who live in rural areas. I have here a paper which was prepared by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who at the time was the shadow minister for regional and rural development. The paper, which was prepared for the structural reform management group, relates to regional and rural development. I am not supposed to have a copy of it. If I had written it, I would not want anybody to have it either. I would not be writing this sort of stuff - nyway. It is a sad indictment of the opposition. The member for Maranoa writes: It is important when. considering initiatives in the p?-foli- of Regional and Rural Development to dlsttng':llsh between those which are essentially. benefiCial to the development of Australian regions and those which will win the Coalition seats in regional Australia. This discussion will be concerned with those initiatives which will win votes for the Coalition. So those opposite are not interested in the real issues. They are interested only in getting a few Yotes. How will they do that? The honourable member for Maranoa says that he will do that by 'winning the Yote of influential community opinion leaders'. He concentrates on two areas, one of which is infrastructure. He writes: We need to set a figure ($) billion, $3 billion-the actual number is insignificant) ... He is saying, 'Let's go out and promise bridges, roads and all these things; the figure doesn't matter.' It should be obvious to all of us and to the community at large that this is not truthful. Those opposite are setting a figure and making promises with no intention of carrying them out. That is further reinforced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and others who say that the budget deficit should be reduced. How can we spend $1 billion, $3 billion or any figure-,-it does not matter-on infrastructure and reduce the budget deficit? The member for Maranoa says that they should allude to some sort of assessment procedure to convince us that they are right and that this is actually what they are going to do. In relation to costs and regulations, he writes: We must create a perception of reducing the costs of businesses ... any reduction in business regulation (most of which is State-based anyway) will be well-perceived ... The member for Maranoa then refers to community services. He writes: ... health, education and telecommunications, and again the actual dollar value of it is not important. That is a sad indictment of the sort of procedure the opposition has. Drought, in varying degrees, has always been a part of the lives of farmers in Australia. It is part of the reason for the ups and downs of rural commodity prices, and that situation is going to remain. Over the past few years, as well as drought, farmers have had to contend with low world commodity prices, a worldwide recession and high interest rates. There is no doubt that it has not been an easy time for people on farms. Thankfully, some of those circumstances have improved. The government, through its policy, has created a low interest, low inflation situation in Australia. That is only a dream for many other countries, including many of the developed nations. Australian farmers in particular will enjoy the ""benefits of this structure in coming years. World commodity prices have shown improvement and are likely to be sustainable for some time. Since last April, the indicator for wool has risen from 380c to around 6OOc. It is firm and indications are that there could be further improvement. In no small way, the good policy settings and the good legislation of this government-the wool legislation of 1993-have been responsible for that improving situation. Drought conditions exist in Australia at present. I have been to some of the drought affected areas; there is ample evidence of hardship. The government is, of course, concerned about this hardship for farmers. There are programs to assist. The question to be answered is: when should those programs come into play and when should they not? Although the opposition says, 'Give us more money,' I do not think it is seriously saying that farmers should receive permanent assistance or subsidies. That would lead to inefficiencies in the rural sector and would damage the direction we are taking towards fairer trade, where Australia has shown real leadership. Australia, through its leadership of the Cairns Group of agricultural fair traders and its role in services and other negotiations, has ' been a key player in the Uruguay Round. In future, global trade in agriculture and minerals, services and manufactured goods will be supported by a more liberal international economic environment, where governments are committed to opening markets for more trade through further trade Iiberalisation. For Australia alone, the Uruguay Round could well add up to $5 billion in export revenue and $4 billion to GDP over the next 10 years. This government played a leadership role in all of that. We have the RAS exceptional circumstances support, which is intended as shortterm assistance for those farmers who are faced with a situation which they could not have reasonably foreseen, which they could not have been reasonably expected to plan for. It is reasonable to expect that some droughts can be planned for. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) said in his speech that the best time is when there is mud on the ground. That is very true. Given the history of droughts in Australia, planning for droughts should be part of good farm management; in other words, planning so that the good years can make up for the crook years. However, some droughts suffered by farmers in this country are so severe that even the most prudent farmer could not reasonably expect to be able to plan for them. That is the situation in which the exceptional circumstances provisions of the RAS should apply. I think the opposition understands that, but pretends not to. All that is required to apply for the RAS under the exceptional circumstances-(Tlme expired)",70

That has come to nought. As honourable members will know, I am no devotee of the notion that this House should rise at 8 o'clock every night. If I might interpolate my view, when the dust settles the government might decide not to get up at 8 o'clock on Monday and Tuesday, but to stick to 8 o'clock on Wednesday and 6 o'clock on Thursday. . The rising of the House at 6 o'clock on Thursday has been a very valuflble innovation. My colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) finds it a particularly valuable adjunct to the zeal she has in serving her constituents. It would be a great pity if, as a consequence of the government's inability to manage the parliamentary program, the facility and the convenience of the early adjournment on Thursdays were to be lost.

115,Mr ELLIOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Briefly, the issues involved here are essentially minor administrative matters. I am advised that the amendments deal with persons or bodies requesting approvals under the offshore petroleum legislation. They are designed to retain industry responsibility for these proposals. Ministerial or official endorsement of these industry proposals should not deflect responsibility, provided that the approvals given in good faith. That seems to be the thrust of the amendments that are proposed. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",74
116,Mr LES SCOTT,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"Oxley) (5.46 p.m.)Prior to question time today, I rose for a couple of minutes to speak on the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994, which amends the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992. I am pleased to have the opporsubstantially tunity to speak in support of the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994 because it is important to industry develexisting opment. It is particularly pleasing to be able to speak on a bill that has enjoyed quite substantial bipartisan support in the Senate since it first appeared there. As indicated the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) when he was speaking earlier, the opposition will also be supporting the bill this place. I am equally pleased that it effect to some of the innovative measures the Working Nation white paper that are designed to assist regional development Australia; the white paper places Ii big emphasis on employment. This bill seeks to amend the Pooled Develeffect opment Funds Act 1992 in order to effect changes to pooled development funds so that they will be better able to lend to smalland medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs. The major amendments will increase the total asset limit of companies in which a pooled develderived opment fund may invest, remove the restricum tion that pooled development funds must not invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises, and increase the level of pooled development funds that must be invested in investee companies. The ·1992 act gave effect to initiatives announced in the February 1992 One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The act has two objectives: firstly, to establish a scheme under which companies and their shareholders can qualify for certain tax conare cessions; and, secondly, to encourage the provision of funds to smalland mediumsized Australian companies. Under the act, eligible corporations may be registered as pooled development funds, or PDFs, to provide funds to corporations with assets not exceeding $30 million. To qualify as a PDF, a company has to comply with a number of criteria, including that it be incorporated or will implement a capital raising plan and an investment plan. The act requires a PDF to believe that money it invests in a company will be used solely or principally for one or more of the following: establishing an eligible business; expanding the production or supply capacity of an established eligible business; or substantially expanding the markets, or developing substantial new markets, for goods or services supplied . by an established eligible business. PDFs receive concessional tax treatment. PDFs by qualify for a concessional tax rate of 25 per cent, although an amendment proposes to change that proposal. Gains on the disposal of in PDF shares are exempt from tax, as are gives unfranked dividends paid by a PDF and in franked dividends, unless the shareholder elects that they are to be taxed as dividends in paid by an ordinary company. The stated purpose of this bill is to give to changes to operational rules applying to PDFs announced in the Working Nation white paper. A number of initiatives were included in the white paper, firstly, a reduction in the concessional tax rate for PDFs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for income from investments in small and medisized enterprises. In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Construction Technology (Mr Lindsay) stated that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) will introduce legislation to give effect to this measure. . Further initiatives inc1ude: an increase from $30 million to $50 million in the total asset limit of companies in which a POF may invest; the removal of the restriction that POFs may not invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises; an increase from 20 per cent to 30 per cent in the proportion of raised capital that a POF may invest in anyone business; the granting of a discretion to the POF Registration Board to allow POFs to invest in excess of the 30 per cent limit in anyone business; and an increase in the limit on ownership in a POF by investors, other than banks and life offices, from 20 per cent to 30 per cent. . The objective of these changes is to encourage more long-term investment in small and medium sized enterprises. The reason for the changes is expressed in Working Nation in the following way: Past attempts to increase the provision of equity for SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) have not proved to be sufficiently effective. In particular, the Pooled Development Funds (PDFs) have not been attractive to investors. . In his second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary said: The Program has not had the anticipated impact on creating a pool of investment funds, as only $35 milIion has been raised by PDFs. This is because there is a view that the incentive available under the Program is not sufficient to compensate for the risk associated with this class of investment, and because some of the operational rules have been seen as being overly restrictive. The sentiments expressed above have also been echoed by the chairperson of the POF Registration Board. In the POF Registration Board annual report for 1992-93, the chairperson stated: In fact, the PDFs have reported great difficulty in generating investor interest given the limited incentives that the Program offers. There is no incentive for superannuation funds to invest in a PDF and there has been a general lack of enthusiasm from banks and large corporations who obviously perceive the incentives to be insufficient. I would just like to make a few comments on this last point. Whilst everyone accepts that POFs could certainly have done better over the years, I think it is wrong to see such strong language being used to condemn them out of hand. Indeed, recently in the Senate Senator Short, in one of the few examples of dissent over this bill, used the term 'an abject failure' to describe the POFs. As I said, few people would deny thatPOFs have not been as successful as hoped, but any initiative designed to give small and medium sized enterprises a helping hand cannot in all fairness be called an abject failure. Certainly, the incentives to invest could have been greater, but I remind Senator Short that anyone can be wise in hindsight. In any case, the purpose of this bill is to offer greater incentives to invest in the POFs. I remind Senator Short and others in this place as well that anyone can be wise in hindsight, particularly from the obscurity of the opposition benches where the opposition can be assured that no-one will ever have to scrutinise its performance in government, particularly as it now seems the opposition might never make it here at all. The lack of incentive to invest in POFs is not related solely to the tax on profits. For instance, the Kelty report found that in the private sector the size and nature of the taxation benefit and the restrictions on what POFs can invest in are blamed for the lack of success. Further, it states that private investorS and money managers also complain that the taxation benefits offered are not signifiCant and that benefits are structured so that investors do not receive them until the pooled development funds begin earning money, which sometimes is five years or more after their establishment. The incentives that this bill offers inc1ude the reduction of the tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent on the profits of such funds and their investments in small and medium sized enterprises. This is sure to stimulate further activity in this sector, which is quite often rightly described as the backbone of the economy. The majority of new jobs that come about as a result of the recovery will be created in this sector,and it is hoped that the changes proposed in this bill will contribute to this. For example, the raising of the limit to $50 million means that the pooled development regime may open up to companies too small to raise equity capital by way of a public float. In addition, the requirement that pooled development funds invest no more than a total of five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises has been abolished. This will encourage pooled developments in sunrise and other high-tech industries. In addition to this, POFs will now be ,entitled to invest up to 30 per cent of their capital in a particular investee company. Previously the maximum was only 20 per cent. This move will make the due diligence costs to POFs prior to investment more efficient. I will just cover each of the amendments briefly. Then I would like to tum to some of the specific benefits this legislation will in the community. Clause 4 will increase from $30 million to $50 million the total asset limit of companies in which a PDF may invest. Clause 7 will increase from 20 per cent to 30 per cent the proportion of raised capital that a PDF may invest in anyone business and provide the PDF Registration Board with a discretion to allow POFs to invest in excess of the 30 per cent limit. The PDF Registration Board is not to allow a PDF to invest in excess of the 30 per cent limit where satisfied that the investment is connected with a scheme or proposed scheme to which part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 applies or would apply. Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 contains the general anti-avoidance provisions of the act and applies to schemes entered into after 27 May 1981 with the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. Clause 8 provides that a PDF Registration Board approval for an investment must be given subject to a condition that, at the end a specified period, the amounts paid on the shares in the in vestee company and amounts remaining unpaid on the shares must not exceed 30 per cent of the total of shareholders' funds of the PDF and amounts remaining unpaid on the issued shares in the PDF. Failure by a PDF to comply with the above condition will attract a maximum penalty of $50,000. That is included in clause 10. Clause 13 will remove the restriction that POFs must not invest more than five pereent of their capital in start-up enterprises. 16 will increase the limit on the level of investor ownership in a PDF by other than banks and life offices from 20 per cent to 30 per cent. Clause 17 will increase from 50 per cent to 65 per cent the level of a PDF's funds that must be invested in investee companies within a prescribed period of five years. There can be little doubt that these changes will lead to more and more money being invested in small and medium sized enterprises from POFs, and the particular benefits to flow from this to regional areas will be substantial and certainly needs as much encouragement as possible. Speaking as the have representative of a regional electorate, and coming from the banking and finance sector, I can vouch for the fact that raising equity and start-up capital is much more difficult for a regional enterprise than it is for a major metropolitan one. The reason for this is obvious, that is there is a limit to the level of debt that any enterprise can bear. But the profit margin for regional enterprises, isolated as they often are from large consumer populations, tends to be much slimmer in the majority of cases, making access to equity capital all the more important for them. POFs have been made more adaptable to regional areas in order to address this problem. Still on the regional front, one of the most attractive characteristics of POFs is that they allow individuals to invest in the region they actually live and work in, which is very important. They also tend to be better focused on the needs of smaller communities than the large financial institutions, and their smaller size and regional emphasis makes it easier for of regional development organisations to develop and sustain projects suitable to the needs of regional areas. In my own electorate I have a very effective regional development corporation, the Ipswich Regional Development Corporation, which I hope will pick up the initiatives that are proposed for the PO Fs and also the new amendments being moved here today. I think they are going to be important for stimulating small business. As I said, in those regional areas we do have a lot of small businesses that need this sort of assistance, which unforClause tunately is not provided by our banking community who seem to think it is best to help large businesses rather than small businesses. I think our small businesses do face a lot of difficulties in that area. I was speaking to my father last night and he made the point-it must have been reported in the Queensland Courier-Mail-that a business person went down to his local bank to borrow just $5,000 and could not get it because of all the bank requirements. So he sent one of his employees down to borrow the same amount of money to buy a car and the employee received the money without any great problem whatsoever.. More assistance was given to an individual to buy a motor car than was given to a smal1 business to give it a bit of extra working capita1. It seems strange to me that banks would operate in such a way and be prepared to lend for a motor vehicle rather than to assist people to expand or promote their businesses. I think the amendment biH before us wiH 'help some small businesses through the PDFs where the banks do not provide that sort of assistance. In talking about the regional development structures, I mention that such a project is currently under consideration in my electorate with the City of Ipswich. The City of Ipswich Council is actually developing a whole new range of innovative ideas in the high-tech area with the development of a new library. It is also getting into information technology with an information technology centre. Part of this project involves the opment of a global information links centre, which I have mentioned before in this place. I had the opportunity of having officers from the council here earlier in the year to speak the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). This centre wiH be for information networks and it will link governments, universities, schools and industries, not only throughout south'-east Queensland but also throughout Australia and some parts of the world. This means that the Ipswich region in particular, its businesses and students, will benefit from a very innovative information sharing facility allowing them to fully exploit the enormous range of resources available on the information highway. The project has already received significant interest from the government as a result of the delegation I mentioned before to the minister for communications. As things stand at the moment, financing of the project is still uncertain, but the people involved are determined to make Infolinks a success. With their determination I am sure it will be because they are obviously very committed to the job ahead of them. Such a project would stand to benefit a great deal from the relaxation of the rules relating to PDFs before us today. Similarly, several groups have approached me with the intention of starting new industries in the electorate to take advantage of the high rates of population growth in south-east Queensland. Several of them, particularly those in the small and medium sized business sector, have complained of difficulty in raising capital through the banks. We must be aware of the vital place that regions have in Australia. If the drain away from them is to be arrested, initiatives like this must receive wider support throughout the community. Regional Australia and our regional centres are the domain of smal1 and medium sized enterprises-it is not where the big businesses are-and they must be given every encouragement and assistance possible if they are to progress and at the end of the day create much-needed employment. We cannot run the risk of underestimating the contribution that this sector makes to develexports, employment and the economy in general. The PDF program is one element of a range of measures designed to assist this sector. The program is an important initiative to and, in conjunction with the superannuation funds being permitted to invest a smal1 portion of their money in the future, the small and medium sized enterprises of this nation wiH look forward to a promising future. I think this applies to the superannuation area as well. The Treasurer spoke earlier today about the changes to that area, which do not necessarily reflect here but are certainly going to give much more confidence to our superannuation area. I am very pleased to have the opportunity of supporting the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994 before us today because I really do think PDFs need to be encouraged. That is what needs to be done all members of this House and by the ness community in particular. I am hopeful that these amendments can enhance the future of the pooled development funds and make them extremely successful in the future.",75
117,Mr VAILE,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"It was interesting to listen to the comments the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). At least there is one government member who recognises some of the problems small businesses face when they are attemptthis ing to get venture capital equity finance from the commercial banking world. I think we would all be cognisant of fact that the banks these days are more intercomes ested in lending-the honourable member for Oxley alluded to this-into areas where there is higher gain for the banks. There is a great question there as to what government should do and what level of government incentive, involvement and intervention there should be in making sure there is a provision for equate finance for small business. I do not think anybody in this place would disagree with the fact th,at it really is going be small business and small business investges ment that pulls this country out of the mire is in at the moment. We can talk all we like about big business, we can keep on visiting and having lunches with the big end of but it is going to be the small end of town, small business in this country, that is going to pull this nation out of the mire it is in now. The opposition is not opposing the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994, but I think it behoves all of those on this side of the House to make the comment that it about time, or it is a little late, and it is another bandaid measure that the government is applying. This bill before us today is result of another botched government initiathe tive which it is now having to apply bandaids to in order to salvage some sort of workable agreement between government and business. It The Pooled Development Funds Amendstart ment Bill 1994 is just one more of the out-ofavoid touch One Nation ideas that have fallen in heap. It is well documented that the pooled development funds idea has been a flop until now with only $35 million having been raised by since its introduction in 1992. Members on busithe government benches would be in full agreement that this is far below expectations of the time and is far below what the government's rhetoric at the time was projecting. Now, only two years later, the government is having to apply bandaids on the run made by to try to get it right. In my short time in parliament, I have been astounded by the amount of government legislation that is first of all rushed through place only to come back a short time later in desperate need of amendment. It would be an interesting study for someone to look into the how much of this government's legislation back for amendment, due simply to a lack of research in the marketplace. Without being able to place a figure on this, I am sure the increased administrative costs that this irresponsible approach to government places on the public purse would be significant. Before the House today we have the Pooled adDevelopment Funds Amendment Bill 1994. This is a follow-on from the Pooled Development Funds Bill 1992, which has shown itself to to be ineffective in bringing about the chanit sought. The amendments being made it will hopefully increase the use of the pooled development funds in Australia and in particular I am pleased to see an easing of the town, restrictions for start-up business. Let us make no mistake: the idea of pooled development funds is a good idea. The problem, however, is that it is a good idea in bad hands. There are so many constraints on business, such as the endless red tape and restrictions and the dodgy industrial relations is laws, that any business investor must also but consider. We must therefore consider PDFs in the context of the whole business environas a ment. That picture has many problems. Over 11 years that this gqvernment has had its hands on the levers of government, it has created only one thing in the business world. has created not one job, it has 1;.'Iot helped up business, it has not helped business bankruptcy and it has not helped busia ness investment. It has helped create only one thing in its 11 years in government: it has helped create apathy within the business community, particularly the small business community. A program such as the pooled development funds program, if implemented properly and if given the proper flexibility that it deserves, would be well received, particularly on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, which I represent. Small and medium sized businesses are the lifeblood of my electorate and recent statistics showed that 80 per cent of businesses on the north coast employ six people or fewer. Many businesses on the north coast are also family owned and operated. POFs should be directed towards these people. If allowed to operate properly, they would be well received in my electorate of Lyne on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. There are many businesses on the mid-north coast that are having their potential for growth stifled by this government in areas such as industrial relations, the unfair al provisions within the industrial relations legislation and excessive taxation such as the superannuation guarantee levy, which we have seen the introduction of an amendment to streamline. But again that is a bandaid approach after the event, after it has caused a of heartache, a lot of concern and, I might add, after it has cost the opportunity of a lot of jobs. Another area is the fringe benefits tax. These are all significant impediments to business and to employment on the mid-north coast of New South Wales and, indeed, in small business right across Australia. These are all also artificial impediments to growth that have been created by this government's seeming fear of anyone succeeding in business in the current Australian political climate. The potential for growth by small to medium sized firms i,s influenced enormously by this government's red tape and heavyhanded approach to business. Under this government's influence, business currently has no ability whatsoever to fund investment. As we heard from the honourable member for Oxley, it does not matter what size expansion or investment businesses are looking for; they have a great deal of trouble finding sympathetic ears in the commercial banking world. They fear any expansion in production capacity, and they are hampered in their efforts to try to enter new markets. Under this government, equity capital has been sorely lacking. In 1992, as Minister for Science and Technology, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) said: Suitable development capital is often unavailable because suppliers of capital are risk averse and often have a short-term investment outlook; they do not have access to the same range of sources of capital as do larger firms, particularly as there is no reliable and easily accessible market for trading equity in small businesses. How are the amendments being put forward today going to change the trend that has already been established with regard to POFs? It is still a mediumto long-term investment prospect, which small business investors have been proven to be very shy about. It does nothing to remove the greatest impediment to dismissbusiness and employment; that is, this government's archaic and chaotic industrial relations laws and this government's tax and spend approach to the Australian economy. I can see that the government has at least lot recognised the problems facing POFs and also facing small business investment in Australia today. As I have said before, POFs are a good idea; they are just in the wrong hands. This government is going about the development ofPOFs in totally the wrong way. In 1992, in his second reading speech, the minister talked about government controls in the POF program. He said: The government is aware that this program will not meet all of the needs for channelling capital to small and medium sized firms. In setting up the program, the Government was mindful of the need to contain costs, yet make it sufficiently attractive to ensure its viability. The general tone behind these statements definitely has the carrot and the stick the wrong way around. This is the whole problem with this government's attitude towards business in Australia. Instead of encouraging investment by putting in place flexible and workable incentives, it is too busy worrying about the possible pitfalls and putting up barriers and disincentives. No sober investors will want to deal with a government that will not help them get value for money from their invested dollar. Therefore, the philosophy of this government needs to dramatically change. This government must start looking at the big picture that it has created for small and medium sized business-it must start looking at the entire·business environment that it has created-if it is going to truly understand why its pooled development funds are not being used. As far as the specifics of this legislation are concerned, I am pleased to see a relaxing of the many restrictions facing POPs. As I said earlier, POPs are a good idea. I think the government should be doing more with them. At last, with this bandaid measure-many months after their initial introduction-we are seeing some positive changes, such as the reduction in the concessional tax rate for POPs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for income derived from investments in small and medium sized enterprises; an increase from $30 milliQ.ll to $50 million in the total asset limit of companies in which a POP may invest; and the removal of the restriction that POPs may not invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises. This is terribly important. It is at least showing a glimmer of common sense toward the end of the market to which it should be directing this program. I am also pleased to see an increase from 20 to 30 per cent in the proportion of raised capital that a POP may invest in anyone business; the grariting of a discretion to the POP registration board to allow POPs to invest in excess of the 30 per cent limit in any one business; and an increase in the limit on ownership in a POP by investors, other than banks and life offices, from 20 to 30 per cent. I welcome the government's attempts, in this case, to encourage more 10ng-term investment in small and medium sized enterprises. The stated reason for the above changes. is: Past attempts to increase the provision of equity for small and medium sized enterprises has not proved to be sufficiently effective. In particular, the development funds have not been attractive to investors. The program has not had the anticipated impact on creating a pool of investment funds as only $35 million has been raised by PDF's; This is because there is a view that the incentive available under the program is not sufficient to compensate for the risk associated with this class of investment, and because some of the operational rules have been seen as being overly restrictive. I reiterate what I said earlier: if the government had taken more time and consulted more broadly on this issue earlier in the piece, it would have had that feedback, particularly from the small business community, as to what it was looking for, what abilities it had in raising finance and how it would have seen this being better structured, rather than having to run an amendment back through the parliament at this late stage, trying to help out those small, medium and large enterprises. These are the obvious problems with small business generally. I worry that the changes to the POPs will do nothing to improve conditions. Instead, it will take substantial change in areas such as taxation and industrial relations to see real business investment return to the Australian economy. At the moment, small business is overregulated, overtaxed, underfinanced and under-resourced. Until the government is prepared to face up to these problems-particularly in the small business sector; that is, companies, firms and businesses that employ less than 100 peopleI do not believe, and a lot of commentators around Australiado not accept the fact, that the government will see the business investment that it needs for the required growth to meet the projections, as far as budget deficits and all the rest of the economic indicators are concerned, from the budget statement in May. Until the government is prepared to accept the fact that, particularly for small businesses, it will have to go further than it has been prepared to go in these measures-I restate that we accept and endorse these moves, although they are a bit late-and provide more incentives for and better understanding of the problems faced by small business in this country, we will riot see 14112 per cent business investment. The big end of town might provide it one pooled year but will not provide it year after year. Small business-be it commercial, retail or farming operations-is what will provide that investment year after year. The government must be prepared to acknowledge this and to accept the fact that until it provides those sorts of incentives for that sort of investment we will not see that growth and we will not see small business generate the employment levels that we know it is capable of and that will do something positive in a long-term way about the unemployment we have in this country. The challenge is before the government. It is not just being made by the opposition; being made by small business groups and by a lot of commentators around this country. Until the government focuses on that area of our economy, we will not make any major move forward, as has been promised many times by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), with regard to getting a stronger economic base in this country, with better growth, better employment and better investment. I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mi' Lindsay), who is at the table: just rememit ber, you have to address the fact that small business is overregulated, overtaxed, underfinanced and under-resourced. When you address those issues in a positive manner, as far as incentives are concerned, this country will start to go ahead and you will start generating more employment.",79
118,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"I support the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994. The amendments proposed to the Pooled. Development Funds Act are part of the government's Working Nation statement which was released recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Before dealing with the detail of the proposed measures before the House, I think it is worthwhile again drawing to the House's attention the philosophy behind the Working Nation statement. . The Working Nation statement encapsulated the philosophy of growth plus; namely, that to maximise employment and make a concerted attack on our most pressing social and economic problem-long-term unemployment-we had to do two things: maximise growth' in the economy and also take special measures to ensure that long-term unemployed people were picked up in the labour force. The special measures relate essentially to matters such as the job compact. This measure is one which maximises growth. It is worthwhile to put this in the context of some of the other measures. In the Working Nation statement, there are some real incentives for growth and business. There is increased access to capital for business-particularly small business-and this is one of the measit is ures that reflects that. We also have the suspension of the training guarantee levy, a training wage for juniors and adults, reform of the CES, private competition for the CES, a more effective government purchasing policy and the benefits that that will bring to Australian industry, and increased access to research and development tax concessions, particularly for small business. They are some of the measures reflected in the philosophy of the Working Nation statement. In terms of the overall economic parameters into which the Working Nation statement fell, is worth making the point that this particular measure is in a sense an incentive to business to invest. In this financial year, we effectively have $3 billion worth of measures as incentives to business. They range through the accelerated depreciation measures, the developmental allowance, the general investment allowance, the 150 per cent research and development concession, and the reduction of the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. I point out to the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) that this reduction of the company tax rate occurred at precisely the time when those opposite were suggesting that it be jacked up from 30 per cent to 45 per cent, and that people also be whacked with a 15 per cent GST. In addition to those measures, we have the pooled development funds measure, which is before us today, and the infrastructure bonds measure. They are the range of incentives for investment. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has at the dispatch box on 'a number of occasions recently made the point that these are the best economic circumstances we have seen in the last 20 or 30 years. There is low inflation, low inflationary expectations and, despite the best efforts of the opposition to increase them, low interest rates. Business confidence and consumer confidence are at all-time highs, productivity has massively increased over the decade, labour costs in real terms have reduced, the profit share is effectively at an time high, our international competitiveness has increased tenfold over the last decade and, despite the best efforts of the Victorian state government, there is now the lowest level of industrial disputation in over 30 or 40 years. The combined effect of those measures has seen a massive increase in our export capacity, particularly in elaborately transformed and other manufactures. All this has culminated in growth in the economy. We saw this in the last set of national account figures, which indicated five per cent growth in the economy, which those opposite did their best to deride and distance themselves from. That is the context into which this particular measure falls. The history of this measure is basically found in the One Nation statement, which was the first major economic statement the Prime Minister presented to this House in his capacity as Prime Minister. Page 75 of the One Nation statement shows the philosophy behind the introduction of the pooled development funds measure at that time. The One Nation statement said: The Government has been concerned for some time about the difficulty smalI and medium sized enterprises can experience in obtaining equity capital. This concern was reinforced during the Ministerial discussions with industry. It is worth making the point, as an aside, that industry consultations over One Nation were held at precisely the time the former Leader of the Opposition and the now shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), was basically saying to industry, 'We have adopted a policy of zero tariffs. We don't want to hear your views. We don't want to listen to you.' He was basically shunning industry. I compliment my colleague from Western Australia the  He did a very good job in the last 12 months of repairing those relations with industry, basically going around to industry and blowing in their ear saying, 'Our industry policy will be precisely that industry policy which the government l}as.' I think the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) made a fundamental mistake in bringing his predecessor into the industry portfolio. I am sure that industry leaders in Australia will rue the day that allappointment was made. But I am digressing. The One Nation statement went on to say: The availability of equity capital can be a critical element for the success of small and medium sized firms. Small firms, however, often have difficulty in obtaining this form of finance because they do not have access to the same range of sources of capital as larger firms, particularly as there is no reliable and easily accessible market for trading equity in small businesses, such as the Stock Exchange That was our attempt in 1992 to improve the capacity of small and medium sized businesses to have access to equity capital. It is no secret that that effort was not successful. That is acknowledged and is the reason for the changes now before the House. The government's Working Nation statement which was introduced into this House a couple of months ago has this to say, again on page 75, in respect of pooled development funds: Australia has a well developed equity market for large firms, but lacks similar mechanisms for SMEs. Past attempts to increase the provision for equity SMEs have not proved to be sufficiently effective. In particular, the Pooled Development Funds (PDFs) have not been attractive to investors. In order to encourage increased investment in the equity market for smaller firms: the concessional tax rate for PDFs will be reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for income derived from investments in SMEs. Income derived from non-SME investments in financilll assets by PDFs will continue to be taxed at 25 per cent, and the restrictions under which PDFs operate will be eased. They are the improvements which this particular measure puts before the House. It is worthwhile outlining the measures taken to ease the restrictions contained in the original PDF measures. The particular measure to reduce the concessional tax rate for PDFs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent will occur through separate legislation to be introduced by the Treasurer, and that has been flagged in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). The key measures this bill will implement are as follows: * an increase from $30 million to $50 million in the total asset limit of companies in which a PDF may invest; * the removal of the restriction that PDFs may not invest more than 5% of their capital in start-up enterprises; * an increase from 20% to 30% in the proportion of raised capital that a PDF may invest. in any one business; .* the granting of a discretion to the PDF Registratraining tion Board to allow PDFs to invest in excess of the 30% limit in anyone business; and * an increase in the limit on ownership in a PDF by investors, other than banks and life offices, from 20% to 30%. It is interesting to see how this and the other measures contained in the Working Nation statement have been received by those who really matter; namely, the relevant industries. Let us have a look at what some of the relevant industry players have had to say. Under the heading 'Business Council welcomes white paper on employment and growth', the Business Council of Australia in the Business Council Bulletin of May 1994 had this to say: The Business Council of Australia welcomes the White Paper, and particularly its statement that sustained economic growth is the key to more jobs. Speaking on behalf of the Business Council, the Chairman of its Human Resources·Panel, Mr Ivan Deveson, said that the White Paper was a positive initiative towards addressing the problem. It goes on to say: There are a number of other issues in the White Paper that deserve applause, such as: introduction of competition for the CES; suspension of the Training Guarantee Levy; reduction in the tax rate for pooled development funds; modification of the treatment of infrastructure ronds; the concept of Ausindustry as an one-stop shop. There is an indication that these particular measures have support in industry, which is where it really matters. That is reflected by the Retailers Council of Australia, which released a statement on 4 May-the date of the industry statement. It said: The Retailers Council of Australia ... has welcomed the Prime Minister'S White Paper on Employment, Industry and Regional Development as a significant step in the direction of restoring confidence in the future of the Australian economy. The next point made in the statement is particularly relevant to the measures before us: As the largest group in the small business sector, retailers welcome the initiatives which will improve their capacity to survive in an·increasingly competitive and difficult environment, including the SME and capital access arrangements. This group has the greatest potential to soak up some of the nation's surpl us labour, and to the extent that it does i- collective job better, the need for more staff will increase. The retailers make the precise point about the improved capital access arrangements. That is reflected in the statement made by Bert Evans of the MTIA, also on 4 May. Mr Evans said: MTIA regards the Government's White Paper, ""Working Nation"", as a constructive contribution to public policy, one which provides new directions for industry policy while genuinely attempting to address unemployment. So the specific measures introduced by the Working Nation statement are welcomed by the MTIA. Although in his 5 May article in the Age Stephen Bartholomeusz had some harsh things to say about the original pooled development funds program, I think he made some pertinent points when he said: Of the specific policy changes, there have been some welcome changes to the infrastructure bond and pooled development fund programs, a sensible first step in providing incentives for foreign companies to use Australia as their regional headquarters, the abolition of most of the developing country preferences, some assurances on tariff levels and a host of low-key support programs. He goes on: The previous infrastructure bond and pooled development fund .programs were spectacularly unsuccessful because the guidelines which governed . them were focused entirely on minimising revenue leakage rather than promoting infrastructure development or the provision of development capital. In adopting the recommendation of the Kelty report, the Government will expand the range of qualifying sectors for infrastructure ronds and loosen the restrictiveness of the PDF regime while also altering the tax structures to make them more attractive to more investors. Whilst not necessarily agreeing with the notion that the programs were 'spectacularly unsuccessful because the guidelines which governed them were focused entirely on minimising revenue leakage', I think Mr Bartholomeusz has put his finger right on the key points: the expansion of the range of qualifying sectors for infrastructure bonds and the loosening of the restrictiveness of the PDF regime while also altering the tax structures to make them more attractive to more investors. This measure is part of a $3 billion package of measures to ensure that we have effective incentives for investment, that we maximise growth in the economy and that long-term unemployed people are picked up in the course of the recovery. Many of these changes have to do with ensuring that small and medium size enterprises, particularly those which are exporting or are emerging exporters, have an opportunity to access capital and to develop their manufactured products. I draw the House's attention to Peter Roberts's Best Practice column in the Australian Financial Review of 22 June 1994, because it gives a pat on the back to my own state, Western Australia. The article is headed 'WA gets the export smarts', and Mr Roberts makes the following points: When I lived in Perth more than 15 years ago, the idea that Western Australia could be anything more than an exporter of raw materials was laughable. But since then the State has broadened its base at the same time as boosting its international market share in core resources markets. Since 1983-84, manufactured exports have grown by an average 23.3 per cent a year. Manufactured exports, a mere $201 million in 1983-84, grew in nine years to reach $1,323.7 million in 1992-93. Overseas sales of elaborately transformed manufactures ... products with the highest valueadded, have been growing even faster at a rate of 37.3 per cent a year. ETM exports, only $48.5 million a decade ago, reached $840.4 million in 1992-93. Those changes are a direct result of the changes that this government has made to the structure of the Australian economy, making sure that we are internationallycompetitive and that small and medium size companies have the capacity to access export markets. I often smile in wry amusement when I hear the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Richard Court, say that Commonwealth-state revenues ought to be increased in favour of Western Australia because Western Australia is the great export state. Western AUstralia is a great export state as a direct result of the policies of the federal government. It has absolutely nothing to do with Richard Court or the Liberal Party, either the WA branch or the federal branch. It is always well worth drawing attention to what those on the other side stand for in the area of industry policy. I have made the point that my colleague from Western Australia the honourable member for Forrest did a good job after the last election in going around telling members of industry that the opposition's industry policy was exactly the same as ours. Let us see what the opposition actually stands for. Mr Reith-That is hardly the case. You shouldn't misrepresent people.",82
119,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"I would not dream of misrepresenting the honourable member for Forrest. To ensure that those opposite are well aware Of what the Liberal Party has had to say about industry policy, I will read the relevant comments into the record. I refer the House to comments made export by the President of the Liberal Party, as reported in the Australian Financial Review on 5 January 1994, under the heading 'Lib president rejects economic rationalism'. That was taken at the time to be a direct rebuff of the opposition's policies. The President of the Liberal Party-who we know is a firm believer in intervention; he believes in intervening in industry and in the federal parliamentary Liberal Party-was reported at the time as saying: To be blunt, we would not be seeing the present growth in manufactured exports if the Federal Government had butted out of its responsibility for the development of industry policies. Industries in which this is evident are the car industry, computer exports, exports of hardware and systems in the telecommunications area and the chemical industry."" None of these things could have happened if we'd just 'left it to the market'. That is the key point. Those on the other side want to leave things to the market. That is why measures that we have introduced, such as pooled development funds, investment allowances, depreciation allowances, all the great incentives for investment, all the great changes to ensure that our small and medium size companies can access the export market, will only be begrudgingly supported by those opposite. They say that they support those measures, but after the delivery of the One Nation statement they opposed the measures. I have referred to the 5 January comments of the President of the Liberal Party. He is reported in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 January by Bernard Lagan as follows: . Mr Staley surprised many Liberals on Tuesday when he said at the Young Liberals' Sydney conference that he supported much of the Government's industry policy and caJled for his own party, to adopt similar policies. In the same article the.honourable member for Forrest, the then shadow spokesman for industry, was reported as saying: I think what Tony Staley was saying was that Government had been 'you beaut' in industry policy ... That is the key point. I think the coup de grace was in a Canberra Times article of the same period, where Mr Staley was reported as follows: He said the present growth in manufactured exports would not have happened if the Federal Government had not accepted responsibility for development of industry policy in areas computers, telecommunications and the chemical industry. There was a need for government to encourage industry in research, development, innovation and exporting. That is precisely what the industry policy part of Working Nation has done and is precisely what this measure reflects. The ongoing program of this government is to ensure that Australia is internationally competitive. Unlike those opposite, we do not believe Australia is a country reliant upon raw materials and commodity prices. This program will ensure that we become a modern industrial manufacturing country trading in our region and doing the things that we need to do to ensure we have long-term, secure, stable jobs. That can only be achieved by the measures, policies and philosophies that we on this side of the chamber have adopted for the last 10 years. It will never be achieved by the sorts of measures that many of those opposite, including the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who is present in the chamber, want to introduce. He is still intellectually handcuffed to Fightback and to the 'let's leave it to the market' view. He is saying, 'We are not here to intervene; greed is good; the winner takes all; there will be no intervention from the opposition side.' But on the government side, we have appropriate regimes in place to provide incentives for investment to ensure that our country becomes a modern industrial trading nation, with our small and medium size enterprises trading well in our region. This measure will help ensure that occurs.",85
120,Mr CUNNINGHAM,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"I rise to support the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994, which gives effect to the changes to pooled developthe ment funds announced in the February 1992 One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The major amendments of the bill will increase the total asset limit of companies in which a pooled development fund may invest, remove the restriction that pooled development funds may not invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises and increase the level of pooled development funds which must be like cars, invested in. investee companies. The Pooled Development Fund Act 1992the principal act-gave effect to initiatives announced in the Prime Minister's February 1992 One Nation statement. The principal act had two objectives: first, to establish a scheme under which companies and their shareholders can qualify for certain tax concessions; and, second, to encourage the provision of funds to small and medium sized Australian companies. There would not be too many members of this House who would not have been approached over and again by small companies in their electorates saying that obtaining equity funding is a ·great difficulty for them. Under the principal act, eligible corporamedium tions may be registered as pooled developthese ment funds to provide funds to corporations with assets not exceeding $30 million. To qualify as a PDP a company has to comply with a number of criteria, including that it incorporated, and that it will implement capital raising plan and an investment plan. The principal act requires a PDP to believe that money it invests in a cQmpany will used solely or principally for one or more the following: establishing an eligible busireplacement ness; substantially expanding the production or supply capacity of an established eligible business; substantially expanding existing markets, or developing substantial new markets for goods and services supplied by an established eligible business. POPs receive concessional tax treatment and that is very important if they are going to succeed. qualify for a concessional tax rate of 25 cent. Gains on the disposal of PDP shares are exempt from tax, as are unfranked dividends paid by a PDP and franked dividends unless the shareholder elects that they are to be taxed as dividends paid by an ordinary comfrom pany. The stated purpose of this bill is to give effect to changes to operational rules applying to POPs announced in the Working Nation statement. The changes announced in the statement were: a reduction in the concessional tax rate for POPs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for income derived from investments in small and medium sized enterprises; an increase from $30 million to $50 million in the total asset limit of companies in which a PDP may invest; the removal of the restriction that a PDP may invest more than five per cent of its capital start up enterprises; an increase from 20 per cent in the proportion of raised capital that a PDP may invest in anyone business; the granting of a discretion to the PDP Regisstrong tration Board to allow POPs to invest in excess of the 30 per cent limit in anyone business; and an increase in the limit on The ownership in a PDP by investors other than . banks and life offices from 20 to 30 per cent. The objective of the changes is to encourage more long-term investment in small and sized enterprises. The reason for changes is that past attempts to increase the provision of equity for small business enterprises have not proved to be sufficiently effective. The pooled development funds have be not attracted sufficient funds from investors. a These measures are extremely important to encourage equity investment in small business. I now turn to some other matters which I be think are equally important to developing of Australia's future export potential, import potential and the creation of the jobs that everyone is so keen to see occur. Mr Reith-I hope you are relevant.",86
121,Mr CUNNINGHAM,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,I will be very relevant. I want to refer to the Kelty report on regional development. There are several recommendations in the Kelty report which I POPs want to touch on. One of the recommendaper tions related to empowering the regions. Many of the areas we represent are areas that in the past have not required a great deal of input on economics from the community at large. The electorate of MCMillan was based the 1920s upon the public sector generating electricity-the powerhouse of Victoria and the powerhouse of manufacturing in Australia. This area has gone through enormous restructuring and change and. it is having great trouble coming to grips with the necessity for change because of the enormity of the changes being imposed and the speed with which those changes are being imposed by the Kennett government in Victoria. Mr Reith-You can thank Joan Kirner for that.,87
122,Mr CUNNINGHAM,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"I am not one of not those politicians who stand up and try to in blame one side or the other. When an area is to 30 going through structural change, the community needs to be involved; otherwise it will not happen. I want to talk about one of the recommendations in the Kelty report relating to empowering the regions. In that report the task force recommended: federal government, in consultation with the state governments, should establish a program to provide financial assistance for Regional Economic Development Organisations (REOOs). This funding should come from within existing programs. The following criteria should be adopted for funding of a REDO: (a) The REDO must be genuinely representative of the people in the region. (b) The three spheres· of government should be represented on it. (c) It should represent a range of interests community, must involve local business; and not be dominated by any political party. (d) Local government representations should reflect the regional cooperation of councils-. The role of the REDO could include the following: (a) Financial initiatives, for example, attracting investment via a Regional Pooled Development Fund. (b) Networking of local business and other players relevant to economic development. (c) Promoting the region. (d) As an applicant for existing government funds and programs which should be tailored to regional circumstances, for example, DEET (labour market programs), DITARD (business support programs), DOT (tourism grants) and DPIE (assistance for agricultural processing and value adding). (e) Integrated regional strategic planning for economic development. (f) Providing guidance to companies seeking quality assurance accreditation. An of those things are possible today, but they are not going to come from government. They are going to come from the people within the region. It is not this government's intention to impose any of these initiatives on the people. The people will need to respond. I bring to the attention of the House an ! initiative that has commenced in the Gipps. land region and has the bipartisan support of the National Party and the Labor Party in the area. The vice-chancellor of the regional university has agreed to become the catalyst and chairperson of the group which is working now towards establishing a very efficient REDO in the Gippsland region. We are doing this because we have hit rock bottom as far as employment opportunities in the public sector are concerned. The SEC has gone from having 10,300 employees three years ago to something like :3,500 employees as of last week. I suggest that by the end of this week it will be 3,000, with another 500 taking redundancy packages. The amount of money coming into the Latrobe Valley and the Gippsland region via employees of the Victorian Electricity Commission has been reduced by $80 million. Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, I am sure that you would be well aware of the impact of this. I in the believe that in your former days in the Victorian state parliament you chaired the committee that made many of these recommendations. I will be working closely with my local community. I am very pleased to say that the support across political lines to get this established has been good. Within a week we will have in place the first group which will be looking at what sort of bureaucracy we will have in our region with all the changes that are taking place in Victoria. We are in the process of seeing dramatic changes in local government. We will have completely new bureaucratic structures. We have had organisations such as VECCI and ACM which, in the past, have been able to sit back placidly with one officer working in the region and not really having to take an active role in regional and economic development. We expect that organisations representing business will play a much greater role. We see local government playing a greater role and we also see industry playing a greater role in the development of REDO. It is a very complicated matter. We have established a regional organisation called the La Trobe Regional Commission. It has been established under state government legislation. We understand from the present Premier of Victoria that that organisation has a very short life. It is the only such organisation left in Victoria. We are keen to replace it with what we believe will be a better structure for the future. We are hoping that our REDO will be a small unit which will generate activities in the community. Those organisations which are presently in place and which are being restructured will have within them development organisation structures which will be able to call upon the resources of local people who really know what is going on in the area. If measures of national importance come to the fore, we want to present them to state and federal governments in a professional manner and have. all the appropriate paperwork done so that our arguments are listened to. We have an opportunity in the Latrobe Valley to develop briquettes from coal. The old state briquette factory has now been revamped and is known as Energy Brix. Those organisations have now been restructured and have industrial agreements which are modern and very effective. They are poised to take advantage of opportunities in markets overseas and to become large exporters. Coupled with that, we have a timber industry which is now expanding with massive investments in dry kiln and plants. We are taking the opportunity of developing that timber industry effectively. In order to do that, we need to be able to export our· product. One of the first things that the Gippsland group will be looking at is how the product can be moved out of the Gippsland region to the ports and what investment and structure is required. We are finding very quickly that we will need to justify several areas. For instance, will be looking for funds from government and the private sector. As an area grows and becomes very active in respect of exports, some things that we probably would not think of suddenly crop up. For instance, most of our exporting will be done by containers. Our difficulty is that any container coming into Gippsland has to come through Melbourne and any container going out has to go through the same process. All customs and quarantine processes are done in Melbourne. We have no customs or quarantine facilities in our region to deal with the export of those containers. Very often we find that a container has been sitting in Melbourne for a week before it has been opened and checked. Those costs are imposed on us. We need to have in our region the capacity for customs and quarantine facilities. One of the things we are looking at is an inland· port which will handle all of those vital issues which add to the costs of exporting and which affect industry in our region. In many cases, we can talk to government about these things until we are blue in the face. We need the capacity and ability to do our own homework. This is where REDOs will become very important. In the futureand I would expect in the next 12 monthswe will be taking to government very detailed and very well thought out and costed programs which we believe no government, at state or federal level, will be able to argue against. At present, there is so much competition around Australia for the vital dollar that,· unless people do their homework properly, they will not get much of a look-in. I think our people have recognised that and the need to come together and work towards this. Pooled development funds are only one issue, but it is a very important issue. Many of our new industries, which are showing great promise in the area, need the equity investment. We are hoping that, when this legislation is passed through this House, it will encourage the investors. But the investors will not be encouraged by legislation being passed in this place. They will be encouraged more by the full knowledge of what the local we region is capable of doing, what skiIIs the local region has to put into a projectMr Reith-Labour market reforms?",87
123,Mr CUNNINGHAM,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"Labour market reforms are definitely part of that. There is no doubt about that. In the Latrobe Valley today, we have the best enterprise agreements that the nation has. There has not been a dispute in, the Latrobe Valley for a long time. The world outside may still think that the Latrobe Valley has industrial problems, but it does not. We have the most modern enterprise agreements. We can detail those enterprise agreements. That will be one of the measures that we will be using to sell to our region within the next six to eight weeks. We will detail that our companies, such as Amcor and Generation Victoria, have one of the best enterprise agreements in Australia. All of the new companies in the Latrobe Valley have the best enterprise agreements in Australia. The cooperation has to be seen to be believed. Mr Reith-You are deceiving yourself. · Mr CUNNINGHAM-We will even convince the member for Flinders that things have changed in the Latrobe Valley and the Gippsland region. We are quite capable of taking the lead in the future. But we do know that we have a job ahead of us and that we have to get out there and sell ourselves. The work has been done. It is getting the message through to the boardrooms of the world and these investors who may. be interested in puttiRg their money into these pooled development funds. They will do that when the confidence returns. The confidence will return when the member for Flinders knows the facts of life rather than going back over the old issues that the opposition keeps peddling out to the public. Australia has changed. Our region has changed. We have leadership today at all levels in our region, which I am very proud to be part of. I am one of the people in the region who is assisting to. bring us back from that dramatic restructure that has been imposed on us. We are not crying poor. We are going to put our people to work at every level we possibly can, and pooled development funds will be one of those key measures. I say again: when we generate the confidence and get the message out, the investors wjll take the opportunity to use those great resources that we have our in region, which to this point are only partly developed. It is all part of the restructure that is going on in Australia. Some areas have moved quicker than others. The crunch has come for us now. Last week I was in Queensland. I have seen what tourism is doing in that area. We do not have those opportunities. We have our own natural resources which we will be working on. That is why it is so difficult to develop a single policy in Australia and that is why it is so important for each region to look at its own resources, to develop its own skills and to put those skills to work-not to come crying to government, saying that we want this or that. The cargo cult has finished. Let us get to work as a region. Let us put it together. Australia has an enormous future. Over the next five years, we will develop jobs in bur region that people probably would not have believed possible. The opportunity is there, and we will go to work on it. I make a guarantee to the member for Flinders and to the rest of those opposite that we will be on the treasury bench after the next election to see it all carried out.",89
124,Mr LINDSAY,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (6.56 p;m.)-in reply-I would like to thank the honourable members for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) for their most constructive comments during this debate which has ranged rather widely in topic. I will make some comments about the contribution of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who made a constructive contribution. Unfortunately, he made some political remarks at the end of his contribution. He must have picked them up from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) because his comments were wrong. Nevertheless, his contribution was generally constructi ve. The member for Curtin made the comment that the tax rate for pooled development funds was reduced last year from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. That is correct. The change in the tax rate did not stem from any formal review of the pooled development fund program. Rather it stemmed from the government's decision, which was announced in the Investing in the nation statement, to reduce the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. It was then necessary to make a reduction to the tax rate applying to POFs in order to maintain a differential between the rates of tax applying to POFs in companies. He also referred to the Greenchip group, which operates two POFs. Oue to the constraints of time, I am unable to deal with some of the claims about the POFs. This is important legislation. It will succeed. It will require a tremendous effort on. the part of private industry to ensure that business understands what pooled development funds are, what their role is and how they are to be used to the benefit and enhancement of Australian industry. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a third time.",90
125,Unknown,POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS,Sitting suspended from 6.59 to 8.00 p.m. NA (SUSPENSION) BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 27 June. Second Reading,91
126,Mr FREE,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (8.00 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In the white paper on employment and industry, the government undertook to suspend the training guarantee for two years. The government believes that employers have recognised the value of training and will continue to play their role in increasing Australia's skills base. The Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill gives effect to that undertaking while allowing employers who have not met their obligations in the current year to take advantage of the carry forward provisions which were recently introduced. It also provides employers with some incentive to provide training during the two years of suspension. Those honourable members who have read the white paper will be aware that the government has also undertaken to abolish the training guarantee if employers make a credible commitment to providing the training places required by the white paper strategy. The suspension will be for the two finan,cial years 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995 and 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996. The main effect of the bill is to remove any requirement on employers to pay any training guarantee charge relating to the two years of suspension. A further provision reduces the minimum training rate from the current 1.5 per cent to 0 per cent for the two years of suspension. This second provision will have the effect that employers who elect to postpone a shortfall from the current year, 1993-94, will be able to offset the shortfall with any training expenditure they incur in the two years of suspension. Similarly, any excess in those two years may be carried over and set off against a shortfall in 1996-97. I commend the bill to the House.",91
127,Mr MILES,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I rise to support the government's Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill. The coalition is delighted that, after almost four years, the government has finally come to its senses and conceded that the training guarantee levy is not effective. I was amused in question time today to hear the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), say that he saw this as an initiative to suspend a piece of legislation. Most people recognise that this bill is an attempt by the government to gradually crawl away from legislation which it regards as not being effective, as we said would be the case right from the beginning. The coalition, along with numerous representatives from business and industry, said from the outset that the levy would not work and' in fact would be counterproductive. still Wherever I have gone in industry and business over the last three to four years, I have been told that the training guarantee levy involves a lot of red tape and excessive administration costs which business can do without, particularly during a deep recession brought on by this government, and particularly considering the other economic factors involved. The government's initial intentions, when it was anxious to improve training opportunities for Australian workers, may have been honourable. The coalition wholeheartedly supports training for workers within the various factories and industries in Australia. But devising a tax on business to force companies to meet a fairly arbitrary level of training for their employees was never honourable. The levy has been seen as unfair in its implementation. The government is responding to that unfairness, and we welcome that. The levy was applied to companies with a payroll of $200,000 and that figure was later increased to $225,000. This fails to cover the majority of Australian businesses, which are too small to fall within the net. In fact, 93 cent of businesses were excluded froID having to pay the training guarantee levy, making the bigger companies feel as though they were being penalised for being large or successful. The overwhelming majority of Australian businesses were not covered by this piece of legislation. As I said, the coalition is fully supportive of any attempts to enhance training, and we would encourage employers to undertake that training. But this piece .of legislation did not touch 93 per cent of businesses in Australia. As well as this feeling of victimisation, the eligible companies have felt resentment at the use of the big whip approach which is typical of the Labor Party. The government was running short of money because of the effects of its policies over several years. It knew that there was a need for greater training within Australian industry. So it passed the buck to industry. People in private enterprise are bitterly opposed to that approach by. the Labor Party. Instead of encouraging business by providing genuine incentives to promote real training, the Labor Party adopted the approach of forcing businesses to comply. Nothing .gets people's backs up more than the sense of being forced to comply. For this reason, on top of many others, I feel sure that the training guarantee levy is doomed to failure. In two years time, I will be very surprised if this government resurrects the training guarantee levy. The seven per cent of businesses affected by the training guarantee levy further felt that it was an injustice to them because they were spending at least two to three per cent of their payrolls on training. Some businesses, such as IBM, spent as much as 10 per cent ·of their annual payrolls on intensive staff training. This highlights the fact that when we take a broad spectrum approach to these types of matters we do not necessarily achieve the result we want. There is a great diversity of Australian businesses, with a great diversity of approaches as to how much training is required in different industries. Some require constant upgrading and training; others require very little training. In some areas, it is very hard to genuinely say that } 112 per cent per should be spent on training. I will give one or two illustrations later in my speech. There has been considerable research into the reaction of business to the training guarantee. Research undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office found that the majority of businesses felt they were spending the same or less on training since the imposition of the levy. Last year the Australian Taxation Office review into business attitudes to the levy showed, just as it did in 1991 and 1992, that all participants believed that the way in which the legislation had been executed was ill thought out and was a simplistic way of encouraging training. That is not an observation by the coalition, the Liberal Party, the National Party, or business people. It is an observation by the Australian Taxation Office. The report showed that there was a great deal of creativity in record keeping. Sometimes this was deliberate, but more often firms kept reams of record$ in order to comply if asked to produce them. It is a matter of administration that businesses seem more concerned about and burdened with. The Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry sums it up for those it represents by saying that it is not the actual training it objects to; most businesses do that anyway in order to maintain competitiveness, so it is in their interests. It is the administrative red tape that businesses most strongly object to. Anybody who has been involved in businesses will understand this. If people are running a competitive business, they know that they are going to have to upgrade their training. Employers have to be at the cutting edge of development if they are going to stay in the game. We as a country need to provide real incentives for companies to be profitable; we need to provide the framework. Those companies will then ensure that their employees are kept up to scratch with the latest initiatiVes and ideas. It takes extra time and work hours away from the main focus of business to contend with the paperwork involved in administering this levy. In effect, this hill forces companies to spend money to discover how much they are spending on training. The bill adds to industry on-costs. It is another tax on top of payroll tax, superannuation funds, workers compensation, long service leave and so on. Australian businesses cannot absorb any more overheads and they find it hard enough to remain internationally competitive with the overheads they already endure. If the government really wants to assist these companies it needs to clean away, to continue the restructuring that is so urgently needed in this country and to really grapple with the industrial relations side of this country. One result of being forced to keep a record of the costs of training, as demanded by the Australian Taxation Office, is that many businesses had not assessed the cost in this way before; they had not calculated the cost of every pen and pad and the cost of lighting and heating. Many businesses have realised that they are spending far more on training than they imagined, exceeding the 1.5 per cent required under the training guarantee, and so have determined to reduce training expenditure as a cost cutting exercise. I was talking with one person in one of the government sectors where the training guarantee levy was required and he said, 'We speRt our time making sure we had the lighting, the heating and all of that included. It really didn't go into training at all.' He had a good job out of it, but it did not change the profesand sional capacity of the people one iota-and this person got a job through the training guarantee levy legislation. In some cases the cost of record keeping has become so onerous that expenditure on training courses has had to be trimmed to cope with extra administrative costs. The training guarantee is clearly a disincentive to employment. We are a country with, until a month or so ago, one million people unemployed; yet the government maintains this impost on business. Another question that is frequently raised by business is the actual value of training. For many small businesses the most valuable training is the one-to-one kind without a formal course, which is difficult or impossible to claim under the training guarantee. There literally are hundreds of businesses and people who will tell you that it really is the hands-on, one-to-one relationship with another employee, or the employer, which gives employees the real skills. But, of course, this training does not qualify because it is not seen as structured and fitting the rules. The Australian Taxation Office's confirmation that it expected an Adelaide brothel to spend one per cent of its wages on training in 1991 absolutely highlighted the absurdity of the federal government's training guarantee levy. The only question on everyone's lips was, 'What sort of training did the ATO have in mind?' It is absurd when governments think that they can have a broad brush approach which will fix these types of issues. There is so much diversity and uniqueness out there in Australian industry that no one approach can meet the bill. In 1992 a Sydney cemetery unsuccessfully challenged the levy in the High Court when it told the government that the assessment exceeded the amount of annual training it could usefully provide to gardepers and gravediggers. Of course there is a limit to how much training a person needs to dig a grave. Yet here we have, again, a government imposing on businesses and saying, 'You have to spend this money.' Businesses In industries such as transport feel that there is only so much you can teach a truck driver that they generally employ people who are already skilled. So we see the absurdity of the training guarantee. Furthermore, there is no emphasis on the quality of training in the training guarantee, just quantity. In many instances employers have undertaken training which has fulfilled the time requisite but has been of little practical use. Training is of value only if it meets specific requirements in the industry by transmitting further skills, lifting productivity, improving safety standards and so on. There is little value in training to fill a time requirement. We had a classic case in one of the cities in my electorate with a business called Serve-ag Pty Ltd, whose main focus is on fertilisers and chemicals. Serve-ag is a highly professional company with highly qualified people, most of them are university graduaies and some of them have PhDs; yet its employees were required to undergo training. At that professional level training is mainly by attending conferences which are not necessarily structured in the way the government requires. It caused enormous hassles for that particular company, an excellent company, which spends a lot of time upgrading the professional careers of the people there and their qualifications and making sure that they are kept up-to-date with the latest in regard to chemicals, their effects and fertilisers. But, again, the company had to be put into this straitjacket by the government. It is clear that business is being required to structure its training to fit in with bureaucratic requirements rather than to target the real needs of business and employees. A further reason for suspension and, in fact, abolition of the training guarantee is that research shows that the very employees it was intended to help are the ones least likely to receive the training. We have heard much in the past from my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) about the training money mainly being directed to managers and executives who have taken advantage of the training guarantee levy to rort the system. For instance, in April last year several hundred Australian businessmen, lawyers and doctors went to Hong Kong. As it happened they were just in time for the annual rugby sevens tournament. Many were aided in their travels by the training levy. I know of courses that have been offered at a cost of $400 a day-held in luxurious conditions, presumably. The luxury camp at Eden Resort on the Gold Coast provides a corporate stress management program which, it says, is eligible expenditure. So, as I say, we find that this levy was not helpful for many people who really did need training. Clearly some businesses have grown as a sideline of this bill, but this was not the reason for its implementation. No doubt it is one of the reasons why the government is doing a U-turn, suspending the levy now and letting it drift off the agenda without telling the people that it is really going to drop this in two years time. Even if the tax office could show you did not attend a conference or training program, it would not worry; it is the expenditure on the training course that matters under the legislation. Each year some employers opt to pay the tax office 1.5 per cent of their wages bill rather than bother to provide what the tax office deems eligible training. Some choose to donate the money to training organisations. The ridiculous thing about this training guarantee is that the levy money can be donated to training organisations When they do not provide training for company employees. This can include donations not only to TAFE colleges and universities but also to charities and any other organisations which claim to provide eligible training services. About $10 million is donated to educational organisations each year, and this sum has included donations to the Guide Dog Association, the Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Spastic Society. No doubt these worthy organisations appreciate the extent of these donations, but this really was not the idea behind the training guarantee. I think that $10 million spent in that way illustrates the fact that this levy is not working in the way in which it was intended. Money spent on training or donated to educational organisations is tax deductible, but money given directly to the Taxation Office is not. Nevertheless, the amount paid to the Taxation Office increased significantly last year. In 1991, the figure was $1.39 million, but last year it increased to about $3 million. One can only assume from this that a growing number of honest employers are fed up with trying to meet what they believe are unnecessary training requirements. When the government set up the levy, it promised that the money paid directly to the Taxation Office would go back to the states. But, again, like a lot of other promises of this government, it has not occurred. Plenty of state governments at this stage, their funds having been cut consistently in real terms by this government-the federal government maintains a growth in real terms in its funding-would certainly appreciate having all or some of that $3 million. But, so far, all the money collected has been used by the Commonwealth to administer the levy. Mr Sawford-That's $4 for each company.",91
128,Mr MILES,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The fact is that the government promised to return it, but it did not do it. That is the situation with regard to the government's approach to Australians on many matters. Many Australians-certainly the business people and state governments in this area-are getting sick and tired of the Uturns and backtracking on promises by this federal government. The Australian Taxation Office's most recent review could not determine the effect of the levy. This levy is held up as doing all sorts of things for Australian training. But it is pretty outrageous that the Australian Taxation Office could not determine what the effect of the levy has been. It is no wonder that the government is doing a U-turn and just letting it slide off the agenda. There is little or no evidence that the training guarantee levy has significantly changed employers' attitudes towards training or their spending on it. Mr Sawford-Wrong.",95
129,Mr MILES,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"There is very little evidence that that has changed. It is only right that at this time the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 should be suspended for at least two years. Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that there is not a quorum in the House. (Quorum formed)",95
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Before calling the honourable member for Braddon to conclude his remarks, I want to say that I understand the difficulties he confronted. After calling the quorum, he unfortunately left the chamber, which is against standing order 47. In future, I warn him that that action will be considered grossly disorderly.",95
131,Mr MILES,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for that advice. While we support this bill, we also believe it is time that the governunskilled ment repealed this legislation. I therefore move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to abandon its training guarantee levy policy and to introduce legislation to repeal the provisions"". As I said, we support this legislation. Businesses and industries around Australia and the federal coalition will not be happy until it is abolished altogether.",95
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr Andrews--Having now been made aware of the amendment which my learned colleague has moved, I have much delight in seconding it and reserving my right to speak.",95
133,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill 1994, which is currently before the House, is part of the major initiatives contained in the government's Working Nation, the white paper on employment and growth. This is the most important employment policy document released by any Australian government since World War II. It represents a watershed in the way that we as a nation deal with the sad and dire problems caused by unemployment, particularly for those people unemployed over extended periods of time and those at risk of being long-term unemployed. Chronic and endemic long-term unemployment creates a permanent underclass in our society. Much of the reason for long-term unemployment can be attributed to changes in industry needs and the consequent impact on its work force. Our industries are increasingly becoming export driven and market competitive. That in itself has produced far reaching changes for both employers and employees. 'Best practice', 'enterprise bargaining', 'multiskilling' and 'total quality management' are terms now'synonymous with industry. Changes in technology, computerisation and production processes, in addition to increased worker productivity, have all taken their toll on reducing labour needs, particularly in the category. It is becoming increasingly difficult for those without skills to land themselves a job. It is even more difficult for middle aged people working in unskilled jobs who find themselves retrenched. A simple analysis of the long-term unem. ployed will predominantly show a background of low educational achievement with few vocational skills or qualifications. Menial labouring jobs are now few and far between and much more difficult to obtain. The white paper initiatives will not only address the problems of unemployment but also have a positive social effect. High levels of unemployment are not just unique to Australia. As I said before, unemployment is chronic and endemic, affecting the world's economies. It is now spreading rapidly to those former Eastern bloc countries. Australia is, without question, faring much better than most DECO countries. We have an unemployment rate that is better than most, although it is still unacceptably high. But we have an employment participation rate among the highest of all countries. The participation rate has been steadily increasing for the past decade. On top of this, Australia has an important safety net for fellow Australians who unfortunately find themselves unemployed. It is a safety net which the opposition, without hesitation, would remove totally to expose those individuals to the prospects of absolute poverty and disadvantage. If meeting the opposition's political objectives is at the expense of sacrificing the social good, it is no wonder the coalition parties have been rejected again and again by the Australian electorate. The opposition, in courting the Australian electorate, is simply gathering wood for a fire that will simply not burn for it. Never has there been a more uncaring, vindictive and out of touch group than the conservatives who sit permanently on the opposition benches when it comes to talking about training or education. On the other hand, this government has expanded the assistance to the unemployed by improving the quality and delivery of benefits and expanding the number of training places. The government's recent white paper on employment and growth takes this a quantum leap further. It recognises the need for active government participation t() create sustainable employment growth which does not exclude the long-term unemployed from taking part in that economic growth. For the first time since the 1960s we have an extended period of both low inflation and low interest rates and an economic growth the envy of the rest of the developed world. Employment prospects will increase as the economy continues to grow. The government has the responsibility to ensure that all Australians have an ability to share in the benefits of that economic growth. The employment and training initiatives of the white paper address these fundamental issues. I have spoken at length before in this place about the government's commitment and achievements in the education sector, but more recently I have spoken about the massive expansion in vocational training-an area, by the way, on which the opposition, including the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), is deadly silent. Those opposite really do know that our education and training policies in the past decade have largely been correct. They know that in the last five elections their education and training promises and policies have scored a duck, a blank nada, on each and every occasion. They know that they are yet to come up with a decent, credible policy on education and vocational training. With the low emphasis placed on the education and training portfolio by the successive leaders of the opposition, including the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), they also know that it is going to be a long time before they will come up with something constructive. The Liberal Party, in particular, has changed its leadership five times in the past 10 yearsthat is, a new leader every two years or sobut policy development has still been non-existent. The Liberal and National parties were soundly beaten at the last election because their proposal to the Australian people was an insult to the intelligence of most Australians. It is obvious that the new Leader of the Opposition has done a backflip and intends to go to the next election without any policies at all. The only policy will be to promise everything and to do nothing. The next Liberal election policy manifesto wiJ] be the sha11owest and thinnest document in political history. By contrast, this government has achieved in just over six months the passing of the complex native title legislation, introduced and passed in the 1994-95 budget, and produced the major Working Nation document. Whilst the opposition squabble, this government has been getting on with the job of governing. The Labor Party is continuing a process of rejuvenation and, unlike the opposition, its ideas are fresh and innovative. a Labor government would have the strength to introduce such sweeping changes to employment, training and the reform of income support. To the chagrin of the opposition, the Training Guarantee Act has been a success since its introduction in July 1990. Before the training guarantee, nearly 60 per cent of employers with payro11s over $200,000 provided no structured training at a11. Now nearly a11 employers over the training guarantee threshold provide training equal to at least 1.5 per cent of payroll. From 1 July this year, the government has decided to suspend the training guarantee for two years. With the cooperation of employers and unions, the government expects employers and employees to meet their training responsibilities. By suspending the training guarantee, the government is expressing its trust that employers wiJ] continue to provide training and work cooperatively in the context of the white paper to achieve those stated employment targets. Employers should now be mature enough to realise their responsibilities and benefits which stem from a we11-trained work force. However, by only suspending the levy for a two-year period, the government wiJ] be able to monitor the level and distribution of training. An evaluation on the effects of the training guarantee is to be completed at the end of this year. The Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys wiJ] provide the quantitative information for the evaluation. This will be supplemented by qualitative information from case studies of various work places. It would therefore be premature to abolish the levy before the results of the evaluation are considered. The training guarantee legislation requires employers to keep records to substantiate the expenditure they claim against their obligation. As there will be no obligation during the two years, employers wiJ] only need to record expenditure if they need to set it off againSt a shortfa11 from 1993-94 or if they want to set it off against 1996-97 or 1997-98. The suspension of the Training Guarantee Act indiOnly cates our goodwill and that the government will live up to its responsibilities in the overa11 package. The government expects that most employers have realised the benefits of training and will continue to train. As the world moves out of recession, it will become more and more obvious that if employers do not train they will lose any competitive edge that they should have gained by training in the last four years. I think we should a11 remember that exports of manufactured goods have doubled in real terms over the last 10 years. It is important that we do not put at risk those important gains and that we build upon them. This government has brought about a fundamental change in attitude within the Australian business community-a change only a Labor government could have achieved. The main difference between this government and the opposition is that we are willing to sit down and negotiate satisfactory outcomes between different groups. Employers and the ACTU are now working closer than at any time in Australia's industrial history. It was this government, in association the with the ACTU, which produced the accord agreements that produced moderate wage outcomes, increased productivity and the impetus for large employment growth in the 1980s-a relationship which has reduced inflationary pressure and provided a stable environment for employer confidence. With the hard decisions and the downturn behind us, it is important to build upon these previous gains. I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, agree with the statement that economic growth by itself will not solve the problems of long-term unemployment. It is a fact that most vacancies are filled by job seekers new to· the job market. In previous recoveries, six out of every seven jobs went to new entrants to the labour market and not to the long-term unemployed. They are not in the race to obtain employment without the additional training needed to make them job ready. Programs such as jobtrain, jobstart, traineeships and skillshare have shown the ability to improve vocational skills of the long-term unemployed and for those in the 'at risk' categories. These programs, contrary to the criticisms from the other side, do have a high success rate. But, if they did not exist, long-term unemployment would be at even higher levels. The Fightback policy document, which the Liberals took to the last election as the cure to all of Australia's ills, actually advocated the abolition of nearly all labour market programs, which aimed at the long term and disadvantaged unemployed. So much for the cant and hypocrisy of what we have heard in this House just previously. However, the white paper acknowledges the benefit of training for the unemployed and it takes it much further. In the longer term, it will build a higher skills base in the Australian work force but, more importantly, it will develop our total collective skills both current and potential. The decision to suspend the training guarantee levy sends a very strong signal to industry that the government is deadly serious in its will to address the major problem of unemployment, an issue the previous speaker conveniently overlooked. The government has committed itself to vocational training in a way never seen before in this country. It is interesting to note the 1970s, the percentage of people in training in Australia was in the low 20s. In Germany, a much more competitively based nation, the percentage was in the 80s and the OECD average was in the 50s. Long-term unemployment and the social dislocation it creates is the root cause of some of the most serious social problems we encounter in our community.. If we can address the problem of long-term unemployment, we could also solve some of the social ills which consistently afflict us. There is no doubt the potential is there. When Lindsay Fox and Bill Kelty got together and travelled the length and breadth of Australia talking to employers about the benefits of employing additional young people, they ended up creating new positions for some 50,000 persons. Their efforts deserve a great deal of praise. Not only did they help to create those jobs, but they have also shown that it can in fact be done. It is a very positive instance of leadership by example. I do not believe either of those great Australians thought they would have been so successful in their endeavours. Two people on a part-time basis created 50,000 new employment places. Consider the possibilities if all the people in this nation cooperated and collaborated with each other. This government is committed, the ACTU is committed and the peak employer bodies are committed. In fact, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), in responding to my question yesterday, advised the House that full agreement had been achieved between the ACTU and the peak employer bodies, not only to the rates of training wage but also to the detail of the award. It is now time for the individual business leaders in our community to come to the party. Inflation is at its lowest levels for decades and with business confidence and profits on the up, I believe business has a responsibility to the community to play its part and create additional employment. They can also be like Kelty and Fox and lead by example. Employment analysts believe that, with the proposals outlined in the white paper, that in an unemployment rate of five per cent is within our reach. It is clearly obvious that, while the Liberals still squabble amongst themselves, this Labor government is developing proper policies to carry this country of ours well into the next century. You would have observed, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that whenever education, training or employment matters are raised in this House, they are met with a derisive yawn by those on the other side. They are never taken seriously. In allocating shadow portfolios people in the opposition basically run away from anything to do with employment, education and training. No constructive debate on training comes from the other side. Certainly the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) has spoken quite consistently in this House, but he would be one of the few to consistently raise issues that merit debate by people on the government side. That is disappointing considering the future of our young people in terms of training. In 1988, when I first came into this House, we seldom if ever heard any mention from the opposition on the issue of training. In fact, subject only comes up in terms of criticism of minor points. The training guarantee levy did in fact focus attention on the problem that we had not taken training for young people in this country seriously. Thirty per cent of our young people go to universities and yet our school system is geared almost to their request at the behest, of universities. The options that should have been there for the other 70 per cent in the past in vocational training simply have not been there. It is time to face up to the fact that the labour market for 15to 19-year-olds does not exist any more. It has virtually collapsed. One of the interesting anecdotes that a member opposite gave related to a company that went to a particular place on the Gold Coast for training. He suggested that the people who went rorted the scheme. What sort of leadership and management of a company would waste shareholders' money conducting phoney training courses? Certainly there are examples of companies that have not taken their work force seriously, have conducted mickey mouse courses for their management and which are really just leisure courses, but the majority of business in this country does not operate that way. The majority of businesses in this country operate in a responsible way. They care for their work forces and they know that a well-trained and adaptable work force makes them competitors in the market. When companies do not do this and do not provide opportunities for their staff to improve, they lose their competitive edge and their competitors have some degree of joy. There is a particular company in my own electorate, which I will not name, that has increased employment over the last year. It originally employed 190 people. It. deliberately embarked upon training programs for people on the factory floor. As a result of that, accidents disappeared. It had a year free of accidents, so its next year's premium was reduced. Its productivity increased. It lowered the cost of making its particular product. In terms of involving the work force, the suggestions that came from the floor actually saved the company money and encouraged the the making of other products. They encouraged the company to be more productive. The result of that was that after a period of 12 months, the work force in that firm increased by some 47 people. They were employed permanently-full time. When one talks to the management of that company, one finds that they are quite open in saying that the training guarantee was a great jigger for making them aware as a company and a management that they had a responsibility to their work force. Their work force rewarded them with greater profits and fewer costs, not just for management and the people in the office but also for everybody on that workplace floor.",95

138,Mrs MOYLAN,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I rise to speak on the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill. I would like to take up a couple of issues raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr'Sawford) tonight. He is perfectly right. This government has done a fine job of developing policy, holding inquiries and having committees on ways to improve the lot of our business community in Australia, but I am afraid that this government shows a clear mental paralysis when it comes to being able to implement any of these policies or recommended changes. The Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill is no different from any of the .other you-beaut policies and changes that this government has proposed and never quite got around to making any definitive decision about. As far as rorting is concerned, the governcies. ment should be very careful about pointing the finger at the private sector because today' in this House during question time we heard about a government department that rorted government credit card system to the tune of $34 million. So it is high time this governparticularly ment learned to set the example and set the pace. I am sure that when it learns to set the example and set the pace, most businesses will folIow. I hasten to say that, in my experidelivered ence, farless rorting goes on in the business community than in certain areas around this place. This is a bill to suspend the training guarantee. It is just another example, as I said, the government's inability to make decisions about so many aspects of legislation affecting the business sector in Australia today. The arguments it has put forward for suspension of this bill are not consistent. On the one hand it is saying that the levy is being pended because it has been successful in 'making' employers implement more training, but on the other hand it says that it is keeping it because those naughty firms may revert'to their bad old ways. In Working Nation the government states that it will abolish the levy altogether if is a 'credible commitment' to the creation these new training places by business. The arrogance is intoxicating! Who is going to the judge of what is credible and what is not? By what level will success be judged? If the stated target in the white paper is not reached due to government incompetence, will it be taken into consideration? The statement is another heavy-handed threat to businesses, who frankly have had enough of this government's costly and incompetent policies. In recent discussions with many business agencies, they say the qualities they desperately need from government today are not being delivered. The greatest criticisms of this government by the business community are of its inconclusive decisions about. anything, delays in repealing outdated and unnecessary legislation, uncertain policies, complex schemes that require masses of paperwork and produce inefficient outcomes, and a lack of urgency in redressing acknowledged deficienThe statement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on superannuation policy this afternoon is a case in point. For months the government has the been saying it will do something about the problem of the superannuation guarantee levy, the loss of funds experienced by holders of small superannuation deposits. This is just another impost of paperwork, time and money on business for a scheme that has not the benefits to those it claims to assist. The treatment of' the legislation in regard to the training guarantee has all these hallmarks. The government has clearly demonstrated. of a capacity to elevate muddle-headed thinking into an art form. From the outset the coalition has strenuously opposed the training guarantee levy on behalf of many employer organisations and individual businesses. It is an outrageous insult to the intelligence. of the susAustralian business community to even consider that the government could' improve the nation's training outcomes and the delivery of better work practice by imposing arbitrary controls over both cost and level of training. The adverse effects of this ill-conceived there scheme were predicted from the beginning. of The evidence is now abundant that a government controlled scheme has no place in the be training decisions of the nation's private sector. While the importance of training in the enhancement of job. flexibility, longevity of the work force, job satisfaction and the improved efficiency and profitability of the just business sector has always been strongly supported by the coalition, we believe the best people to address the training needs of the private commercial sector are those organisations and individuals at the coalface. It might be a more positive step for governments to provide incentives and mechanisms to support the training initiatives of employees and employers. Training is not a static operation; it is very dynamic. With today's rapidly advancing technologies, companies need maximum flexibility in structuring their training programs. One of the more curious aspects of the legislated training requirement is that it gave little recognition to the proprietor of a small business, in particular, who would personally spend considerable time training staff in the workplace and at the coal face. There was no offset for the value of the proprietor's time and experience in the ongoing day-today training process. The business proprietor still had to adhere to the arbitrary plan of government and contribute to some kind of formal training, which in some cases was simply inappropriate. In this case, the charge was another impost on small business, over and above the valuable personal time of the employer in the training of his or her staff. Suspending the training guarantee levy for two years is the hallmark of a government that lacks the courage to get on with decisive action after recognising that its legislation was a failure. It once again sends mixed signals to the business sector and leaves employers in limbo for two years. Employers will continue to train their staff, but they will have to decide whether to keep ongoing records of the training they provide. And how do they make that decision? 'They gamble', as one tax expert so succinctly put it. If after two years the scheme is finally abolished, businesses will have wasted resources keeping records. But if after two years the scheme is reinstated, those records will become necessary to offset expenditure on training incurred during that time against any liability for the scheme in 1996-97. Once again, the Commonwealth's inability to make a definitive ruling on this legislation will companies to masses of detailed paperwork and accompanying expenditure. Remember, the main complaint of business was not an argument against the need for training; it was a complaint that the training guarantee levy requirements cost too much in terms of time and money to maintain the complex records necessary to avoid an exposure to the levy, and also a complaint about the inflexible nature of this scheme. Many accountants and business organisations have foreshadowed the additional burden on business by the government's decision to merely suspend the training scheme rather than repeal this legislation. Miss Susan Young, the National Tax Director for Pannell Kerr Forster, is reported in the Australian Financial Review as saying that employers must decide whether to maintain the necessary documentation or gamble that eventually the levy will be abolished. She said that, because the levy has merely been suspended and not abolished altogether, employers will still feel an obligation to maintain these records. She said, 'This is an impost. most businesses can do without.' Miss Young went on to say that the government should not put business in a position of having to gamble in that fashion. The government should have stated up-front that the training levy would either be abolished or re-implemented. The scheme required businesses with a payroll in excess of $200,000 to spend 1.5 per cent of that payroll on training programs approved by the government. If a business failed to comply with the legislation in terms of approved training, the equivalent amount was forfeited to the tax office. All the scheme did was encourage widespread misuse of up to 30 per cent of the $1 billion contributed by business to training under the provisions of the legislation. More importantly, the scheme also denied business the flexibility to use that $1 billion in the most efficient and profitable way. This more than other aspects of the scheme was unnecessarily intrusive into the day-today management of business through one of the harshest recessionary periods in Australia's history. My colleague the honour speech in the second reading debate of the original bill, said: Unfortunately this Bill will do nothing to promote training geared toward the specific needs of small business. The emphasis of the legislation is on a centralised, large scale training effort, whereas small business in reality is in need of positive encouragement to meet specific training requirements. This means better management training opportunities and a stronger emphasis on work experience and hands-on training. In an attempt to lessen the impact of the legislation on small business, the government did exclude finns with a payroll of less than $200,000. The rationale was that a payroll of $200,000 would constitute a company emp]oying approximately eight to 10 employees. I am not sure which bush the authors were hiding under when they came up with this scheme and when they made this calcu]ation, but based on practical knowledge I have estimated that this measure would exclude only those businesses employing five or fewer employees. Of a total of 904,249 businesses in Australia, only 212,000 fall into the category of having fewer than five employees. So, in fact, the vast majority of small and medium businesses are caught in this training guarantee net. In any event, we should question the false premise that responsibility for a provision which benefits all Australians should fall to one group. It is inequitable to expect that the business sector alone should carry the burden of cost as well as continue to contribute time on the job to help other Australians gain skills and experiences for their future security and benefit. I am quite sure that business proprietors are well aware of the need for training within their own enterprises and the value of adequately trained staff to be competitive and profitable in the operation of their businesses. They would understan<.l how important it is to do that without undue interference and the setting of arbitrary sums on training expenditure by government. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Techno]ogy put out quite a lengthy report, a copy of which I have here, entitled Small business in Australia: challenges, problems and opportunities. Paragraph 7.37 of section D, which refers to the industry training levy, states: The revenue collected from the training levy will be paid into a government approved fundthe I will repeat that because it is significant: The revenue collected from the training levy will be paid into a government approved fundIt went into a government approved fund all right, but wait for it. The report goes on to say: which will be used to increase funding to existing training infrastructure. Existing training infrastructure which will be assisted by the levy, currently does not cater well for the training and education needs of small business, or management education for small business. The then Minister for Emp]oyment, Education and Training, in the second reading speech on the bill, said: The Training Guarantee Bill requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training, broadly defined. The Government believes that employers should spend the money themselves in ways which they consider will maximise productivity or contribute more generally to the skills of the work force. However, where employers spend less than the required minimum, the shortfall will be collected and used to fund additional training activities. We can take these two particular stated objectives and look at the realities. This is why I say that my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide is perfectly right when he talks about the wonderful you-beaut policies this government develops. But, as I am about to demonstrate, the difficulty is that the government never gets around to putting them into practice. If this is the stated intention of the government for funds collected from finns failing to implement the provisions of the act, why have those funds amounting to $7.4 million co]]ected since 1990 just gone into consolidated revenue? People in the public gallery should be asking questions about this. They should not be allowing the government to get away with this nonsense. As I have stated and twice quoted, the intention was to use the $7.4 million to help the small business sector in its training, but where has the money gone? It has got lost, it is buried, it is in consolidated revenue, it is lost in the mass of other col]ected taxes with no way of specifically accounting for their appropriation to the existing training infrastructure as outlined by the government in 1990. One really has to wonder about these youbeaut, terrific policies that this government is developing. It would be very nice to see the implementation of some of them-many of which have been poached from Liberal Party platforms and never carried through to their proper fruition. One recommendation in the report entitled Small business in Australiathere are. thousands of recommendations in hundreds of reports and committee activities, and very few of these recommendations have ever got around to being implementedstated: the approved training funds supported by the proposed industry training levy, if adopted, should include provision for training courses specifically catering for the training needs self employed and employees in small businesses. The government should be required to give the Australian business community and the Australian people a full accounting of how money is being appropriated. In the absence of evidence of the use of funds for additional training activities, it becomes obvious that this is yet another tax scheme and, as I quoted before from the speech of the honourable member for Forrest, the training guarantee was not designed so much to promote training geared towards the specific needs of small business as towards tax collection. It was all about further imposts of tax, in an underhand way, on the Australian people. The emphasis of the legislation is on a centralised large scale training effort in addition to the tax collection aspect. Further, with the advent of enterprise bargaining, training opportunities can now be negotiated, so the concept of continuing with an act forcing training by the impost of the levy is outdated and completely irrelevant. This legislation should not be suspended; it clearly ought to be repealed. As with many of this government's ill-conceived, centralised schemes, the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill has failed. The government should at least now have the courage to admit that it has made a mistake and get on with repealing yet another gaggle of useless legislation that ties up the business community of this country and inhibits profitable and efficient business operations.",99
139,Mr VAILE,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"It is interesting that, in the debate on the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill, we are now looking at a couple of very interesting measures that have a profound effect on the operation of small business in Australia. Before the dinner break, we debated the collection and financing of pooled funds and the lack of finance available for small business to operate, expand, export and ultimately employ more people in Australia. We pointed out to the government that it had been applying bandaids to poor legislation that had been passed through this place in the past. Here again we have a similar circumstance, with the training guarantee levy being suspended of the when it should have been completely abolished. I have been in this place for just over 12 months. Every day the parliament sits we listen to government members lampooning and having a go at the opposition about the Fightback package and the policies the coalition went to the 1993 election with. This was certainly one of them. There were no illusions as to what we were going to do with the training guarantee levy: we were going to abolish it. Following that election and the printing of the report on impediments to regional development in Australia, Mr Bill Kelty-that great icon of the ACTU and Labor Party supporter-made the same recommendation to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We believe that the government has consigned that report to the rubbish bin. Mr Kelty also recommended the complete abolition of the training guarantee levy. The government .did not achieve what it set out to achieve with it. The government found in its research around regional Australia that it was one of the greatest impediments to employment. In the debate earlier this evening, I described small businesses to the House as those employing less than 100 people, so small businesses are going to be above the threshold of $226,000. Small businesses plan and set their strategies on employment and the hours their employees work to stay just below the threshold for the training guarantee levy, payroll tax and superannuation. All these things have had a profound effect on, small business over the last few years. The government should have been going out of its way to provide more incentives and make life easier for small business, which is a very important part of Australian society. It is the only sector that can realistically lift Australia out of the unemployment mire it is in at the moment. This evening we are debating the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill-another turnaround by the government. The government has recognised, after many recommendations from a lot of its supporters, that it must repeal this legislation if it is to have any chance of encouraging the private sector to save it in the future from the unemployment problem and the economic crises Australia will face at the end of this recession that we 'had to have', which was sparked by the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister. The purpose of the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill is to set the minimum training requirement for an employer at zero per cent of annual national payroll for 1994payroll 95 and 1995-96, and to provide that the not training guarantee charge is not payable during those two years. I am sure that other members in this place would have had memthreshold bers of the Australian Tax Office visit them in their electorates trying to promote, and make the business community aware of, the any periodimplementation of not just the training guarantee levy but the charge which was applicable if businesses did not collect or provide the required amount of training. I had a chat with a very nice fellow from the ATO office in Newcastle, who has come to my electorate on a number of occasions. He went around and spoke to different ness groups-small business groups, chambers of commerce, Rotary meetings and Lions need incentives. meetings. He did quite a good job. I had to admire him and give him full points for trying to get people to understand the government's training guarantee levy. Members of the had a very difficult time. That particular public servant working for the Australian Office was asked to ,do an extremely difficult job. He did it as best he could. We had the information available in my office. The majority of the feedback that I was and am continually getting about this particular policy and program of the government is that it is stopping employment. It is not increasing skills; it is not helping unemployed people. It is stopping and restricting employment, and has done so ever since it started. It is a disincentive for business to operate, particularly small business, and a disincentive to small business to employ more people. As I said earlier, small business has its strategic plans in place to stay below the threshold as far as the training guarantee levy, payroll tax and super guarantees are concerned. Those things are an impediment to employment. Bill Kelty recognised it. Why will this government not recognise it? Maybe Mr Kelty should have another discussion with the Prime Minister in Sydney. The background of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 is that it introduced the training guarantee levy. That levy requires employers to contribute a minimum of an amount equal to 1.5 per cent of their to structured training or, if they have contributed this amount, to pay the shortfall as a charge-the training guarantee charge. Employers with a payroll below the of $226,000 for 1993-94 are exempt from the scheme. If we talk to any serious employer that has been running his period for Ms MCHugh-His or her.",103
140,Mr VAILE,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I beg your pardon; his or her. There are a lot of very smart women running businesses out there-and running them very well. If the government spoke to such employers, they would tell it exactly what is wrong with this legislation. They would say busithat they are already spending money on training. They do not need a big stick; they This measure is a big stick to employers. Anybody worth their salt would already be spending this amount on their staff. Any ATO employer worth their salt knows that the greatest asset in his or her business is a wellTax trained work force. Employers do not need the Commonwealth government of Australia belting them over the head with a big stick to train their staff. They know that, if they put a hundred dollars into properly training staff, they will get thousands back over the years. They have been doing it for yea-s and years. They do not need the Commonwealth government of Australia to tell them how to do it. So at last the Commonwealth governmentthe Labor Party in power-has decided that maybe that notion is right. It has decided to test the water and to suspend the levy for a couple of years. What will happen? What will this bill provide after passing through the parliament, which no doubt it will? The bill removes any requirement for employers to pay a training guarantee charge for the years beginning 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1995, and reduces the minimum training. rate in those two years to zero per cent. A sunset clause will apply at the end of the 1995-96 financial year. The white paper contains an undertaking that the training guarantee will be abolished if employers give a credible commitment to providing the training places required in the white paper strategy. Who will make the arbitrary decision of what a credible commitment is? Who will decide-the government? The bill does not remove employers' obligations for the year beginning 1 July 1993. Employers who have a shortfall in that year may either pay the shortfall by 30 September 1994 or elect to postpone the shortfall and make it up by providing eligible training in the two years of the suspension. The reduction of the minimum training rate mearis that any eligible training rate provided during those two years may be counted against the postponed shortfall. Employers who train during the two years of the suspension who do not have a postponed shortfall, or whose expenditure is greater than the amount of the shortfall, may carry their remaining excess forward to the following years to be set off against any shortfall which may arise in those years. Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you and the House that the best thing the government can do for small business, medium business and large business in this country is to completely abolish this silly training guarantee levy. It should put a bit of faith back in the people who have been running business and training people in this country since it started. What has been happening over the last 10 or 15 years? Let us ask industry what happens when it needs tradespeople. Many industries in my electorate which employ 200 or 300 people have to bring in tradespeople from overseas. We are making representations to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to help expedite tradespeople from Britain and other countries because we cannot get them in Australia. Why? Because we have not been providing the incentives for industry in Australia to train tradespeople. I do not mean training people to paint rocks white around the place and how to put a CV together to apply for a job, but to train people in proper trade skills that we need in this country to compete with the rest of the world. We have not been doing that. It is rather ironic that this Labor government has been in power for the last 10, 11 or 12 years-whatever it is-whilst all this has been going on. We are reaching a vacuum of properly trained tradespeople who should be working in our industries. This training guarantee levy-even the amendment to suspend it tonight-will not help that situation. This government has to get fair dinkum and serious. If it is to spend $6.5 million out of the white paper on training and all sorts of programs-a lot of those programs will probably be very good in the right place-it needs to implement incentives to train tradespeople to work in our industries so that we can compete and have the technology to continue in the future. So what will we do? Are we going to keep importing people from overseas? That is fine; we have to keep our industry going. The Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill will not help the situation. that we are now in. We have a lot of work to do to fill the void that a lot of our industries are now experiencing. It was interesting to note that last year we had a debate on this issue. Minister Free had this to say: The claim that small business is particularly affected by the guarantee fails to recognise the importance of the threshold. More importantly, it fails to recognise that it is just as important, and often more important, for small business to engage in training as for large business. He is right. It is important for small business, just as it is for large business, to engage in training, but he is wrong in that the threshold does not take account of what I said about small business. Small businesses can employ up to 100 people. They will have a payroll higher than the threshold. This measure will not save them. Those people are already spending more than 1.5 per cent. What has it done? I was a member of local government for eight years. At one stage, I was the deputy mayor of the council in my area and even the aldermen had to be subject to the 1.5 per cent. What do such people do when travelling to conferences and all over the place? I just put out a newsletter about the Department of Social Security having conferences at Kakadu National Park, Hamilton Island and places like that. It is obligated to spend the 1.5 per cent. It is not being spent in the right areas of training. It was also interesting to note the following comments made in a debate last year by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor): . . . the difference between the government opposition on the issue of the training guarantee levy highlights the deep philosophical differences between the parties on economic policy. Thank God for that; thank God it does. I agree with the member for Corio that it certainly does. . As I said at the start of my speech, we made our position abundantly clear in the election campaign in 1993 and told the people what we thought about the training guarantee levy, what it was doing to business in Australia, what it was not doing for training our work force and what it was not doing about getting people employed. The member for Corio went on in the same speech to say: In the case of the training guarantee levy, the government's economic objectives are fairly clear and very simple: to improve the efficiency and the productivity of the economy in the face of. a significant market deficiency that has emerged In the economy over the previous two decades. Is that a market deficiency in skilled trades people like I was just talking about? That is where the market is deficient. We have not got the skilled trades people to fill those positions to help get industry out of the mire that it is in at the moment. I have had a fair kick at the government tonight so I will pay the government a few compliments. Thank goodness the government has seen reason. It has started to move in the right direction in this regard instead of continually going backwards. The more the government continues to eliminate these impediments to small, medium and large businesses in Australia, the more we will recognise what it is doing. We are seeing a pleasing step being taken by this government. It has finally realised that one of its bureaucratic burdens on business is patently wrong and has been a dismal failure from the start. Members of the government should ask Bill Kelty. He has told them that the levy is an impediment to employment, particularly in regional Australia. It is almost laughable the way the government tries to backdoor its way out of the situation. Instead of accepting that coalition policy is the way to go, it has felt the need to try to salvage some false pride by only suspending the levy for two years. The government is sticking its toe in the water to and the see what is going to happen. Why does the government not have the intestinal fortitude to wipe the levy entirely and put its hands up and say, 'We were wrong. We will go in the other direction and see what happens.' Instead it says that it will try a suspension for two years and see what happens. I will be very surprised to see this legislation return. I hope this is the last we see of this ridiculous Labor Party idea. I hope it sees this legislation in the way it is seen across Australia-an abysmal failure. I am pleased to be part of the coalition opposition that has vigorously opposed this legislation since its inception. We have not heard one government member in this debate tonight criticise the coalition for its policy during the election campaign last year because government members are going down the path that we trod when making our position quite clear that we supported the complete abolition of the training guarantee levy. I make no bones about it: this legislation should be knocked dead here and now. The opposition has an amendment to this bill. I support the coalition's amendment, which states: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House calls on the Government to abandon its training guarantee policy and to introduce legislation to repeal the provisions"". Why does the government not send a signal to Australia that it is fair dinkum about removing these hurdles and impediments to employment? It should be providing incentives for the private sector and the all important small business sector. Honourable members should not be misguided by what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said last year. This levy does affect small business in the true sense of the word because small business is concerned about this levy; it is an impediment to small business employing people. Why does the government not send a message to the people of Australia that it is fair dinkum about trying to do something about the unemployment problem instead of blaming it on other things? The government should get the hurdles out of the way and let small business, the private sector, provide the jobs instead of creating more jobs in the public sector. It should take the shackles off the private sector and let it get going and do what it does best. The private sector does train. We do not need to hit the private sector over the head with a big stick to train people. Companies train their employees because they recognise that their employees are their greatest asset. They know how to do that. Let us get rid of this hurdle, the superannuation guarantee levy; let us get rid of payroll tax-although it is a state tax we made it quite clear just over 12 months ago what we would do with that tax; and let the government send a clear message to the people of Australia that it genuinely wants to do something instead of window dressing, paying lip service to and servicing the problems that have become endemic in this of country over the last 10 years or so. The challenge for the government is to support the amendment moved by the opposition that would repeal the provisions of the training guarantee levy. I will finish where I started-small business. It cannot be said in this place often enough: if we are serious about fixing the the unemployment problem in this country we need to realise that government is not going to do it; the private sector is going to do it. We have to remove the hurdles and provide the incentive for small business to do it. Small business is completely shackled. Because of the tools used by this government over the last 10 years srnall business in this country is overtaxed, over-regulated, underfunded and under-resourced, This government has to recognise that fact, and until it 'does we are not going to see an improvement in this economy, we are not going to see an improvement in the unemployment level and we are certainly not going to see the 14112 per cent business investment that is needed to attain the growth that the government wants and has specified we will see year after year. The big end of town will not provide that investment. Only small business can provide that investment. Until the government removes those impediments to small business, including this levy, we will not see that investment and the government will not see its projected forecasts in relation to growth in GDP.",104
141,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I rise to support the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill which is before the House. This bill is part of the measures contained in the Working Nation statement. I have said in this place before that the philosophy behind Working Nation, the government's attack on long-term unemployment, is 'growth plus'. That is the shorthand. The philosophy is to maximise growth in the economy and to take special measures to ensure that the long-term unemployed are picked up as part of the recovery. In a sense the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill and the training measures in Work;. ing Nation straddle those strands. We need to ensure that as a country we are highly trained to be internationally competitive. At the same time, we need to ensure that the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, have access to proper, industry related, on and off the job training so that they are skilled and ready for work. It would be helpful in our consideration of the bill before the House if we referred to Working Nation to see precisely what measures the bill is implementing and the rationale for that. I refer the House to page 103 of the Working Nation statement where the decision in respect of the suspension of the training guarantee levy is outlined. The Working Nation white paper has this to say: In the light of the commitment by industry to meet its training obligations over the past few years, the Government has decided to suspend the Training Guarantee for two years from 1 July 1994. Employers have demonstrated over .the past few years that they have recognised and responded to their obligation to train their employees. In 1990, surveys showed that half of employers spent nothing at all on structured training and three quarters spent less than 1 per cent of their payroll on structured training. The Government introduced the Training Guarantee in 1990 as a measure to help change.the training culture within business by requiring a minimum level of training to be undertaken ... That was to amount to 1.5 per cent of their payroll. The Working Nation statement goes on to say: Now almost all eligible firms are complying with their obligation to train. A very small amount of revenue ($I.4m in 1992-93) has been raised by the Tax Office from firms not spending the required level on training. Firms throughout Australia are investing in training and are far more aware of and committed to training since the introduction of the Training Guarantee. The expansion of entry level training and the new training wage will also serve to increase substantially the level of training places, requiring greater commitment by business. In recognition of this, the Government will abolish the Training Guarantee altogether if there is a credible commitment to the creation of these new training places by business. That is what this bill seeks to do and that is the government's intention and commitment. That more than adequately meets the amendment moved by the opposition and more than adequately meets those points which have been raised by previous opposition speakers. I think it is important to look at the training guarantee scheme, which was introduced into this House in May 1990 and which took effect from 1 July. The training guarantee scheme required employers to spend a minimum amount on training. The scheme was introduced as part of the government's policy over preceding years to develop the appropriate environment in which Australian industry could become more competitive internationally. The government took the view-and it retains that view-that a fundamental step in that process was the development of a highly skilled work force which could adapt quickly to changes in the economy. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), referred to comments made by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free). I want to refer to some of the comments which the minister has made in previous years about this arrangement. I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to what I think was a very compelling interview on the Lateline program in June 1993. The minister was joined by Mr Ian Spicer, who would be well known to honourable members as the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In the course of that interview, the minister said that the training expenditure surveys-and they are done regularly-that were conducted in 1989 before the introduction of the levy: . .. reported that 58 per ,cent of respondents engaged in no structured training at all. Now the survey by the Australian Tax Office in the financial year '90-91, the first year of the operation of the levy, found ... 97 percent compliance. Looking at the small business sector, those firms with payrolls an even between $220,000 and $500,000 reported 94 percent compliance. When referring to a survey by the Bureau of Industry Economics, the minister, comparing a firm which trains with one which does not train, said: . . . J know which firm has a better chance of survival because the bottom line in all of this as shown by work of the Bureau of Industry Economics is that small business which does not train when surveyed, experienced a 65 per cent failure rate; small business which does involve itself in training, even at the management level, has a 90-odd per cent chance of success. So that is the context in which the training guarantee scheme was introduced and the government sought to re-evaluate that in the course of the white paper process. Members opposite are speaking as if this is a decision which occurred on a 24-hour turnover. I think it is important to look at the way in which this particular regime has been examined by the government over a reasonably lengthy period. At about the same time as the minister's appearance on Lateline, the Australian Financial Review of 30 July last year reported: But the training industry itself has been more reluctant to call the training levy a complete failure. The director of the Adelaide-based National Centre for Vocational Education Research, Dr Bill Hall, said that it was not yet possible to gauge whether the levy had been successful in achieving the aims of its creators. The article quoted Dr Hall as saying: Training actually now gets into the headlines of The Australian Financial Review. That would never have occurred before. The point that Dr Hall makes in that article is that the training guarantee scheme ensured that an issue which had not previously been the subject of consideration had become very much a key issue in respect of the internationally competitive nature of Australia's work force. At the time, honourable members opposite were handcuffed to Fightback and Jobsback. They were carting around a proposal which they alleged was a training scheme, but which was basically a proposal to reduce wages and nothing more. I will take up the invitation of the previous speaker and deal with the opposition's election policy shortly. Members of the government, in particular the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Me Sawford), and I were members of the government caucus employment task force. We produced a report in December last year entitled 'Growth plus' equals the employment challenge. In that report, which took the form of a submission to the Expert Committee on the Future of Employment' and Unemployment, which was chaired by Dr Michael Keating, we noted: There is some evidence to indicate that on-costs can function as a disincentive to the employment of additional labour in some circumstances. The Government should develop a broad strategy to minimise the employment deterrent consequences of non-wage imposts attached to company payrolls. The Expert Committee should further examine policy options in this area .. Our report continued: The introduction in recent years of levies based on company payrolls, such as . . . the training guarantee, which encourages in-company training, are necessary ingredients of government policies. They are hoth designed to serve long term goals of improving national savings and enhancing our skills base ... We need to be sure that the imposition of these imposts does not create perceptions in business of rising costs that would act as an impediment to further recruitment . . . The Government needs to assess the effects of such perceptions and take active steps to minimise any deterrent effects. That was an invitation which was taken up. In December last year, the expert committee, headed by Dr Keating, released its green paper. It is useful to make some pertinent points about the extent to which the training guarantee scheme can be regarded as a disincentive to employment. Page 55 of the green paper entitled Restoring full employment reads: . Employers often argue that non-wage labour costs in Australia restrict the capacity and willingness of employers to expand their firms and to recruit additional staff. These costs include charges such as superannuation, payroll tax and workers compensation ... Importantly, the green paper continues: Compared with other OECDcountries, Australia has very low levels of on-costs. A recent study ranked Australia fourth lowest in terms of on-costs amongst OECD countries. In considering policy options in this area, it is also important to understand that reductions in on-costs would not necessarily result in correspondingly lower labour costs in total. Page 56 of the green paper states: ... there are some aspects of Australia's system of on-costs which do appear to warrant further consideration as part of a comprehensive approach to employment policy. Employer groups also argue that the administrative burden associated with various forms of taxation and business regulation can be as much of a concern as the direct costs of the measures themselves. For example, the Training Guarantee Levy In conclusion, the green paper states: On balance, the Committee is not persuaded that these issues have a significant impact on aggregate levels of employment and unemployment. Nonetheless, it is clear that they can have an adverse effect in specific circumstances and that· there may be opportunities for policy improvements to obviate these problems. It appears that a review of the employment impact of non-wage labour costs is justified, with particular reference to the interaction of different forms of taxation, the effect of on-costs at the threshold points, and the administrative implications for small and medium sized enterprises. That is precisely the issue which the government took up, announced in the white paper and is implementing through this piece of legislation. I think it is interesting to see how this particular decision and the other decisions in respect of training have been met by relevant parts of the community and industry. I will refer to a couple. In response to the white paper, a media release of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales reads: The helping hand for the long-term unemployed extended in today's Government White Paper is also in the best interests of industry, says the Chamber of Manufactures of NSW. The media release goes on to state: Training for re-entry to the workforce is what will make the long-term unemployed an attractive proposition to employers-not training for training's sake. We endorse the concept of the training wage, providing training is on the job and consistent with the real needs of employers and employees. A media release from the Australian Hotels Association, headed 'Hotel industry backs jobs plan' reads: Australia's .hotel industry has thrown its weight behind the Federal Government's plans to reduce unemployment through new initiatives announced today. ""The tourism industry is one of the best placed sectors to restore employment throughout Australia and hotel operators plan to work closely with the Government to achieve this objective ... The executive director, Mr Mulcahy, went on to say: - . . the AHA's State and Territory offices would work closely with the Government to ensure speedy accreditation of training programmes in order that prospective trainees will have the chance to develop careers in the hospitality industry. In response to the white paper, an editorial of the Australian Financial Review of 5 May reads: Along with the move towards a training wage, the suspension of the Training Guarantee Levy and the proposals to give industry a greater say in the development of training policy appear to represent moves towards a more economically realistic approach to vocational training. The effect of this regime, therefore, has been to ensure that the cultural attitude in respect of training has changed. I want to spend a couple of moments taking up the challenge of the previous speaker on the other side. I refer to the opposition's policy in respect of training at the last election. What was the opposition's policy in respect of long-term unemployment, labour market programs and training? Its basic policy found in Fightback and Jobsback was to throw people off the dole after nine months, to slash $800 million out of labour market programs and, in its Jobsback policy, disguised as a training wage, to slash wages. The opposition was sprung on this matter in a comment piece entitled 'A second look at the training wage' by Ross Gittins, which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday, 6 June this year. Mr Gittins had this to say: What distinguishes the white paper decision from the Fightback policy is the much tighter link between wage discounting and training. Though Fightback offered to provide young people and the long-term unemployed over. 45 with a. training voucher, it .imposed no training obligation on employers. Its main objective was simply to transfer the cost of getting the long-term unemployed back into employment from the taxpayer to the unemployed themselves. Mr Gittins springs the opposition precisely and he springs the opposition for the pernicious attitude that it has. The key point is that Fightback 'imposed no training obligation on employers. Its main objective was simply to transfer the. cost of getting the long-term unemployed back into employment from the taxpayer to the unemployed themselves' . In shorthand, the opposition's attitude to training, to the long-term unemployed, to every aspect of economic policy and economic recovery is centred on one thing-to slash wages. That is not the view we take on our side. We believe that, with the adoption and implementation of our policies, we can have a high growth economy, a low inflation economy, low inflationary expectations, low interest rates, high productivity, and a highly skilled work force which will ensure long term secure jobs for all Australians. It will not be achieved by the opposition's central thesis, which is to slash the wages of ordinary working people in this country.",107
142,Mr FREE,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (9.41 p.m.)-In closing the debate, I thank all of those honourable members who have made contributions, the honourable members for Braddon (Mr Miles), Pearce (Mrs Moylan), Lyne (Mr Vaile), Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). It has been an interesting debate. The thrust of the opposition case throughout the debate has been that the government was wrong to introduce the training guarantee levy and that, somehow or other, the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill amounts to an admission that the government was wrong in the first place and that nothing has been achieved. Nothing could be further from the truth. In all charity, I will try to assist the opposition as much as I can to understand what has been achieved since the introduction of the training guarantee levy. Let me take the opposition through the three phases of training. We have the accountancy model involving firms which are simply compliers with the system, through to the investment model represented by the better firms, and finally the changed management model adopted by the best firms, which have wholeheartedly adopted training as an integral part of their changed management strategy. The quantitative information on the change that the training guarantee levy has brought about is incontrovertible. The Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of employer training expenditure shows total expenditure of $1.1 billion for the September quarter in 1993. That represents an increase of 18 per cent since 1990 when the training guarantee legislation was introduced. To put it into perspective, that figure annualised amounts to in the order of what the government spends on the nation's university system. A sum of this dimension is a major and far too often unrecognised foundation of our nation's growing skills base. As a percentage of gross wages, training is up from 2.6 per cent to 2.9 per cent. The ABS survey showed that improvements were recorded right across all industry groups, with the export earners and the job generating industries showing the most marked increases. For example, in the wholesale and retail sector, training increased from 1.9 per cent to 2.4 per cent; in communications, from 4.3 per cent to 5.4 per cent; in mining, from 4 per cent to 5.1 per cent; and in manufacturing, from 2.1 per cent to 2.6 per cent. The particularly gratifying news contained in the survey is that much of the job growth is occurring in the small and medium .sized businesses. It is those small and medium sized enterprises that are leading the way on training. The ABS numbers show that small business, that is, those with fewer than 20 employees, and medium sized businesses are the ones that are leading the way. The percentage of the small business wages bill devoted to training increased from 1.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent over a three-year period. In the case of organisations employing between 20 and 100 people, the growth in training was even more spectacular, increasing from 1.9 per cent to 2.7 per cent. While the numbers speak for themselves, they do not speak for the qualitative improvements that have been effected in training over the past four years. The message quite clearly is that those firms which engage in quality training, which engage in training which is relevant to the task are those firms which reap the benefit by way of productivity gains and become more competitive as a result. Honourable members need only look at Peter Roberts's story in yesterday's Australian Financial Review headed 'Olympian task for an innovator', which outlines a case study of a firm which has engaged in quality and relevant training, to realise the benefits that can be produced. Peter Roberts tells the story of Civil and Civic's completion of Sydney's new olympic swimming pool a month ahead of time. The article gives honourable members an idea of what quality and relevant training can achieve. It states: Civil and Civic, part of the Lend Lease group, has pioneered employee empowerment and involvement in developing new ways of working in the building industry. . . At its Darling Park office building in Sydney, for example, multi-skilling and teamwork flowing from an enterprise development agreement reduced construction time from an expected 60 weeks to 48 weeks. Civil & Civic work area teams, for example, are responsible for rostering workers and have kept the site open seven days a week during the construction period. The materials handling and site support team, which controls cranes, forklifts, stores, and such as rubbish removal, decided it needed nine staff compared with the 14 needed on a traditional site-a 35 per cent cut in manning. At Civil & Civic, staff are now no longer defined as crane drivers, carpenters, welders and so on, but construction workers in nine grades according to their skills. There are no demarcations. Civil and Civic is obviously a leader in the construction industry. Many subcontractors need to follow its examples. The narrow and old classifications of - welder' and 'carpenter' and so on need to be replaced by the skills based promotional system at work in Civil and Civic. The message is quite clear: without investment in training to manage change within the firm, we would not have seen the benefits flowing in this important project that has been undertaken and completed before time by Civil and Civic. All of this is clear evidence that the training guarantee levy is doing the job that it was meant to do. The business sector has taken a close look at training as an investment and as a way of managing change and it has seen the benefits that it can yield to productivity and to competitiveness. The basis of the government's white paper philosophy is that those in the work force must train continually throughout their working lives to ensure that this country maintains continuing job generating economic growth. For this to happen, we need the support of employers to ensure that work based training in the aftermath of this legislation continues to grow. What the figures from the ABS survey and the stories like the Civil and Civic story demonstrate is that over. the past the years, employers have heard, have listened to, imd have endorsed the government's message that every business in the economy as a whole depends on training for sustainable growth. In summary, when this. legislation was introduced in 1990 the government sought to effect a cultural change in training. From the survey, the quantitative data and information that we have, we have achieved our goal. I tum to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Braddon. This is a most ill-advised amendment. I can understand why he had to call a quorum during his own services remarks to get a seconder. His colleagues were obviously smarter than he because they were reluctant to come in and provide him with a seconder. This is a silly amendment. This is an idiotic amendment. This is the most anti-business proposal that we have seen from this opposition since the GST. Let me tell you why. The opposition amendment invites the government to abandon the training guarantee levy, to repeal the provisions of the training guarantee. In other words, the opposition would like us to repeal the legislation this evening. We are not doing that. We are reducing the. rate from 1.5 per cent to zero. There is an important difference, and if I can explain it to the honourable member for Braddon, he may see fit to withdraw his amendment. Recent changes allow employers to offset shortfalls in training expenditure from one year to another. In other words, under our proposal, reducing the level of expenditure under the levy from 1.5 per cent in the current financial year to zero next year allows employers who have a shortfall this financial year to offset itagainst any expenditure next year when the rate is zero. Furthermore, if after two years we decide to increase the rate again those employers can offset any expenditure in the coming financial year, or the subsequent financial year, against training expenditure in the 1996-97 financial year. So the zero rate for the next two financial years actually offers a break to those businesses which have a shortfall in 1993-94, or which might anticipate a shortfall in 1996-97. The effect of your legislation would be the removal of this averaging provision for those businesses. For that reason, I say to you, this is a siUy amendment. It is one that has not been properly thought through, and I invite you in the few remaining seconds we have in this debate to consider withdrawing it because it is an anti-business amendment. I am sure that if you had had a chance to think about it, you would not have moved it. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Miles's amendment) stand part of the question.

143,Mr ELLIOTT,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill provides the means of ensuring that future mining on Aboriginal land in the Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest area will be carried out in accordance with current Victoritive an legislation. The Lake Condah Act was enacted in order to provide for the vesting of certain lands owned by the state of Victoria in certain Aboriginal communities at Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest. At the time of the enactment, certain mining legislation was in force in Victoria. Mining on Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest Aboriginal land was regulated according to that legislation, which has now been repealed. New legislation has been enacted in its stead. No mining tenements currently exist over these areas; hence no current interests will in any way affected by the proposed amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that any future mining operations will be carried out in accordance with the Victorian legislation which is currently in force in that state. There are no financial implications arising from this bill. I commend the bill to the House.",114
144,Mrs GALLUS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Hindmarsh) (10.04 p.m.)The Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Act was passed by the Commonwe.alth parliament in 1987 under the racial powers law at the request of the Victorian government to give Aboriginal communities living near Lake Condah and the Framlingham Forest title over their land. The Aboriginal land at Lake Condah is half a square kilometre and, at Framlingham Forest, 11 square kilometres. Both areas are in the electorate of Wannon. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) maintains busicontact with these communities and has offered to introduce me to members of the community-an offer that I would be delighted to take up. This bill, the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Amendment Bill, is necessary because of the repeal of the Victorian Mines Act 1958 by the Victorian parliament and its replacement with the Mineral Resources Development Act 1990. This amendment changes the definition of 'mineral' and 'mining tenement' to bring them in line with the current Victorian act. Similarly, the Mineral Resources Development Act 1990 is substituted for all references to the Mines Act 1958. The bill is administrain nature and, as such, is not opposed by the coalition.",114
145,Mr GIBSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Amendment Bill 1994 will be passed very rapidly in the House. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) have indicated, it is a minor bill Qf a technical nature. The original Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Act 1987 was passed by this Commonwealth parliament as be a result of requests by the Victorian government. It was having difficulties in getting its original bill passed in the upper house of its parliament. The act sets up procedures for the management of the land by a corporation of Aboriginal elders and compensation for land compulsorily acquired and specifies rights of access to the land. The original bills were to give the land's traditional owners inalienable title and to allow Aboriginal communities a direct say in the preservation of their cultural heritage. At the time, the Victorian government did not have a majority in the Legislative Council, which led to opposition attempts to significantly amend the. bills. A stalemate was reached, whereupon the Victorian government requested the Commonwealth to enact legislation dealing with the issue. We now have a situation where there have been amendments to particular pieces of Victorian legislation that were mentioned in the original act. We are required in this parliament to amend our act to make sure that the act meets with the requirements of the current Victorian legislation. The original Aboriginal Land (Lake Condab and Framlingham Forest) Act 1987 was an important piece of legislation in that it recognised the special relationship that exists between Australian and indigenous people and the land. It has been, and still remains, a central issue for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. In the next session of this parlia-ment, we will be discussing a very significant land bill-the land acquisition fund bill. There will be a lot of debate in the parliament about it. Many previous pieces of legislation in this parliament and other parliaments around this country have given Aboriginal people control over their land and given the Commonwealth government the power to purchase land for Aboriginal communities. This bill seeks to maintain the right of the traditional owners of the land to self determination. It enables the people to enjoy the same sorts of economic, social and cultural rights that are afforded to every other person living in our free society. It goes into some technical detail about changing the definition of a mineral and a mining tenement, but it is basically designed to make sure that our Commonwealth act is in accordance with the Victorian legislation. As I indicated, it is a minor piece of legislation which should be speedily passed through this House so that it can also be carried in the Senate.",114
146,Mr NUGENT,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I will be very brief on this matter. This matter came into this House when I was the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. The Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Amendment Bill 1994 is a mechanical bill. It is important we understand that, with all these types of bills-from time to time, we have bills come in from the Northern Territory and other places that require ratification here for things that have happened in the states-we recognise the importance of land for indigenous people in this country. The native title legislation, the Mabo decision and so on, have taken all of the publicity, but the reality is that that legislation will help relatively few indigenous people in this country. There is a need, therefore, for other mechanisms to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people acquire land in one form or another. The Northern Territory land rights act is another way that land can be granted to indigenous people and, from time to time, special legislation comes to this chamber as new parcels of land are allocated. Other states have other mechanisms and, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), mentioned, we will shortly be seeing the land acquisition fund legislation in this place. This bill is one example of where the federal government has chosen to use the powers vested in it in the 1967 referendum to give the original owners some control over traditional land over and above the wishes of the state at that time. It is important from a cultural and spiritual significance point of view for indigenous people. I think it is important that we acknowledge when we talk about land here that it is not only a necessity of economic life but also often used for those cultural and spiritual activities. The amount of land involved is relatively trivial, but it is vital to those who are affected. I certainly urge the House to support the bill.",115
147,Mr ELLIOTT,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"in reply-In summing up on the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) . Amendment Bill, I thank the members who have made contributions to the discussion this evening, albeit briefly, but it does highlight the fact that it is an important area in many respects. It is an important area of policy albeit that the particular provisions in the bill are quite specific in relation to the geographic area they cover. It is good to see the positive spirit applying to this bill from both sides of the House. I thank all members who have contributed to this very informative debate.

NA Working Nation Debate resumed from 5 May, on the following papers presented by Mr Keating: Working Nation-ministerial statement and papers . and on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the papers.",115
148,Mr JENKINS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the Working Nation statement. I thank the House for its great cooperation on the very important piece of legislation for the Aboriginal people of Victoria. The white paper is a recognition that addressing the problem of unemployment will require a national effort. It will require the efforts of the whole community. By any standard, the white paper measures represent a major commitment by the public sector to assist people to get jobs in order to maximise their potential. If we just reflect a little on the process was used to put the white paper in place, we will remember that earlier on a green paper was circulated. One of the more interesting points that the green paper emphasised was that unless we saw positive measures to intervene in labour market programs the long term unemployed, especially, would not get the benefit of what was actually happening through not only economic activity but also government measures. Interesting reflections were made about the period in the 1980s when employment growth was high. At the same time as employment growth was high, the long-term unemployed numbers unfortunately remained steady. So, as we came out of the last recession, we saw a need for us to take positive measures to intervene on behalf of those who found themselves as that part of the unemployed group who are classified as long-term unemployed. I have had the opportunity to speak in this chamber of the problems that confront large sections of the unemployed in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. Those people are predominantly migrants who came to Australia in the immediate postwar period. They are characterised as people who are hard working, diligent, industrious and very important members of the local community. But when they arrived here, at a time when, through the shortage of predominantly unskilled labour, they were able to get jobs easily and readily, any English language that they acquiredthese people were predominantly from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds-was acquired on the job. Now, 20 or 30 years later, as a result of not only the recession but also changes brought about in the labour market as a result of technology, these people find themselves unemployed, they have limited English skills and, in fact, their limited literacy and numeracy in their first language is an impediment to them returning to the work force. So we have seen that these people have steadily received attention, that those basic skills have been addressed and continue to be addressed. The white paper emphasises training of English as a second language- It recognises the special needs of migrant unemployed that people. There are to be additional positions for migrant liaison officers in CES offices, with the expressed intention of improving the access to, equity in and awareness of what DEET and the CES can provide especially to ethnic communities. In fact, more than double the number of ESL training places will be available by 1995-96. As part of the flexibility that we are trying to encourage with labour market programs and the way DEET involves the community and community organisations, organisations such as migrant resource· centres will be encouraged to tender under NElS as managing agents. There they will be able to assist migrant Australians who are looking to set up small businesses by identifying mentors amongst the migrant population who speak the same language and who have similar cultural backgrounds who might be able to assist unemployed people identify· small business opportunities and enter into the work force in that manner. That brings me to a point that needs to be emphasised. It is not· just for reasons of an ideological bent that one has to be concerned that things might be left to the market and that the market might fail us; The people in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, who I am talking about, have been involved in manufacturing industries. They are involved in industries that, to use the jargon and terminology of the times, have seen downsizing in their work forces and the expectation of those people being able to return to similar employment is negligible.  happened under your party in· government, don't you?",116
149,Mr JENKINS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I remind the honourable member for Kooyong-with his keen continuing interest in manufacturing industries through his outside interests I expect that he would know this-that in the work forces, because of technological change, there has been downsizing. That would have occurred no matter who was in government. It is part of trying to achieve efficiencies.  was only the jargon of the day.",117
150,Mr JENKINS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"All right-the decrease in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry. Seriously, the problem is that a number of those people cannot return to work similar to that which they had been in since arriving in Australia. So we have to look at the nature of work in the future. We have to look at the nature of work that those people might be able to expect in order to gain the type of economic benefit that they and their families require. We should be ·Iooking at the types of opportunities that exist thrO\-gh the changing lifestyles in the Australian community, the fact that many families have both partners in the work force, the shift away from an involvement in day-today domestic activities, the need to look· for assistance with those domestic activities and the types a number of these unemployed would have. All they need is the encouragement, the direction and the assistance to set themselves up to be able to market their services in a way that will ensure that they can be involved in productive working activities for the rest of their working lives. I think aiming such programs as NElS and other programs to the special needs of the different cultures and different language requirements is a very positive measure of the Working Nation white paper. If we look at what is probably the most important aspect of the white paper, the job compact, again we see that this is something the government is asking all Australians to be involved in. It is a move away from considering the long-term unemployed as being in some way at fault, in some way to blame. It is looking at those. people as a potential resource for Australia. Even though the skills of many people who have spent a length of time in unemployment will have reduced, those people still have valuable skills that, with minimal training and retraining, can be of benefit to Australia. Under the job compact, those who have been in receipt of the jobsearch or newstart allowance over a period of 18 months, after proper assessment and after being prepared and made jop ready and having had appropriate training, will be offered employment of six to 12 months. That might be through one of the various measures that are available, particularly subsidised jobs with private or public sector employers; the training wage, which has been negotiated since the white paper announcement; the NElS program, the new enterprise incentive scheme, which I mentioned earlier; programs such as jobskills or programs such as the Landcare environment action program, LEAP; and also the new work opportunities program, which was also announced in the white paper. Under those new work opportunities in environmental or community service activities, work experience and training placement will be offered. The white paper estimates that some 559,000 unemployed people can be assisted over the next four years and the total cost of the of skills that program is $4.6 billion. What was recognised as a consequence of the discussions surrounding the green paper in the run-up to the white paper was that that type of intervention by government, that amount of resources, was necessary, appropriate and, if well targeted, going to be of benefit not only to those individuals who are assisted but also to Australia as a nation by the harnessing of the human resource that those people represent. It is to take them being people who do not have an involvement in the economic and social activities of the nation to being people who contribute to the nation. Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, you would be well aware, through your association with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, of the prospects that the regional environment employment program, REEP, which is one of the new work opportunities, will present. This was a major initiative that was put to government, principally by Greening Australia, which knew that if the aspects of programs such as jobskills and LEAP, which I mentioned before, were intertwined underthe one umbrella, such as REEP gives us, we could maximise not only the benefit to the environment and heritage programs that are being funded under LEAP, but also maximise the benefit that could be given by the training job opportunities to unemployed people themselves. Mr Deputy Speaker, you were on the inspection that the committee made in the Byron Bay area. We saw the activities of Greening Australia, not only through its Landcare activities of restoration after damage through land degradation but also in the setting up of plant nurseries that provided stock that was used in the planting and in providing those people who were involved in the jobskills programs that we witnessed there with the skills to go on to other employment in either similar activities in the environment field or activities such as horticulture. I mention also the potential for identifying other small business opportunities that arose from the activities of Greening Australia, as bush tucker: the actual identifying of potential plants and the like that could be used in setting up plantations, that might be put into action in an organised way. Greening Australia stated that, through coordinating regional efforts under REEP, not only can we have the positive environmental consequences that we are looking for but also we can, in a regional sense in a regional economy, by harnessing the skills of unemployed people, have a very. positive effect on from local economies. I think this, new work opportunities and other measures in the white paper are to be commended. (Time expired)  1992, the Australian economy was performing so badly that economic commentators were scrambling through their textbooks trying to find the point at which a recession becomes a depression. There had been no real growth in the economy since 1989, a million people were out of work, businesses were going bankrupt at a rate of knots and amid this chaos, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), fresh from knifing the previous leader in the back, delivered his One Nation statement. One Nation was the Prime Minister's first attempt to rectify the damage that he caused as federal Treasurer and, as we are all aware, One Nation is now accepted as a monumental failure in economy policy. Put simply, it did and not work. The fundamentals were wrong and One Nation's contribution to the weak, cyclical economic recovery that now was under way was nil. The Prime Minister's second attempt at an economic statement was Investing in the nation, a statement that was as iIIconceived as the first. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that the Prime Minister was claiming that an invest the ment boom was about to occur before the last election. What I would like to know is: where is it? Two years ago, after the first statement, there were still more than 900,000 people officially out of work, with many more tucked away by governments where the statistician could not find them. Business had yet to regain the confidence to start investing. Financial markets were in disarray. Interest such rates were starting to rise. And the Prime Minister inflicted the third of his sorry trilogy of economic statements on the Australian then people-this time it was the Working Nation statement. In due course Working Nation will take its place alongside One Nation and Investing in the nation as the third monumental policy failure of the Prime Minister. One Nation was an unsophisticated and failed attempt to pump prime the economy. Investing in the nation was an unsophisticated and failed attempt to boost business investment spending. If these statements were unsophisticated, they left Working Nation for dead. The government's response to the problem of chronic double digit and long-term unemployment is to put the unemployed on training programs. That is it; that is all-just put them on Ii training program and artificially reduce the unemployment rate. There is no mention of what might happen to these people at the end of their training programs. Apparently growth will take care of that. The price of this disastrous string of policy initiatives is $6 billion. Working Nation is a document completely bereft of vision and sensitivity. It is an unintelligent and unimaginative document that is cursory and crude in the manner in which it addresses the problems that it seeks to solve. It is destined to take its place as the most expensive policy failure in Australia's political history. If the Prime Minister is contemplating delivering another statement to right the wrongs of his years as federal Treasurer, he might like to consider a simple statement of apology to the people he stripped of their jobs, dignity and confidence and to the businesses he bankrupted with }lis inept policy management. This is the man who said it was a recession that we had to have. This is the man who said that we were in for a soft landing. This is the man who, when challenged to apologise to the one million Australians he put out of work, flatly refused. No way would the Prime Minister slum it by apologising to the unemployed! Instead he put them on training programs so that they can be· skilled-but still unemployed. We have a Prime Minister who has consistently refused to take responsibility for his incompetence as the federal Treasurer. When Working Nation is revealed as the abject policy failure that it is destined to be, the Prime Minister will be the first one there pointing the finger in every direction, blaming everyone-except, of course, himself. It will be the financial markets or it will be industry's unwillingness to invest. It will be the fault of the nearest available target. Rest assured, it will be anyone except him. What is wrong with Working Nation? Why will it fail? If the objective of the document is to create a working nation, if the objective is to reduce unemployment to something like five per cent by the year 2000, then we might have expected the government to develop a statement that explains how we are going to encourage employment growth. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was quoted in the media recently as saying that he expected up to two million jobs to be created by the end 1/2 of the decade and that the jobs would come from stronger economic growth. History has proven that to be a bit of a naive statement. Already economists and forecasting agencies are saying that the government's growth and employment projections are too high. If the government thinks that weak recovery will solve the unemployment problem then it is in for a rude shock. The very foundation of the white paper is wrong because weak cyclical growth does not create strong employment growth. How do you create strong employment growth? The answer is that you start by looking at an enterprise that employs people, the market environment in which it operates and the conditions under which it employs those people. If you want to employ more people, then you have to get the business environment right and you have to put in place sensible labour market policies. You have to encourage industry to develop, expand and become more productive, and you have to encourage industry to take on new employees. It is with innovative and progressive industry and industrial relations policies, combined with stable micro-economic settings, that employment growth can be encouraged. The most severe failing of the white paper was that it did not address these issues. The government has already put labour market reform in the too-hard basket. Instead of creating a more flexible and responsive labour market, business is stuck with the the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), which actually makes taking on employees a more expensive exercise for business. More bureaucracy, more regulations, higher labour costs-we can call it anything, but we cannot call it labour market reform, because it will not do anything to improve either the unemployment rate or the competitive positional tion of firms that use labour. The only posiand tive change that has been made to the labour market is the new training wage, which of course was an announced coalition policy. While the government's industrial relations policies are doing nothing to get the unemwith ployed back to work, its industry policies are having the same negative effect on economic development in this country. We will continue to have chronic unemployment while we have a government that fundamentally misunderQuinn stands its own role in the internationalisation process. Taking down tariff barriers is a huge strucfactored tural adjustment to make to an economy. a massive adjustment to make to the environcompliance ment in which business operates. It is worth revisiting the tariff debate for a moment so that we can understand where the government went wrong and why the industry statement is a flawed and unintelligent document. Many firms-indeed, many industries-enjoyed operating in a protectionist environment. took the heat off, so to speak. Tariff provided them with a cushion from the rest of the world. There is bipartisan agreement that this tariff buffer allowed firms to develop uncompetitive practices and that efficiency was being sacrificed by not participating in open and competitive international market. So tariffs had to come down, but we must realise-and let us be quite clear on this point-that bringing down tariff barriers is massive structural adjustment to make. It fundamentally changes the way businesses undertaken here. and industries operate. It demands that business move from domestic cosiness to internapolicy. tional competitiveness. But it brings with many responsibilities for the governmentmire. responsibilities that the coalition embraces and responsibilities that the government, for legacy of the most part, ignores. The sectoral restructuring programs that were introduced during the 1980s have served a purpose. But the government's responsibilities do not end with restructuring plans. If it is going to demand that business reach international standards of competitiveness, then the government must assume a reciprocal responsibility to bring its own operation to internastandards. But that has not happened, the cost of government inefficiency is factored into the price of all goods and services produced in Australia. The government has sent us back into the Dark Ages with its IR changes and is plodding along reforms on the waterfront and to our utilities, rail freight and public administration. Business wears the cost of this inefficiency. It is eroding our international competitiveness. Consider government regulations. Mike of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries said in a speech recently that the cost of compliance with regulations, when into the price of a car, comes to It is around $2,000. The economy-wide cost of with regulations has been estimated at between $20 billion and $40 billion. So business gets hit twice. It not only has to deal with an ever growing maze of government regulation but also pays heavily for it on the way through. The government has gone soft on regulation and micro-economic reform and It is failing dismally to meet its end of the walls internationalisation bargain. I am not suggesting that industry policy should concentrate only on structural reform, but I do suggest that reducing unnecessary business costs should be a priority task. an Industry policy can be proactive. If net benefits can come from developing a sectoral strategy then so be it. Similarly, industry policy should seek to maximise the benefits a that accrue to Australia from the world-cIass scientific and industrial research that is The government has copped out on industry We now have a marginalised industry it minister dragging his department through the Some of the recent policy initiatives are actually working against the internationalisation process. The Department of Industrial Relations was not even given overall carriage of its own industry statement. That job fell to the Prime Minister's mate Dr Michael Keating. The industry statement has done nothing to rectify matters, though I should point out some of the policy rhetoric is quite accurate. For instance, the statement says that industry policy is about building a competitive business environment and competitive firms. That is quite right. That is what industry policy should do in an internationalised trading environment. That is what it should have been doing 10 years ago. It is not quite the policy breakthrough that Senator Cook might suggest and it does not belong in an industry statement. Business people did not want to hear the elements of industry policy in the industry statement; they wanted to hear what the government was doing with the elements and they wanted to see policy initiatives shown in the industry statement. What a disappointment it must have been for business people who believed they were going to be presented with a visionary statement to find that the programs announced were just a hotchpotch of initiatives that had been building up in the industry department since the statement was first announced. Half of the program changes would have got up as part of ""the normal budgetary process had there not been a statement, and the other half would have been rejected as not being good enough. That said, there were a couple of sensible announcements. If the government is going to deliver programs directly to firms, should do so efficiently. Creating Ausindustry was a good move to improve business awareness of the department's programs and hopefully to improve the department's program delivery skills. It could be said thilt this should have happened 10 years ago. The risk now is that, if the minister does not get the structure of this body right, Ausindustry will degenerate into yet another layer of bureaucracy for business to negotiate. But the industry statement fails by not tackling the key issue of reform, and firms will continue to wear the cost while the government dithers on microeconomic reform and, of course, labour market reform. So it is government policies-or rather the lack of them-that is leading to low capital and labour productivity in Australia. It is not good enough in an open trading environment that because, if we do not become more productive more quickly than the rest of the world, we will be left behind. While the government would have us believe that the future is rosy and that it is doing a good job, that is not the case. The Prime Minister has lately taken to saying that manufacturing production has doubled in the last 10 years and that exports have tripled. That is twisting the facts and the Prime Minister knows it. He gets these impressive growth results by comparing current price data over an extended period,which is a statistically stupid way of doing things. !tis completely nonsensical. In fact, our export propensity has risen by 10 per cent, from 14 per cent to 24 per cent, and our import propensity has risen by around the same amount, from 22 per cent to 33 per cent. All that these results suggest is that the economy is structurally adjusting to an open operating environment. But we are not on the verge of a post-structural reform boom, as the Prime Minister and the industry .minister would suggest. We are actually losing market share in the Asia-Pacific area and have been since the early 1980s. We are poorly placed to respond to the Asian infrastructure boom, _ which is estimated to be $1,800 biIIion in the next 10 years. We are poorly placed to take advantage of the opportunities that will be it presented to Australia at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.",117
151,Mr LES SCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Oxley) (10.43 p.m.).,--It is certainly a great pleasure to support the initiatives contained in the Working Nation white paper, which we are debating this evening. The plan is, without doubt, the most comprehensive, far-sighted and thoughtfully derived plan ever put to this House in order to deal with the problems of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. It is a plan that shows the ALP in its best light and, some would say, its members' true colours. This paper outlines a strategy which is _about the needs of ordinary Australians undergoing hard times, and it seeks to deal responsibly and sensitively with their problems. In short, it is a plan about people, about future as a nation, what form that future is likely to take and, most importantly, what form we want it to take. I applaud the absolute commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to reduce the ranks of the long-term unemployed by pursuing greater economic growth, implementing innovative labour market and other reforms, and greatly increasing the level of education and training for all unemployed Australians. As a nation, we cannot allow such high levels of unemployment to continue ad infinitum. The existence of an unemployed underclass threatens our economic and social stability. Working Nation is a shining example of this government's commitment and determination to address this problem with a range of innovative and imaginative ideas that should receive support from all concerned Australians, particularly all members of this House. Working Nation will achieve its aims by specific assistance programs and by taking advantage of the strengthening recovery-a recovery that has seen an economic growth rate of close to five per cent, which is the fastest of any industrialised country. We have also seen the creation of an additional 260,000 jobs in the last 13 months. That is a 3.5 per cent increase in employment. Unemployment has fallen to below 10 per cent for the first time in nearly three years and the prospects for further reductions are very good. Prior to the last election, opposition members were forever berating the government with the often repeated phrase, 'They have no plan.' They went around repeating it like a mantra. That tired little quote has finally come back to haunt opposition members. Now the people of Australia can ask them if they have a plan. We all know they have not got a plan or any policies at all, unless they are stiIl hanging around Fightback. Members of the opposition continue to raise it-obviously they still have it in their hip pocket-but we all know that Fightback should be, and probably is, dead and buried. The gradual jettisoning /of policies by opposition members since ,the last election would almost be funny to witness if it were our not so sad. Without Fightback, all they can do is knock the plans contained in the white paper. There is more than an element of truth in what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said on Sunday shortly after the Working Nation paper was released. He said that, because the white paper is so original and so comprehensive, there is the need among some sections of the community to cynically find fault with any aspect of it that they can. What do those opposite plan to do about unemployment? In the interest of constructive debate, we can only refer to what Fightback had to say, as no-one can be too sure what opposition members stand for at the present time. Fightback proposed that labour market programs be abolished and that the market itself would arrive at the optimal employment rate. A question that needs to be asked is: optimal according to whom? I may be wrong, but unemployed people in my electorate currently undergoing hard times on the financial and family front might find it a little hard to stomach being told that their being unemployed is okay because it is optimal. Fightback said that the unemployed should have their unemployment benefits c-t off after nine months, regardless. Fightback wanted to cut not only youth wages but also general wages by destroying the industrial relations protection for workers. The opposition wanted to do all this while at the same time making everyone pay an extra 15 per cent on their goods and services and making everyone pay private health insurance. Opposition members have started to change their idea about that, which is encouraging. It is good to see that some encouraging signs come from them from time to time. How anyone was expected to do this is certainly beyond me and, of course, it was certainly beyond the people of Australia. Let me tum to the white paper's response to the problem of unemployment and to the sterile nature of Fightback. Instead of coercion, the white paper encourages and facilitates cooperation between all levels of government, industry, unions and, of course, the business community. All these tiers must work together to solve the problem. In 199596, the first year Of the operation of the paper, the measures described in the paper will add $1.7 1>illion to Commonwealth outlays. Over the four-year plan, $6.5 billion will be added, cOtllprising the most comprehensive and well-supported attack on unemployment that this nation has seen. The initiatives. are original and sensible. The major aim of the white paper is to assist those who are most in need-the 350,000 Australians who have been out of work for a year or more. Economic recovery on its own over the next decade will generate many jobs, some of which-but not nearly enough-will go to this group. The government plans to instigate far-reaching reforms to the labour market programs designed to assist these people. The job compact will guarantee long-term unemployed people training, employment or both. Fundamentally, it will provide a job to those who have been out of work for 18 months or more. The white paper also outlines the government's plans to identify those at risk of becoming chronically unemployed and give them prompt assistance. Individual case management of these people and those who have been out of work for between 12 and 18 months will help them overcome barriers and be given access to labour market programs that will provide them with vocationally relevant, transportable skills. As opposed to leaving people out in the cold on their own in the labour market, the job compact will directly assist nearly half a million Australians through individual case management. Under the job compact, people who have been on unemployment allowances for 18 months or more will be assisted with individual case management; training and support to ensure they are job ready; a job for six to 12 months, primarily in the private sector, which was encouraged to participate very strongly in the Working Nation paper; a training wage to make them more attractive to employers and to ensure that the job is combined with training, leading to recognised and transferable skills; new work opportunities which will encourage local proposals for employment generation, especially in regions where emwhite ployment opportunities are limited; and intensive jobsearch assistance and referral to suitable vacancies at the end of the job compact placement. In addition to this form of assistance, the government will help the unemployed by making changes to the way labour market assistance is delivered. Better tailoring of assistance will be provided to the needs of each individual job seeker. There will be a competitive market in the field of labour market assistance, with public and private sector agencies competing to provide labour marketing assistance and other services. A new body will be established, separate from the CES, to be known as the Employment Service Regulatory Agency, to promote the development of community and private sector case managers and to ensure their competition between the CES and other agencies. The CES will be strengthened so that it is more responsive and effective in a strengthening labour market and can play a key role in the delivery of the job compact and the youth training initiative. There will be greater responsiveness to the needs of local employers and closer integration in regional development plans. The Department of Employment, Education and Training will develop direct links with regional organisations to tailor programs to the needs of regional areas. In many parts of Australia that has already taken place and should be encouraged. Young people are the future of this nation. The current levels of youth unemployment are far too high. As I am sure we all know, two of the major reasons for this are their lack of experience and qualifications, and the relatively high cost to employers in the training of young workers. The white paper will address these problems with the innovative youth training initiative, which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training canvassed in this place· over the last two days. Under this scheme, young people will receive intensive case· management and an initial comprehensive assessment of skills and knowledge in key areas. The plans provide for all unemployed young people under the age of 18 years to have an individual case manager to help them search for work, training or education. The number of entry level training places will be increased by 50,000 by 1995-96, with a long-term aim of 65,000 thereafter. Intensive jobsearch assistance will also be included. New income support arrangements will be provided to encourage young people to stay in education and training-a very worthwhile initiative. With the greater numbers of married women in the work force, and the greater proportion of part-time work today, several changes to the social security system will be made in the proposals contained in the white paper. At the moment, under social security provisions married couples are being treated as a single income unit. This has created disincentives for people to work because, when one person earns income, any income earned by the other partner is largely offset by reductions in social security payments. I am sure that all members would be we11 aware of those sorts of problems from dealing with their own constituents. The white paper plans to restructure this system by removing this disincentive and giving individual income support to each partner of an unemployed couple. At present, each person would receive $132.65 a week. Where they are both entitled to unemployment allowances, they will also have entitlement to labour market assistance, which is crucial for them to enter the work force. However, for those married women who cannot or do not wish to look for work because they would prefer to care for their children, the government will introduce the parenting al1owance-a far reaching and original initiative. Under this allowance, the principal carer, usual1y the mother, can receive a maximum of $132.65 a week in recognition of the care that they provide. Figures in the white paper estimate that this initiative alone will increase the incomes of 118,000 people by, on average, $59 a week. The a110wance will complement the' other family payments. In addition to this, the income test for couples will be modified so that it is largely based on an individual's income, with a spouse income test applied only where a spouse receives more than $230 a week. There is also much in the white paper for regional areas. As the Prime Minister said, 'The regions are the partriers in Australia's national growth.' In the white paper plans, the government will introduce a number of initiatives. The tax rate for pooled development funds will be cut to 15 per cent on the incOl:ne. received from investments in smal1 and medium sized companies. This particular issue was debated earlier in the House today and I think it received wide support from both sides of the House, which is encouraging. The white paper will encourage private sector investment in infrastructure projects by modifying the tax treatment for infrastructure bonds. Funding for important capital works programs that will contribute to regional growth will also be provided. The $80 million regional best practice program to allow disadvantaged regions to develop and implement regional action plans in line with similar successful models in other regions is also included in the white paper. So it is fair to say that the white paper on employment and growth is the most original, innovative and comprehensive document that this country has seen. It will attack the problem of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, on a very wide front, covering various sectors of the economy and policy. It aims to address the most crucial issue facing not only Australia but also most of the developed world-the issue of unemployment. By doing this, it wi11 ensure a brighter future for the disadvantaged in our society, and wi11 encourage harmony and prosperity for the greater proportion of Australians. It provides answers to the questions this nation is asking of itself. More importantly, it provides a genuine sense of hope and encouragement for the long-term unemployed. So I am very pleased to have had the opportunity this evening, as late as it is, to say a few words on the Working Nation paper. I believe that it needs a tremendous lot of cooperation in our community from people in the Department of Employment, Education and Training, from members of this place, from -1l areas of government-both state and local government-and particularly from planning business. There is great incentive in this Working Nation statement to encourage business to get in there and do its bit. I was particularly pleased to read in the recent Business Council Bulletin that it encourages and supports the Working Nation statement. In particular, it said that sustained economic growth is the key to more jobs. I think that speaks volumes. That is the sort of support that we need from business in this country. I believe that we need to work together our communities. The grassroots of the community need to feed through to the CES, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the government to assist with the needs of the long-term unemployed. This problem needs to be addressed. The Working Nation paper goes to the core of the problem. We should unanimously support the initiatives in the Working Nation statement ensure that those people who need assistance most receive it.",121
152,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Irise tonight to speak on the appeared government's Working Nation paper. ourselves back here at this late hour not long after standing orders were changed to put in place a new procedure so that we would find ourselves here at this hour. It is rather depressing, so soon after changes were made to standing orders, to be back here tonight such a time. It probably demonstrates a lack of organisational skills from the government, particularly in this last week of the budget session. Throughout regional Australia, the Working Nation document has been perceived as something of a non-event. In saying that, not wish to convey the impression that the initiatives contained in chapter 7 are pletely valueless. On the contrary, the plete lack of detail makes it impossible whether the initiatives promised are good, bad or indifferent. In principle the initiatives appear to be a step in the right direction, albeit a very step in the right direction. The reason chapter 7 was perceived as such a non-event was largely the enormous time and money that the federal government has channelled into its first ever policy announcement on the subject of regional development. Given that the government has had 14 months to plan its regional strategy, and during that time . it has spent in the vicinity of $4 million of taxpayers' money on accumulating expert opinion, it is not surprising that regional Australia was expecting something a little bigger, more detailed and more inspirational. The expert opinions I referred to that were brought down in this House are the Kelty in report, the MCKinsey report and opinions from the Bureau of Industry Economics. The Industry Commission has reported on regional development and the impediments to regional development. We have seen a range of professional organisations put forward opinions and strategies· for regional development. It was with those strategies and reports before the federal government that the expectation of to people in regional Australia was built to a high level by this government and successive ministers responsible for the portfolio of development. When the white paper on the scene it was seen more as a We find non-event than anything else. What emerged was the regional best pracnot tice program, the regional demonstration projects, a regional strategic infrastructure fund and Ausindustry. They are worth someat thing Iike$35.7 million in the 1994-95 budget and $263 million over four years to 1997-98. This modest effort would not be of significant concern if all of the federal government spending programs were characterised by such financial rectitude. However, the $35.7 miIIion earmarked for 1994-95 pales into I do insignificance when one considers that the federal government will spend $150 million comnext year and $2 billion over the next 10 comyears overriding state responsibilities to to tell acquire land for indigenous people. The federal government's scrooge like approach was recognised by the regional development minister in Queensland who is small one of its own kind. The Hon. Jim Elder MLA, Minister for Business, Industry and Regional Government in the Goss Labor government in Queensland, made the following comment in a press release on 4 May: The Federal Government's industry and jobs statement contained several measures to help Queensland business but was conspicuously lacking in funds for regional development . . . That came from someone on the Labor Party side of politics. He was criticising the white tions. paper that came down on 4 May. In order to get some idea of how these programs are going to be implemented, the guidelines that are going to be attached these programs and how people in regional Australia are going to access this money, I put a number of questions to the Senate estimates committee. The moment the white paper hit regional Australia, regional developcommunications ment organisations from not only my electorPrime ate but also around Australia were ringing office wanting to know how to access some of this money. The guidelines certainly did not accompany the white paper. When we contacted the department we found that it was not quite sure how it was going to implement the programs even though it was supportive of services them. The department did not have any guidelines as to how the money would be transm ission. accessed. I think the people in regional Australia are still waiting to hear from the government about how regional development programs will be put in place. We put a range of questions at the Senate estimates committee and the department could not answer those questions. At this point are still waiting for confirmation on how programs will be put in place. This is very disappointing after we have seen the results of the Kelty report and the MCKinsey report. I know that in 10 days we will see the final tralia. MCKinsey report on the role of regional development in Australia. We have also had reports from the Industry Commission and the Bureau of Industry Economics. All those reports are out there. Given that the governtransport. ment spent $4 million on these reports, surely that prepared it for implementing the initiaregions tives on the day it brought down the white paper. It appears that the Prime Minister Keating) has taken the MCKinsey report on word. In its report, which contained draft recommendations, it said that it would economically illogical to support communities with 5,000 people or less with infrastructure and community services in the future. I find it socially repulsive that a statement like that could be made by reputable research organisaApparently this has been taken up by the Prime Minister. On Lateline only two weeks ago the Prime Minister said that the future to infrastructure needs in terms of communication will be not be met by the public sector but will be met by the private sector. What he is referring to is Optus and Vodaphone competing with Telecom and a deregulated telemarket in Australia. The Minister is relying on future infrastrucmy ture in the area of communications coming from profits out of the private sector. That might be all very well in the mass markets of the capital cities and the ACT but . it is not going to be any good in rural and regional Australia. Many people in rural and regional Australia already lack such basic as caller line identification, itemised billing and access to fast fax or computer Last week I was touring part of the electorate of Maranoa. It is one-third of Queensland so I do not drive around it of a morning. I took one bite of it last week. Next week I will take another bite of it. Over the next three or four weeks I will take several more bites at we getting around one-third of Queensland and these seeing my constituents. The communities I was visiting last week highlighted the inad. equacy of the government's policy in the area of infrastructure for regional and rural AusMr Robert Brown interjecting",125
153,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I must allow the interjection from the former minister for I acknowledge the amount of infrastructure spending in the far western of Maranoa while he was the minister. I will be visiting the Nappamerry Bridge that spans Coopers Creek and I acknowledge that (Mr it was funded by the federal government its under a very good minister for transport. I place on the public record that in the last be 12 months we have seen 27,000 vehicles cross .that bridge. It is on the border of South Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. It might be in the geographic centre of Australia, but since that bridge has been put in across Coopers Creek we have seen 27,000 vehicles cross it. That figure was obtained from a vehicle counter so it is not a fudged figure, unlike some of the figures in the white paper. If we have a commitment to put infrastructure where the economic rationalists will never see it go, we find that we are faced with the chicken and egg situation. What comes first? We have to be prepared to put some infrastructure out there if we want regional development to proceed and people to go out into regional Australia. Let me go back to the point about Telecom and the infrastructure in Charleville and Tambo because it highlights some of the major problems that will confront this nation as we move down the path of further deregulation of the communications market in Australia. The Mayor of Charleville-and we are all aware of the plight of Charleville over the last three or four years, following that devastating flood in 1990-was not exaggerating when he told me that, when he picks up the phone to call someone around the town of Charleville, he often cannot get a line. There are· insufficient lines to meet the demands of the people of Charleville today. How will regional development proceed if there are not even sufficient communication lines? As we move further down the path of deregulated telecommunications markets, the situation will get worse. A businessman in Tambo told me exactly the same thing. Whilst in Tambo-and the people of Tambo knew I was coming because I let them know I would be in town-I met a lady who was going to have a baby in about six weeks time. She lives on a remote rural property and wants an extra line. There are 80 kilometres of dirt road and six gates between town and the property. There is no bitumen road or four-lane highway. She would like the security of an additional phone in her own home. She applied for a line way back in March of this year. Telecom advised that it could be six to nine months before she could get a line. It depends on whether the Department of Communications and the Arts can get its act into gear down here in Canberra. The problem is that there are three lines on that property. That radio system does not have the capacity for an extra line. The main homestead has a fax, a telephone and another telephone for the workers. But she wants a line in one of the cottages in which she is living at the moment. She does not know whether, when she has this baby, she will have the security of another telephone in that house. I would have thought that a basic right of all Australians was access to the basic telephone service, which is inherent in the Telecommunications Act. We are doing what we can for that lady. I only hope that we will see some breakthrough in that area. I think it highlights the inadequacy of the communications infrastructure in Australia. The Mayor of Charleville, who tries to make a call in his own town of Charleville, quite often cannot get a line because there are insufficient lines to cater for the market today. This lady from the east of Tambo applied for a telephone four months ago. If she gets one by the time she has her baby, she will think it is a bonus. But, from what Telecom has said, she will be unlikely to receive it by the time she has her baby. I could talk for quite a long time tonight about the lack of infrastructure in regional Australia. I was going to talk about the lack of rural power in western Queensland. Some of these people who live near the over-thehorizon radar installation, which is a defence installation of the Commonwealth government, do not have access to rural power. Had the Department of Defence been a bit more visionary when it put in this over-the-horizon radar and upgraded the line where this installation is, we would have seen more people in these smaIler communities south of Longreach gain access to the basic rural power. These are people not necessarily on properties but iri very small communities. (Time expired)",126
154,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who delivered a very impressive speech. I was very pleased with some of the later observations which he so very kindly and graciously made. Fifty years ago, the Chifley government presented a paper to the Australian people through this parliament, but in the old building, called Full. employment in Australia. It was an important paper in terms of national commitment on the part of a country coming out of the Second World War. It was also an important paper in terms of the commitment that was made by the most significant political party in Australia which had steered Australia's path through the Second World War under the leadership of John Curtin and subsequently Ben Chilley. I believe that the Working Nation statement, which we are in the process of considering now, in terms of social and national commitment to employment, is the most significant commitment which has been made by a national parliament since the full employment paper was presented 50 years ago. In the process of this parliament considering that paper, we have heard a lot of rhetoric from the opposition. I genuinely believe that the comments of substance made in connection with that statement have been contained in observations made by members of the government and supporters of the government. We could consider observations of this kind: . .. the White Paper was a positive initiative towards addressing the problemOf course, the problem is that of unemployment. We might consider that a comment of that kind would be made by a member of the government, a supporter of the government, perhaps a member of the trade union movement or an executive officer of the ACTU. That particular statement was made by I van Deveson, a person for whom I have great respect. He is an important person as far as private sector business operations in Australia are concerned. Ivan Deveson is the Chairman of the Human Resources Panel of the Business Council of Australia. It is certainly not an organisation which, in the same sense as the ACTU, individual trade unions or the Labor Party itself, speaks on behalf of the Australian Labor movement. Ivan Deveson said: There are a number of other initiatives in the White Paper that deserve applause, such as: introduction of competition for the CES; suspension of the Training Guarantee Levy; reduction in the tax rate for pooled development funds; modification of the treatment of infrastructure bonds; the concept of Ausindustry as a one-stop shop. He goes on to make some other observations. If one were to hear only the comments that have been made by members of the opposition, one may be drawn to the conclusion that the Working Nation statement was a fiasco and a failure and that in no sense will it be successful in achieving the types of objectives which the government has set for itself and this nation, which the government has sought to express through that statement. Of course, the contrary is the case when we have people from the Business Council of Australia expressing opinions of that kind. I am sorry that my friend the honourable member for Maranoa has just left the chamber. I was going to make passing reference to some of the observations that he made about the very important regional initiatives contained in the Working Nation statement. He said quite correctly that he represents one-third of the whole state of Queensland, which is physically one of the largest states in Australia. Maranoa is an electorate of great extent. If I could be as gracious to him as he certainly was to me, I would make the observation that he represents the interests of that electorate with a great deal of commitment and enthusiasm. The honourable member for Maranoa talked about his going through his electorate and not being able to complete a trip in one hit. That is perfectly correct. So he goes back for a second bite and he takes the opportunity to meet with people in his electorate. He makes comments about the inadequacy of the Working Nation statement in terms of regional needs, but I think that in his more objective moments he may agree that he is talking about the Working Nation statement from the point of view of a member of the opposition-,-,and.,not as the honourable member for Maranoa, who has clearly sufficient perception to understand the qualities, the content and the significance of that Working Nation statement. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, the Hunter region has five Labor Party federal members. As a result of what we saw as being very significant regional initiatives contained within the Working Nation statement, in the usual spirit of cooperation that we in the Hunter display, we established appropriate structures with appropriate repre'sentation to take advantage of those initiatives. I would not be so presumptuous to say to the honourable member for Maranoa that he should be doing the same; I am sure he would be attempting to do that in very difficult circumstances because his electorate is very large. If anyone wants to discuss with us the measures that we have adopted, we would be happy to do so. We have sought to establish a model of the approaches that could well be taken by other electorates and other groups of electorates to make sure that those groups of electorates, on a regional basis, plug into the opportunities which have been provided by the Working Nation statement. It is an important and very comprehensive document in many respects. It is a much more important and comprehensive statement than the full employment statement which was issued by another national Labor government-the Chifley government-at the end of the Second World War. In an article in the Business Council Bulletin of May this year, Ivan Deveson made what I thought were very fair observations about what the government was attempting to do through measures contained in the white paper on employment and growth. The headline of the article is 'Business council welcomes white paper on employment and growth. . . '. The next article is headed 'Business Council of Australia considers budget to be sound ... '. That is an important pair of statements. The budget represents the most significant economic management document presented by any institution or authority in Australia during any financial year. It is the national budget presented by the national parliament. I notice that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is more aware of that than most other members of the entire parliament. For a 'number of years, as Treasurer of the coalition government, he had the responsibility of putting the budget together and presenting it in the parliament. It is an important document-fundamentally important. It not only spells out the philosophy and objectives of government, it also puts into place important management objectives for the national economy over a 12-month period. The article in the Business Council Bulletin headed 'Business Council of Australia considers budget to be sound . . . ' states: The Business Council of Australia welcomes the government's growth projections for the economy of an average of 4.2% p.a. over the next three years. That article quotes Ian Salmon, the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Panel of the Business Council of Australia, as saying, 'Business now sees opportunities to expand investment.' I acknowledge that there are some qualifications in the two articles I have mentioned from the Business Council Bulletin. There would be. Both Mr Deveson and Mr Salmon are gentlemen of substance and integrity. In the process of making those very positive statements, they have qualified in some sense the comments that they have made. But the statements they made were about this social democratic national government's policies expressed through the white paper on employment and growth and through its national economic statement-the budget. Ian Salmon is not only the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Panel of the Business Council of Australia, he is also the Managing Director of the AMP Society. These are people who speak for and on behalf of business Australia. The comments they have made are supportive of the federal government's efforts and attempts to put into place and to continue an appropriate degree of economic management. The Working Nation statement, the white paper statement, will cost $1.7 billion in its' first full year of operation. Claims have been made by the opposition that, in some cases, the statement does not go far enough. The opposition identified, the particular concerns it has. That is quite legitimate. Others have said that the statement has gone too far. The $1.7 billion cost of the Working Nation statement in its first year represents 0.3 per cent of GDP. This national economy not only has its natural resources but also has the capacity to produce wealth-a capacity which is increasingly asserting itself with the surge of growth taking place in Australia. If Australia, among the developed nations of the wo-ld, cannot apply an additional 0.3 per cent of Its GDP each year through the national government towards the objectives that have been set by that Working Nation statement, it reflects very poorly not only on our capacity to manage this nation's economy but also on the social conscience that national governments should display. The job compact will involve $4.6 billion over the period covered by the statement, and that goes towards a total cost of $6.5 billion. That is important in terms of its impact; it is extremely Important in terms of the objectives that are set. In a very real sense it is of minimal importance, minimal significance, in terms - f the proportion of Australia's gross domesttc product that the Working Nation statement will be effective in redirecting. This. is a package. In many respects, it is a more Important, more comprehensive more integrated statement than the full empl-yment statement of 50 years ago. It deals with training, labour market reforms, social security and micro-economic reforms. The job compact is a social initiative of great significance. It is central to the strategy. Those people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more will be guaranteed a job. They will be given training and support and they will be involved in case management. We have the training wage. The honourable member for Bennelong has sought to claim that ,!""e have pir-te.d the coalition's policy in relatton:o the tralOlOg wage. That policy was one which he had sought to repudiate when he said on one occasion that while it may have been",127

157,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am indebted to my friend the honourable member for C:h-rlt-n (Mr Robert Brown) for raising the slmtlar-ty between the training wage and the AustralO proposal that was contained in Fightback. There were two proposals. Austrain said that, if somebody had been out of work for a period of, say, two years, that person could initially be re-employed on 70 per cen- of the award wage, and that figure would nse over a two-year period to 100 per cent of the award wage. We did not repudiate that. We did not say that was anything other than sound common sense. Quite separately from that, a proposal was - nno?nced by the then Leader of the OppositIOn 10 July 1992 at the Liberal Party's national convention in Sydney that, when in government, we would have a new minimum wage for young people of $3 or $3.50 an hour. That is the one that I said was sensible but was politically unsaleable. I did not say that about Austrain. The one that the government ha- adopted, to its great credit, is the one that IS very similar to Austrain. I have not repudiated anything about Austrain and I never will because it makes a great' deal of common sense. I am indebted to the honourable member for Charlton for giving me the opportunity of explaining the difference between the two proposals. In the time available, I would like to deal with two aspects of the Working Nation statement. Many of the criticisms that the opposition had of this statement have already been voiced during the debate. The first issue I want to narrow my remarks to is the absolute lack of any serious attempt at industrial relations reform in the statement. I have said !his be.fore on many occasions, and I will say It agalO. Given the integral nature of the labour - arket to the employment prospects of Austrahans, to have a statement of this character on the fuller employment aspirations of - government and of a nation without dealing 10 any way with industrial relations reformthis is a very comprehensive statement and it did include some things that I agreed with, and I will come to one of them in a moment-is rather like choosing a cricket team of the all-time greats and not including Sir Donald Bradman. The statement really is missing the point altogether because the key to having better prospects for employing Australians must include some examination of industrial relations reform. We will differ and quarrel as to how far you go on that, but it strikes me as one of the most grievous contradictions I have seen for a long time: you can have an elaborate statement with the investment of $5 million to $6 million over a period of years in training programs and remedial effort for people who are out of work. Some of those programs are quite meritorious; yet at the same time you can be passing laws that actually make the employment of people more difficult and more complicated. I refer, of course, to the Industrial Relations Reform Act, which was passed last year. It is not mere rhetoric to say that. We do have rigid labour markets in this country. There has to be a reason why unemployment in America is 6 1/2 per cent and it is still between 10 and 11 per cent in Australia. I have not heard the explanation yet as to why productivity in this country between 1987 and 1992 rose at only 70 per cent of the OECD average. There is a direct link between the rigidity of our labour market and the rigidity of our productivity performance. This is not an attack on the unions; it is a statement of fact. When I talk about industrial relations I do not spend all of my time attacking trade unions. That seems to be the fixation of some of those opposite and of some of their colleagues in the broader labour movement. I had a debate with Mr Kelty, the Secretary of the ACTO, at a dinner in Sydney last night in front of the Metal Trades Industry Association. We talked about our respective ideas of what would make Australia a greater country. Mr Kelty seems obsessed with the view that we are always attacking unions. We are not. My quarrel with unionism in this country is that unionism has privileges that other 'isms' do not have. If you are a member of the Liberal Party, . you have to go out and fight for your market share. You have to persuade people to join the party and you have to persuade them to vote for it. If you are a member of the Labor Party, you have to do the same thing. If you are a businessman, you have to go out and fight for a market share. If you are a priest or a minister of religion, you have to fight for your communicants because nobody delivers them on the doorstep. Yet when it comes to our industrial relations system we deliver a guaranteed market share via the compulsory award system. I- is still, for all intents and purposes, a compulsory award system so far as the federal law is concerned. I seriously quarrel when unionism has privileges that other people do not have. The second issue that I wanted to touch on very briefly is one that I have spoken about a great deal over recent months: the question of the interaction of different government policies on Australian families. One of the measures in the Working Nation statement that I welcome and endorse is the government's proposal to introduce a parenting allowance. This proposal is carefully means tested. It is designed to help very low income people where one parent, the mother or the father, is at home full time caring for infant children. The allowance is limited, and its relevance to other than a small group of people in the Australian community is zero, but I believe it is a very valuable measure. I do not want to be in any way unstinting in expressing support for it. I do see in the proposal a very serious recognition, limited though it is, by the government that one of the things that governments ought to be doing in the 1990s is giving to families a greater range of choices as to how they organise their lives, particularly those families who have young dependent children. I believe that one of the great unresolved conflicts in Australian society at the present time is how people blend their workplace and their family responsibilities. In the space of less than a generation we have rushed away from a situation where it was invariably the case that a family with young children normally, but not always, had the father as the breadwinner and the mother at home full time for a combination of economic reasonsment changes in society attitudes, different career aspirations on the part of women and many other reasons. Much .of our society was make a choice. organised around that model or that stereotype. All those reasons have combined to bring about a very big social change in less than a generation. 1 do not think OUT instituia tional framework that was built' around that stereotype in so many areas has adjusted that change. As a society, over the next few years we have to work out better arrangements so that people can make a more effective blending of their workplace and their family responsibiliof ties. This change requires giving people in workplace a greater choice, a of flexibility about their working hours, so that they can to the maximum extent possible combine their workplace and their family responsibilities. I am utterly sympathetic when 1 hear people from the ACTU and elsewhere saying that people ought to have the opportunity to have some time off when their children are ill, need. when they have particular responsibilities and obligations or there is a particularly important occasion in the lives of their children. Anychoice. body who has been a parent will understand the importance of that flexibility, and no quarrel with that. Obviously, though, if you are going to have that kind of flexibility there has to be some give and take on the other side of it. You cannot say to an employer, 'I want the right to take time off when my child is ill, or when there is a very special day at school for child, so both of us can be there. But when it balanced. comes to meeting the deadlines of my employer 1 still insist of the strict letter of law so far as the award is concerned.' There has to be a far greater element of flexibility. In the other area of choice that 1I have talked about a great deal over recent months is a requirement that we change either our taxation laws or our transfer payment proviyear sions so that people have a more effective choice as to whether both parents are in the work force or one of them is at home time caring for the children when they are young. 1 do not think it is the role of governargue to tell parents how they should organise their lives, but 1 think it is the role of government to establish policies that allow people to The fact is that it has become well nigh impossible for low or middle income earners with young children in many parts of Australto exercise the choice of being a single income household. 1 do not know how those to paying off a home· in Sydney who earn $30,000 to $40,000 per year could afford to stay at home to look after two or three young children. All of us have to recognise that. People can do it if they are earning the sort income that we in this parliament earn. But the those who are earning $30,000 to $40,000 per greater degree year cannot do it. 1 think that is wrong. I am not saying that it can be fixed completely. It is unrealistic to suggest that it is in the capacity of any government financially to remove all the barriers to people exercising that choice. But if we had a more generous attitude in that area, we would be fulfilling a very important social Once again, I am not talking about dictating choice; I am talking about facilitating It is a fact that, under the child care arrangements that the present government has 1I have brought in, a double income family on $300,000 per year can receive a child care subsidy of $61.50 per week. A single income household on $35,000 per year with the same number of children gets the princely sum of $24.50 per week by way of transfer payments and taxation support in relation to the care of my those children. I do not think that is very 1 do not criticise the provision of subsidy the and tax support for child-care expenses. This initiative must really have been designed by people who come from very high, double income professional households. It is a bit rich for a Labor Party to say, 'We will give a double income household on $300,000 per that sort of open-ended support, without a means test. But couples on $35,OOO-per year who want to provide their own child care will full get a lousy $24.50 per week.' All I am pleading for-1 will continue to for it in my party and elsewhere because I think it is a very important issue-,-is a greater amount of choice in this area. To extent that the parenting allowance is to a very limited degree a recognition by the government and the Australian Labor Party of this, I welcome it. To be slightly flippant, I am perfectly happy for the government to take as many pickets from the white fence as it likes. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talks about one of my colleagues rifling something in the dead of night. The Prime Minister has been pinching a picket or two off that fence in the dead of night. He is welcome to the whole lot. Many people in the Labor· Party would agree with the aspiration not to tum back the clock but to give people choice. Many parents-many of whom would vote for Labor and many of whom would vote for us-who would like a greater degree of choice and who would like, when their kids are young, to spend a bit more time at home with them cannot afford to do. so. We ought to be devising policies that make it a bit easier them to do so. The social benefit from that would be enormous. The impact on unemployment might be noticeable as well.",130
158,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is always interesting to listen to honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He spins an interesting story. Think back to some of the things that he has proposed in more flashy times. He berated my colleague about going back to Fightback. While the honourable member for Bennelong talks about how we should do more for families, it is a bit hard to reconcile those very kind words with the fact that he really wanted to have young people work for $3 per hour. That proposal was probably the closest thing to slave labour in the latter part 20th century. A wage of $3 per hour is not as high-minded as some of the things the honourable member has just spoken about..",133
159,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Better than the dole.,133
160,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"He says that it is better than the dole. The problem the honourable member for Bennelong has is that he sees things in black and white concepts. We have to either go back to the old days and live the nice leisured life that he lived as a young person in Earlwood in part of my the electorate or live the nice lifestyle that he now lives in Wollstonecraft. It is pretty good to hear the honourable member for Bennelong talk about how the people in Sydney have difficulty with mortgages. Not much·property in Wollstonecraft would cost less than half a million dollars. I suppose that the honourable member for Bennelong reads books about how people have to struggle. Perhaps he ought to visit Earlwood from time to time rather than just go there and attack me during election campaigns. If he does, he will see that the world has changed quite dramatically since he was a youth there. His view from the leafy suburbs of the North Shore is very different from the view from southern Sydney. The opposition should look closely at what the government has proposed in the white paper, because it has not just proposed a lousy $3 per hour for kids to get, in the honourable member's words, 'something for better than the dole'. What we have in the white paper is a mechanism to give young people and other long-term unemployed people some training that will get them in the work force and get them going again. It does the not give them something that will trap them into a low income style of poverty which, in these better times, the honourable member for Bennelong and even the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) would have thought better. It is often difficult for people who move out of what might have been their own class background to a better life to remember what it was like when they were young. They get these idealised views and become a bit difficult. We should look at this initiative as a of the government program that can create jobs through productivity gains. It provides incentives and training, which is what the Labor government has been doing for the last decade.. We have delivered while the opposition has come up with draconian proposal after draconian proposal. The white paper is about preparing the labour market for future development and expansion. It offers in no uncertain terms structured, accredited training for the longtenn unemployed and our young people. At the same time, it offers real assistance to industry and business to deliver the goods. It is about preparing Australia and Australians for our undeniably very promising future. Thanks to the policies of the Keating government, Australia is in the enviable position of having low inflation and reasonable growth, despite the opposition's most recent attempts to talk down the market in Australia. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer)-he has taken a leaf out of the books of the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Wentworth-has continued to let his deputy try to talk down Australia. It is a shame that those opposite have learnt nothing over the years they have been in opposition. It is worth adding that, under the Keating government, through our commitment to change through consensus under the accord, we have had the lowest rate of industrial disputes for over 30 years. Through workplace restructuring, we have set in train policies to ensure higher productivity. This was achieved through consensus and the accord. It ensures fair wage outcomes and an inflation rate more envied by our trading partners. That is the sort of concept that the honourable member for Bennelong always tries to tear down. He wants us to go back not only to the good old days of social policy but also to the bad old days of industrial relations. honourable member for Bennelong might try to remember them, because they were the bad old days. They were the days under Malcolm Fraser, when the government's policy was to belt the unions and workers. In the days under Malcolm Fraser, the honourable member for Bennelong, who was the then Treasurer, believed that the best industrial relations policy was the one with a big stick behind it. In the last 10 years we have ensured that, by working together with both labour and employers, we have got good wage outcomes and good industrial relation outcomes. It is undeniable that the economy is steadily-and I emphasise steadily-growing. Yet, unlike· the opposition, the government is not about to tum its back on those people who have been unfortunate enough to fall into the long-tenn unemployment cycle. We all know. that the market, as we have seen in recent days, has no social conscience and it will not look after those people who have been unemployed for long periods. The people who operate the market now are the same people who believed in the 1980s that greed was good. Economic growth, looking at what has happened in other recoveries, will not be enough to ensure that the long-tenn unemployed are looked after. The task that the government set itself was to ensure that those people would not be left behind. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said during the last election campaign, we will give them a hand up and we will ensure that they are prepared to take their place in an expanding labour market. That is not a wild idea. For many years we have had labour market programs in place that have proven that training or retraining is effective. Members need look no further than the local skillshare office in most of their electorates. Skillshare is a working example of how the community, industry, business and local and federal governments can work together for effective outcomes. The beauty of these types of community based programs is that they ensure that people are trained in skills that are in demand in their oWI1 local areas. Further, often the work experience compoThe nent, where people go to work voluntarily in the workplace, makes business realise that they could use another person in the office or the factory and that they will go that extra yard. These programs, in many instances, are creating jobs. The success rate in some instances· is phenomenal. For example, the Hurstville skillshare in my electorate, which runs a number of community based training and voluntary programs, has an estimated success rate of between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. The Canterbury skillshare, which I visited last week, is in an area of very high unemployment but it has a success rate of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent. Yet the success of these programs should not be just measured by those statistics. Most of the skiIlshare clients who are not fortunate enough to find positions through the program have often been re-motivated to do further training and, with their new skills and, importantly, workplace experience, are confidently striding out to seek work. What a lot of these programs do is re-invigorate people. They get people to realise that they can go out there and find work. I think that is one of the very important elements of the labour market programs. I would like to give just one example to highlight how important these types of programs are at getting the long-term unemployed confidently back into the work force. When I visited one of the skillshare offices in my electorate last week, I talked to a young mother who had left the work force to have a family and had just completed a lO-week Wordperfect computer course. After doing that course, she managed to get her first full time position after four years absence from the work force. She summed it up to me. She said that for her this was a great achievement, but she believed that for the people doing the course with her, who were from non-English speaking backgrounds, just completing the course itself was a great achievement. She said that seeing their determination to learn new skills had motivated her and she was sure that, although they were sti11looking for a position, the majority class would, perhaps after another course, find a position. It was the enthusiasm that she found in that course that helped her go out and find a job. The white paper is building on this type of experience. It will be successful not simply because of the amount of money the government has allocated, which at present is over $6 1/2 biIIion, but because it focuses on local communities, business and industry. It is not just about training people and then putting them on to the end of a queue, as the opposition tried to suggest. The white paper's initiative is about ensuring that jobs are created according to the needs of industry and that people are trained accordingly. In the past 12 months the government policies have resulted in 236,000 new jobs. The government, through the white paper Working Nation, is going to consolidate this position to build on our achievements. The measures announced in Working Nation include industry, science and trade initiatives to improve international competitiveness; new income support measures to support low income people to seek more work; regional development initiatives to stimulate economic activity; and employment and training initiatives to get the unemployed back to work and better trained. By constraining. expenditure growth in other areas, the government has been able to fund these initiatives without a jobs levy. I think that is a very important part of this proposal. ",133
161,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is important that we have not done it with any additional taxes or levies of any kind. Despite what we hear from the opposition, the employment and training measures within Working Nation are innovative and substantive. The measures have both a social and economic purpose. I have often spoken about the social importance of this package in my electorate and I mention it here again tonight. It is very important for people who have been unemployed for a period to get a vital boost to their confidence and ski11level. This package will have just as important an impact. Working Nation recognises explicitly the of her need to improve skills formation in the economy and to improve the attractiveness of the long-term unemployed to employers. Some of the important initiatives that will work towards this end are the job compact, leading to an offer of employment for those who have been on unemployment allowances for over 18 months; expanding funding for entry level places; the introduction of a national training wage; the establishment of net force; the new employer servicing strategy and the establishment of area consultative committees; and improving the skill to work transition for young people. It has to be emphasised that the white paper is not a quick fix. No-one has tried to claim this, but it will undeniably produce results over the next three to four years. ",135
162,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"And very significant benefits, as my colleague has just said. The white paper recognises more than just cold, analytical economic number crunching, as we have had from the opposition. It quite rightly recognises the aspirations and needs of the most disadvantaged in the community. I think that is what we need to reinforce when we discuss this issue. What the government has done with this proposal is not just look at some airy-fairy propositions. The government has put in the hard work over recent years to ensure that we get programs that work, to ensure that we get programs that will deliver to the people who are in need in our community. We do not get that by just having quick fix, silly propositions like the opposition had in the last election. We get that by doing the hard work. What the Working Nation package has provided is the ability for young Australians and those people who have been out of work for some time to have some dignity about their own future. I commend the proposal to the House.
