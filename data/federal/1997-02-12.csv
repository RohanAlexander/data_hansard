1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Abbott) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the notice  ance of Statutory Rules 1996, No. 261, being called on forthwith. Motion for Disallowance  a.m.)-I move: That the AU STUDY Regulation (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1996, No. 261, and made under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed. This motion relates to two measures in the Austudy area that were announced in last year's budget which we find particularly iniquitous. The first is the decision to increase the age of independence under the Austudy means test from 22 to 25. It is a direct reversal of a measure that was taken by the former government when I was minister to reduce it from 25 to 22 in a series of three incremental steps. The second matter that we find particularly objectionable is the abolition of the schooling incidentals allowance. This is not a big ticket item in the overall scheme of the budget. However, we find this a particularly cruel and obnoxious proposition. We have expressed strong opposition to it. These matters were given notice of towards the end of the session last year. The Senate has already voted on them. Regrettably, our attempt to disallow these propositions in the Senate failed because the two Independent senators did not support us on that occasion. So you might say that, in a sense, this debate here is a little academic because the numbers are, shall we say, rather more clear-cut. But we think these are important issues of principIe, and we intend to take this opportunity to raise them in the parliament. On the age of independence, we believe that it is a fundamentally absurd premise to suggest that the structure of the Austudy income test can proceed on the presumption that there is a relationship of financial dependency between people in their mid-20s and their parents. It simply does not accord with any concept of social reality. I am sure that many members of parliament Orders will have received representations on this. I know that I have received quite a few. It is a matter that has generated a great deal of concern and anger. The sort of anomalies that can emerge are well exemplified by this representation received by one of my colleagues. I do not intend to give the name of the individual, but I will read the letter, because I think it exemplifies some of the points: I am writing to inform you of my situation in relation to Austudy regulations. My hope is that you may be able to lodge some sort of appeal and present my case as an example of how the current regulations exclude students with a genuine need from receiving government help. This year I am entering the second year of a Bachelor of Teaching degree at the University of Western Sydney at Nepean. I enrolled as a mature age student last year at the age of 21. Prior to this, I had completed an associate diploma over two years, which I financed myself by working part-time. I had moved out of home to attend this course. The year following, I worked full time in a primary school, supporting myself again. On enrolling in the degree course, I was refused Austudy payments due to not being an independent age, not having worked full time for three years and not having been on social security and having parents whose income was marginally too high. For my first year of university, then, I lived off my savings, with the expectation that I would receive Austudy in 1997 at the age of 22. Under this assumption, I also advised my mother that working a second job would not detrimentally affect my chances of receiving the payments. On application this year, I found the independent age had been raised to 25. This meant for me that I was still classed as dependent on my parents, whom I do not live with and whose income is set too high as a result of the second job held by my mother. Looking at how the system has been set up, it would have served my purposes better not to have worked my way through my associate diploma but rather to have depended on social security. The point there is that, had he done so, he would have qualified under the work force test to be considered independent. It continues: Maybe then the current regulations would have permitted me to receive the much needed help. So it is my opinion, therefore, that the independent classification as it now stands is not an effective way of assessing students' independence. People are confronted with the situation where, having taken bona fide decisions and acted in good faith on the presumption that a set of arrangements would apply, they now find themselves caught by this sort of change. The numbers involved are quite significant. According to budget material, 13,700 stand to have their payments reduced. A further 12,000 will become completely ineligible. I acknowledge that the measure is not quite as obnoxious as was originally suggested in the budget, when it was proposed that if you turned 25 in the course of your studies, you would continue to be deemed dependent on your parents until completion. That meant, hypothetically, that somebody starting medicine at the age of 24 could still be deemed dependent on mum and dad when they were approaching the age of 30. That was a bit too red hot even for this government. I was pleased to see that that aspect of the original proposition was not carried through. There was some loss of savings as a result of that. As I have said, this is a highly retrograde measure. When in government and when I was minister we made it a high priority to get that age of independence down. And we did. The student organisations identified reducing the age of independence as one of their two top priorities in the Austudy area, the other being to liberalise the personal income test, which we also did to a very considerable extent. We strongly oppose this proposition. Clearly it creates additional barriers to participation in higher education to many people. When you combine it with the impact of the sharply increased HECS charges and the substantially increased HECS debts that people are going to be forced to incur, and the fact that many of these students are now going to have to look at loans-they might be the Austudy supplementary loans or loans from other sources-you will find that the disincentive for study, especially for those who do not have particularly high levels of means, will be considerable. Bear in mind here that the parental income test under Austudy does cut in at a pretty low income level. We are talking about the basic joint family income threshold of $22,650, which varies a bit depending on circumstances. But still, we are not talking about people with very substantial wealth. The other measure was the cessation of the schooling incidentals allowance. As I have said, we find this a particularly cruel and objectionable step. The schooling incidentals allowance provided students on the homeless rate of Austudy with $300-a one-off payment-at the beginning of each year to help them buy necessary items such as books, equipment and course materials. You could not envisage a more disadvantaged group in our society than those receiving the young homeless rate of Austudy. It is an obnoxious measure to deprive people in that circumstance of the capacity to acquire basic textbooks. This is the government that goes on about how important it is to overcome educational disadvantage and address problems like literacy. How can you address educational difficulties if people cannot acquire the basic requisites necessary to undertake study? It is just an absolute outrage. It sits alongside a complementary measure announced at the same time in the budget to get rid of case management for students on the young homeless rate of Austudy. This is not embodied in this regulation, because that was a step that the government was able to do administratively. The idea of case management is to provide customised, individualised assistance to, again, some of the most disadvantaged people in our society-those getting the young homeless rate of Austudy-so that they may have some prospect of overcoming their educational disadvantage. The saving from the abolition of case management is $14V2 miIlion over four years. Getting rid of the incidentals allowance saves about $11 million over the four years of the forward estimates. These are not big bucks items; they can hardly be said to bear significantly on the government's overall fiscal position. They are just very obnoxious. The government may argue that case management is reinstating the old JPET scheme-job placement, employment and training. It is setting up a number of pilot programs at a cost of about $11 million. That does not offset the negative impact of theseÂ· other changes. For one thing, the financial balance clearly represents a cut in assistance to these students. JPET is going to take some time to wind up. It is just not the case that the pilot programs are a comprehensive substitute for the assistance provided through individualised case management and through the incidentals allowance. We think these are thoroughly objectionable measures. We did not object to everything that the government did in the budget. We did not have an in-principle objection, for example, to the actual means test changes. It does appear that there have been some major problems in the implementation of that. There have been a heap of complaints about the way that has been administered. But that is not the subject matter of today's debate. These are part of an overall combination of measures which will severely restrict access to higher education for many people. They represent the negation of what we should be trying to achieve in this area. We are already starting to see in enrolment patterns at universities clear evidence of the impact that the combination of these measures will have. The picture does vary from state to state, and the full effect of what the government is doing is in some cases being masked by other factors, such as in Queensland, where there is a significant growth in underlying demand. However, where you have a combination of institutions that service a high proportion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds-I think of institutions like the University of Western Sydney and some of the newer regional institutions-and courses that have a sharp increase in the level of fees payable, as in science and technology based courses, you start to see clear evidence of a deterrent effect. I refer to some research that was done when we were in government on the impact of HECS. It showed that HECS at the level that we in government had pitched it was not having a particularly substantial effect on participation decisions for the great majority of students. However, where you had combined characteristics of disadvantage, such as people from both low socio-economic backgrounds and rural and isolated areas, you did start to see the emergence of a significant deterrent effect. That arises from the effect of people being encumbered with substantial levels of debt. There is clear evidence that people from disadvantaged backgrounds are more averse to encumbering themselves with high levels of debt than people who are not. All those changes are obviously compounded by what is being done in the Austudy area to the extent that people do not have access to the full rate of Austudy they would have otherwise been entitled to, to the extent that they are forced to seek other forms of support, such as trading in part of their Austudy loan as is now permitted under the Austudy supplement arrangements where they can forgo $1 of grant income for $2 of concessionalloan. If you accumulate that with the effect of the HECS changes that this government has made, then you are starting to look at a very substantial disincentive effect. We do not yet have a complete picture of that because we do not yet have the full set of information about the take-up on offers of application at university. Most of the institutions are still going through the process of offering places. We will see the impact when those final numbers come through, but already it is clear that there is an effect there and that will be compounded. Clearly, reverting to the incidentals allowance, the foundations of educational disadvantage and the viability of equity programs are compromised and undermined to the extent that disadvantage at the school level, problems with literacy and behavioural problems, has emerged as a result of early educational disadvantage. If they are not addressed in a timely fashion, then you have a major problem. It has to be done partly through the early years of schooling, but the programs that we have-including the incidentals allowance and the case management of homeless Austudy recipients-are designed to provide the kids who are some of the most disadvantaged in our society with a degree of hope. In summary, we find these measures highly obnoxious and we were regrettably unsuccessful in our attempt to have these regulations disallowed in the Senate. I am sure we will be even less successful down here, but we believe very strongly that we need to take a strong stand on principle on this and we will be dividing on this disallowance motion.",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Sawford-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,16
3,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (9.47 p.m.)-It is worth noting that the regulations in question, which have been supported in the Senate, had already been amended to provide Austudy on an independent basis for everyone who turned 25. As the member for Sydney  a change to the original budget proposal, and I would like to thank the member for Sydney and others for drawing the government's attention to the consequences of the initial proposal. The other point I would like to make at the outset is that the raising of the age of independence has been grandfathered, so anyone who was getting Austudy because of their turning 22 last year will continue to get Austudy this year. They are important points to make at the beginning of this debate. At the end of the day, this debate is really about exactly what Austudy should be and what it should do. It is important to note that Austudy is an income supplement, not an income substitute. Austudy is an allowance paid to people in need. It is not an allowance paid automatically to students. It is not the educational equivalent of the dole, and that is why it has always been very tightly targeted, as the member for Sydney pointed out in his contribution. The parental means test begins to operate at about $23,000 per year taxable income and for many students their Austudy eligibility cuts out when parental income approaches $35,000. This is a benefit that is strictly targeted towards low and I suppose lower middle income families. In addition, we have, as the member for Sydney indicated, the actual means test implemented last year by the former government and continued this year-I would like to think improved and enhancedby the current government. I might have a little more to say about that in a moment. But the simple truth is that we cannot afford to pay all the 500,000 or so people in higher education in Australia $140 a week. We simply cannot afford to do it, and that is why Austudy is a targeted scheme. One of the other features of Austudy which distinguishes it from DSS benefits is that students on Austudy are able to earn I think up to $6,000 a year before their benefit starts to cut out. DSS beneficiaries are normally limited to about $30 a week. We as a government believe-the former government believed as well-that work enhances the student experience, that part-time work is an ordinary part of the life of a full-time student. One of the difficulties with reducing the age of independence to 22 is that we had, anecdotally, numerous students getting Austudy at the age of 22, dropping out of their part-time work but continuing to rely on mum and dad for income incidentals. Let us remember that there are already a number of grounds of independence apart from age. Marriage is a ground for independence, having a dependent child is a ground for independence, being self-supporting for three of the past four years is a ground for independence and being homeless-that is, being unable for all sorts of reasons to live in the family home-is a ground for independence. So there are many other ways in which people can be judged independent of their parents apart simply from the attainment of a certain chronological age. It should also be pointed out that in 1974, when the Whitlam government introduced the forerunner of Austudy, the age of independence was 25. In 1987, when the former Hawke government turned the tertiary education assistance scheme into Austudy-the current scheme-the age of independence was 25. It is only in 1993 that the age of independence began to be reduced, down to the age of 22 that applied last year. If having an age of independence at 25 is an injustice, for nine years it was an injustice connived at by members opposite, including the member for Sydney, and it was an injustice that was perpetrated by the former government. The fact is that it is not an injustice that students should be regarded as dependent until the age of 25. If they should not be judged on their parental income, there are many criteria on which they can gain independence. They should not be exempted from consideration of parental means simply because they tum 22almost any full-time student without substantial investment assets and income will qualify under the means test for Austudy if judged independently. The reality of the changes introduced at the beginning of 1993 by the former government is that the children of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would get Austudy when they turned 22 and Kerry Packer's children, if they were at university, would get Austudy when they turned 22. My position, and the position of the government, is that Jamie Packer should not get Austudy just because he has turned 22. Reducing the Austudy age of independence to 22 was a prime case of middle class welfare. I tum now to the schooling incidentals allowance. It was an allowance introduced by the former government just before the electi-on. Some could say it was a cynical, pre-election bribe and some could say it was something thrown into the youth statement at the last minute as a pre-election handout and as a sweetener, and as a desperate last roll of the dice. I am not suggesting for a second that such cynical statements would be true but the fact is that there was a problem with that allowance. It was $300 which may very well have been spent on ice cream at MCDonald's as well as on books and other necessities of schooling. So if the intention of the former government had been to ensure that students on the homeless rate of Austudy had better access to books and equipment there were a lot better ways of doing it than simply handing them an extra $300. Mr Sawford-But you didn't do it any better ways.",16
4,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,"I will come to that. In fact, the new government is assisting homeless youngsters in much more effective and much better targeted ways. Instead of the $3 million or so that was spent on the schooling incidentals allowance of the former government, we are committing $11 million to the jobs, placement, employment and training, or JPET, program and also committing $8 million to the youth homelessness pilot program. The member for Sydney in his contribution alluded to the disincentives that some people face because of the variations between Austudy allowances and DSS allowances. I accept that there are some disincentives. They are not new disincentives: they are disincentives that have existed for many years; they are disincentives which existed under the former government. It is a problem that the current government accepts and is one we are trying to address in the process of formulating our youth allowance. The member for Sydney raised the question of what he said were declining enrolments at universities. Yes, the figures are yet to be finalised for this year but it is possible that in quite a number of faculties there may be a decline in applications but, on the other hand, in other faculties there will be increases in applications. In the case of science enrolments, there has been a steady fall for some years. That is due fundamentally to falling numbers of students doing science at school. Applications overall fell six per cent last year and they did that in the absence of any increases in HECS charges. When HECS was first brought in in the late 1980s applications to go to university increased substantially. So it is certainly quite simplistic to say that the increases in HECS charges have contributed to a dramatic decrease in university enrolments-they have not; there is no evidence; it is not logical; it does not stand up. Finally, the member for Sydney alluded to the actual means test. Various people on the coalition backbench, various people on the opposition benches and, indeed, various independent members of parliament have drawn the government's attention to some problems. The imputation of values of expenditure was a problem last year and it is a problem again. It is unclear whether anticipated Austudy payments should be included in prospective educational expenses; that was a problem last year and it is a problem again this year. I think members on all sides of the House will find that the departmental motto in this, as in all things, is, 'We will listen; will learn; and where necessary we will act.'",17
5,Mr SA WFORD,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,"Whatever the fudge or the spin that the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) or the  this is nothing but a betrayal of young Australians by this government. Increasing the age of independence for Austudy from 22 to 25 and abolishing the incidentals allowance from January next year are just more pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that will see the government rejected at the ballot box much sooner than the pundits predict. Basically, this is an attack on low to middle income earners, whom this government so comprehensively conned at the last election. When I look at the front-bench of the government I see a lot of blase contentment. I do not see anybody with any empathy or understanding of the difficulties that low to middle income earners face in their efforts to raise families and provide educational opportunities for their children. Of course government members can say that on 2 March last year the Australian electorate put its faith in the coalition in a resounding way, but there is a very big 'but'-when it comes to anything to do with education, this is a coalition government that cannot cut the mustard. The Austudy age of independence is a case in point. The coalition suffers from a very convenient memory loss. In 1991 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training released a report on student financial assistance, known as the Price report. The committee's membership included the Labor members for Chifley, Brisbane, Forde, Moreton, Lalor, Cowan and me, as the member for Port Adelaide. The four Labor members on that committee who remain here have not forgotten the report. It was a unanimous report, by the way, which recommended changes to Austudy. On that committee there were four coalition members who remain as members of this House. They are the Deputy Leader of the National Party and Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson); the Minister for Veterans' we Affairs, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott); the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford); and the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). What did they support in March 1991? They supported the same recommendation as the Labor members of the committee, recommendation II A. I remind the House that it said: The independence eligibility criteria for independent status for Austudy be reduced progressively to age 21 over the next four budgets. They endorsed that decision because to suggest that people can be presumed to be financially dependent on their parents until they are in their mid-twenties is clearly untenable. The 1991 decision was the correct one. That judgement was the sensible one. But now the coalition have sold out young people. They have betrayed their actions, their beliefs and their commitments, then and now. I would like to hear why they have changed their commitments to young Australians. This government is very keen on using the term 'financial black hole' in attacking the previous Labor government, but where is the government's stance on the social black hole it is creating for so many Australians? The decision to save $210 million dollars over four years takes the money out of the pockets of students. As a result, 13,700 students will have their payments reduced and 12,000 will become completely ineligible-a total of 25,000 students will be adversely affected by this decision. Where is there any evidence of social ethics and social responsibility in this government? The former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, in an article in the Australian today, certainly had a change of mind on social ethics. We do need economic responsibility, but it needs to be balanced with social and moral responsibility. I refer the many new coalition members to the work of coalition colleagues and Labor members who worked on the Price report. On the issue of independent status for tertiary students, it is worth examining the views of the National Union of Students, of the Institute of Family Studies and of DEET. As the shadow minister at the table, the  the National Union of Students stated: ... the overwhelming source of most complaints from their members on Austudy was the question of independent status. Another student body stated the very obvious, that 18 is the verified age of independence in most areas: voting, licences, alcohol consumption and so on. There is no logic whatsoever in moving the age of independence back to 25 years of age. The Institute of Family Studies argued, and I again quote from the report: ... Austudy together with most other allowances is largely built on assumptions that all but a very small number of young people have support from their parents in the early teenage years. The institute stated that young people choose to move on or are forced to move to independent level for various reasons at different ages and stages of development with every different personal and financial resources. The age for independent Austudy will now be 25 years, while for jobsearch allowance it is 18 years and over. At the time of the report, DEET explained that this reflected the fact that Austudy is generally available over a longer period than the then unemployment benefits and that there was an expectation that parents would contribute to their student children under the age of 25. However, one DEET officer really let the cat out of the bag when he told the committee: I cannot think of any educational research that is available to us to suggest that 25 is the appropriate age. Exactly, because none exists. There is absolutely no research, no rationale, no process, no outcome that will support the actions of the government. Those on the government side who know anything about education know this. This is economic responsibility without social responsibility. It is economic good without public good. It is private good without moral good. The action of this government in changing the age of independent status to 25 years takes public policy on income support for tertiary students backwards to an age that no longer exists. It ought to be comprehensively rejected. I challenge the members of the coalition, particularly the members for Gwydir, Maranoa, MCPherson, La Trobe, Warringah and Sturt, to defend these regressive policies in this chamber and to recant on the commitment they made in 1990 and 1991 which led to the publication of the Price report. The ceasing of the schooling incidentals allowance is another exceptionally mean measure. It saves $11 million over four years. That is how much the government has taken from the most needy of students. One hundred thousand young people are unemployed-$2 a week. Measly! It is estimated that 8,500 students will be disadvantaged by this measure. It is a one-off payment of $300 payable at the beginning of each year to help homeless Austudy/Abstudy students complete their secondary education, by assisting with study expenses such as books, equipment and course costs. It is not a very large outlay, but it is a very important one for recipients. It can make the difference between a young person undertaking or completing a course of study or dropping out altogether. The government has not even attempted to defend this decision in its budget papers, nor can it, because once again this decision reveals nothing but the meanness of spirit which runs through many of. its policies, especially those from which Aboriginal people might receive some benefit. It seems that the most vigorous cost cutting measures are made to programs which provide support for Aboriginal people. Perhaps the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has more friends on the government benches than she realises. This measure reveals a complete lack of understanding and empathy for the hardships that low to middle income families face. The same group of students will also be hit by another mean budget measure: the ceasing of case management of secondary students on the student homeless rate of Austudy or Abstudy. This program assisted homeless secondary Austudy/Abstudy students to stay on and complete their studies, achieve family reconciliation and, in the case of year 12 students, make the transition from school to work or further education and training. This measure saves $1.5 million over four years. That is piddling, measly and mean. The total that this government has swindled out of young Australians continues to mount up. The government's action bares for all to see its lack of prudence and lack of care and responsibility towards the aspirations of ordinary young Australians who, by furthering their education, contribute to the further wealth of this nation. I remind the members for Warringah and Sturt that the people of Australia did not vote for these actions. These are yet more examples of the government's continuing betrayal of people, especially young people. This is a government without conscience, without any vision of national identity or national interest. It thinks standing still is progress. This is a government that is going headlong back into the past. It is supported by a front-bench which believes its own propaganda to manipulate lesser choices for Australians and by a large backbench which has learned to conform, be uniform and exclusive and not to step out of line. This is a government with no openness, no diversity and no inclusiveness. It is a government for a tiny privileged minority of Australians. That is not at all how they promised it would be.  already been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), this matter was defeated in the Senate last December when introduced by Senator Nick Bolkus. As a consequence, there is no possibility that these regulations can be disallowed. So, in effect, all we are doing this morning is spending an hour of the Commonwealth's time debating an issue which is already closed, which I think speaks volumes for the facile nature of the member  member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) in coming in here today to debate an issue which is already closed, simply as a matter of point scoring. Mr Sawford-We'll be sending a copy of your speech to the Adelaide University, my son.  speech to the members of the university. It would give me more publicity. I turn firstly to the contribution by the member for Port Adelaide, which was, unfortunately-knowing him as I do-sadly full of cant and humbug. He used phrases like 'the betrayal of young Australians', 'meanness of spirit' and 'letting down young Australians from low socio-economic backgrounds', and asked about the rationale for the age of 25. Why wasn't the member for Adelaide asking all these questions in the 13 years of Labor government when they did not introduce the schooling incidentals allowance until just before a federal election, and for the 11 years of Labor government while the Austudy age was 25 and was only brought down to 22 in 1992? Why weren't you asking those questions then? You say that we have betrayed young Australians. If you are to be believed, then you have betrayed young Australians for 13 years and 11 years on both those counts. That is beside the fact that you betrayed young Australians for your entire term of office in higher education through the introduction of HECS, increasing it three times, and a number of other matters which I will deal with later. One specific matter mentioned by the member for Port Adelaide was how the coalition government is attacking indigenous Australians particularly, and non-indigenous Australians. That is an absolute nonsense. If he looked to the facts of the situation, he would know that on two counts the coalition government has specifically excluded indigenous Australians for better treatment. Those are a bill that was introduced in the early part of the coalition's term last year which put aside $140 million extra for indigenous educationit was an indigenous education bill-and the budget itself, in which the coalition put special positions aside for indigenous Australians through their 4,000 scholarships for higher education and also put extra money into indigenous education. So the member for Port Adelaide should check his facts before he makes such absurd claims. The member for Port Adelaide also said that the coalition was letting down young Australians from low socio-economic backgrounds. It is quite the opposite. In fact, letting down his own people in Port Adelaide by making such a claim. Austudy, for the last four years, has been available to people from the age of 22 deemed to be independent because of their age, regardless of the means of their families. As a consequence, Austudy has been paid to many people from comfortable and rich backgrounds instead of people from low socio-economic backgrounds. If you take money and give it to people who do not require it-people from wealthy and comfortable backgrounds-simply because of their age, you inevitably affect people from low socio-economic backgrounds in the other programs that you can provide to them, because the government's pool of money is limited. In terms of the rationale for the age of 25, the member for Port Adelaide might like to know that the Labor Party introduced the age of 25 on two occasions: when they first introduced this measure for Austudy in 1974, and again in 1987 when they changed the measure. That is why we are going back to that age. Austudy should be targeted to the low socio-economic groups. Raising the age from 22 to 25 will help achieve this by ensuring that students from comfortable and rich backgrounds will face a means test on their family means until the age of 25. It is difficult to understand how the member for Sydney, the member for Port Adelaide and the Labor Party can feel passionate about this measure when for 18 years-from 1974 until 1992-it was 25 years of age. For 11 years of Labor government-if you include the Whitlam period, the Hawke period and the Keating period-it was 25. Now, all of a sudden, with great humbug, they come into the parliament and into the Senate and decry this change as though it is striking at the of students and their capacity. In fact, the member for Sydney described it as 'a high priority for Labor when in government'. A high priority, indeed, that took nine years for them to introduce! The result of reducing the age to 22 will be that those on higher incomes are able to receive Austudy for their children, as the means test is not applied to the newly independent class of student. Those genuinely in he is need will continue to receive Austudy unabated. There is no change to that. The parliamentary secretary pointed that out. If you are a low income family, then there is no change. If you are married, if you have dependent children, if you have worked for three of the last four years, if you are an orphan, a refugee or homeless, or if you have parents who cannot provide you with home or support, then you will have Austudy. So the member for Sydney's comment that this will create barriers to entry simply does not stand up. The government has taken a fiscally responsible approach to income support for children. We have maintained a grants scheme, we have maintained the current rate of Austudy in very difficult budgetary times as a consequence of Labor's term in office, and we have tried to target the scheme to the most needynot to the children of rich parents who want to cruise through their last years at university at taxpayers' expense. Turning to the abolition of the schooling incidentals allowance, the member for Sydney described it as 'an absolute outrage and an obnoxious measure to deprive young homeless'. It is such an obnoxious measure that it took 13 years for the Labor Party to introduce it and a few months before the 1996 election for them to decide that it was an absolute outrage that young homeless children were not able to access $300 for books and other things for their schooling! The reality is that the $300 allowance that was being paid to young homeless children in the last 12 months was not in the least bit targeted, was utterly uncontrolled by the department, and there was no control over how it was spent. As a consequence, we have no idea whether it was spent on books, or heart shoes, or whatever else, or whether it was spent on rollerblades or other things that might have been used by these people. The coalition, on the other hand, while setting aside this allowance, is spending more money on young homeless people through two measures. We are introducing the youth homelessness pilot program which will provide $8.1 million in additional funding over three years to improve the level of engagement of homeless young people or those at risk of being homeless in family work, education, training and the community. The primary focus of this youth homeless pilot program will be on family reconciliation and early intervention. We have put $8.1 million into actually trying to achieve something for young homeless people, rather than simply giving them a benefit which encourages the idea that they can stay away from their families when obviously the best solution to all the problems is for them to be reunited with their families, the House. for them to achieve some reconciliation, for the reasons they left their homes to be changed and for those in the homes who created the problems to change their ways. The other way we will achieve this is through the reintroduction of JPET-the job placement, employment and training program-which will provide targeted assistance to homeless and disadvantaged young people who are looking for work or are wanting to continue or re-enter full-time education. Finally, I will make some general comments on Labor's record on education. The member for Sydney made some general comments in his speech about how the coalition was basically striking at the heart of access to higher education by young people. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party is extraordinary in this term of government. They come into this House time and time again to debate education bills-the member for Port Adelaide does it regularly; this is the fourth I have had to follow him in a debate and had to point out the errors of his ways and he unfortunately still has not learnt from any of my contributions-trying to wear the clothes of the student activist, the student advocate, when for 13 years the Labor Party undermined, betrayed and slapped in the face the National Union of Students, which they were supposed to be aligned with and supposed to represent. Time and time again they came in here and hypocritically changed higher education in a way that affected students. There are many examples, such as the introduction of HECS which they promised they would not do before the election but they introduced immediately after the election. They promised again that they would not increase HECS for current students and they increased it three times in one parliament. They introduced full fees for postgraduate students, they reduced per capita funding per student and they widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Unfortunately, while I have more things to say and I am sure the Labor members would like to learn as much as they can about higher education from me, time does not permit me to continue. I commend these regulations to",18
6,Mr FILING,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,"I point  I had forgotten completely, was a signatory to that report",22
7,Mr FILING,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,"I beg your pardon. It was not you because you were not around at that time. But a number of your colleagues were. I would like to make a couple of observations. The first is that you have fallen into the same trap as the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) in assuming that anybody on this side is going to be siding, or in some way connected, with the Labor Party. That assumption or convention that the Leader of the House is undertaking almost continuously is not only offensive but also does not help the better workings of the House. I point that out because I know you are a sensible member and you would understand that, under those circumstances, that can be quite offensive. At time the moment, the coalition backbench is in absolute turmoil over the question of Austudy. ",22
8,Mr FILING,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,"That is unusual, because their happiness is not being radiated around the House. Certainly, the happiness is not being expressed in their verbatim comments about how the new changes to Austudy are being effected. I know that the member for Sturt is a close colleague of Senator Vanstone, and the parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), is the poor bunny responsible for fronting the brunt of the wrath of the coalition backbenchers. They, along with me and, I am sure, a number of Labor members, would be receiving countless calls from constituents who are upset, confused and, in some cases, bewildered by the changes that are taking place. In particular, bearing in mind that this does not strictly relate to the changes to the assets income test relating to Austudy, the totality of these changes, which were effected some time ago, is causing a considerable amount of angst amongst the very people who elected the coalition government. In other words, their core constituency is angry about these particular measures. I just wanted to point out something that my colleague the member Oxley (Ms Hanson) pointed out. When you look at the range of pre-tax income of these people we are talking about, and we have to bear in mind that these people are raising, in many cases, two, three or four children, we find that it cuts in at $23,000 per annum and then cuts out completely at $35,000 per annum. The coalition knows this. When I was part of the coalition, I was part of the discussions that took place in relation to the income levels that are necessary in order to properly raise, educate, feed and clothe a family. When you consider the high rates of tax, the superannuation contributions, the Medicare levy, the private health insurance contributions, the clothing costs, and so on, and the fact that a 22-year-old is now obliged to be considered to be dependent for the purposes of Austudy, you can understand the tremendous financial constraints that these families would be under. These are the core coalition constituency groups. I know that the backbench are upset about this because they recognise that these are the very same people who elected the coalition to power. Those backbenchers who are on knife edge margins are starting to sweat because there is talk of a double dissolution this year in order for the government to achieve a majority in the Senate. Those backbenchers are starting to perhaps consider that their might be coming because of some of the changes that have been effected. These changes have been effected in a way that is not consistent. As the parliamentary secretary did not quite say, they are not consistent with the policy as expressed by the coalition prior to the election or, as the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) pointed out, the strong views held by significant members of the coalition when they and signed off on the Price report on Austudy. One of the consistent complaints from my constituents is that it is easier to go on the dole than to stick around and study. We have this ludicrous situation in this country of people wanting to educate themselves but, because of their financial circumstances because of the combination of the tests fo; Austudy, it being easier for them to go on the dole and sit and watch television or to drop their ambition of being able to study and qualify themselves to not only make this country a smarter country but also put ourselves in a position to be able to compete with our neighbours. We have to realise that, in these particular regulations that the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) has sought to have disallowed, one ought to differentiate between the two measures. I want to particularly deal with the question of the qualifying age for Austudy or the age threshold for consideration as independent. One of the problems in any family relationship is that after 22, or for that matter before 22, what happens in the case where, for instance, the siblings are estranged from their parents? In other words, they cannot get on or there are some particular problems in their relationship that makes it difficult for them to be considered to be dependent. Also in my electorate I have had a number of complaints in relation to the application of these tests. For example, a 22-year-old constituent contacted me because he has been refused Austudy to support him during his surveying and mine engineering course. He has been self-sufficient from his parents for three years, although he boards with them at a cost of $200 per month-and $200 per time month is a fairly sizeable outgoing. They are unable to support him due to significant costs related to their mortgage and their other children, but he has been refused Austudy on the basis of their income even though he has no access to it and they are no longer responsible for him legally or otherwise. He works one day a week as this is all his curriculum will allow. Ironically, if he registered for unemployment for the six months prior to taking his course, he may have been eligible for Austudy. Again, we have this strange set of circumstances. The member for Sydney, unfortunately, smiles too early because this concoction has arrived at this point thanks also to a number of measures that were undertaken during the period of the Labor government.  ence-we brought it down.",22
9,Mr FILING,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,"I was going to say that the Labor government during its 13 years fundamentally failed to alter the demography of the universities and tertiary institutions. That is true, isn't it? In actual fact there has been no effective change in the demography. I listened from time to time to the member for Sydney when he was the minister for education and I listened in particular to some of the research that was undertaken to look at the demography in relation to tertiary institutions and universities. My view was that it was the considered opinion that there was little effective change. The measures undertaken by the Labor government over its 13 years have failed to bring tertiary education to the socio-economic groupings that they wanted to. Mr Sawford-We had the second highest expenditure in the world. Acknowledge that.",24
10,Mr FILING,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,Let me make an observation for the member for Port Adelaide. Please do not tag or chain expenditure to outcomes. You are the one talking about moral and social justice and sort of decrying the economic bottom line of the government's measures; but at the same time there has to be some means of measuring how effective this expenditure IS. Mr Sawford-I'm not arguing that.,24
11,Mr FILING,AUSTUDY REGULATIONS,"Of course. I am saying that, under the 13 years of your government, under Hawke-Keating administrations, there was no effective change. In conclusion, may I make a couple of other comments. What the member for Sturt said in his speech is a little hard to understand. I am still unable to understand where the 25 years comes from. He says it comes from the Labor had Party's measures from 1974 and 1987. I was a member of backbench committees in the coalition and, if that were the case, I would be absolutely appalled. If it is, it is purely and simply cynically political. There is no justification other than 'you .can get away with it because the Labor Party did it before'. Let us look at it in reality. People who are 18 years old are able to vote, presumably are able to go and fight for their countries, and are able to go and get a jobsearch allowance. You have a situation where there is now a notional age of independence at 25, and I think that flies in the face of the philosophy of the coalition. Back in the time when I was a member of the coalition, those of us who believe in trying to break the question of dependence considered that people ought to be more independent at an earlier age. In particular, where families are unable, effectively, to support a tertiary student on what are quite low incomes and where there is a cutting off or a withdrawal of Austudy, that has to be the case. The question of homeless youth, a matter raised by the member for Port Adelaide, is a vexed question. I was a policeman for nine years. I had a lot of dealings with kids who were homeless on the streets in Perth. It is one of those things that you cannot just keep throwing money at. The coalition, in talking about the money it is expending on homeless youth, is also falling into a similar trap, although I suspect that it is probably trying desperately to appear to be all things to all people on this particular point. Let me make an observation. There have been some interesting studies done by some of the non-government service providers on the reasons why some of the kids are homeless and out on the streets. An interesting facet of the studies I have seen is that, in many instances, they are on the streets because they want to be, because in actual fact they are trying to get a more libertarian lifestyle away from their parents at an earlier age. Certainly, many of the kids I dealt with when I was a policeman who were homeless on the streets of Perth you could not take back home because they did not want to go back home-not because they were being abused, belted up, or whatever, but because they wanted to be out on the street effectively availing themselves of things they wanted to do, including sex, drugs and alcohol. I am just saying that on that score it is a mistake to merely quote the amount of money that is being thrown at it. I have had some first-hand experience and, I might say, am very close to some of the non-government service providers. In particular, I have looked at some of the studies they have done amongst the very people we are talking about. I think there is a trap in just merely assuming that throwing money at it is going to solve it. That was 13 years of false thinking on the part of the previous Labor administration. I will stick to my commitment to the parliamentary secretary and finish, but I will say that, in the totality of the changes to Austudy, I hope the government is going to think again. I know its backbench is smarting. I know the hotlines are running red hot. I can well understand the parliamentary secretary being more than keen to see all the problems of Austudy blown away so the government can get on with other things. Question put:  to.

12,Mr OCONNOR,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Corio) (10.42 a.m.)PAIRS The Productivity Commission Bill 1996 is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the parliament this session. It is this legislation that gives effect to the amalgamation Â·of several statutory economic advisory bodies to create one powerful, 1996 singular source of economic advice to the federal government. The Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Council are the advisory bodies which will be amalgamated to form the new Productivity Commission. It is critically important to Australia's overall future economic development that the federal government of the day, of whatever political persuasion, not only has access to the best quality economic advice but can call upon a diversity of advice and opinion from within its own bureaucracy when making the momentous economic decisions it is called upon to make in the interests of all Australians. It is the federal government, through its fiscal policy framework, that can exert great influence over the living standards of all Australians. It is the federal government, through its monetary policy framework, that influences the cost of finance to businesses and households throughout Australia. It is therefore with considerable concern that I note in this bill that the government has centralised the source of independent economic advice from within its own bureaucracy into one body, the Productivity Commission. There are very real dangers to government and indeed to the Australian community in this centralisation of economic advice. Quality economic outcomes for the nation can only come from quality economic advice delivered professionally from a variety of sources. Economics is not an exact science, and practitioners often bear the brunt of the cruelest jokes in a professional sense. It is a discipline open to varied interpretations of the the variables in that discipline. Indeed, we have witnessed over the past couple of days in the House during the debate on the charter of budget honesty government ministers and members distorting economic reality in a most deceitful manner for their own political ends. I refer also to the Hansard of Monday, 10 February, when the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in an answer in question time, had this to say: It is the policy of this government to throwaway the failure of 13 years of Labor ... He continued: As we have said, you cannot tum around 13 years of failure in 11 months but this government has made a start on those problems . . . The chief economic officer in the nation was handed an economy that had grown at four per cent over the last four years. The previous government broke the back of inflation and passed on a low inflation regime to the coalition; it left interest rates in single digits and an economy with industrial disputation at the lowest level it had been for years and an unemployment rate coming down. If you like, a golden egg was left to the coalition. And the chief economic officer in the nation regards that as a failure. The Treasurer's remarks in question time demonstrate the point I am making-that is, the importance of obtaining a range of economic advice for the chief economic officer in this country. Given the Treasurer's appalling lack of understanding of economic fundamentals, it is really a double imperative that he get a breadth of economic advice to input into his decision making and that input should come from a variety of sources from within his own bureaucracy. This debate on the Productivity Commission Bill is timely because, as I speak in this House today, the Industry Commission cum the Productivity Commission is considering the future of key manufacturing industries that form the backbone of Geelong's regional economy. The Industry Commission recently published its draft report on the automotive industry in Australia, and it is currently taking public submissions for its inquiry into the textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing industries in Australia. All of these industries, it is estimated, employ around 7,000 people directly in the Geelong region. Many more people employed in small businesses throughout the region depend on the income flows in the community that are generated by those employed in these key industries in the city. Therefore, the economic future of the region is inextricably linked to the immediate future of car and component manufacturing and textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing in Geelong. Further dramatic falls in employment in these industries would have a devastating flow-on effect on other businesses in the area and the overall employment levels in the region. Therefore, it is with absolute and utter dismay that I continue to read and hear that the member for Corangamite, Mr Stewart MCArthur, who is in the House today, is continuing to advocate in this place the zero tariff policy for these industries of the discredited Fightback policy platform. That Fightback policy platform was soundly rejected by the people of Geelong in 1993 and again in 1996. I listened with deep concern to the contribution that was made by the honourable member for Corangamite in the debate last night. The contribution that he made demonstrated once again how remote he is from the hopes, aspirations and concerns of workers in car and component manufacturing and textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing in Geelong. The member for Corangamite mounted his usual theoretical defence of free market economics and laissez-faire economic systems, and he left us in no doubt last night-as well as in other places and forums-about his commitment and dedication to economic rationalism. Perhaps he might tell the 450 ASTAAS workers recently made redundant in Geelong because of the withdrawal of financial support by the federal government about the great benefits of that economic rationalist approach to government intervention and economic activity. Perhaps the member for Corangamite might like to take himself down to Godfrey Hirst and talk to the management about the level playing field in that free enterprise mecca in the United States of America. I think they could tell him a thing or two about the difficulty they have had in accessing that particular market. If the doors close on Godfrey Hirst, I suggest the honourable member stand outside the factory gate as the redundant workers file out and give them copies of his speech lauding the great benefits of laissez-faire capitalism. It would make good bedtime reading for the children of those redundant workers who will go without because their parents have lost their jobs in these industries. I do not intend to engage in theoretical economic debate on a discredited economic philosophy which is, as we know, the magnificent obsession of the member for Corangamite. I am more interested in expressing on the floor of this House the concerns of the workers in the industries of car and component manufacturing and textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing in Geelong about the Industry Commission reports and where the government might take them. Down in Geelong, the member for Corangamite is affectionately known as Captain Zero-the man who would sacrifice the economic future of Geelong on the altar of zero tariffs. He is known as a man who, in his blind economic prejudice, is prepared to put the livelihoods of around 7,000 workers and their families at risk in our area and condemn the Geelong region to another decade of economic deprivation and struggle. As the member for Corangamite drives into Geelong from his farm in the western district, let him contemplate the devastation that might flow from the policies that he is advocating on the floor of this House. What the Geelong community wants to know is when the member for Corangamite is going to stand up in this place and represent the interests of the community that forms an important part of his electorate. There are many car workers and textile workers who live on the other side of the Barwon River and who are very concerned that the member for Corangamite is selling them out in this place and in this debate. They are naturally anxious to know when the member for Corangamite is going to heed the concerns of local manufacturers about their future or when he will listen to the pleadings of local businesses, unions and community leaders on the impact the substantial job losses in these industries will have on the region. The member for Corangamite is hopelessly out of touch and isolated in the Geelong community on this issue. However, he is also isolated in his own caucus, which is badly divided on this issue. I note with interest a Financial Review article on Wednesday, 6 November in which the views of the Liberal member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) in South Australia were expressed. Her electorate is. the home of the Mitsubishi engine plant. She had this to say on the car tariff issue, as expressed in the article: Ms Jeanes said there was a 'deeply held concern' in the industry and wider community that the reductions of tariffs on cars and components should be more closely aligned with those of our trading partners, particularly the developing countries which had 'far higher trade barriers and protection levels than Australia'. 'Any negative impact on the industry will see an extension of our unemployment queues in Kingston, further dampen the fragile South Australian economy, contribute to an expanding trade deficit for the automotive industry and further erode our overall balance of payments problem.' I congratulate the member for Kingston on her views on this issue because those she has raised mirror my own views which have been expressed on the floor of this House in grievance debates and in my own submission to the Industry Commission on the automotive inquiry currently under way. Of course, the people in Geelong are asking why, if the Liberal member for Kingston can stick up for the car industry in her electorate, the member for Corangamite cannot come into this place, stand on the floor of this House and stick up for car workers, component workers and textile, clothing and footwear workers in Geelong. The simple fact is that the member for Corangamite is isolated in the Geelong community on this issue. There are deep divisions within his own caucus ranks on the tariff issue, and I urge him today to recant, re-think and abandon the commitment he has articulated to economic rationalism, the level playing field and zero tariffs. When Labor took office in 1983, it inherited an economy in a shambles, an economy with over 10 per cent unemployment, 10 per cent inflation, low growth, double-digit interest rates and an economy structurally unfit for the challenges of the 1980s and 1990s. Labor inherited an automotive industry that was racked by industrial division; it was an inward looking uncompetitive industry with no capacity for exports and a management comfortable behind a protection wall of 57 per cent with little or no incentive to invest in new capital equipment or labour retraining. In government we changed all that, knowing that a radical restructuring was necessary to preserve at least some substantial levels of employment as the industry faced its new global challenges. Labor ushered in a new era of industrial cooperation in the car industry in Geelong and elsewhere. We provided huge incentives to companies to invest in new capital equipment and in the skills of their work force. Labor encouraged the industry to innovate, to unleash its creative talents and to enter export markets with confidence in its competitive position. The results have been staggering, and the gains to the national economy have been substantial. Australia's car industry is now internationally competitive, with high productivity, good export performance with the production of quality cars and a commitment from the industry to invest to maintain its competitive position. I pay tribute to the work force in Geelong and elsewhere which has played its role in ushering in this new era of competitiveness for the car industry. Indeed, it was under Labor's policies that the jobs of car and component industry workers and the jobs of clothing, textile and footwear workers in Geelong have been secured. The people of the Geelong region know very clearly the differing views of me as the member for Corio and of the member for Corangamite on this and other issues. I am on the public record calling on the federal government to reject the IC report and to hold tariff levels at 15 per cent beyond the year 2000 until Australian manufacturers can gain reasonable access to overseas markets that are currently denied them. The member for Corangamite, in contrast, wants to drive the tariff levels down further to zero per cent. I am on the public record supporting the export assistance programs used by local car and textile, clothing and footwear companies to boost their export performance. The member for Corangamite is on the public record supporting the slashing of these programs. I am on the public record supporting a continuation of the labour market programs that have delivered significant productivity gains to Ford and Godfrey Hirst in my electorate. The member for Corangamite, on the other hand, is on the public record supporting the emasculation of the programs. I am on the public record supporting the maintenance of the 150 per cent R&D incentive for companies such as Ford and Henderson Springs in my electorate, whose research capacity is now in danger because of this government's budgetary actions. The member for Corangamite is on the public record supporting the budget position in slashing these concessions. Let the Geelong community be in no doubt as to the massive differences between the Labor and Liberal parliamentary representatives from the region on this issue. The Geelong community is mobilising itself to oppose the recommendations of the Industry Commission which may devastate the region. I urge citizens to sign the community petition being circulated by my colleague the  Loney, and I congratulate him for his hard work in circulating this petition throughout the length and breadth of the electorate. I congratulate him also on the support that he is getting from the car workers in the north of Geelong. I also urge citizens to attend the public rally at Rippleside Park on 21 February to protest against the Industry Commission recommendations. I pass on my congratulations to the Secretary of the Geelong Trades Hall, John Kranz, and to the Mayor of Geelong, Councillor Gerry Smith, who have thrown their collective weight behind this rally. We are hoping for a massive turnout to that rally. In my own submission to the Industry Commission I put some very simple propositions that I think will demonstrate a clear commitment by government to the preservation of a strong, viable, productive, export orientated industry in Australia. I have recommended a pause in tariff reductions at the year 2000. I have proposed action by government in the forthcoming budget to stimulate the demand for cars by lowering the sales tax on them. I have suggested action to restore the range of research and development and export incentives abolished in the 1996 budget. I have advocated restoration of the labour market programs that have assisted auto manufacturing and textile and clothing manufacturing in my electorate. I have proposed greater action to improve the overall age of the Australian car park. Let there be no doubt about the future directions of industry policy in 1996 under a new Labor government. That policy has been outlined by the shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), on several occasions. In September 1996, he said this at a conference in Queensland about the future directions of Labor policy: We believe that government does have a role in working with industry to(1) build exports (2) smart research, and (3) jobs. He said: The reality is we need a more active industry policy-one which recognises the limits of the market philosophy, one which actively encourages and supports the manufacturing sector. Of course, on 21 October, in a speech to the MTIA national forum, the member for Hotham made several key points and commitments to a future Labor industry policy. He made these points: 1. There is a role for government in industry policy. 2. There isn't a level playing field. 3. Labor is committed to supporting a strong manufacturing industry. Again, on 5 December, in a paper outlining Labor's approach to industry policy, he said this: In the long term we will continue to argue that Australia needs a government which sees manufacturing industry policy as at least as important as support for rural and resource industries. You cannot get a clearer commitment to the manufacturing sector than that. In conclusion, let me say that the member for Corangamite is prepared to come into this House and sell out the 7,000 Geelong car and component workers and the workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industries. That is something that I will not do on the floor of this House. The member for Corangamite's view is a cynical betrayal of the Geelong region. I will make sure that every car worker, every component worker and every textile, clothing and footwear worker has access to the speech that he made on the floor of this parliament last night. Those views expressed will, in the long term, destroy the very jobs on which their families rely. (Time expired)",26
13,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"The bills before this House are bad policy. They will lead to further bad policy. They are bad policy because they reduce the sources of advice that go to government and they narrow the range and focus of that advice. I have said previously in this place that one of the great strengths of the Commonwealth system and Australian national government is the strength which comes from the diversity of views and the scrutiny of those views. As we all play our part in the search for better public policy, the diversity and scrutiny of views and independent, free professional and fearless advice help lead the way in our endeavours to make better public policy decisions. Why these bills are so wrong and such bad policy and will lead to further bad policy is that they reduce the sources and diversity of advice to government. The provisions of the bill ensure that the focus and range of advice will be narrowed. What these bills do is essentially roll three separate forms of advice into one. The Industry Commission, responsible to the Treasury portfolio, the Bureau of Industry Economics, responsible to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, and EPAC, the Economic Planning and Advisory Council, responsible to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, will be all rolled into one. We might just as well have rolled ABARE into them as well. Why not knock off the research bureau for our primary industries and energy portfolio as well, if that is the approach you wish to take. The key component in this range of measures is to effectively roll those three bodies into one and change the name of the Industry Commission to the Productivity Commission. The Industry Commission has a long history in the development of public policy in Australia. When you track back its history, you will find that the Industry Commission was previously known as the Industries Assistance Commission and, before that, as the Tariff Board. What we have seen in the history of, firstly, the Tariff Board and, ultimately, Industry Commission and now the proposed Productivity Commission is the provision of independent advice to government. It was not always so, of course, that the Tariff Board provided, or was allowed to provide, independent advice to government. This is not the first time in history that we have seen a coalition government seek to nobble either the range or sources of advice to it. I will make some comments in respect of the former Minister for Trade, Mr MCEwen, and the Tariff Board in due course. I was very impressed with the speech by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), in which he comprehensively skinned the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur). Mr Warwick Smith-He's doing press releases.",30
14,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"As the minister at the table interjects, the honourable member for Corio is off sending direct mail and press releases to all the members of the Geelong community. I read the speech of the member for Corangamite myself. I was pleased to see that at least the member for Corangamite has some sense or notion of the corporate history involved in the Tariff Board and the Industry Commission. He referred in his contribution to the book by Alf Rattigan on the Tariff Board called The Inside Story. As part of my holiday reading, I read the biography on MCEwen, which makes some interesting comments along similar lines. I will bring the House to them later. Mr Warwick Smith-Are you going to come across?",31
15,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"My point in referring to MCEwen is not to take up the invitation of the minister at the table to come across but to ask the question, 'Where is the National Party in this debate?' MCEwen would be rolling in this grave at the craven way in which the National Party has allowed a Liberal Treasurer to skin them in this area. I will come to that shortly. The dangers of these bills and the way in which the diversity of advice and the focus of the advice to government will be reduced could be no more clearly set out than in the provisions of the bill itself and in the terms of the amendment to the second reading, which has been moved by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). When one turns to clause 6, part 2, of the Productivity Commission Bill, one's attention is drawn to the sorts of issues which the proposed Productivity Commission is asked to take note of. Reference is made to 'the productivity performance of industry or of the economy as a whole' and 'any factor that affects or might affect productivity performance, including labour market practices' . In subclause 8(a) there is an express requirement that 'the commission must have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth government to improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity'. Subclause 8(b) says 'to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes'. Subclause 8(c) says 'to reduce regulation of industry'. All these provisions are consistent with the approach to industry policy we have seen this government take since it came to office. That those provisions are so narrow is highlighted by the provisions of the amendment moved by the member for Holt. The amendment reads: ... the House: (1) expresses its concern at the monopolisation economic advice under the Treasury portfolio ... the disappearance of independent sources of economic and industry policy advice to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism ... On the basis of what we have seen to date, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) certainly needs some independent advice because at the moment, so far as industry policy is concerned, more means less. Every time the minister for industry has a loss around the cabinet table, he issues a press release or makes a public comment to the effect, 'I could have lost more, therefore it is a victory.' It is certainly the case that the minister requires more advice in the industry policy area, not less-certainly not the domination of advice on the industry and economic area by Treasury. The second part of the amendment refers to concern about the centralising of economic industry policy advice under one minister, the Treasurer. The third part of the amendment refers to the need for the commission to take into account not only Australia's international obligations but also the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers. Fourthly, the amendment refers to the need for the commission to have regard to regional development and employment consequences. All those provisions would have the effect of widening the view of the proposed Productivity Commission, of increasing the diversity of view that would go to government and of putting government in a better position to make economic and industry policy decisions. Why these bills, which represent such bad policy, would lead to even further bad policy is reflected by the decisions the government has already made since it came to office. We have seen a massively reduced focus on industry policy, a massively reduced level of importance given to the industry policy area. That has been no better expressed than by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). On 19 December on ABC's Radio National, in response to the statement by Pru Goward that business is complaining there is no industry of policy, the Prime Minister responded: Well, there is. I mean industry policy is low inflation, low interest rates, industrial relations reform, other microeconomic reform. There is a debate, the debate is about the extent to which Government should specifically intervene to support particular industries ... So it really is about the extent to which you specifically intervene and give a nudge in a particular direction. That's what the debate about industry policy is about. So it's a pretty limited debate. We hear the Prime Minister express his view that the area of industry policy is a very narrow and very limited area. That is not the view we take on this side of the House. Before me the member for Corio outlined to the House the statements that the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has been making consistently in the course of the last nine months or so. On this side of the House, we take the view that it is very important for the Commonwealth to have an active industry policy. It is very important for the Commonwealth to take the view that one of the arms of public policy is an active and an interventionist industry policy. Of course, the effect of these bills will be to reduce one important source of forming views about industry policy, and that, of course, is the Bureau of Industry Economics. The decisions the government has made to date reflect the views of the Prime Minister but also reflect the policy domination on the part of people who take the view that there is no role for industry policy, who take the view that the market absolutely should prevail. We have seen these sorts of decisions from the government consistently since it came to office. We have seen, for example, the massive gutting or abolition-most of it in breach of election commitments-of a whole range of industry and trade enhancement measures, all of which are aimed at increasing our export performance. We have seen in the recent release of the midyear review that the government's own figures make the point that the net contribution of exports to growth in GOP is estimated, on the government's own forecast, to be a negative contribution for 1996-97 and a negative contribution for 1997-98. So, at a point in the cycle where the government's own analysis and the government's own forecasts show that exports will make a net negative contribution to growth in GOP, and therefore a net negative contribution to jobs, the government is gutting or abolishing the trade and industry enhancement programs that have been put in place previously. EMDG, gutted by $426 million over four years; research and development, reduced by $2 billion; Austrade, gutted by $90 million on a recurrent basis. In industry bounty areas we have seen the effective abolition of a range of bounty measures-whether it is in shipbuilding, which is now almost exclusively an export industry in Australia, computers, robotics or book bounties. All of these measures have been implemented by the government, consistent with the philosophy expressed by the Prime Minister that there is effectively no role for industry policy. The narrowing of the focus of advice, the abolition of the Bureau of Industry Economics, the rolling in of the Economic Planning and Advisory Council into the Industry Commission and renaming it the Productivity Commission, with those narrow terms of reference that I have outlined to the House, will only have the effect of increasing that trend. To enhance that point, the Industry Commission recently released a paper entitled 'The changing of Australian manufacturing'. That paper stated the view of the Industry Commission: . . . there was no basis for providing selective government assistance to the manufacturing sector. That is not the view that some people take when they look at some of the work done by the Bureau of Industry Economics. The rolling in of these three sources of advice, the narrowing of the focus of these sources of advice and further consolidating the dominance of Treasury in this area will have the effect of continuing bad public policy decisions in this area. I note in the brief put out by the library on this bill an interesting quote about the Industry Commission. The library material says: The Industry Commission has a long history, as the Industry Assistance Commission before 1990, and before 1973 the Tariff Board. Since the early 1960s it has had a reputation for giving consistent antiprotection, anti-government and free market advice. Its critics allege that the IC's work of\en reflect its bias rather than being the outcome of well-reasoned analysis. On some occasions I have seen the Industry Commission referred to as the 'Industry Abolition Commission'. The point I take up here is in respect of fearless and independent advice. With the Tariff Board it was not always so, and the member for Corangamite referred to Alf Rattigan's book on the insider's view of the Tariff Board. In Peter Golding's book, Black Jack MCEwen, you find reference to the sort of attitude which MCEwen took to the Tariff Board in its early days. At pages 215 and 216 of that book, we find comments from Bill Carmichael, who became a member of the Tariff Board in 1960. Carmichael made some points which confirm the comments Rattigan made in his book which the member for Corangamite referred to. Carmichael is quoted by Golding as saying: The board was operating in a fairly ad hoc way. It lacked any consistent framework. It was reacting to references by the minister or principally originating from his department and they were all requests for increases in assistance. The whole environment and the practice of the board up until then-and the expectation of it-was that its work would result in increases in protection. It was concerned with providing protection to Australian industry. Then Carmichael says: But it also had in its charter responsibility for doing this in the context of advancing national economic welfare. It was this second larger, broader focus that had been ignored. The practice was that the board was a fairly submissive institution ... A 'fairly submissive institution'. Carmichael goes on to say: The principle of independent advice was what was behind the establishment of the Tariff Board and if the public expectation of the institution was that it should provide advice at arm's length but in fact was receiving a wink and a nod about what advice would be acceptable then it was simply being used to keep the public in the dark and was a tame institution. We see in the course of the book an entire chapter devoted to the dispute between Rattigan and MCEwen, under the title 'Rattigan, the ""manageable"", just isn't so', where the Tariff Board established its reputation ultimately for giving independent advice. The point to be made here is that that was one occasion where a coalition minister effectively sought to nobble advice in a public policy area. The coalition government here is doing it in a much more grandiose way: by rolling three institutions into one and by substantially narrowing the terms of the advice that would be available to government. I noticed that the member for Corio in the course of his contribution referred to views held by the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) which were entirely inconsistent with the views expressed by the member for Corangamite in respect of tariffs in the car industry. The member for Corio referred to an article that the member for Kingston had written in the Financial Review at the end of last year or early this year. I must say I was much more interested in a report in today's Financial Review which contained an article by Mrs Gallus, the member for Hindmarsh. I will leave it to the member for Corio to home in on the inconsistencies on the question of tariffs in the car industry that the member for Hindmarsh has with the member for Corangamite. I was particularly interested in the general comments that the member for Hindmarsh had to make about the Productivity Commission. In the course of her article, which is on the opinion page of the Financial Review, page 15, the member for Hindmarsh said: There is within the Commission an almost religious conviction ... Being religious about public policy views is not the sort of approach that a fearless, independent and professional statutory authority ought to bring. Religious convictions are for members of parliament and ministers to hold when they have considered a vast array of information and advice to them. The member for Hindmarsh goes on to say: What standard of reports should we expect from the Productivity Commission? She talks about objectivity and says that 'it has not shown this objectivity' to date. Here we have the member for Hindmarsh referring to the Productivity Commission, saying it operates on the basis of religious convictions and saying that it has not shown objectivity in its report. Yet this legislation would have two other independent sources of advice rolled into the Commission so that a religious view expressed by the Commission, a nonobjective view of the Commission, would become the monopoly source of advice to government in industry and economic areas. The member for Hindmarsh goes on to say: What we need from the Productivity Commission is an honest analysis ... The Productivity Commission has misunderstood its role. It is not there to make government policy, but to provide the information on which the government can base policy. On the day in which we see bills debated in this House to abolish the Bureau of Industry Economics, to abolish the Economic Planning Advisory Council, to narrow the sources and range and diversity of economic industry advice to the government we see one of the government's own members writing in the Financial Review that the commission suffers from religious convictions, it is not honest in its advice, it is not objective in its advice and it is taking upon itself the role of making public policy decisions rather than providing the government with honest, independent and fearless advice. I hope that, on the basis of the article she has written today, the member for Hindmarsh will come into this chamber and support the amendment circulated by the member for Holt. (Time expired)",31
16,Mr CREAN,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"The Productivity Commission Bill, on the face of it, gives effect to an election promise that the government made--one of the few it has kept, I might add. But it is in the application of what we consider this legislation will lead to that we see an insidious agenda on the part of the government. It is for that reason that we are moving amendments both to the second reading and in the consideration of detail stage. The first reason is to give a wider perspective to what the Productivity Commission should take into account in arriving at its decisions. There are two areas that I am specifically interested in. The first is that if we are expected to compete with the rest of the world, we cannot ignore what the rest of the world is doing to support their industries. There is not a level playing field and even though the Industry Commission, as it still is, recognises that fact it seems to place almost total regard on Australia's obligations and Australia meeting them, and scant regard--one would argue, none at all--on the pace of reform on the part of our trading partners. One of the amendments seeks to address that point, that there ought to be a requirement on the part of this body to have regard to what our trading partners do. The second area it has to have to regard to, quite frankly, is the impact of its decisions on regional Australia. We have this government with all its mock concern about regional Australia, yet it has abolished the regional development office and the regional development program, and we have a minister who still calls himself the minister for regional development whose only act has been to abolish his own department. The government talks concern about regions but it does not require this body to have regard to the impact on regions of its decisions and the recommendations it makes. We believe it is essential that it does so, so one of the amendments goes to that point. For all those members who sit on the other side representing regions which returned this government so massively in the last election, to oppose this amendment is again betraying the regions because it requires no more than the fact that the commission have regard to the impact on regions, both in terms of industry development and in terms of jobs. Who could argue against that? The other point that we are seeking to get from the government as a result of our amendments is the need for there to be an alternative source of advice, rather than just Treasury. I think there is a monopoly now on advice to the government. It is a monopoly contained within the framework of Treasuryand we know that Treasury is dominated by the free market ideology. I do not mind there being that rigour in a decision-making process but there needs to be an alternative and government has an obligation to provide that alternative. It needs to acquaint itself with views other than those of Treasury and then, in a cabinet room, make wise decisions based on the weighting of the evidence before it. If all you have is the monopoly, how can you make a sensible decision? You are a government that talks about competition but you will not allow the competition of ideas in the cabinet room. If you support competition of ideas, you should be supporting the amendment we are moving that seeks to open up an alternative source of advice. Whilst this bill is not yet through the House, the fact is that the Productivity Commission exists in fact and has come out with its first determination. The reality is that the Productivity Commission, which is still called the Industry Commission, is the body that has reported on the Australian automotive industry. It is our concern about what has come forward in this report that underscores the reasons we are seeking amendments in this place. But it is not just us who have concerns about the direction the new body will take; those concerns exist in the government's own ranks. We have headline after headline in the last few weeks of ministers in the Howard government expressing concern about the cuts in car tariffs. Senator Hill has talked about decisions in relation to the automotive industry and the textile industry-the next agenda for the Productivity Commission. He said: They should not be made on ideological grounds or some ivory tower view which is out of touch with the real world. They will be practical, common sense decisions based on Australia's national, economic and social interests. Clearly, he does not think that the Productivity Commission's majority report has had such a regard. We have also got, as the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has just identified, not just one of the backbench expressing concern-most notably the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) in an article today in the Australian Financial Review-we have a number of other South Australian members as well: Susan Jeanes, Chris Pyne, Andrew Southcott, Jeannie Ferris and Trish Worth, to name a few. I am sure that as the debate runs on we will be flushing more out. All I am saying to them is that if they concerns for the future of the car industry in South Australia they should support our amendments, cross the floor and send a message to the government because it is clearly not getting that message in terms of the way the campaign is being run at the moment. We have the concerns of Senator Hill shared by Senator Vanstone. We have those concerns also shared by the Victorian and South Australian premiers, but also it would seem by the minister for industry and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). They are the people that go around in public in interviews and say, 'There shouldn't be any further cuts in tariffs without knowing what our trading partners are doing or without regard to what our trading partners are doing.' If they believe it, support the amendments; require the Productivity Commission to take those factors into account. The reality is there is division on the government side. There is concern about the direction that the Productivity Commission has taken in relation to the automotive industry. Here now is the opportunity to address that concern and to correct the issues the Productivity Commission takes into account in arriving at its decisions. This is more than delivery on an election promise which said: 'We want to get savings, we want to get efficiencies, we want to cut the budget bottom line through rationalisation.' It is more than that because what it provides for is the destruction of an important industry: the automotive industry. It reflects the dominance of Treasury in giving advice to government that essentially argues for cuts in government expenditure, regardless of the consequences. It is a free market ideology that has no regard for the effect on communities. Communities are more than just a marketplace. Communities are people. They are history. They are commitments. They are families. They are social structures. They are not just marketplaces. They have been the lifeblood of the development of this country; regional Australia has been the lifeblood of this country. They are also our best bet for future potential. It is interesting that the terms of reference that were sent to the Industry Commission in have the context of the automotive industry required it to have regard to-these are weasel words- 'the regional development objectives of the government'. How can the government have regional development objectives when it has abolished its regional development department and when it says there is no constitutional role for the Commonwealth in regional development? It is pretty easy to be dismissive of the government's regional development objectives because it hasn't got any. On the face of it, you would think there would be a requirement to have regard to the impact of changes in the automotive plan on regional Australia. But scant regard is paid to that by the majority report. The only person who addresses it is Mr Ian Webber in his minority report. He expresses grave concern about the impact that the implementation of the majority recommendations, the cuts to that tariffs, the end to the export facilitation scheme and the like will have on regional Australia. All I am saying is that, if the government is concerned about the impact on regional Australia, they should write it properly into the charter. That is what we are urging be done by way of the amendment we are putting forward. The reality is that development of our regions will occur only if we have an effective industry policy. The majority report does not provide a sound basis for future investment into the automotive industry. Indeed, if you listened to Mr Scales defending that report on Business Sunday on the Nine Network as recently as last Sunday, he sees this as a launching pad for the introduction of a GST. We give the commission the obligation to look into the future of the automotive industry and he sees it as a launching pad for a GST. Where are these instructions coming from? That is why you need alternative advice. That is why you need to give specific terms of reference and require in the legislative charter for this body to stick to its obligations, to have regard to the impact of tariff changes in the rest of the world and to have regard to the impact of its decisions on regional Australia. The impact will be huge on the car industry, especially in Victoria and South Australia. I see the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) in the chamber now. She has expressed concern about the direction of this report. She is in that group rejecting the report. I say to the member: if your concern is that they do not have regard to what our trading partners are doing, and if your concern is that they have not had proper regard to the impact on regional South Australia, then support our amendments. Join us on this side of the House when we put them before the chamber and vote with us. Don't just go around expressing your concerns in the media: support it in the place that matters-the people's chamber. Make sure it gets locked into legislation. Have the courage of your convictions and side with us in implementing the amendments. The Productivity Commission report actually gives a tick to Labor's car plan. It actually says the export facilitation scheme was a great initiative in getting our car industry, both vehicles and automotive components, into the international marketplace. But then it recommends we end it. It says that the car plan is successful but we should finish it; the export facilitation scheme is a great initiative but we should not continue it. What sort of logic is that? We have them looking at the circumstances that have seen the growth of this industry-the entrenching of important initiatives and expansion in areas such as South Australia-and yet they argue for an end to the export facilitation scheme and to the unilateral disarmament on tariffs. Keep cutting tariffs here, regardless of what our trading partners will do. We believe that the other countries should be obliged to honour their obligations under the tariff reduction regime. Australia has led the way. Having argued for so long and having positioned ourselves for so long, it would be crazy to move away from that discipline. And we should not be moving alone. If there is a requirement for us to meet our obligations, so too must there be such a requirement for our trading partners. The fact of the matter is, we do not have a strategy for the future of the automotive industry in this report; we have ideology. That is why it has to be rejected. That is why there are so many members on the government side of this chamber rejecting the recommendations of the report. If, in fact, there is rejection of it because it has not had proper regard to what this country needs, then let us correct it. Let us correct the basis upon which it gets its charter. Let us amend the legislation that gives it the power to simply keep reporting ideology rather than reality. That is what the thrust of our amendments involves. Labor is committed to a more interventionist, a more active industry policy. It is one that we have argued for and it is one that is supported by many sections of the Australian community, most recently by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has actually been a very strong supporter of the government in most of the decisions it has taken but which has come out recently and said, 'Reverse the decisions that cut research and development in this country.' It has come out and said it supports a sectoral approach to industry policy and it has called for the government to implement and develop a more competitive industry policy. We are arguing for just that. These supports for industry are not welfare measures, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) would cast them-he believes that any assistance to industry is business welfare-but they are not. They are investments in our future. They recognise that there are market failures. They recognise that there is not a level playing field and they recognise that, if we are to get industry developed in this country, then there needs to be a partnership with government to achieve it. The reality is we will not get unemployment down in this country unless we get economic growth at better than four per cent. This government has set its targets as low as three to 3V2 per cent. No wonder it will not make any progress in unemployment. We did make progress in getting unemployment down in our last three years. Why? Because we had economic growth averaging 4.2 per cent. This government has come to power and, through decisions taken in the budget, has ground that growth back to 3Y2 per cent at best and I would suggest, when the figures come out, probably a damn sight less. You will not get unemployment down in this country unless you get economic growth going, you will not get economic growth going without an industry policy and you will not get an industry policy if your sole source of advice is the new Productivity Commission because it does not believe in it. It does not believe in government in partnership intervening to help industries grow. But Labor does and we will continue to argue for it. I think that government needs to develop a strategy that goes beyond the term of one government. It needs to put in place an industry policy that is transparent and understood by those who would seek to invest in this country. It needs to be an approach similar to-but developed for the Australian context-that so successfully embraced in Japan in the MIT! model, a bipartisan approach on industry policy to provide business with a secure policy framework transcending the electoral process. What is needed is this alternative source of advice to counter the ideological claptrap that surrounds the Treasurer and his department. We need a long-term industry policy. I am on the record in this chamber spelling out what that policy involves. It is something that needs to go beyond the next election but it cannot be done unless you establish an alternative source of advice, unless you go beyond the monopoly power of Treasury and the Treasurer in taking submissions to cabinet as to what the future of the industry will be. I think it will be an interesting tussle to see how the government resolves its dilemma on tariffs and the future of the car industry. Tariff is not the only component. Tariff is about stopping or limiting imports. That is an important part, but it is not the vital part of what has been more successful with the car plan, that is, expanding exports. The objective has to be to get net export growth. It has to be to provide expansion in the industry recognising that the marketplace is out there in the region, not just here in Australia. Unless you have a strategy that fosters it, unless you have the industry support that recognises that there is not a level playing field, it is not going to happen. If we are serious about ensuring that we have a body of advice coming forward, the amendments should be supported. (Time expired) (Quorum formed)",34
17,Mr WILTON,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"I am overwhelmed that so many government members entered the chamber on the occasion of my speech in the debate on this most important matter-the Productivity Commission Bill. As many members have said, this bill formulates at law the amalgamation of the Industry Commission, the Economic Planning and Advisory Council and the Bureau of Industry Economics. I say at law because clearly this amalgamation has already been achieved in reality. It is somewhat farcical that the Productivity Commission has been issuing reports, most notably its 240-page report entitled Stocktake of progress in micro economic reform which was released as late as June last year. In the accompanying press release, on the occasion of the release of that document, the commission had many fine things to say. It said, among other things: Microeconomic reform is crucial to future living standards in Australia. Some major reforms have already been introduced but a substantial reform task lies ahead. The commission's press release goes on to say: The stocktake report finds that the most pressing needs for reform are in: application of national competition policy principies ... Reforms in these areas are needed to create an adaptable and innovative economy; that can flourish amid rapid global change. They are fine words but, to my way of thinking, the Productivity Commission is full of little else but fine words. That is typical of the sorts of statements that it has gained a reputation for releasing. It is my understanding that the Productivity Commission costs something like twice as much to run as something like the Industrial Relations Commission, which is far more productive in its own right in benefits to the economy than perhaps the inaptly titled Productivity Commission. What we have with the Productivity Comof mission is a monolithic advisory body which reports to government on both industry and productivity matters. Those opposite bent on notions of competition, yet simultaneously seek to thwart any notion of competition in the kind of advice being given to government which those of us on this side the House say ought to be from a range of sources, not from one monolithic advisory body. The new commission, which is an amalgaof mation of three former instrumentalities, also receive additional responsibility in the areas of labour market reform and competition policy. My personal view is that this bill should not proceed. This monolithic body should not be formed at law, even though it has already been formed in an administrative sense. I understand that in reality this is not about to happen. Those of us on this side of the House contend that sound economic management nomic requires a variety of credible sources of advice to government, not just advice one source. We are equally concerned that the advice that will be forthcoming, as was quite lucidly submitted by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in his speech, will be all too concentrated for the good of both the governwould ment and the economy. To that end, Labor pursued a competitive advice model to ensure that all sides of the debate would be considered. Indeed, one the underlying thrusts of the amendments we are proposing seeks to restore some competitive basis for the kind of advice that is proffered to the government. Any such notions of competitive advice are being dismantled by the government. We remain concerned that this will lead the government side. to pursue even more inappropriate economic and energy policies than those that it is currently pursuing. Many of the issues mentioned in the stocktake report, which I have previously alluded to, such as a further cut in general tariffs from 1 July this year from five per cent to three per cent, the complete abolition of the sugar tariff, the review of all limits on foreign investment where the government has a view relaxing strictions and the termination of export assistance like the DIFF scheme and the export market development grants scheme, are hell are energy policy matters. The further concentration of advice will increase the weight of Treasury views in the of agenda of this government. Whilst these views should be considered, they should be debated in the environment of the range of options and alternatives that exist. Clearly, this will not happen given the concentration advice in a monolithic body that this bill will will formalise the creation of. The government loves competition, but it is thwarting competition in the advice that it reasonably ought to be receiving from a range of sources if it is to run the economy in a far more effective way than it has been to date. The work program of the new commission will be largely determined by Treasury. Given the congruence of ideology of both Treasury and the Productivity Commission, the ecoperspective presented will be extremely narrow. Those two bodies have views on the from economy which are markedly similar. The member for Hotham also mentioned that the opposition is not opposed to the Treasury, nor is it opposed to the agencies within the Treasury portfolio. Rather, we submit that what is required is a plurality of advice emanating from a diverse range of sources-quite literally, a competitive model for the provision of all kinds of of economic based advice to this government. that The fact that there is not a monopoly of wisdom within the Treasury portfolio and, therefore, all the advice should not be concentrated within ihat portfolio is apparent to those on this side of the House but, unfortunately, not so apparent to those on the other We have some concerns with this legislation. The first of these concerns is, as I have put, the dismantling of the system of competing sources of advice established by Labor while in government. To that end, this legislation further isolates and ostracises the contributions of other departments-most notably Industry, Science and Tourism-in the overall context of the Australian economic debate. The new commission will, to a considerable degree, reflect both the personnel and the practices of the former Industry Commission. Previous experience with the IC has demonstrated that it has an extreme reluctance to take note of those views which do not coincide with, nor adhere somewhat rigidly to, its own predetermined views. Those submissions and public hearings are essentially a sham, a farce. For instance, where draft reports have been issued, there has rarely been any substantial change in the recommendations in the final report regardless of the weight, the cogency and the factual content of the responses. The Industry Commission is, therefore, quite legitimately regarded as an ideological advocate rather than a source of true independent advice of the kind that we believe this government needs and in fact should demand. It has an extreme fundamentalist view of the way reform should take place, and the views of other groups which are supportive of reforms, such as various employer groups and, indeed, the ACTU, are rejected. It, therefore, fails-and some might even say refuses-to build a consensus even amongst those that are largely supportive, that largely embrace the general economic directives and underlying thrusts of the Industry Commission. In particular, these draft reports to which have just alluded failed to gain credibility with any of the major stakeholders in the areas concerned. I refer to stakeholders as being those government departments and other major players in the economic debate who look somewhat candidly upon draft reports' knowing that there has been no true consultation embraced as part of their development and that any final recommendations will not incorporate any subsequent amendments that might be made or suggested by interested parties. Increasingly important is the fact that interested parties are boycotting the Industry Commission because of its failure to listen in a balanced, non-partisan and non-prejudiced way. There has been far too much emphasis placed on the now failed and the now discredited ORAN! model, which is consistently used to claim exorbitant 'savings' for the particular ideological course that has been proffered or recommended. However, this ORANI model has indeed lost the confidence of some state governments, some federal parliamentarians, including me, significant national business organisations and community and religious organisations, and various commentators on all sides of politics also cast doubt on the worth of the ORANI model, given its consistent claims of exorbitant savings for a particular ideological course that has been recommended. There is nothing to indicate that the commission has or will have any capacity to adequately address the interested industries, consumers in the community and the social and environmental consequences as it is required to do under the general policy guidelines outlined in clause 8 of the bill. The commission, through its report that I have mentioned previously, the Stocktake of progress in micro economic reform, has already largely determined the results of any inquiries it might undertake and is, therefore, incapable of balanced and independent advice. This is bad policy, which leads to further bad policy. I ask the government to examine this matter in the bill critically before it proceeds to encouraging a vote on it. I have cited some of the industry policy I matters which are encapsulated within the stocktake report and other matters contained in the same report which I believe already have their futures predetermined. Page 9 of the stocktake report under the heading 'Competition policy' states: Prices oversight should be limited to statutory and natural monopolies and other markets where competition is very weak. This is another example of the commission predetermining the future of a particular issue. In this case, the oversighting of prices in both the oil and banking industries would not occur. There would be no statutory obligation for the oversight of pricing in the event that that particular predetermined recommendation of the commission were to be pursued. One can only imagine that, given it was a key part of the stocktake report, issued only some 10 months ago, it is on the commission's predetermined agenda and that, if there are further submissions and proposed amendments requested from the public at large and other interested parties, they will not be incorporated into any final recommendations of the commission. Consequently, the creation of the Productivity Commission must be seen as an undermining of the democratic process. The funding level will exacerbate the situation by giving the commission a level of resources which will ensure its capacity to initiate and dominate the agenda. I will just refer to the potential to undermine the democratic process. There is no doubt that in putting this forward in the parliament the government has pre-empted the parliament because it has arrogantly disregarded the supremacy of this place by acting as if the Productivity Commission was already in operation-although this legislation is necessary to effect its creation at law. Before the election the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claimed he was going to respect the role of parliament and the supremacy of the parliament, yet this is another example of where proper parliamentary processes have been blatantly ignored. What then are the better alternatives? I a few words of advice in that regard. The first is that the government should seek and obtain a variety of sources of advice and not just one which emanates from a monolithic body such as the newly formed Productivity Commission. There should be more of a 'horses for courses' approach. Appropriate people with expertise and credibility in a range of areas under examination by the commission should be utilised as being effective and efficient sources of advice. The one Productivity Commission/Treasury line should not be extended to the government as the only source of advice on issue after issue after issue. More open and genuinely consultative processes should also be undertaken. By that I mean that if the commission calls for submissions from interested parties it should look at those submissions with a view to incorporating at least some of them into the final recommendations of any report on any particular aspect of micro-economic reform that it may be investigating. This would create a capacity to build support and build a basis for global reform that would enjoy the support of a range of interested parties who, whether or not they had had their suggested amendments incorporated in the final report, would at least feel that they had been legitimately consulted and would be more inclined to support the eventual outcome, given that they felt that they were reasonably heard during the consultative process. What is required in this country is not a source of advice emanating from a single monolithic body but a partnership between government and business where government can seek a range of advice from a range of sources offering different expertise to it so that we can get economic growth above levels of four per cent-economic growth of the kind that will be needed to lower unemployment and of the kind that the former Labor government was reaching in its final term of office. But the Productivity Commission does not believe in this integrated partnership arrangement. It would consider any suggestions of the nature that we are proposing to go to the issue of business welfare. Seeking to attain the sorts of schemes I have been talking offer about, be it DIFF or EMDG, has nothing to do with business welfare. Even though I have called for this bill not to proceed, I acknowledge that it will proceed. Due to the significant influence that the Productivity Commission will have, the opposition considers that the bills should be referred to a Senate committee so that the proposed commission can be adequately scrutinised.",38
18,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (12.04 p.m.)-I would like to sum up the debate in regard to the Productivity Commission Bill 1996. There are a range of issues which have been raised by the opposition in this debate and I would like to make some brief comments about those issues. The last speaker went over some of those points. One was that the range of options of opinions which can come through to the government is severely limited by having a Productivity Commission rather than, say, the three previous bodies. Another point was that it is all being brought within the Treasury area. That is really begging the question. Governments can go to a whole range of people in regard to--Mr Crean-It's true, though.",41
19,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"No, it is not true, actually. Mr Crean-It's true.",42
20,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,What you are saying is that the only opinion that the government is going to get on these types of matters can come from the Productivity Commission. That is not true. Mr Crean-Only public hearings. The rest of it is done in private and secret.,42
21,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"There is a whole range of other ways in which you can get advice and views on these sorts of matters. There are of ways in which we can get a lot of input from a range of other people. There is no reason why the government cannot at any time seek to have independent consultants, apart from the Productivity Commission, to give them advice. The argument being put by the opposition really does not hold water. There are lots of ways in which advice and information can be sought to try to improve the productivity of this country and to ascertain how those possible options will affect outcome of people in a social context. There are many ways. For a number of speakers to run this line that just because we are having the Economic Planning and Advisory Commission, EPAC, and the Industry Commission and the BIEMr Wilton-Gone.",42
22,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Yes, but you are saying that, just because they have gone and are being rolled into one body, there is going to be one line of advice. Mr Crean-It increases the risk.",42
23,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"I do not believe that that is the case. In regard to the Productivity Commission and the issue of having just one body, many of you are saying that there was no overlap in the work which those bodies were doing. I believe and the government believes that there was overlap. For example, the previous government did actually use EPAC for a while but, as time went on, it started to ignore EPAC. So what use was there for that body to remain? You come in here and say that we should have kept that, yet in the last few years of your government you were actually ignoring EPAC. You were just setting it aside. Mr Crean-You've got the industry portfolio without any analytical input.",42
24,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"But you were setting it aside. Comments have been made in this debate that industry ministers and, for example, the primary industry minister would not be receiving any other good advice from their departments. That is what is being argued by the opposition. I totally reject that and the government totally rejects that. The information which can be collected by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy through his lots department is a source of information which can be used to make decisions. It is the same for the industry minister. Also, when submissions go to cabinet everybody is aware that all the other departments have a look over that information. Mr Crean-Yes, departments, but what about ministers?",42
25,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Ministers also have their own ideas, so you have another 15 or so opinions the on which decisions can be made. To run the line that there is going to be only one source of information going into the government, and that that is coming from the Productivity Commission, does not stand up at all. It is very interesting to look at the Industry Commission's general policy guidelines, under which it operated, and to look at the guidelines for the new Productivity Commission. In actual fact, the guidelines are very similar. So the work which was being underonly taken by the Industry Commission is largely the work which is going to be done by the Productivity Commission. Let me just go through some of those guidelines to point that out to people. The general policy guidelines for the Industry Commission state: In the performance of its functions, the Commission must have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth Government: (a) to encourage the development and growth of Australian industries that are efficient in their use of resources, self-reliant, enterprising, innovative and internationally competitive. The Productivity Commission's general policy guidelines state: In the performance of its functions, the Commission must have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth Governmentthe same words(a) to improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in the public and private sectors in order to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community; That is pretty close to the same sort of thing. The wording is slightly different. The second guideline for the Industry Commission says: (b) to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes; Guess what the Productivity Commission's point (b) is. It says: (b) to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes; It is identical. The Industry Commission's point (c) says: (c) to reduce regulation of industry (including regulation by the States, Territories and local government) where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government. Let us have a look at (c) in the Productivity Commission's guidelines. It says: (c) to reduce regulation of industry (including regulation by the States, Territories and local government) where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government. They are identical. You are really saying that the Productivity Commission is not going to be able to do, and will not do, the work which was being done previously. The simple fact is that the guidelines are almost identical. Are you really rejecting what you had in place before? Yes, your debates are. Mr Crean-We're saying you should go further.",42
26,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Well, you were in government for 13 years and now you are coming in here and saying that we have to go further.",43
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Order! I ask the parliamentary secretary to direct his remarks through the chair, and other speakers as well.",43
28,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I will be immensely cooperative. Point (d) of the Industry Commission's guidelines says: (d) to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission. What do we find in the guidelines for the Productivity Commission? It says: (d) to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by the measures proposed by the Commission. Many speakers have come in here and have not really gone back and done their homework in that area. Go back and have a look at what the Industry Commission's guidelines were. The Productivity Commission is, by and large, going to take on all of that work, and its general policy guidelines are almost identical in wording to that of the previous Industry Commission. Our whole goal with this is to try to make sure that policy comes into the government which is wide ranging, which is informative, which brings in empirical evidence, which is well based, which is analysed and which brings to us options and so gives the government a very good, well-rounded view of whatever investigation has been undertaken. The point can be made that there are part-time commissioners who can be appointed to the commission and specifically brought in, depending on what industry or what area is being investigated. So there can be specialist points of view brought into help the Productivity Commission with that. I reject quite strongly the view that a range of options will not be brought to the government and that there will not be wide-ranging consultation and gathering of information because of the way in which the general guidelines of the commission have been structured. I believe that this commission will fulfil its function quite adequately and that the work of the commission will be able to proceed in a very comprehensive way. The advice coming through to government just from this commission alone will be very intensive, will be well analysed and will take into account a whole range of factors as is required by a commission of this nature. I have no doubt about that whatsoever. I would also like to point out that one of the amendments that has been proposed relates to competitive neutrality policies and principles. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is proposing to change some wording in that regard. He proposes the word 'experience' instead of 'enjoy' and 'competitive disadvantage' as well as 'competitive advantage'. It is interesting to go back to a little bit of history which shows that the preferred words of the then government, the Labor Party, were exactly what is now put into this legislation. Under 'Competitive neutrality policies', it reads: The objective of competitive neutrality policy is the elimination of resource allocation distortions arising out of the public ownership of entities engaged in significant business activities. Then it makes this particular point: Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage simply as a result of their public sector ownership. That is exactly what we have put into this legislation, and that is exactly what the then Labor government, in 1994, used as their preferred words. Now one of the members of the opposition, the member for Werriwa, is coming in here and saying that he would like to move an amendment along these lines with the aim of ensuring that significant government business activities do not experience'experience' instead of 'enjoy'-'net competitive advantages', and then he wants to put in the words 'or disadvantages'. Where is the opposition on competitive neutrality policy? Has the opposition changed its policy or is it that one of its members is acting as a rogue in regard to the policy position? In 1994, the preferred words were the words which we are actually putting into this legislation now. So, when the opposition come in here and want to move amendments, maybe they-in particular the member for Werriwa-should go back and check the history of the wording of the previous government. Some opposition members obviously have not gone back over the history and looked into it in a thorough, comprehensive manner. The government believes that the Productivity Commission is a very important commission, that it has a job to do and that it will be one source of information for the government to use to analyse particular areas. It is very important within the Treasury portfolio. There was overlap and duplication in some of these areas. Besides, EPAC was just being ignored by the previous government. So I think this is a sensible, common sense approach to good public administration in this country. I have no doubt at all that the information and the range of options which will come to the government from the Productivity Commission will be wide ranging, that its inquiries will be done thoroughly and that the scientific, empirical evidence which will be brought to us will be, without exception, of a very high standard. I believe that what is being proposed in this bill will certainly serve all Australians' interests, will serve the government well and will provide the information. By having the three areas rolled together, I believe there will not be the overlap and the duplication which was occurring before. As I said previously, there are research capacities within other departments to develop empirical information for the appropriate ministers. The industry minister, if he so desires, could have a subunit within his portfolio, as could any other minister. So the idea that this can be only one source of information is blatantly wrong. There has also been comment by some people that the commission will not be able to do anything on its own initiative, that it will always be under instruction. Over the years, the Industry Commission has spent about 50 per cent of its time-probably a bit more-on public inquiry and the rest of its time has been spent in research, in gathering information and in initiating inquiries in its own right. I have no doubt that that will continue, that a lot of the time of the Productivity Commission will be directed towards public inquiry. I know it is fundamentally important to have wide-ranging information flowing into the Productivity Commission, but to say that it cannot act on its own initiative, Baldwin, R. C. that it is going to be tied down with very detailed instructions and have no time to go about initiating the gathering of empirical information in its own right I do not think is a correct interpretation of this bill which we are proposing. I believe the commission will be able to initiate the gathering of information to a certain extent. As I said, the Industry Commission tended to use a significant amount of its time initiating the gathering of information off its own bat, and I believe that will continue. It is important for a body such as this to be able to gather information on its own initiative. There will no doubt be more opportunity for debate on some of these matters because amendments will be moved that will provide that opportunity. In closing the debate, I would like to thank all members from both sides. I think there were 18 people involved in the debate. It is on a topic which is wide ranging. That is to be expected in regard to such a commission, which is about Australia being competitive, productive, taking into account circumstances in which Australians find themselves-whether they live in regional or urban Australia. I believe that these debates are very healthy and worthwhile, and I believe without doubt that the Productivity Commission will fulfil its role, this legislation Truss, W. E. having been passed to achieve those sorts of outcomes. The information flowing to the government will be well based and comprehensive. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Gareth Evans's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [12.28 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr F.W.

29,Mr CREAN,AYES,"I move opposition amendment No.1: (l) Clause 8, page 5 (line 31), at the end of subclause (l), add: ; and (f) to have regard to the regional opment and regional employment consequences; This is an essential amendment and we cannot comprehend why there would be opposition to it from a government that says it has real concern for regional Australia. The simple fact is that that is its rhetoric; it is not the reality. We have the circumstance where the first major act of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was to abolish his department. The minister is on the record as saying that there is no constitutional role for the Commonwealth in regional development. Little wonder, therefore, that when they ask the Industry Commission, in its NOES inquiry into the car plan, to have regard to the consequences of the government's regional Brereton, L. J. development strategy, it would not take the commission too long to do. The government does not have a regional development strategy. We are saying that there should be an obligation through legislation for the Productivity Commission, in making recommendations to the government, to have regard to the impact on regions-to have regard to the impact on regional economic development and to have regard to the jobs of those regions. What is wrong with that amendment? I refer to those members on the other side of the House who have lent their name to concerns about the Productivity Commission's recommendations on the car plan-the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the member NA for Kingston (Ms Jeanes), the member for  Southcott) and the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth)-all of whom have written letters around this parliament. I see the member for  keen to send a letter round the House to all members telling them of his commitment to the car industry in Adelaide and his concern about regional development. Your test will be in here. Will you support the amendment? Why not require the Productivity Commission to have regard to what you say it should have regard to? Your problem",46
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I ask the member to address develhis remarks through the chair.,46
31,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"The member for Sturt's problem is that he wants publicity but not action. He wants to get his name in the paper but he is not keen to bring in the legislative reform that will enable the concerns that he claims to have to be properly regarded by the Productivity Commission. What a sham! I again refer the amendment to the member and to the other members from the South Australian seats who are in this chamber and who express concern about the impact of the majority report of the Productivity Commission on the car plan. I say to all of them: have regard to the importance of this amendment because it requires the Productivity Commission to in future have regard to the impact on regional jobs and development. The car plan under Labor worked and saw the expansion of the car industry. That car plan will be decimated if the majority report of the Productivity Commission is adopted. There is also another report under way, into the textile, clothing and footwear industries. There is a whole group of them in town today. That is the reason I was out of the chamber before, because I was speaking with them. They are going to be inquired into. Don't you think there are impacts on regional jobs in the textile industry in this country? Yet you will come into this place and vote down an amendment that requires the Productivity Commission to have regard to the impact on regions and jobs. The simple reality is that under the car plan, through the export facilitation scheme, we saw a huge growth in the component supply market of the car industry as well as a base underpinning the car market. Without those plans, and with the unilateral disarmament on tariff cuts and with the abolition of the export facilitation scheme, those jobs will go. Those regions will suffer. Unless you require the Productivity Commission to have regard to the impact on regions, you are selling your area short. You will be shown up as the hypocrites you deserve to be shown as--expressing concern about the future of the industry but not requiring your government to put obligations on the very body that has made the recommendations to consider what is in the interests of regions. (Time expired)  extraordinary move by the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), to introduce a pious amendmentwhich is all it is-to the Productivity Commission Bill and then to expect the South Australian members of parliament to flutter about and fall apart. Quite clearly, this is a political stunt on behalf of the opposition-a political stunt just like the letter circulated Margaret Reynolds about human rights last year and just like the pious amendments that are always moved to government bills by both the current opposition and us when we were in opposition. We do not intend as South Australian members of parliament to fall for some pious amendment, to fall for some political stunt, designed to give the member for Hotham another run in the press. As to some of the more substantial reasons why we vote against these amendments, it is very clear that the matters mentioned in the member for Hothain's amendments proposing subclauses (f) and (g) are already included in the bill. I refer to the bill. These are the general policy guidelines for the commission as stated in the bill: (b) to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes; and (d) to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission; and (e) to recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the Commission. All of those matters quite clearly specifically give the Productivity Commission the opportunity in their terms of reference to take into account all the matters raised in (f) and (g) of the amendments of the member for Hotham. They are not excluded. In fact, in the auto industry inquiry, the terms of reference included the commission taking into account our international obligations. For many years the government has had the right in its terms of reference, in its policy and principles guidelines that it gives to the Productivity Commission-formerly the Industry Commission-to indicate what they want taken into account. It does not require us to leave out any issue. It does not have to be included in the policy guidelines in the bill because anything else can also be included, and it usually is included. Each new inquiry is given new terms of reference. They include some things that are in the guidelines and they include extra things that the government thinks are importby ant in its policies and principles to include in each inquiry. I would also add that the ALP spent 13 years in government with this capacity for the Industry Commission inquirynow the Productivity Commission-and for 13 years they did not see any necessity at all to include amendments (f) and (g) in the policy guidelines for the commission. It is only today, at the last minute, without any notice being given to the government that the member for Hotham has come in here and demanded, having had an about-face, that this is crucial, that it would be obnoxious if we did not include it. Why then for 13 years did the Labor Party see no reason, no cause celebre, for including in the Industry Commission Act the requirement to take into account these matters? It is so transparent it is pathetmentioned, ic. I am sorry that the members of the opposition have been so badly let down by the Manager of Opposition Business. I am sorry for Simon, of course, because it will set back his opportunities for the leadership to some extent. The final point I would like to make is that these changes-(f) and (g) being included by the member for Hotham-will make absolutely no difference whatsoever to the auto industry inquiry that has already being conducted by the Productivity Commission. That inquiry has been completed, the draft has been put out to the public and in May the final report will be made. This bill will have no effect whatsoever on that inquiry.",46
32,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PAIRS,"The final report has been totally pre-empted by the chairman.  whatsoever to the deliberations of the current Productivity Commission inquiry because this is a new bill. The idea that this will in some way affect the automotive industry in South Australia is a nonsense. In closing, I would simply restate my absolute commitment to the South Australian automotive industry, which has been stated publicly on many occasions since the draft report of the Industry Commission came out before Christmas in newspapers and on radio. I know that most of my South Australian colleagues share that commitment very strongly. This is a very important issue to South Australia, and we will do everything in our power to protect the jobs and the livelihoods of the families affected.",48
33,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"Werriwa) (12.47 p.m.)Like any good opposition we are here to help. We are here to help all those government members who are so worried about the way in which the Productivity Commission is not considering regional issues. It is not considering regional employment issues. I was interested to hear the member for  cock, with all that style-he is well presented and is very stylish in his presentation-but there are a few gaps in the substance. He correctly enough, that for 13 years the Labor Party did not have a reference to regional employment and development in the work of the Industry Commission, but that is the whole point of this legislation. The Labor Party in government had the BIE and EPAC to provide the recommendations about regional development and regional employment. But this legislation is wiping those two bodies away, clearing the decks in terms of regional employment and development and establishing a narrow stream of neoclassical advice in the hands of the Productivity Commission. The member for Sturt is damned by his own analysis, because the very purpose of this bill is to wipe away all the advice that the federal cabinet has ever received on regional employment and development courtesy of EPAC and the BIE. If we are wiping away that stream of advice, then obviously regional development and regional employment should be entrenched in the policy guidelines for the new Productivity Commission. So the Labor Party is here to help. We are here to help all those government backbenchers from South Australia and Victoria who are concerned about the narrow advice on tariffs that takes no account of regional development and employment and all those National Party members, not even in the chamber, who have copped so many cuts to employment in their regional electorates. Here is the answer. Here is the positive, constructive solution to the way in which the Productivity Commission fails to consider regional employment and regional development. If you have a look at the policy guidelines, it is fairly clear why regions should be mentioned: because everything bar the kitchen sink has been mentioned, from productivity to structural change, to regulation of industry, to industries and consumers, and to social and environmental consequences. Whatever happened to mentioning regions? Whatever happened to taking a spatial dimension in the formation of economic policy? The problem the government has is that Productivity Commission relies on the up ORANI model. The ORANI model of forein casting and projections takes no account of space. It takes no account of the way in which many factors of production are immobeen bile, particularly labour. In the ORANI model it is supposed that a job lost in the electorate of Kingston, Hindmarsh, Sturt or Adelaide a job that will be replaced somewhere else the national economy and the person losing that job can move seamlessly to another location to pick up that employment. is no spatial dimension to the work of the productivity commission. Everything is mentioned here in the bill bar regions. It is a shameful thing for the Liberal members participating in this debate to adopt the doctrine of Sharpism. John Sharp, Minister for Transport and Regional Developthe ment in name only-in practice, Transport only-has said that the Commonwealth has no funding or constitutional responsibility regions. It is bad enough for the National Party to be saying those things, but Liberal Party members should not fall for that narrow, neoclassical, flawed analysis of economic projections. Regions should be written into guidelines. It is so simple to If you believe in regional development, into the policy guidelines of the Productivity Commission. If you have seen the way which EPAC and BIB are being abolished virtue of this legislation, continue their charter on regional development by writing it into new bill. It is so simple to do. This common sense proposition. It merely needs be stated to be supported. What is wrong with all those government backbenchers who talk the language of gional development and employment but when push comes to shove, when the heat on in the parliament, when they have to face a vote on the guidelines for the Productivity Commission-the body that they have denounced so thoroughly in here and in the mediaMr O'Connor-They go missing.",48
34,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"The member for Corio is right, they have gone missing in action, MIA--each and every one of them missing in the action. When the vote comes on for standing for regional development they are missing action. We will have to play the role of Rambo and free them from their restrictions, free them from their captivity. They have lost behind enemy lines, each and every one of them. So stand up and do more than talk the language of regional employment. Do is more than that-actually write it into the in legislation of Commonwealth. Write it into the legislation of the Commonwealth, stand up for your electorates and vote for them. So there (Time expired)",49
35,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PAIRS,"As we are talking about the Productivity Commission Bill, it is worth reflecting on the history of the Productivity Commission, which is a merging of the Industry the Commission, EPAC and BIB. Before it was Industry Commission it was the Industries Assistance Commission; before that the Tariff Board. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) for has circulated an amendment saying that it should be the brief of the Productivity Commission to consider regional development and very regional employment consequences. Regional development and the consequences for it are something most of us on this side do. are very concerned about because we are the put it people who do come from the regions of Australia. The member for Werriwa (Mr in Latham) and the member for Hotham were by tugging their forelocks to the man who believed that if you were not living in Sydthe ney, you were camping out. Where does the is a member for Werriwa come from? He comes to from the suburbs of Sydney. Where does the member for Hotham come from? He comes from Melbourne. Where did he work when he rewas President of the ACTO? He worked in Melbourne, and he probably thinks that is Australia stops at Tullamarine. Of the 89 members of this House from places outside Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra, there are only something like II who represent the ALP. In terms of the amendment, by introducing into the brief of the Productivity Commission that it should consider regional development and regional employment consequences-and that is something I addressed in my speech on the second reading-you virtually make the Productivity Commission an impotent body. You say that the Productivity Commission has to consider national goals and regional goals, so it would almost act in different ways. I think it is more important that a government consider the regional consequences. The Productivity Commission is one source of advice to the government. Regional consequences will be raised by members on this side of the House because we are the ones who represent the regions and we are the ones who know that Australia does not stop at Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. The member for Hotham has been searching around trying to find something to differentiate himself from those in the Liberal Party and he thought that the way to go on industry policy was to model ourselves on Japan's MITI. Everyone knows their interventionist industry policy has had a lot of failures. They have been quite unsuccessful in terms of some of the things they have missed. I rise to state once again my very firm commitment to the automotive industry in South Australia. We do need to consider the regional impact that the automotive industry does have in South Australia but I do not believe it is necessary to introduce this clause into the Productivity Commission Bill. I think it is better that this be considered by governments rather than by the Productivity Commission.",49
36,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"I rise to speak in support of this amendment on the Productivity Commission Bill and do so on the basis that those on this side of the chamber are committed to the Australian automotive industry. I know there are some on the other side who are somewhat committed to the industry, and perhaps an exception to that lot is the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), who is noted for his absence this morning; he is no doubt off doing his direct mail to his constituents in the industry and his local electorate, having been absolutely skinned alive this morning by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has said, we are from the opposition and we are, indeed, here to help. I know the government has not to this date, on any aspect of this bill or in any submission it has made in terms of debate on this bill, made more than a passing reference to the needs of regional Australia, the needs of regional development and the employment consequences of this bill as it applies to those regions it claims to represent--or, perhaps, misrepresent. In government we had the BIE and EPAC and, contrary to the view of those on the other side, we took notice on an ongoing basis of all those constituencies and authorities during our term in government. In fact they offered more than just the limited, neoclassic advice that no doubt will be proffered by this new amalgamated, monolithically geared Productivity Commission. No doubt the government, in implementing this legislation, is simply sweeping away a major stream of advice from a diverse range of sources that was formerly forthcoming under the reign of the Keating and Hawke governments. Those opposite who have been forced to endure regional cuts to their constituencies have the answer, it is right in front of them: support an amendment which makes more than just a passing reference to regional development; show some intestinal fortitude and apply your minds to supporting a reference to regional development which will ensure that the automotive industry is looked after in a way that those opposite pay no more than lip service to. The government relies on the ORANI model, which is fatuous, fallacious and discredited. Ms Jeanes-So did you.",50
37,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"We did not rely on the ORANI model to anywhere near the extent that you clearly are relying on it. We relied on it until we acknowledged early in our third term of government that the ORANI model was flawed and discredited. That model was consistently used to claim exorbitant savings for any ideological course that was recommended but it lost the confidence of state governments and those on this side of the House; and it lost the confidence of significant national business organisations and other community organisations because it claimed exorbitant savings to justify some ideological bent. We on this side of the House do more than just mouth platitudes in regard to regional development and regional employment; we want to put it in the legislation and say- 'It is there for the taking.' The government should show some guts and take the opportunity to put it in the legislation where it belongs and demonstrate that they are not, as their National Party cohort has said, ministers for just transport, but that they are concerned about more than just issues related to transport; that they are concerned about regional development as well as other portfolio areas. Today, while their presence in the chamber is noted, apart from the member for Corangamite their silence in large part has been deafening. Again, I urge those opposite to put a reference in the legislation to regional development. In the event that this will occur, I am sure that we would approach growth rates of near four per cent-of the kind that we had when we were last in government-in order to render the sorts of falls in unemployment that are required to reverse the trends that are already demonstrated in the first 10 months of this government's office. Unemployment, especially in regional areas, is trending upwards to levels which are clearly unsustainable and to levels which will clearly cost the government seats at the forthcoming federal election. I urge those opposite to show the guts and intestinal fortitude to put the reference to regional development in the bill, to support this amendment and not kowtow to certain sectional interests as the member for Corangamite does, who has slinked away having been skinned by the member for Hotham in what was a most assertive and formidable presentation. (Time expired)",50
38,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (1.01 p.m.)Don't you just love politics! It is interesting to see that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who has moved this amendment, has so little interest in it that he has actually left the chamber. It was an interesting stunt by the member for Hotham, wasn't it? Let us see how this went: we have some South Australians over there who are concerned and who really care about their car industry. They said, 'How can we cause a bit of trouble? Let's look for an amendment we can put into the legislation which riUght make them quiver and wonder what they are going to do about and, what's more, we will introduce it at the last minute just to make it even harder.' But what did they come up with? Nothing very good at all, just a motherhood statement about looking after the regions. It states: ... have regard, when providing its advice, to the regional development and regional employment consequences. It may not have occurred to the member for Hotham that when you actually give references to the Productivity Commission you can write that into the terms of reference. It is not hard at all: just put it in as a term of reference. But, in fact, you do not even need to do it. Why don't you go to the guidelines that are already in the Productivity Commission's legislation before us today? Have a look and see what it says. The member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) read them out to you. Paragraph (c) states: to recognise the interests of industriesincluding the car industry, because it is an industryconsumers and the communitythe South Australian community, the Adelaide community, the Kingston community, the community of workers; the community--does not 'community' include regionthat are likely to be affected. How more specific can you get! The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) smiles. I would like him to tell us when he gets up how else he would interpret that other than that members of the community are affected by it. Is that not regional interests? This is, as the member for Sturt said, a stunt-and not a very hard stunt. As I said at the beginning, it is one of the reasons why I like politics: to think that the shadow minister spent the morning or late last night, sitting there, thinking up some way he could try to divide the government, and this was the best he could do. But it was a nice attempt. Let us say it was one of those warm, friendly attempts that we see so often that really cannot rise that much ire. If I can point out to the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), who decided to attack the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), that I do not actually agree with the member for Corangamite on the Productivity Commission's report on the car industry. I think, said in a speech in this House yesterday, it a poor document. It is an intellectually impoverished document. But, for all that, the member for Corangamite has stood a very strong line on what he believes, and he believes it honestly. I would ask the member for Isaacs to clear up what he said earlier, because at one stage he had the member for Corangamite being skinned by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and then I think he changed it and had him being skinned by the member for Werriwa or Hotham. Perhaps he would like to make up his mind who is actually skinning the member for Corangamite-who, in fact, was not skinned at all but who has stood his ground on principle. I congratulate the member for Corangamite for the stand he has taken, although I have to say it is not a stand in this instance that I agree with. He at least is a man of principle and has not introduced to this House a trivial, nonsensical amendment simply on the political grounds that they might be able to divide the South Australians. It was a weak and pathetic attempt. The member for Hotham is going to have to try a lot harder in future if he thinks he is going to score on that side.  p.m.)-I am alarmed to hear the words of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). I have listened to her with great attention on other presentations but I am alarmed to hear her treat an amendment-that we from the region see of vital importance to us, to our careers, to job opportunities and industry for the future-with such scorn, regarding it as trivial and nonsensical. I say to the member: go back home to South Australia, to Adelaide and to country South Australia and tell them that is your view about the region. I hope everybody hears and sees what you had to say. I am alarmed at what you said. The amendment says 'to have regard to the regional development and employment consequences'. Aren't there any regional employment consequences for the car industry in South Australia? The amendment is of no accord, it is trivial, and it is nonsensical, is it? Go back home and tell that to the Adelaide as I Advertiser-make your attitude towards is employment in non-capital cities a front-page story. Where I come from, the Hunter and the Central Coast, regional economic development and regional economic development policies are of the utmost importance. Regions like the Hunter, the Central Coast, the Latrobe Valley and Geelong-regions right around Australia-have suffered decade after decade from neglect by conservative federal governments. Here we have a government led by a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who, in his role as Treasurer, scorned regions. I said last night in this place that, when we came as a delegation to talk to him about an autonomous taxation office for Newcastle to service the Hunter region and the north, his response was, 'No, there's no role for that.' When he becomes Prime Minister, back into the position of power, what are the first actions that are taken? Abolish the regional development program and close down the regional offices of public service departments. So CES offices are getting closed down, Medicare offices are being closed down, the Newcastle immigration office, which was performing a fantastic service for northern New South Wales and for central New South Wales, is being been closed down. You can go right through all the federal services and you will see reduction in the staff numbers and abolition of regionalisation of federal public services by this Prime Minister. It ill becomes those from country Australia who now sit opposite to be clamouring into support of what has been put forward by the government and not realising the doublespeak that they are getting. The growth centres of the future and the growth of this economy has to be in regional Australia. What those opposite on the back bench are really saying, is that you have no regard for that. You say: 'simply trust the Prime Minister and trust this government.' How can anybody trust this government-such a forgetful man, such a forgetful government; a government that puts forward propositions but when they are revealed now in the parliament says, 'Yes, but we didn't state those things at the election. Somebody else, the apparatchiks, the party, put out those responses to my statement.' If you go through all of those processes and you on that side think that is going to wear in regional Australia, you have another think coming. I want to argue as strongly as I can that the future of this country is in regions, and regions must have a voice. I tell you now: before this year is over, you on that side will be reintroducing regional development programs because of the scathing response there has been to the abolition of the regional development program in country Australia. You may not want to look across here but, you will see. Before the end of the year, you will reintroduce a regional development program because of the battering you are taking in country Australia. Talk to people associated with the regional development programs in western New South Wales and listen to what their views are about this government; talk to people in eastern country Victoria and ask them what their views are about this government and its attitudes to regional development. This is a doctrinaire, Treasury led government by a former Treasurer, a mouthpiece for the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It is absolutely essential in the interests of regions that this amendment be inserted into the legislation.",51
39,Ms WORTH,PAIRS,"The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) made much of these amendments but then snuck out of the place. He was very anxious early in opposition to prove that he was not suffering from relevancy deprivation syndrome and is still carrying out such activities to ensure we recognise that he stil does not. On one occasion when we were both in regional Australia, in Port Augusta, debating from the back of a truck, I recall him then saying that the ALP would stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Port Augusta. He was not owning up to the fact that he had stood shoulder to shoulder with Laurie Brereton when they sacked 972 workers from AN only a few months before, in September 1995. They were still going to the election saying that all was well at AN. There has been absolute hypocrisy about employment, about caring how many people are unemployed and about what is and is not regional Australia. The opposition is just getting itself into one more little stunt which is really not appreciated by the electorate. They should have learned that. They had 13 years to do things and to do them well. They messed it up; they have been chucked out; and they now are not handling opposition all that well. We could be getting on and debating other important legislation. This bill is not about the car industry; this bill is not about the latest draft report of the Productivity Commission. There will be inquiries into that report and public discussion going on this month and next month. This legislation has absolutely nothing to do with that at all. The general policy guidelines for the commission, which were read out by the member  member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), are very important. For the opposition, who perhaps have not read them, I will remind them again: it is to recognise, for instance, the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the commission. I would not have thought you would actually even need to add the word 'regional' to that. Go back to school. What would your English teachers have had to say about that? Look at the correct drafting of things. As has already been said, there will be plenty of opportunities for the government to put in the appropriate terms of reference when it is wanting inquiries made by the Productivity Commission. The car industry in South that Australia, as in other parts of Australia, is very important. The car industry in South Australia is important to me, but it is even more important to the 17,000 people who work in it. Because I recognised that this bill was not about the debate on the car industry, I actually spoke about that industry in the grievance debate on Monday. I said on that occasion that we cannot live in a textbook and how important the industry was in South Australia. But I also reiterate that that draft report is not even the full report yet. It is the final report to the government. When it is, the government will consider that report. I support Ian Webber. It was good that the government brought in somebody with industry experience. All that is good. But this bill is not about the car industry and it is not about that report. The member for Hotham, in conjunction with others in opposition, has been up to one more political stunt. I say to him and I say to the opposition that the people of Australia are sick of stunts. They want some real action. We should be getting through this bill and getting on to debating other legislation which will be of real relevance and real importance to the people of Australia. The members from South Australia will not be hoodwinked by this little stunt and neither will the people in our electorates.",53
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Andrew)Before calling the member for Corio, I did not interrupt the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) but, as was pointed out by members of the opposition, the clauses being considered deal deliberately with regional development rather than the car industry per se. I would request members to stay on that particular issue.",54
41,Mr OCONNOR,PAIRS,"The series of amendments that have been proposed-particularly amendment No.4 relating to the need for the Productivity Commission to have regard, when it is giving advice to government, to the effect that its recommendations will have on regions-are very reasonable amendments. I cannot see anything in this particular amendment that would send a shiver up the spine of any member of the opposition. How members opposite can come in here and say that this is just a political stunt is quite beyond me. We really do need to entrench in the charter of this new body that is going to give very specialised, very specific economic advice to government a reference to regional concerns. In the Productivity Commission's deliberations, when it constructs and implements its models of economic activity and when it makes its own judgments about the evidence, one of the factors that it needs to take into not account is the impact that those recommendations might have on particular regions. The reason I am speaking to this amendment is fairly obvious because before the Industry Commission as I speak here today are two references: one on the automotive industry and the other on the textile, clothing and manufacturing industry. Both of those industries employ around 7,000 people in direct employment in. my electorate. You could imagine what would happen to downstream employment if we had significant job losses in those particular industries. I should say at this point that over the past 15 years we have seen a rationalisation of those industries in the Geelong community. So we are aware of the processes of structural adjustment; we are aware of the possible job losses that can occur. What we are simply saying to the bodies that give advice to government is that they must now take into account from the provisions of their charter the concerns of people in regional areas. I was interested in what the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) had to say. He said that this particular amendment would make the Productivity Commission impotent and that all you had to do was leave the consideration of regional issues to the government of the day. That is all very fine, but we have a problem because the government of the day says that it does not have any constitutional responsibility for the regions. Indeed, in the budget that the government brought down, it put its hand in the chest of the regions and ripped out the heart with its bare hands. That is what it did in the budget. There was not a whimper from the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the honourable  member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) and other members who are here today in this particular debate. What we are simply saying is we should enshrine this provision in the legislation so that the government of the day cannot avoid the issue of regional development because, we know, we have a minister for transport and not transport and regional development. The federal government has openly said they have no constitutional responsibility for regional development. But I was very intrigued with the way the member for Hindmarsh suggested that all the government had to do was write in the refermust ence that the Productivity Commission could examine regional issues. The problem with that is that under this legislation the Producto tivity Commission can initiate references it can leave out any reference to regional development. So where are we going to get if you have a Productivity Commission that that. can draft its own references and leave out any reference to regional development and government that sees no constitutional responfor sibility for regional development? The most culpable member in this is member who got skinned by the member Hotham (Mr Crean)-and he is here in the House today-the member for Corangamite. They are going to hang his political carcass at the front end of his electorate coming Geelong and at the back end of it, because there is no other member on the floor of this House who has indulged himself in such a great economic rationalist fantasy, that going to destroy Geelong industry, as the member for Corangamite. I made him a rately promise today that I will make sure his speech does reach every shop floor in both the textile, clothing and manufacturing industry and the automotive industry in Geelong. (Time expired)",54
42,Mr MUTCH,PAIRS,"I very much appreciated the contribution just made by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). It was harkening back to the days of the previous member for Blaxland with all his imagery of ripping out hearts-what be called neurolinguistic language, I suppose-and carcasses and all the rest. his point that he was going to become the to propagandist for the member for Corangamite and (Mr MCArthur), and we very much appreciate his efforts in that regard. This proposed amendment is obviously nothing more than an attempt by the honourposed able member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to write as himself a job description because he is the shadow minister-for those who are not aware, and there are probably those that are not-for industry and regional development. I think his job as Manager of Opposition Business should be taken more seriously because this sort of amendment does tend to waste the time of the House. But we really respond and reveal that it is nothing more than a stunt. I believe that the honourable member for Hotham-with my apologies the English language-is exhibiting the and gasbaggery for which he is becoming known in this place. He can make a name for himself it in that field and perhaps he should stick to The ALP have just produced someone from a regional Australia-the honourable member  fairly thin on the ground when it comes to the producing members from regional Australia for to speak to this amendment because the Australian people spoke most vehemently from the regions when they elected us overwhelmingly at the last federal election. What into distinguishes us from the ALP is that the concerns of regional Australia are intrinsic to everything we do, in everything we say, and in all our concerns. We really do have great is concern for the country as a whole. It is something the sectional Labor Party is despenow trying to grasp back, but they just do not relate very well to the country areas. With respect to this proposed amendment to clause 8, surely it is res ipsa loquitur: the thing speaks for itself. Perhaps they should get advice from the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) when they attempt to draft such nonsensical amendments. Clause 8 refers to 'General policy guidelines for Commission.' You only then have to refer to subclause (d) to find the reference to regional may Australia and employment. That subclause I did like calls upon the commission: recognise the interests of industries, consumers the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission; If we do not think communities live in regional Australia, I do not know what we are supto be thinking on the opposition side. The proposed amendment really is nonsensical and irrelevant. We probably should not be wasting so much of the time of the House on this. Clause 8, subclause (2), is also quite specific: In the performance of its functions, the Commission must also have regard to any other matters notified to it in writing by the Minister. It is obvious. The only criticism you possibly could make of the general policy guidelines to the commission is that probably they are too detailed. You want to make sure that guidelines are such that the commission address itself to all the relevant concerns. you want to be specific about regions or areas of interest that need to be addressed by particular report, it is all there for the minister to make sure that those things are stipulated in the matter notified to the commission. Once again, we have a scenario where the sion. honourable member for Hotham comes up with another amendment that is really decritical signed to do nothing but showcase the that they have invented a position for him, wants to write himself a job description he is desperately sticking to that task. is not working. The fact that we are amalgamating a ber of commissions into the Productivity Commission is very important. We are current streamlining the efficiency of economic advice that is sought on behalf of the ment. It is very important that we do look at the efficiency of those operations. For too long we had a government that has been kicked out by the Australian people on the basis of profligacy, waste and too much government unfortunately-too much duplication, too much government. What we are that trying to do is streamline. The fact is that, this one efficiency, budgetary cost $5 million are expected already in 1997-98 and $6.15 million in 1998-99 and so on.

Opposition speakers have mentioned that we have merged three bodies. However, rather than the focus being broadened through that merging, it has been narrowed. It has narrowed the focus, the philosophy and the policy. If the member for Sturt and the other members are not concerned about that, they should look at the first report which the Productivity Commission put out even before it was established-the so-called stocktake report. That report shows that this body is not going to be concerned at all about regional development. It is not going to be concerned about social justice. It is not going to be concerned about fairness. It is going to be concerned about a narrow agenda based on economic rationalism-that is what it is going to be concerned about. People in the regions who have genuine concerns about the employment consequences of the recommendations of this Productivity Commission are going to suffer. The report on the car industry is an example of what is to come. Although the body has called itself the Industry Commission, the restructure has taken place and the people who are going to be involved in the Productivity Commission after this bill goes through will be the same sort of people who produced the report on the car industry.  ment.",57

The members from the regions who have come here to try to argue that we should not have an amendment of this kind will regret it. An amendment of this kind is absolutely essential, given the nature, philosophy and general approach of the Productivity Commission. The idea that a minister can simply write in additional terms of reference at the end of the process is a nonsense. We are talking about the need to have a commission whose business it is to take account of the social issues, of the social justice questions and, importantly, of the regional issues. It should take account of the consequences, especially the employment consequences, to people in the region when it comes to determinations about what to do about our key industries and the process of developing the country in terms of further development of industries in the regions.

53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Andrew)I remind the member for Kingston, as I have already reminded other members, that we are dealing with an amendment and the standing orders oblige us, in dealing with an amendment, to focus on the amendment, which in this case is an amendment directed to the development of regional Australia.",57
54,Ms JEANES,PAIRS,"I certainly take the point, Mr Deputy Speaker. The general policy guidelines for the new Productivity Commission take into account the impacts on communities. Surely this gives the Productivity Commission much greater scope to look, not only at regions, but within regions, and to look at the people in the communities that will be affected by its reports. Of course, for my electorate of Kingston, it is very appropriate that the Productivity Commission in the future will be able to focus on those workers and their employment opportunities. Had the Industry Commission done that then maybe we would not have such a flawed report. The community concept is a very important one and I do not think that the concept of regions, which the opposition is arguing should be placed in the act, would make the act any stronger, or would provide any more protection to the workers in my electorate. It is good to see that the opposition has not been asleep over the Christmas break. South Australian members have been debating the report that was released by the Industry Commission and discrediting it, and no doubt the ongoing criticism will continue. I believe that this amendment simply seeks to capitalise on the legitimate debate that has been going on between members of the government and between members of the opposition. We have all had our say on the recommendations made within the report and I believe that they stand discredited. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has been watching this debate and that is the very reason why we have the amendments placed before us, in order to entice some South Australian members to be attracted to support those amendments, but it is not going to work. I would like to make some comments in regard to the statements of the member for  accused the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) of scorning South Australia's regions. The member for Hindmarsh, along with many other South Australian members, has been a very strong voice, a very strong supporter, of the people who live within her electorate, of the people who live within the regions of South Australia, and for the workers in South Australia's automotive industry. For that reason I believe the member for Shortland should be condemned for his comments in regard to the member for Hindmarsh. This government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have supported the car industry and I continue to support the workers in the car industry. I will continue to discredit the Industry Commission's report. Let us hope that the Productivity Commission's future reports will be much more credible and much better due to this bill that has been introduced into the House today.",57
55,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,PAIRS,"The members from South Australia really have a touch of arrogance. They have actually got a bit carried away with themselves. They think the regions of Australia simply mean South Australia. Fortunately for the country it does not, they actually are much more widespread. Perhaps they have neit realised that in South Australia there is also a steel industry at Whyalla, which is very much under threat. Perhaps they have not realised that regions include places like the Pilbara in Western Australia. In fact, Australia is made up of a series of regions, but you would not know it from our economic statistics. The fact is that for quite a long time there has been a debate raging about the need to understand our country as a series of economic regions. One region is the conurbation of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, which takes in two states. That is one region. It is one economic zone, not two. However, look at our statistics and you will not see it as one, you will see it as two. You will see southern Queensland and northern New South Wales as two separate regions which, of course, they are not. Similar things occur in Albury-Wodonga. Our economic statistics do not reflect the country at all. Historically, organisations like the Industry Commission and this new Productivity Commission do not reflect the actuality. They give an artificial view of the economy of the country and change is long overdue. There is legislation now refocusing and restructuring and it is very difficult to understand why the government has not accepted these amendments. Why wouldn't you have an amendment included which says 'and to have regard to the regional development and regional employment consequences'? Why wouldn't that be seen as an improvement of legislation? It is a sensible logical extension. The idea from the South Australian members that somehow this is an attack on them or some attempt to inveigle them is a little bit fanciful. At the moment there is a company in Newcastle in receivership with 300 employees. It is Australia's biggest suit maker incorporating modem high technology and good investment. They have done everything right but as far as our economics are concerned as a country, it does not show up. Taking it across the whole country or the whole of the state, it does not spike into the statistics. Similarly we have got steel in three regions of Australia but it should be five or six or seven. We have currently got Newcastle. We have got Kembla. We have Whyalla. We also now have Port Hedland. We could have north and south Australia-it is a very real possibility. We could have the Meekatharra deposits in southern South Australia and we could have possibly two other areas in Western Australia. But the minister is announcing a committee of parliamentarians. He refused a parliamentary committee but has a committee of parliamentarians. Are they going to Western Australia where the new emerging regions are for steel? No, not at all. The government does not see any role for that. In other words what we are trying to suggest is that the government is stuck in the old rut of the states. This government is about states and states' rights and in the process it undermines and damages the regions. While ever the view in Canberra is via the state channels, via the state governments and the state premiers, the regions will never be understood. There may well be one region in a state; there may well be three regions in a state, but the fact is that until we, as a parliament, and our institutions start to understand the actualiAustralia. ty of our economy which is that it is regional, we will never make it work very well. The future of this country is not in the Melbourne and Sydney areas which are largely suffocated because of transport complications and land costs. The future lies in the regions and their potential growth. Unless you take that into account in employment, in skills, in provision of training and investment and analyse it accordingly and look at it accordingly, we will never make it work. These amendments are very sensible, logical things. It is amazing and people out in the community will be astounded that the government does not just accept them and get on with it. They do make a lot of sense and the idea that those opposite, now in government, are now playing this funny game about, 'Because they're yours, we won't accept them. Because we did not think of it, we won't absorb them,' is really very childish. I commend the amendments to the House. (Time expired)",58
56,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (1.39 p.m.)-I can tell the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) who just spoke why we will not be supporting this. This is a straight political stunt from an opposition that, when in government, could not give a tinker's curse about regional Australia. They did absolutely nothing for 13 years to help regional Australia. The one group of people that paid the ultimate penalty for the former Prime Minister's recession we had to have was regional and rural Australia. They were the ones that went into recession first and they are the ones who are still there. It is utter hypocrisy of this opposition to come in here to pull a political stunt like this-whacking something in as an amendment and expecting us to fall over backwards in joy. I can assure you it is probably one of the richest things I have heard since this mob was in opposition. Let us have a good, long, hard look at what they are trying to hang their hat on. They talk about their former regional development policy-this was going to save regional When was it implemented? Just prior to the last election-a cheap political stunt trying to shore up their vote in regional Australia. The very reason those speaking opposite are from metropolitan areas is the simple fact they do not have any regional representation. They were decimated in regional Australia. That little stunt they tried to pull before the last election did not fool anyone and it most certainly did not fool the people of regional Australia. I find it very interesting that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) was running around Australia last year saying, 'We're going to recreate this regional development program and it is going to be where we will put our influence into regional Australia.' Guess what was said by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in January of this year: 'We haven't yet worked out what our vision for regional Australia is, but we see how important it is.' Either the member for Hotham is wrong or the Leader of the Opposition has absolutely no idea of what his party intends doing in relation to regional Australia. I might just give you a few quotes from those on the Labor Party side of the House about this fundamentally flawed regional development policy that they had. We are talking about regional development and I am addressing remarks made about that by people such as one minister from New South Wales",59
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I remind the member for Ballarat that I have listened to him for over half of his speaking time, and he has paid reference to regional Australia, but as he well knows, as the mentary secretary, merely inserting the word 'region' does not necessarily tie his remarks directly to the amendment before the chair which is an amendment dealing with the Productivity Commission and its consideration of regional issues. I would appreciate him addressing that matter.",60
58,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,"I take my lead from the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) who had a lot to say about the slashing of programs and who was waxing lyrical about the former government's programs. But I will talk about the question of regional development in the context of the Productivity Commission and the absolute fallacy and hypocrisy of this opposition in introducing an amendment. Even their own people know that they are utter hypocrites in relation to regional develhad opment. Michael Egan quite clearly said the former program that members on the other side have been talking about this morning in a wide ranging debate which they were quite rightly allowed to pursue, that 'significant time and money is wasted. Cost overheads could be more meaningfully applied to projects. Client and community confusion has been created-burnout of regional leaders' . Mr Deputy Speaker, when you are talking about regional development and about giving regions a go-which the opposition believe that this phoney little amendment is going to achieve-the serious problem we have here is that their own credibility is fundamentally flawed. Rather than dealing with the people that should be involved in regional development, that is local government, the states and other organisations, those opposite, tired to put their own-and I think we all know why they tried to do it, it is not related to regional development, but their long-term plan about what the governmental structure should be in this country-infrastructure in place that had absolutely no association with the very people who should be assisting the delivery of regional development. To come in here, bleeding hearts talking about regional Australia-they still have not apologised to those that they hurt the most. (Time expired)",60
59,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS," Mr parliaDeputy Speaker, as you pointed out, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), actually had nothing to say of relevance to the Productivity Commission Bill or the clause. It is a miserable existence he has because he is parliamentary secretary in an area of government responsibility that his minister, Mr Sharp, has abolished. Mr Sharp has said there is no Commonwealth constitutional or funding responsibility for regional development. I suppose that makes the parliamentary secretary a parliamentary secretary for nothing, which in the food chain of parliamentary life is probably the bottom of the ocean. It is barely surprising by that analysis that he was right off the bill and right off the clause and nothing to say of any substance about the need for this particular amendment. As to the other matters that he raised, if we accept his proposition that all those problems in Australia's regions took place over the last 13 years, what problem is there in inserting the need for regional development and regional employment to be considered by the Productivity Commission? If the member for Ballarat is correct in saying that all those things happened and all those problems occurred over the last 13 years in Australia's region, it is all the more reason to support the Labor amendment. It is all the more reason to support the Productivity Commission's having regard for regional development and regional employment. It is a basic proposition that, by his own argument, he has de facto supported. I tum now to other government members who have been attacking this amendment. The member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) was saying that, because the word 'community' is in the reference to the Productivity Commission, it covers regions. That is not the case. The Productivity Commission in their national model regard the community interest as the national interest and, in between community and nation, they have no place for assessing regional impacts. Do not take me for the source of those things, take the member for Hindmarsh herself. In debate last night she said 'models have to have assumptions in them', and that one of the things that the Industry Commission will admit is wrong with its model is that 'it does not have the capacity to take in regional effects. So regional effects are out of this model. Quite interesttreasurer ingly, Chris Murphy has a model-MM2-in which he did manage to look at regional effects. According to Mr Murphy's model, we get a 1.2 per cent drop in South Australian state product as a result of the change in tariff' . It is a strange thing indeed for the member for Hindmarsh to be saying last night that the Productivity Commission model takes no account of regional effects, it has no regional dimension to its analysis, but today, because she has been corralled into it by the government whips, she is forced to say that the word 'community' in the Productivity Commission Bill denotes a regional consideration. She cannot have it both ways and she, too, is damned by her own analysis, the words that she put to this House just last night. Beyond that, other government contributors have not had a very good time of it. We had the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) saying that this was an amendment that the Labor Party advanced at the very last minute. Where was she last night when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Evans, stood up and moved a second reading amendment which stated, in part, 'believing that the Commission should be required to have regard when providing its advice to the regional development and employment consequences of that advice.' So this was foreshadowed by the Australian Labor Party in debate 24 hours ago. Part of the reason we are moving this amendment in detail is that we are expecting all those government members who spoke in favour of regional analysis and regional effects in the debate last night to support us today. We were moving this amendment on their behalf. The shadow treasurer stood up and moved the second reading amendment last night. The member for Hindmarsh and her colleagues came out and said, 'That is right, the Productivity Commission is deficient because it does not take account of regional effects.' The Australian Labor Party comes in today and says, 'Okay, we will take that proposition. It has been supported by the shadow and by the member for Hindmarsh; we will move an amendment in detail to write regional development and employment into the charter of the Productivity Commission.' As I started out some time ago, we are from the opposition and we are here to help on these matters. We are here to help all those government members who have a concern that the Productivity Commission takes no account of regional effects. We could not be any more sincere, any more helpful, any more constructive in our amendments this morning than we have in raising the matter that has been moved by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). This need not be a partisan matter. This need not be a matter where people like the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) feel the need to stand up and denounce this proposition only because it has been moved by the Labor Party. If he was advancing this, he would find many reasons why the Productivity Commission should take account of regional effects. Let him say those things now. (Time expired)",60
60,Mr BOB BALDWIN,PAIRS,"I am quite astonished by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) who can stand up and say, 'We're from the opposition and we're here to help you.' Where you have been for the last 13 years? In the last 13 you went through and you destroyed regional and rural Australia, systematically just wiped it off the map. If you need any proof of that, the proof is the fact that you only have two members on that side of the chamber from regional and rural Australia. So where is the proof of your pudding? You are coming in here a little bit late. You stand up and talk about fuel prices and yet you sent the transport industry to the wall in regional and rural Australia, which relies on transport, by your failure to do anything about the fuel industry. Mr Latham-You don't know what you are talking about.",62
61,Mr BOB BALDWIN,PAIRS,"I know what I am talking about-I am talking about regional and rural Australia and what has been happening there. I am going to talk about some of the areas that you have destroyed. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. After the rulings you made earlier, he cannot give a 13-year survey of regional development. He has to talk to the bill.",62
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Andrew)The member for Werriwa is well aware that the Deputy Speaker has endeavoured to be even-handed in the policing of this. I am sure the member for Paterson is aware that he needs to address the amendments before the House on the Productivity Commission Bill, which deal with regional Australia, but he cannot get away with simply using the word 'regional' and not referring to the specific amendments. I call the member for Paterson and invite him to address his remarks to the bill.",62
63,Mr BOB BALDWIN,PAIRS,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe I am talking about regional and rural Australia, what is important to the people there, and what would come before the Productivity Commission. We only have to look at the Labor Party's record in regional and rural Australia, yet members opposite want to walk away from those 13 years. We have just heard that the member for Werriwa does not want reflection on 13 years of failure, 13 years years where they did nothing. In that period of time-and he supported it-they destroyed regional and rural Australia; they destroyed productivity. They wiped out the timber industry; indeed, the Mayor of Gloucester is coming here today to talk to the minister about the failures of the state government, supported by the previous federal Labor government, in the timber industry, and the wiping out of jobs and any opportunities in regional and rural Australia. It goes on. The chicken industry is another classic example.",62
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The member for Paterson must address the question that is before the chair, and that is the changes that are proposed by the amendment to the Productivity Commission Bill and the changes that are proposed by the inserting of reference to regional and rural Australia.",62
65,Mr BOB BALDWIN,PAIRS,"I am getting to that, particularly with the chicken industry, Mr Deputy Speaker. The intention to open up the chicken industry to competition, where they have had absolutely nothing to say aboutMr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Paterson is' deliberately flouting your ruling. I invite you to sit him down if he cannot address the clause.",62
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I do not need any assistance from the member for Werriwa on how to control the member for Paterson or the House. The member for Paterson knows what is expected of him. He knows that he will be obliged to resume his seat if he does not address his remarks to the Productivity Commission Bill. I invite him to do so.,62
67,Mr BOB BALDWIN,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to go to a point that the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) raised about Rundles clothing-and if it is good enough for the goose, it is good enough for the gander, because there was no chicken industry left after they had finished. It is as though they have not been here for 13 years. It is as though they have been in opposition for the past 13 years. All of a sudden they say that Rundles is finding it tough because of tariff barriers and competition from overseas products, but who has administered that for the last 13 years? Who has allowed it to happen? Have we heard any comments about this from the member for Newcastle before? No, none at all. Have there been any comments  Morris)? No, none at all. It is as though the member has had the lights turned off for the last 13 years, but now he is facing a preselection battle-and I hear that the member for Werriwa is helping, as indeed are other people, to get rid of him. I can understand that. After 13 years, he comes in, turns the lights on and finally finds a fax machine and a telephone. We wish him well. The bottom line is that he has not stuck up for regional and rural Australia. Regardless of what competition policies his government put in place, competition policies that, as we have heard, are going to wipe out 320 jobs in his area",62
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Paterson will resume his seat.,63
69,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,It is a pleasure and a privilege to follow the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) who was maintaining his average in terms of irrelevant contributions to this place. I understand that in a local fundraiser the member was sponsoring constituents in his area to encourage him to lose weight,63
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Andrew)The member for Isaacs is running the risk of being similarly directed.,63
71,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"In a brief contribution, Mr Deputy Speaker Mr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",63
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I hope this is a valid point of order. Mr Bob Baldwin-You spoke to me of relevance and asked me to resume my seat,63
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Paterson will resume his seat. He was shown a great deal of tolerance by the chair. The member for Isaacs has had the call for all of 20 seconds. I call the member for Isaacs.,63
74,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"If I could be extended such tolerance also for a moment, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would say to the member that if he wants to lose 10 pounds of ugly fat, he should cut off his head.",63
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Isaacs will withdraw that remark and address his remarks to the question before the chair.,63
76,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"I withdraw that remark. We know that reform is crucial to future living standards in regional Australia. Some major reforms have already been introduced in regional Australia but much more needs to be done. In fact, I would encourage the now government to follow the trend demonstrated in the One Nation document in terms of its commitment to regional Australia and the structural adjustment that was ongoing as part of that process in regional Australia. There is a great need to develop and make the best use of Australia's human resources, particularly in regional Australia, as well as to improve our social and economic infrastructure in those regions. It is for this reason that the opposition is so committed to incorporating as an integral part of this legislation a reference-and more than just passing reference to the words 'community' or 'nation' or whatever-to the word 'region'. We want some definite, deliberate reference to the word 'region'. We need to entrench and express that in this bill as an expression of our commitment to those crucial areas in which many Australians choose to live. Of course, the Productivity Commission must also take into account the needs and aspirations of residents and constituents of this parliament in regional areas. As I again affirm, we need to make more than passing reference to regions. We all know that in last year's budget, regions of this great nation were gutted by this government. Indeed, this is one attempt by the opposition to ameliorate the plight of regional Australia in terms of the devastation that has been wrought upon them by those opposite. The member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) suggested that given that the word 'community' was already contained in regulations associated with the bilI that that was sufficient in terms of incorporating a definition of the word 'nation', indeed of the word 'region'. However, the Productivity Commission has more than a loose definition of the word 'community'. It defines it more than just loosely, it defines it as a nation. That is, community interests are, as the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said, our national interests. Far too broad a definition for our purposes is that one that I have just put to you. If we are representing the interests of regional Australia then I ask government members why it is that they are not prepared to incorporate a more definitive definition of regional Australia in this bill. Is it simply because we are committed to it and they are not? We are committed to it and they haven't got the guts to incorporate in this bilI anything more than a passing reference to regional Australia. The member for Hindmarsh' s claim that the definition of 'community' is an all-embracing one is absolute, arrant nonsense. In fact, the Productivity Commission's Stocktake report does not refer to the word 'community' in any way, shape or form. It only reports in the context of the nation; there is nothing to do with community as such. I think that the member for Hindmarsh is completely wrong in her fatuous assertion that the word 'community' referred to the word 'region'. On page 31 of the report it only discusses outcomes in terms of national growth figures. It discusses outcomes in terms of GOP. It discusses outcomes in terms of findings by the IC, the BIB, EPAC and the BCA in regard to the impact of micro-economic reform on a range of nationally based economic indicators, notably GOP. There is nothing there to do with regions. For that reason I ask those opposite that they have the guts and the fortitude to place within this bill a more than passing reference to the word 'region' and demonstrate the same sort of commitment that we have to regional Australia. (Time expired)",63
77,Mr REID,PAIRS,"I am pleased to speak on this bilI, the Productivity Commission Bill, because it is quite obvious that the members on the other side of the chamber have not read what we are proposing in 8(1)(a), and that is: to improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in the public and private sectors in order to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community; That's what we are doing. In fact, we have reduced interest rates three times. There have been three reductions in interest rates and do not tell me that they do not flow on to regional areas of Australia. In fact, the people in my electorate welcome the change since the Howard government has come into being and the impact it has had on the economy in regional Australia. I want to take you back to the bad old days of Labor when interest rates went from the seven and eight per cent mark up to 21, 22, and in some instances 23 per cent. That is what you did for regional Australia. You drove regional businesses out of regional areas",64
78,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! It being 2 p.m. the debate is interrupted ih accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Staff: Senator Colston,64
79,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In relation to the Colston staff upgrade, first, did Senator Colston approach him or his office seeking the upgrade of his staff position prior to Senator Reid's letter to him, the Prime Minister, of 15 November? Secondly, is the Prime Minister aware that the current Senate estimate of the total annual cost to taxpayers of the upgrade he approved is closer to $75,000 than the $20,000 the Prime Minister referred to in his letter or the $4,000 figure his staff were trying to flog around the press gallery last night? Thirdly, and finally, is he aware that the President of the Senate is on the written record saying that the new classification level 'would not be justified on the basis of the approved duties' of the Deputy President?",64
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As to the first occasion on which Senator Colston approached my staff, I understand that Senator Colston had discussions with my chief of staff, Nicole Feely. He may have had discussions with somebody else. I will find out from Ms Feely, who is currently on sick leave.",65
81,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How convenient.,65
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think that comment does require to be withdrawn. There is no need to carry on like that.,65
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I actually did not hear the comment, Prime Minister, but if the words were offensive then I am more than happy to invite the honourable member to withdraw.",65
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just repeat that my chief of staff has been on sick leave since before Christmas, and I will speak to her and get the sequence of events. As to the second question, I have not seen that information; I will have a look at it. As to the third question, I will check the veracity of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said. Home Mortgage Rates",65
85,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of recent developments in relation to home mortgage rates?,65
86,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I am aware of recent developments. This morning, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia dropped its standard variable mortgage rate from 8.25 per cent to 7.55 per cent. As I have previously said, that rate of 7.55 per cent by the Commonwealth Bank in relation to its standard variable mortgage is the lowest since June 1974. Interest rates are now at their lowest since June 1974. Of course, in 1974 loans were rationed and quite often people on those rates had to take cocktails. The last time the ceiling on home loans was below 7.55 per cent was in 1969. Government member interjecting-When man walked on the moon.",65
87,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When man walked on the moon, that is right. One small step for the Commonwealth Bank, one giant leap for home buyers this morning. Since March 1996, when the standard variable rate was 10.5 per cent, interest rates have fallen by 2.95 per cent. On the average Australian $100,000 home loan mortgage, that is an interest saving of $246 a month. All Australians will welcome the fact that home loan rates are falling, and I pay special tribute to the new mortgage originators-the Aussie Home Loans, the RAMS-that introduce competition and put the competitive urge on banks to drop those rates. They have led the way, and I call on other banks to see if they can match the Commonwealth Bank in relation to that announcement. As I indicated earlier in the week, fo: the first time we are now seeing the mortgage originators, such as Aussie Home Loans, go into small business lending. This represents a wonderful opportunity for small business to put competitive forces at play to get the benefits in relation to their businesses. I urge those small businesses to go down to their banks and ask their banks whether they can match the rates which are now being offered by the mortgage originators. This government turned away from the Labor path of high debt, high deficit and high interest rates. We took the decisions to rescue the fiscal situation of Australia. We decided to embark on a low inflation, low interest rate strategy. The benefits will be for small business. The benefits will be for home buyers. There will be wonderful opportunities in relation to those people, and they are the benefits which responsible economic management can bring. Family Tax Initiative",65
88,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maybe the Treasurer will be less pleased with himself after this question, which I now put to him. Will he confirm, as he had to on the Laws program today, that it is possible under his family tax initiative for a family earning $77,000 a year to get a nearly $20 a fortnight tax break which is denied to a family earning $27,000? Why did he make things which are so blatantly unfair to baulers a 'deliberate design feature' of the Australian tax system?",65
89,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course I confirm what I said on the Laws program, and I am pleased that you have the time to listen in. I was very pleased that when we released the mid-year review the shadow Treasurer was in the country. He had just got back from the Clinton inaugural, and he came out and gave a doorstop saying, 'It's jobs, stupid,' presumably speaking to himself. Then he went away the next day again and left it to the shadow assistant Treasurer. They are putting to work Martin Ferguson's policy of job sharing-the two of them-but they are trying to do it on two salaries instead of one, Martin. You should tell them that the idea of job sharing is to share the income as well as the workload. Of course I said that on the Laws program because the design features of the family tax initiative were: part (a), which was for all qualifying parents with dependent children up to that income ceiling of $70,000 adjusted per defendant gained under part (a); under part (b) there was an additional gain for the single income family with a child under five. That was to redress what we thought was some of the current imbalance against the single income family which does not have access to two tax free thresholds, nor does it have access to two marginal rates of 20 per cent. That was a deliberate design feature. That was the way in which the family tax initiative was designed and introduced. We make no apology for that. This was a family tax initiative for the families of Australia-$1 billion of tax relief for Australian families-and this government is proud of it. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",66
90,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and follows my question yesterday on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge fiasco. Prime Minister, who will have to pay for any further reports that are required into the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair as a result of the Senate's decision this week? As a representative of regional Australia, may I observe that, whoever pays, surely the money for any such inquiry could be put to better use.",66
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the arrangements, ATSIC is responsible for administering the legislation relevant to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair and I have advice from my department to the effect that the cost of both the Saunders report and the Mathews report has been met out of the ATSIC budget. That is under administrative arrangements which, it is my understanding, prevailed under the former government and have been continued by my government. So to date ATSIC has had to fund the Saunders inquiry and the Mathews inquiry, the latter of which cost $1.03 million. I say again that the government is adamant that no further taxpayers' money should be spent on this tawdry saga which has cost in excess of $4 million to date. This is the reason why we will return the Hindmarsh Island Bridge legislation to the Senate. The Labor Party and the minor parties in the Senate must understand that, if they do not pass this legislation, the people they are hurting are the indigenous people of Australia because the cost of another inquiry will come out of the ATSIC budget. It passes the comprehension of the average Australian that you should be so insensitive, so indifferent and so obsessed with ideology rather than common sense that you should vote yet again against this legislation. Mr Melham interjecting",66
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Banks!,66
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a result of your actions and those of the minor parties in the Senate, indigenous Australians are going to be deprived of the money that ATSIC would otherwise be able to spend in Aboriginal communities overcoming existing disadvantages in areas of health, housing, employment and education. You parrot your concern for the indigenous people of Australia in areas like this, yet when it comes to your priorities you are more obsessed with the sorts of forces that drove the former Aboriginal Affairs minister down that quite stupid path on Hindmarsh Bridge than you are with the application of practical common sense. What you have done is to take another $1 million to $1.5 million out of the ATSIC budget. What you have done is to take another $1 million to $1 Y2 million away from expenditure on health, housing and education. Be it on your heads that they are your priorities. You are more obsessed with your theories about these things than you are with rendering practical help to the indigenous people of Australia. NA",66
94,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the French Senate Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and the Armed Forces led by Senator Xavia Devillepin. A very warm welcome to you, ladies and gentlemen. May you enjoy your stay with us. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Hindmarsh Island Bridge",67
95,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, your government accepted an amendment to the Social Security Act in relation to newly arrived residents that is subjected to the RDA and expressed the view that the RDA did not contravene the act. Why are you refusing the same amendment in relation to Hindmarsh Island? Is it true that there is not a protection order with respect to Hindmarsh Island in existence? Is it also true that, even if there were, your minister has the power to amend or override it? Is it therefore not true that construction of the bridge over Hindmarsh Island could proceed immediately?",67
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is completely contrary to the advice that is available to the government. Wik Decision,67
97,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the anxiety created by the Wik decision for the pastoral and mining industries, can the Prime Minister inform the parliament of his discussions so far and the next step in the process to resolve this issue?",67
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question. I want to say again that the government will make a fair and considered response to the Wik decision after it has finished a round of consultations with relevant organisations, with representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and also with the state and territorial governments. I have said that the goal of the government in this area is to have an outcome, a solution, a response which delivers both justice and certainty to all of the people who are affected by this decision. The Wik decision did surprise many people. It did overturn the understanding that many Australians had which was largely based on the preamble to the Native Title Act. It is a matter of some interest to me, and I think to the House, that the preamble to the Native Title Act stated that native title had been: ... extinguished by valid government acts that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold estates That particular clause gave rise to the quite understandable expectation with the whole of Australia that the grant of a pastoral lease had extinguished native title. It is also interesting that the status given to that proposition in the preamble to the Native Title Act was exactly the same status as was given to the statement in the Native Title Act that the High Court had rejected the doctrine that Australia was terra nullius at the time of European settlement. Those who argue that there was no the particular strength in the proposition that a pastoral lease had extinguished native title are also in a sense arguing that there was no greater strength in the proposition that the High Court of Australia had overturned the doctrine of terra nullius. I do not pretend that this is an easy matter to resolve. The discussions I had on 22 January with the Premiers and the Chief Ministers were extremely useful. On 6 February, the Commonwealth received further material on proposals by the states and the territories. That is now under consideration. There will be a round table meeting here in Canberra on Friday between me, Senator Minchin-the parliamentary secretary who has given very valuable assistance to the government on this issue-representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, representatives of the National Farmers Federation, the Minerals Council and other organisations whose members are affected by this particular situation. We have not ruled out any options except the option of doing absolutely nothing or the option of, in some way, trying to overturn the basic principles of the Mabo decision. They are the two options which are absolutely sacrosanct as far as we are concerned. I think it is important that if we are to have ated settlement of this issue that those people who have a vital stake in a just outcome and an outcome that delivers certainty must be prepared to make some compromises. The government is approaching this issue in a spirit of trying to find common ground in respect of a very difficult challenge between people who hold strongly opposed views. It may not be possible to find that common ground, but I want to assure the House that I personally and my government will leave absolutely no effort untouched in order to try to reach that common ground. But if there is to be common ground it must be achieved within a reasonable time frame because it is not in the national interest for there to be ongoing and lingering uncertainty and doubt. There can be no argument, in my view, that the whole basis of the discussion on native title was fundamentally altered by the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Wik case. I accept that decision as a proper interpretation of the current law, but, of course, I naturally reiterate the right of the national parliament to change the current law of Australia if it believes it to be in the national interest. Hollows, Ms Gabi",67
99,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. At any time has the minister made or caused to be made on his behalf any approaches to any individual board members of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority offering other government positions or consultancies to them if they agree to resign? To whom, by whom, when, in what form and involving what offers were such approaches made?",68
100,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suspect that the honourable member for Melbourne is referring in that question to the members of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. I spoke with all of the members of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board shortly after we were sworn into office. I spent, in the case of the person to whom I think the honourable member for Melbourne is referring, some two hours one evening in my office discussing with Ms Gabi Hollows her involvement with the Civil a negotiAviation Safety Authority board. I explained to her then the basis of our policy commitment made whilst we were in opposition. It was clearly enunciated in our policy that we wished to have people with aviation experience on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It was quite plain, and she quite freely admits, that she has no aviation experience other than being a passenger on planes on an ad hoc basis-and millions of Australians would qualify on that basis. In the course of our discussions it became obvious that whilst Ms Hollows did not have any aviation expertise' she had a distinct interest and expertise in areas of Aboriginal health. I drew that to the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I do not think anything ever came of it beyond that. Youth Unemployment: Work for the Dole",68
101,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Minister, could you outline to the House any obstacles to the implementation of the government's popularly acclaimed work for the dole scheme that will break the cycle of hopelessness and despair that is Labor's legacy of youth unemployment in the electorate of Page and across Australia?",68
102,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. The government's work for the dole plan will break the cycle of isolation and hopelessness faced by many young Australians who are long-term unemployed as a result of the policies of the previous Labor government. The government's plan has been overwhelmingly welcomed by young Australians and by the community. Nothing illustrates how divorced the Labor Party has become from the grassroots of the community than its resolute opposition to the government's plan. The fact is that they have absolutely no idea how to solve unemployment or to help unemployed people. It is worth remembering that when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment the number of long term unemployed people rose by some 95,000, and the worse level of unemployment since the Great Depression was recorded. Yet yesterday he told the members of this House that the answer was to 'restore what we did' - to restore the failed Working Nation programs with their huge cost to the community. Who was it only several days before on Radio 6PR in Perth who told listeners that the Working Nation programs had failed? One day the Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'Restore what we did. Restore all those failed programs,' but on another day, 'No, those programs didn't work. We admit this.' It is no wonder that the Labor Party is so directionless at the moment and does not have any idea where to tum. He confirms more and more every day just how useless the Labor Party is as a contributor to national policy debate. In the House yesterday-and it is worth noting this because it just shows how divorced of ideas they are-he said: ... we have piloted every conceivable scheme that gives young people an opportunity to contribute to our society and advance their own skills and training--every conceivable scheme! How blind can you be? For 13 years they did nothing to address the literacy and numeracy problems of young people, which are such an obstacle to employment by small business. They did nothing to address the decline of apprenticeship opportunities. They did nothing to address the desperate need for industry recognised training opportunities in schools and did precious little to bring schools and small businesses In the community closer together. The fact is the government is addressing every one of these substantial proposals to help young people back into jobs, to address the fundamental causes of youth unemployment which were never addressed by the Labor Party in power. Yet the Leader of the Opposition thinks they did everything he could think of. They are obviously totally divorced of ideas, totally out of touch with young people in this community. They have nothing. They are opposing a scheme to bring young people out of their isolation and bring them back into touch with their community. They are not listening to young people. They are not listening to the grassroots. They are not listening to the battling families of this country and it is time they got back in touch. Directory Assistance Charges",68
103,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister, the communications minister or any ministerial staff member had discussions with Telstra chief executive, Frank Blount, or other Telstra staff about the introduction of directory assistance charges? If so, when and with whom? Has the Prime Minister forgotten his election promise to keep directory assistance calls free? Has the Prime Minister also forgotten repeating this promise in this chamber on 24 June 1996? If the Prime Minister has not forgotten, has he told Telstra to abandon their plan to introduce charges for directory assistance? Having been reminded of his promises, will the Prime Minister today, now rule out charging for directory assistance?",69
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answers to the several questions asked by the member for Dobell are as follows. I have not had any discussions with Blount to my recollection. I will ask Senator Alston. I have had a number of discussions with Mr Frank Blount, but I do not recall this issue having ever been raised. Mr Lee-The staff?",69
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will ask my staff whether any of them has and I will refer the question to Senator Alston and he can answer for himself and his staff. The answer to the third question is, no, I have not. The answer to the fourth question is, no, I have not either. The answer to the fifth question is, as far as I am concerned, Telstra will not be doing anything in this area that is contrary to pre-election commitments. Member for Fremantle: Legal Costs",69
106,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General.

109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question thus far does not canvass the intention to debate the issue. I am listening very carefully. Mr MCClelland- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question is also contrary to the sub judice rule and should be ruled out of order. It is in contemplation of litigation.",70

112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is your point of order? Mr Crean-I draw your attention to the precise words of the notice of motion. It asks for the same thing. It is a question on notice. Therefore, it is out of order. I would ask you to uphold what has been upheld in this place before on this very point.",70
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hotham. At this juncture, I am not convinced of the nature of your argument. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on that point of order: it is clearly a different question. Question No. 1288 on the Notice Paper relates to commitments of the previous government; it does not relate to the claims now being made.",70
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice.,70
115,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cowan for his question. The legal costs of the member for Fremantle fall into three categories: the costs of her representation before the Marks royal commission, the costs of her court challenges to the appointment of the royal commission, and the costs of the Western Australian government which courts ordered she pay in respect of failed challenges. As I stated in this House on 19 November last year, the government intends to comply with the parliament's previous explicit decision to approve payment of only so much of the member for Fremantle's legal costs as were reasonably incurred in appearing before the Marks royal commission, less such costs as are payable by the state government of Western Australia. Under the appropriation approved by parliament for the 1995-96 financial year, $319,927 has already been paid by the Commonwealth in respect of these costs. This appropriation lapsed on 30 June 1996. I said on 19 November that the government intended to seek parliament's approval of a further appropriation of approximately $50,000. That remains the government's position. That amount represents the balance of the royal commission costs, after making allowance for the amount of the royal commission costs which we understand are payable by the state government. The government intends not to pay any of the court costs, in accordance with the parliament's previous explicit decisions. In other words, the foreshadowed litigation has not affected the government's intentions. When the proposed payment of Dr Lawrence's legal costs was put before this House in 1995, the then government agreed, in this House, to a coalition amendment reducing the amount of money appropriated by parliament to pay for Dr Lawrence's legal costs by the amount of the court costs. In the Senate, the wording of the appropriation amended explicitly to exclude the payment the Commonwealth of any costs other than the royal commission costs. We understand that these costs other than the royal commismanagement sion costs were to have been paid by the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, which was effect set up specificalIy to pay those costs that parliament had refused to authorise the government to pay. The Australian public and the donors to that fund are entitled to ask why the fund has not been applied in payment of those costs, as this was the stated reason the fund being set up. It might also be asked whether any interest has accrued on the funds, or whether administration fees have been Commonwealth. charged. The fund was set up to pay those costs and should be applied accordingly. Ministerial Code of Conduct",70
116,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday, Prime set Minister, I asked you about another breach your code of conduct through Dr Kemp's misleading of the public on the work for the dole fiasco. You undertook to check the cant transcripts and advise the House.

118,Mr SOML YAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Defence able to inform the House of developments in relation to the management arrangements of the lindalee over-the-horizon radar project?,71
119,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am able to tell the House that a heads of agreement was signed this morning giving Commonwealth approval for new arrangements for the management of the lindaIee over-the-horizon radar was project, known as lORN. These new arrangeby ments established a joint venture between Lockheed-Martin Corporation and Transfield Defence Systems which will take over the of the project from Telstra. As part of the transaction, which will come into on 17 February, Telstra wilI selI its 60 the per cent stake in Telstar Systems to Lockheed and Transfield, and on a redistribution of equity this wilI give Lockheed and Transfield a 50 per cent share each in Telstar. It is the intention of all the parties that the contract be for novated to Telstar, prObably in the first quarter of next year. That will place Telstar in a direct and exclusive relationship with the Also, as part of those new arrangements, the progress payments mechanism will be changed from the present milestone system to one which is predominantly based on earned value. In addition, the new arrangements will in place incentive and disincentive arof rangements which will encourage early delivery. The revised payment and incentive contractual arrangements will deliver signifibenefits without any overalI cost in real terms. This is a very important capability for the Australia's defence and we welcome very a much the involvement of these two leading defence contractors. As everybody knows, Lockheed has had extensive experience in over-the-horizon radar and will be immediatehad ly assigning some of those people to the I would like to say that the fact remains, however, that we have been left with a legacy of at least three years delay in a very expensive project-three years, that is, beyond the 1997 date-and it is a masterly understatement to say that we have been less than happy with the arrangements that were set in place by the previous government; with the way in which the project has faltered; the way in which the project has been managed",71
120,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How would you have managed it?,72
121,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We fixed it. We were less than happy particularly with the inability of the original contractor-let me repeat, with the inability of the original contractor-to deliver anywhere near the completion date. As I have observed before in this place, this project is simply one of a number which the previous government left in a shambles and could not properly deliver. Hollows, Ms Gabi",72
122,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of a letter sent by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to a member of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board, Ms Gabi Hollows, on 6 May 1996, offering her alternative positions in the Aboriginal affairs area if she agreed to resign from the CASA board? Will the Prime Minister initiate an investigation into this apparent attempt to induce a Commonwealth office holder to resign from her position, by offering her other benefits, in order to determine whether any of his ministers have breached his ministerial guidelines, or any act of parliament? Will he instruct Senator Herron to table this letter, given that Senator Herron today has refused to table the letter in the Senate?",72
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It happens that there was some reference yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the Deputy President of the Senate that it passed belief that certain thingsÂ· were coincidence. Perhaps I could borrow the Leader of the Opposition's words and say that it passes belief that, after the member for Melbourne had completed his first question to the minister for transport, I was in fact handed by my staff a fax from Ms Hollows attaching a letter from Senator Herron addressed to her. I was handed it immediately after the member for Melbourne had sat down. I will talk to the minister for Aboriginal affairs and to the minister for transport.",72
124,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Just table it! Table the letter.,72
125,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will talk to both of them. I will then take whatever action is appropriate. British Pensions,72
126,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the minister's recent discussions with the British government regarding the issue of the indexation of British pensions for British citizens now living in Australia. What progress has been made on this matter for the 190,000 British citizens resident in Australia to whom it is of great and immediate importance?",72
127,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, may I say that I know that the member for Kingston has a very great interest in this issue and has campaigned very hard on behalf of Britons who have migrated to Australia and who are still in receipt of British pensions, because those people do not have their pensions indexed. The member for Kingston has many such people in her electorate and works very hard on their behalf. This is a long standing issue and, despite the very great strength of the relationship between Australia and Britain, which was brought home only very recently with the respective launches in Britain and Australia of the new images program, the issue still remains an outstanding one and one that we are trying to resolve. While I was in Britain I spoke with both the Prime Minister, Mr Major, and also the Foreign Secretary, Mr Rifkind, about Australia's concerns and our desire to see this issue resolved. In both cases I made the point that Senator Newman had put forward an interim solution to this problem which would cause very little expense to the British government and that it would be important that Britain at least consider that interim solution. There is no doubt that the British government listened and showed an understanding of our case, in particular the moral strength of our case. We look forward, through further representations, ultimately to resolving this issue. While I was in Britain I also took the opportunity of raising the issue with the Leader of the Opposition in Britain, Mr Blair, and also with the shadow foreign secretary, Mr Cook, because, with an election coming up in Britain fairly soon",72
128,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You expected them to win.,73

131,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hope you are not taking sides. You would not be so indiscreet, would you? I thought it was important that the opposition in Britain, with an election coming up",73
132,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,73
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my left!,73
134,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite are conwell stantly interjecting about the British election. You should worry about trying to get back into power in Australia, not worry about your mate Tony Blair in Britain. I tell you what: matters. having sat in the House of Commons to hear parliamentary question time, I was impressed with the behaviour of Mr Blair as the Leader of the Opposition. Since he is a friend of yours, you might like to get some advice on how not to constantly interject. The opposition in Britain were also interesttise ed in our case and showed a great deal of understanding. But let me say in conclusion that, in the course of last year, the House Commons established a select committee on this issue. The Australian government made a very important submission committee, along with the Canadians and, I think, the South Africans, but certainly the Canadians. By coincidence, that select committee reported during the time that I was Britain. It recommended that there be a free vote of the House of Commons on the issue of the indexation of pensions for people eligible for British pensions overseas. The Australian government would urge both major political parties in Britain to adopt that committee's recommendation to put this matter to a free vote, because I believe that in a free vote the just case of the Australian government, and indeed those in Australia who are in receipt of British pensions, would be accepted and supported by the vast majority of members of the House of Commons. Hollows, Ms Gabi",73
135,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the minister for transport. At any time has the minister made, or caused to be made on his behalf, any approaches to any individual CASA board members, other than Ms Gabi Hollows, offering any government positions or consultancies to them if they agree to resign? To whom were any such approaches made, by whom, when, in what form and involving what offers?",73
136,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Apart from the answer that I gave earlier today in the House in regard to Ms Hollows, I am not aware of any other situation where I may have referred a person who may have some expertise that could be used by government. I do not think there is anything wrong in my recommending, in this case, Ms Hollows, who has an obvious expertise and interest in Aboriginal health You might think it is inappropriate to do that. You might think it is very inappropriate to appoint somebody of expertise to a particular area. I think, and I think members of the government would agree, that it is inappropriate to appoint people who do not have experin the area that they are appointed to. After my discussion with Ms Hollows, it was quite obvious to me that she was very interof ested in the Aboriginal health issues, she was very interested in providing service to government and that she was quite expert in her to that select particular field. Medicare: Bulk-billing",73
137,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed into the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister advise what is actually happening with the proportion of services being bulk-billed on Medicare? In particular, could he advise whether the national bulkbilling rate for the 1996 December quarter has either risen or fallen? Opposition members-Yap, yap!",73
138,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At least the Leader of the Opposition is not talking to himself, Mr Speaker. I did see a very interesting press release yesterday from the shadow minister for health claiming 'Bulk-billing decline highlights the real agenda'. I have to say that the shadow minister for health is welcome to have a flight of fancy, but he should not expect people to take him too seriously if he continues to do it. And, if he is going to quote figures, I suggest that he not be selective but honest. The facts with bulk-billing are these. When we came to power in March 1996 the bulkbilling rate for general practitioners was 80.3 per cent. As of December 1996 the rate was 80.5 per cent. The rate had in fact gone up. Mr Lee-What about September?",74
139,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Across all Medicare servicesMr Lee-How about since the budget?,74
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Dobell!,74
141,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For all Medicare services the rate was 71.1 per cent. Across all Medicare services in the December quarter the rate was 71.7 per cent. So in the whole range of Medicare services the rate of bulk-billing has gone up more than for general practitioner services. The shadow minister seems to have some problems with mathematics, so I will tell him one very simple point. The rate of bulk-billing services is already very high and, as the maximum conceivable rate is 100 per cent, it is inevitable that at some point the rates will start to plateau. In fact, that plateau has evident since two financial years ago in general practitioner services as the rate of increase in bulk-billing services started to decline two years ago. To check the veracitv of the shadow minister's claim, overnight I got the department to take out the bulk-billing figures for January. In fact the rate of bulk-billing for January was 81.0 per cent, an all-time high. It shows that the claim he is making is absolutely without substance. The other point that I should make is that any changes in the budget did not actually come into place until November last year. So any talk about the last two quarters of the calendar year in fact relates to what you did in the 1995 budget. If anything happened in those two quarters it is as a result of the decisions of the Labor Party, not the decisions of this government. Further, if you look across all bulk-billing figures, you have to see the great hypocrisy of what is going on. The Labor Party froze rebates for non-vocationally registered GPs in November 1991. There has been no increase for over five years under the decision of the previous government. Bulk-billing increased from 72.7 per cent in December 1991 to 86.6 per cent in December 1996. So if there is a slowdown in the rate of increase it is inevitably because you held the rebates at their level for over five years-and, for good measure, you took them out of the forward estimates in the budget without telling anybody, so there is nothing for them in the forward estimates for the next four years either. With services for vocationally registered GPs, you made the decision to have the rate of increase from November 1994, so it is not surprising that GP rebates-bulk-billingshould slow down-totally as a consequence of decisions made over six consecutive years by the Labor Party. I will make this final point. The shadow minister says in his press release 'This disturbing evidence in the fall of bulk-billing rates'-which is, of course, complete humbug-'is the first indication of the coalition's attempt to undermine Medicare by stealth.' been There is only one thing that would undermine Medicare, and that is an annual rate of growth of 6.6 per cent, which is what you left us. On a budget bigger than the budget of the state of Western Australia you left us with an uncontrollable increase in the rate of growth. We have brought that back to controllable levels. We have done, on doctor numbers, what Graham Richardson and Brian Howe said needed to be done-but you never had the guts to do it, or to support us. We have managed to get a cap on pathology fee rebates over the forward estimates. We have reduced total Medicare rebates by one per cent, just by the changes we have made to radiology alone. So all those things actually mean that Medicare is sustainable-which you never had the capacity to do in 13 years in government. Hollows, Ms Gabi",74
142,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and again follows the previous question. Minister, did you make any offers of positions or consultancies to any other person than Gabi Hollows should they agree to resign from the CASA board?",75
143,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question from the Leader of the Opposition leaves me with an answer that I can only recall discussing any other work that may be available with Ms Gabi Hollows.

145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. Children's Cots,75
146,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Is the minister aware of recent reports raising doubts about the safety of children's cots? I understand that last year the minister ordered an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs into the current arrangements governing the safety and design of children's cots. Is the minister able to advise the House of the outcomes of this investigation? What action is the minister proposing to take in this important matter?  her question. I am very concerned by evidence that some cots in use in Australia, especially old and homemade cots, may present significant safety risks to children. October last year I directed the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs as a matter of urgency to investigate the safety of cots. I also acted to have work on an improved Australian standard for portable cots fasttracked. As part of the bureau's investigation, surveys were conducted to identify potentially dangerous cots. Comments from the public, manufacturers and consumer groups were also sought. I have now received the bureau's report, which has identified some significant safety risks. There is evidence that children have died or have been seriously injured as a result of hazards associated with entrapment, snagging of clothing and falls. This is simply unacceptable. The community expects, quite rightly, high safety and design standards for nursery furniture. To address these problems, I propose to introduce a mandatory standard for the safe design of children's cots. The standard will cover the major safety hazards. I have been pleased by the very responsible reaction of Australian manufacturers on this issue. The support of the states and territories will be essential to ensure effective enforcement, especially over the sale of older and second hand cots. Mr Crean-What page are you on there, Geoff?  issue. In the whole time you were in government, you did not act on the deaths of children due to inappropriate standards. This government is concerned about child safety and we are taking action to address this matter, where you failed to act. You can laugh about the matter of child safety; this government is going to do something about it. We intend to act to improve the quality of cots as one part of the solution. It is also essential that parents are aware of the potential risks to their children, so I am proposing a consumer awareness campaign which helps parents to identify safe cots, to know how to maintain cots and to select appropriate bedding and software. The investigation into cot safety has highIn lighted the need for a wider and more systematic investigation into the safety of nursery furniture. I believe that Australians deserve better than the ad hoc approach of the previous government and we intend to take the matter of product safety seriously. I am proposing a Commonwealth-state program to examine the safety of all types of nursery products over the next 18 months or so. With such a program in place, the risk to children from these products will be significantly reduced.",75
147,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister been made aware of the latest DEETY A leading indicator of employment released today, which fell for the eighth consecutive month in December? Is he also aware of the latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment also released today, showing that consumer confidence has just fallen by a huge 7.9 per cent in the last month and is now some nine per cent lower than it was when you came into office? Prime Minister, will these figures stimulate you to fundamentally rethink your economic strategy and give some priority at last to growth and jobs?",76
148,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen the detail of either of those, but can I take the opportunity given to me so generously by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to remind him and the House of the positive features of the Australian economic scene-features, of course, you are so desperately anxious not to see. If there is one thing that distinguishes those who sit on the front bench of the Labor Party, it is their absolute preoccupation with negative talk about the future of the Australian economy. The Treasurer has just told you that Commonwealth Bank housing interest rates are down to their lowest levels since 1969. We have just had a mid-year budget review that confirms that projections for economic growth are on track in accordance with the budget time forecasts. We have the lowest level of inflation since the early 1970s. We have quite literally a surge in business investment. We have many indications that the housing industry, after the slump that your policies drove it into, is now emerging from that slump. I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to stop talking down the Australian economy and to recognise many of the positive features of our current circumstances and what they portend for the future. Staff Allocations for Senators  Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen reports of remarks by Senator Kernot on staff Economy allocations for senators? Has the government treated senators fairly on this issue?",76
149,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was rather surprised to see some remarks by the Leader of the Australian Democrats this morning obviously related to Senator Colston. She spoke rather disparagingly about 'What price the next vote? I just don't believe that what the Independents are doing is coincidental'. That was obviously a reference to the remarks made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday. In the light of those remarks by Senator Kernot, I think I should inform the House that when the government was elected in March of last year I implemented a reduction in the government's staffing establishment and I applied the same percentage reduction to both the opposition and to the Australian Democrats. But as a result of representations that were put to me by Senator Kernot later in the year-and she was supported in those representations, I think, by other members of her party-I in fact restored the Democrats' staff to the level that had obtained. So if we are to follow the logic of what Senator Kernot has said, Senator Kernot herself was presumably bribed by that action. If Senator Kernot thinks that by restoring her staff establishment we are in some way behaving in a corrupt fashion then she is certainly indicting herself.",76
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. SPEAKER'S CHAIR",76
151,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I refer to the question of the Speaker's chair, which was the subject of a statement. I mean the physical form of the piece of furniture in which the Speaker sits. The matter was raised by you yesterday. For the benefit of the House, I will make a couple of observations. It is the case that when the decision was taken by the former government not to bring the old chair down here, as then Leader of the Opposition, I was critical of that decision. It still remains my personal view that there is an argument, in the interests of historical continuity, for that chair to be here. Many members of this House do not agree with that, but there are a lot who do. I respect the differences of opinion that exist. I want to make it very clear that, whatever views may be held by you or by any member of the parliament, in current budget circumstances and for the foreseeable future, my government will not be making any money available to move the chair.",76
152,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On indulgence: I wish that we could get as rapid a retreat on what the government are intending to do about nursing homes. I wish that we could get as rapid a retreat on what they have done to labour market programs.,77
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your indulgence?,77
154,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am exercising the same indulgence you gave to the Prime Minister and which you have given to me.,77
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, but I thought it was relevant to the chair.",77
156,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It certainly is. I wish we could get the same retreat in what they have done to battling students. I wish that we could rapidly get some answers to other questions. But it is relevant to this matter to point out what was said by the Prime Minister at the time. The Prime Minister said then to Speaker Child: . . . neither you, nor anybody on the other side of the House, should start advancing expense as one of the reasons why you have taken this decision. That was the decision not to put the Gothic chair here in this chamber. So I am glad that the Prime Minister has eaten humble pie on that one as well. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Staff: Senator Colston",77
157,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I was asked a question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about Senator Colston. I have been supplied with this information by staff in my department. I have been informed that my chief of staff did not have any contact with Senator Colston prior to the matter being raised by Senator Reid. The figure of $20,000 was provided in a letter to me of 15 November from the President of the Senate as her estimate of the additional expenditure that the upgrade would have involved. My department's advice to me of 28 November was that the President of the Senate supported Senator Colston's views in principle. NA Speaker's Chair Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Speaker, in view of the remarks just made by the Prime Minister, will you now undertake to the House to cease this ridiculous project to move the old Speaker's chair up to this House? Further, since there will be no money provided by the government for this costly exercise, will you cease any further consultants reports, which are costing the parliament money and will obviously not provide a position whereby this stupid proposal can be put into effect?",77
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Watson for his question. The investigations that were proceeding which I alluded to yesterday were in two parts: a preliminary report and a final report. In light of the advice I have received this afternoon from the Prime Minister, the investigation will cease forthwith. The costs that I alluded to in the same discussion yesterday will be considerably reduced on those that I advanced yesterday . Old Parliament House Mr SINCLAffi-While I have views about the transfer of the chair, I think there are other aspects involved, such as the bar table, reducing the distance between the sides and making this, as a debating forum, far more pertinent. Mr Speaker, I want to ask you a question about not the interior but the exterior of Old Parliament House. The Speaker will be aware that in front of the original Parliament House there are two temporary constructions which seem to be gathering rather considerselectively able permanence. One is purported to be an Aboriginal embassy. The other, I gather, is purported to be a basis for demonstration against the Indonesian presence in East Timor. Whatever the cause, and without prejudice to Australians' legitimate capacity to protest either individually or collectively, will the Speaker, in conjunction with the any Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, negotiate with the government of the Australian Capital Territory that there is some time limit on the duration of such constructions, perhaps identifying an area where legitimate protests can be maintained and certainly ensuring that, after this time, two buildings which really do enhance the exterior of that building are removed so that it looks as it originally and Old Parliament House can be seen in all its glory?",77
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the right honourable member for New England. I will take the points raised with the appropriate minister. You mentioned the exterior.

I refer the House to Australian Doctor of 31 January with the headline 'Bulkbilling Falling for the First Time in Five Years'.

166,Mr SPEAKER,PAPERS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), proposing that a definite matter of importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The consequences for older Australians living alone of the failure to exempt their homes from the assets test when seeking access to nursing home been I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",78
167,Ms MACKLIN,PAPERS,"Jagajaga) (3.08 p.m.)Frail and sick older Australians in need of nursing home care are going to need to sell their homes to get that care. This will lead to a system of nursing home care never seen in this country before. If you have a large amount of assets to sell and then, after selling them, pay the proceeds over as an up-front fee, you will be able to get into a nursing home and get decent care. Those who have little to contribute either will not get in or, if they do, will receive a much poorer level of care. The principle of equal access for all Australians to quality care will be lost. This is a piece of legislation which truly reveals the humbug in the assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that 'one group of the community that is not going to be hurt are the most vulnerable'. He went on to say 'We will protect the vulnerable and thneedy.' They certainly are not protected by - his legis-ation, which will see people going mto nursmg homes only if they are able to sell their homes. In stark contrast to the sentiment of these statements by the Prime Minister, this government with this legislation-which forces people to sell their homes to gain nursing home care-will cause, as it has already started to cause, widespread uncertainty and apprehension amongst older Australians. This legislation will not only directly and adversely affect the lives of those needing nursing home care but also affect the lives of their immediate families. The atmosphere of apprehension and uncertainty is only worsened by the refusal of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to come clean on this point. She will not admit that the assets test to determine whether or not a person must pay an entry fee for nursing home care will necessitate most people having to sell their houses. Selling a home is always a dramatic and often traumatic time in anybody's life. Being forced to sell it when one is so seriously and physically incapacitated that nursing home admission has been recommended is far worse. The minister has squirmed and prevaricated on this point. Despite a growing grounds well of opinion to the contrary, she has stubbornly stuck to her guns. But the mounting tide of evidence is irresistible. People will have to sell their homes. That is very clear when we have a look at the draft legislation. It provides exe-ptions in the assets test for spouses, relatives or a carer living in the house. This clause is very clear in the draft legislation. But there is no exemption from the assets test for a single person. Yet we know from the statistics that around 90 per cent of nursing home entrants have been living alone. We also know from the data supplied by aged care assessment teams that around 70 per cent of people recommended for nursing home care are home owners at the time of assessment, so they have an asset to sell. Of these, about 10 per cent have a spouse who would remain in the home. Therefore, 63 per cent of residents have a sellable home. The critical point is that all the department's estimates about how much nursing homes can exp-t fro- entry fees are based on people selhng theu homes. Otherwise, there will be no money for the upgrade of nursing homes. The most damning evidence is now coming from the nursing home proprietors themselves. Today in the Courier-Mail we read about a Gold Coast aged care facility operator confirming that proposed new federal rules mean that some people will have to sell their homes if they want nursing home care. It says that the new laws finalised this week would mean single pensioners with no assets except their homes might have to sell their property if they need nursing home care. A more detailed assessment in the Sydney Morning Herald today says: The cost of nursing home beds could reach an average of more than $80,000, with a top rate of $2-,000, shutting ou- the poor and forcing many patients to sell their homes, despite Federal Government assurances to the contrary, nursing home operators admitted yesterday. The Uniting Church, which runs 33 nursing homes in NSW and is the single biggest operator in the State, rejected the Government's estimate that the average entry fee, or accommodation bond, would be about $26,000 . . . Mr Lee-Is there no cap?",79
168,Ms MACKLIN,PAPERS,"There is no cap. It continued: And the industry's main body, the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, said there would be ""access problems"" for people trying to move from one home to another. The general secretary of the Uniting Church's NSW Board for Social Responsibility, the Rev Harry Herbert, said that . . . . he also rejected statements by the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan, that no patients would be forced to sell their homes to get access to a nursing home ... This is the critical reason. Of course the market does not work in the nursing home sector. He said: ""Supply is out of whack with the demand for nursing home beds, so the proprietors are going to be in a strong bargaining position ... Most elderly people don't have a lot of cash reserves, and their main asset is their home."" The association's chief executive, Mr Warren Bennett, admitted that some single patients who did not fit into the exemption categoriesin the draft legislationwould have to sell their homes to pay for nursing home beds. So we have everybody except the minister coming out and saying that people will have to sell their homes to get a bed. In the same article we also have a rejection of the notion being peddled by the minister that somehow nursing home patients could pay by instalments. The executive director of the New South Wales Council on the Ageing rejected the argument that people could pay by instalment. He said: Nursing home operators would prefer to takeso they will be deciding on who they takenew patients who could pay in a lump sum, because they would need the money to repay the estate of the deceased patients. A clear assessment of the situation is provided by a spokeswoman from the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation in an article in the Australian tod""y. The spokeswoman, Edith Morgan, says: ... single pensioners would either be forced to sell the home, or have the outstanding debt deducted from their estates in the form of a death tax. Edith Morgan also makes the crucial point-a point that is obviously not understood by this government-that a bond develops between older people and their homes. The security of their own home is vitally linked to their health and well-being. She also makes this point: ... the knowledge that the family home awaits their return can be a final hope for continued life. This hope for a continued life in your own home is of course lost as a result of this legislation. Edith Morgan is also worried that concern within a family over the potential loss of the family asset, the family home, if it is to be sold to secure entry to a nursing home, is the spectre of a trend all too prevalent in the United States, where privatised health care and user pays hold sway. This is the spectre of elder abuse and, in the most extreme manifestation, as Edith Morgan has brought to attention of the Australian people, granny dumping. The treasurer of the same organisation, Norah MCGuire, also rejects the minister's assurance that the elderly would not have to sell their homes, describing the minister's assurances as 'balderdash'. In the Sydney Morning Herald she said: There are 'very few' nursing home proprietors who would not demand a bond from vulnerable patients and the government would be unable to stop patients being pressured into selling. There is nothing in the draft legislation that would stop them. Maybe we are going to see, from a comment on the Terry Laidler program yesterday, the minister finally stop stonewalling on this point. The interviewer asked: But if they are single pensioners living in a home that they own, that home will be taken into account in assessing the assets they might have to admit themselves to nursing homes? The minister said: 'That may well be.' Minister, maybe we are finally getting there; maybe you will admit that people's homes will be taken into account when they need to go into a nursing home. Perhaps the minister needs to consider some of the other implications of this failure to exempt the family home from the assets test. The Pensioners and Superannuants Federation also raised the point that including the family home in the assets test is likely to see a dramatic escalation in the size of the entry for nursing homes. In fact, Minister, because your legislation fails to place any cap on the amount of entry fee-so there is no cap on the amount of entry fee that can be chargedare it is likely that the entry fee will become total of a person's assets. In most cases, will be the total value of the family home $22,500. Let us look at the situation in Victoria. The average price of a home in Victoria, accordbe ing to the Real Estate Institute, is $155,400. The entry contribution then could be about $132,900. Is that the level of entry contribuuser tion that people will be expected to make? The Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation are very concerned that this will so. Their media release from earlier this states: Pensioners will be devastated when they find are expected to hand over all but $22 000 simply in order to get the care they need in a nursing home. Most will be extremely reluctant to movethis is the critical pointif it means selling their home. Usually, it is only asset. What this will inevitably lead to is two tiers of care. Nursing homes will of course be attractive to those who can pay the most entry fees. They will get in first. Those can pay only a small fee will be passed over, let alone those who have no money to pay any fee. The minister is setting up a system whereby she will be gutting the assets of average Australians as they struggle to ensure themthis selves a reasonable standard minister is trying to hoodwink the Australian people by representing the need to go into nursing home as merely a change in accomminister modation. She has persistently refused acknowledge the point that nursing homes are for people who can no longer look after themselves. They are designed to care for people. They are not an accommodation option. I draw the minister's attention to the crowning irony in the draft bill which she released for 10 days public comment. Mr Lee-How long?",80
169,Ms MACKLIN,PAPERS,"Ten days. In the objects of the act, there is not one word about accomfee modation. Each of the objects of the act go to the quality of care, the type or level of care, access to care, recipients of care and providers of care. It is about care. That is why we so concerned about the changes that are the involved in this legislation. We do not agree this that people should be held to ransom when less they need to get access to essential nursing home care. It is also the case that the House is going to expected to debate this legislation without critical information. We have no information classification principles, nothing about rights principles, no information about how many places will be set aside for those who are financially disadvantaged, no inforbe mation on the level of subsidy for financially week disadvantaged people and no information on the quality assurance processes, yet we are they supposed to come into this place and debate a piece of legislation when the critical pieces of information are not available to us. There are only two things that are clear from this draft legislation. One is that people their will have to sell their homes to gain nursing home care, particularly the 90 per cent who are single when they go in. As a result of this user-pays approach we will have access and in decent care for those who can pay and much who poorer care for those who cannot payor have only a small amount to pay. Aged care, like health care, requires long-term, carefully thought through policies. These are areas that affect the lives of all Australians. They cannot and must not be exposed to market forces as government so cruelly proposes in this of care. The draft legislation.",81
170,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,"The shadow for family services, the member for to Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), just has not got a clue. Here she is, the architect of the former government's policy in this area and she has not got a clue. This shadow minister is so confused about her own policy that she is constantly destroying her own credibility and has her party's credibility with hypocritical assertions, because that is what they arehypocritical in the extreme. It is hypocrisy that is breathtaking in its scope. I greatly welcome this opportunity to address the House today on this matter and to highlight this government's aged care initiatives and again correct the inaccuracies, mischief, pain and heartache that this shadow minister causes out there in the community by not coming clean. We need to assess Labor's record in government with respect to aged care. Where was their record? I brought into this House before their policy when they went to the last election. There were eight solitary paragraphs. That was the sum total of that party's aged care policy as we went to the last election. Eight paragraphs is the best they could offer as their solution to a system that is breaking down, that is in disrepair in the nursing home sector where people are crowded into rooms of four beds or more and where the facilities in some cases are fire traps hazards. This is the system that that party presided over for over a decade when they were in government. Labor accuses us of a two-tiered system but they presided over a two-tiered system of aged care where residents in hostels were asked to make a significant contribution. Mr Bevis-Are they the same?",81
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,The member for Brisbane! You are not participating in this debate.,82
172,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,"It was introduced by you in this parliament in 1988 by way of an instrument in this House-and I have all the background on its introduction. It was supported by us because it was sound, sensible policy to address an improvement in accommodation for the frail in our community. Those who presided over this two-tiered system allowed that to continue. People in hostels were asked to make a significant contribution towards the cost of their accommodation while those in nursing homes who were not had to suffer the consequences. Those opposite also presided over a system where if you went into a hostel you were also subject to a variable fee charging practice by the provider. That was totally uncapped. You could earn any amount of money over the free area and the provider had the licence, under that regime, to take dollar for dollar outside the free area without any restriction or caps. That was the two-tiered system that these people presided over. Nursing home residents did not have to pay any such fee so if you were sent to one facility you paid it and in another facility you did not. We all know that the profile in those facilities has changed dramatically so that the edges are now blurred. In addition, in terms of the condition of the accommodation facilities, these two facilities also differed in that if you were lucky enough to be assessed to go into a hostel you often went into one that was modem, that would provide the dignity, comfort and security of your own room with an en-suite bathroom, but if you went into one of these run-down, dilapidated old nursing homes, you were and probably going to be thrust into a ward of four or more people, with no private bathroom facilities, no dignity and no privacy. The system that those opposite presided over was a disgrace but what was more disgraceful was the fact that they sat on their hands, they procrastinated, they knew that there was pressure building in the community, that we were not meeting the needs of the community and that there was no flexibility in the system as it stands today-and they did nothing about it. Not only did they put in place no plans to address the pressures in the system today, they did not plan for the future. We have an ageing population. That is a fact and these pressures will continue. As a government we have a duty and a responsibility to care for those in the community who are frail and vulnerable. These people had no concern. They professed to have a concern but they had no concern, otherwise they would not allow people to be sitting and lying in fire traps, and in disgraceful conditions that we see in some nursing homes in this country today. You are a disgrace. Again, there was the hypocrisy about the assets testing. Let me make just one point: guess who presided over and applied the assets test when they were in government? Do we know who applied it? We know who applied the assets test. Ms Macklin-To the family home?",82
173,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,"Yes, to the family home. Let me read from an article that was written by my colleague Chris Gallus in the Australian Financial Review on 4 September last year. Mrs Crosio-Because she wrote it, it is fact? You have got to be joking.",83
174,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,"You check with the Department of Social Security. If you knew your own policy you would not ask such dumb questions. I will quote from the article that was written and if you want to check the veracity of it you may do so. Mrs Gallus says: And nowhere is anyone mentioning that under the arrangements set in place by the Labor government pensioners and those on low incomes moving into nursing homes have been selling their homes to comply with the Department of Social Security rules. In assessing income for the purpose of the pension, the Department of Social Security considers the family home to be an asset after a person has been a nursing home for two years. That is absolutely right. You are sitting there saying it is not. Do you know what the policy is? Mrs Crosio interjecting",83
175,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,You do not know what the policy is.,83
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,Mr Nehl)Order! The minister will direct her remarks through the chair and the member for Prospect will not direct any remarks.,83
177,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The result of this is that the majority of pensioners sell their homes to obtain sufficient money to offset the drop in pension and pay their nursing home fees. That is the kind of cant and hypocrisy that these people go on with all the time in relation to this matter. It is no wonder that the people out there-the public and the elderly in our community-are frightened because when that kind of misinformation goes out it would frighten anyone. Mrs Draper-You are shameful.",83
178,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,"You are shameful. The shadow minister quotes from only one person who has been featured prominently in the media. For some reason some of the media do not want to relate any of the positive comments about the measures we are taking and about our commitment to improving this system. I would like to make some quotes of my own in this particular respect. Dr Keith Suter from the Wesley. Mission told listeners on Sydney radio yesterday that this government has to be congratulated for trying to do something. He was well aware that these people who sat in the chair presiding in government for over a decade did absolutely nothing. He went on to say that Professor Gregory estimated that it would cost half a billion dollars to bring aged care facilities in Australia up to scratch. Dr Suter went on further to say that the Labor government thought it was too horrific to contemplate. They did not have the gumption to address such a serious and important measure in this community. He went on to say that, because it was too horrific for the Labor government to tackle, very little was done in terms of funding: what was required to redevelop these buildings and bring them up to proper standards. I quote also from comments made by my colleague Senator Woodley yesterday on SAN news. Senator Woodley said: Some people should consider whether it is better to pay for a higher standard of nursing home care than continue to own an empty house. He went on: I think what they've got to consider is whether or not they are prepared to allow decaying nursing homes to continue; unsafe often with improper fire services to those homes to continue or whether they are prepared to make a contribution themselves to the accommodation that they would want to be of a much higher standard than what we have got now. Ms Macklin-But you took $500 million out.",83
179,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,"That had nothing to do with it. They presided over this system for 13 years and made no provision apart from in their last budget: $12.9 million. That was it. And there was no plan, no blueprint, no vision for the future of aged care or for those in our community who are frail. So they stand condemned not by their policies but by the lack of them. There were eight paragraphs in their last policy document as we went to the last election. It is very easy for these people to sit on the other side and constantly carp and criticise about the policy that we have put in place. Perhaps I am being too judgmental of the member for Jagajaga. Perhaps she simply does not understand the aged care issues. This point was reinforced in the subject of today's MPI. Mrs Crosio interjecting Ms Ellis interjecting",83
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,The honourable ladies on my left should settle down. Ms Macklin-They are honourable members.,84
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,I will discuss that with you in a moment.,84
182,Mrs MOYLAN,PAPERS,"We are being condemned by the member for Jagajaga for failing to exempt homes of single, older Australians from the assets test. This government has not introduced the assets test, as I said. I think most important thing that has happened since we took government just over 11 months ago is that we have consulted with this sector. That consultation process has gone on since I became the minister. When we laid out our blueprint and our vision for the future of aged care I set up four working groups which comprised people from the leading consumer groups, including the superannuants and pensioners association that the shadow minister has been frequently quoting from. They had a representative on the working groups; they had an opportunity to have their input and they did. They received consideration and they were given concessions. We had a very good and constructive consultative process in laying down the implementation details for this particular bill. We have been criticised today for not having some of those details, but the fact is that the people on the other side, when they were in government, did not bother to bring out a draft exposure bill. They just brought the bill into the House and said to people: 'That is what you are going to get.' They did not consult. I am told on good authority that very little consulting was done with the industry in any shape or form. It is not unusual to bring a bill to the House that sets down the main principles of policy and then to fill in some of the details, as appropriate, with subordinate legislation that will come behind it. That will also be available and will be laid on the table. We have listened and we have consulted. In my deliberation of and response to the working group's first paper to me I have tried to balance the interests of both the consumers and the providers in our community: the consumers because, clearly, the whole policy should be developed on the basis that they should be our first concern-and they areand the providers because, in order for the providers to give the care that is so vital in these nursing homes and hostels, they also need to be able to run viable facilities. I have been disappointed to hear the criticisms being levelled at those in the facility who are the care givers because these are a group of highly professional, dedicated people in our community-both the trained nurses the and those who are the care givers are a very special group. As I have moved around this country visiting the many facilities, I have been touched and deeply moved by that dedication to the job, sometimes under the most difficult of circumstances. These are the people who are expected to give the same level of care and do give the same level of care because of their professional dedication to all members of the public who enter nursing home and hostel facilities. All residents get the same dedicated care because the carers are professionals. This government's total commitment is to continue to support the nursing staff and the care giving staff in these facilities to care for people based on their need to be cared for, not on whether or not they have the means to pay for it. What we are doing is responsible. We are saying to the Australian public that we are dealing with a difficult situation in terms of the financial provision for the future. We are asking the Australian public to contribute a very small portion of their income to being able to support their entry into a nursing home. (Time expired)",84
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the next speaker in this discussion for the benefit of the honourable lady sitti-g at the table on my left, I might just that the terms 'honourable gentleman' and 'honourable lady' are common and wellaccepted terms of address in the parliamentary atmosphere.",85
184,Mrs CROSIO,PAPERS,"I rise with great delight as the second speaker on this particular matter of public importance as placed before the House today. I notice the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is running for cover-she does not want to hear her own debate. We have seen the Minister for Family Services come into this chamber during question time and not once tell the truth when queried about her government's policy on nursing homes. Well at least she is consistent. She has not been telling the truth about nursing homes from day one, ever since the government announced the elderly",85
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"Mr Nehl)Order! Be a little more careful in your speech, please.",85
186,Mrs CROSIO,PAPERS,"I will take on board what you have had to say to me, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am concerned that ever since the government announced that the elderly of Australia would be forced to pay at least $26,000 to gain a nursing home bed, we have heard nothing from the minister about this, and today her explanation was no exc-ption - o that previous comment I made, which I WIll not repeat. Each time the minister has walked to the dispatch box, she has told the people of Australia, 'No, nobody will have to sell their homes to gain a bed in a nursing home.' What do we do when those statements are made? We immediately race out, switch on the TV s, listen to the radio, read the new-Â­ papers and listen to the people who ru- thIS country's nursing homes, the pensIOner groups, the peak bodies for the aged, who are saying exactly the opposite to what the minister is trying to have us believe. They are saying in very clear voices, 'The elderly of this country will have to sell up if they want to get a bed in a nursing home.' On the one hand, we have the minister and a couple of her barely convincing cronies saying one thing and, on the other, we have the majority of the spokespeople for nursing homes and for the aged saying another. Who say do we believe? I have news for the people in the gallery and for the people on the government benches. We in opposition believe the people and not the falsities spread in the debate today. When you look at the government's legislation, the only people exempt from having to sell their home in order to raise the money to move into a nursing home are those who share a house with a spouse or a long-term carer. Okay. So what happens when you go looking for that part of the bill which says people living alone are also exempt. from selling their homes in order to move mto a nursing home? You start to become just .a little bit concerned for the elderly of thIS country and more than just a little angry and disbelieving of the minister because it is not there. It does not exist. Nowhere in the government's draft legislation is the family home exempt from the assets test for a pensioner living alone in their own home. The minister is well aware of this. Ninety per cent of the people who are now admitted to our nursing homes do not have a spouse living with them, nor do they have a carer. This means that all of those people within that 90 per cent bracket who own their own home, upon moving into a nursing home, will have to sell. There can be no other interpretation. It is what the minister has left out of the legislation that condemns her and her government, not what has been put in it. Seventy per cent of pensioners have as their one asset the family home. So when these people are presented with this legislation which says, 'Those who have assets. over $22 500 will now have to pay to get mto a nur-ing home,' there are not many choi-es left open to them, are there? - ot one quest-on did the minister answer in thIS regard dunng this debate today, nor at any time when questions have been raised directly to her in this House about this legislation. So for those living alone, it is either going to be t:be family home or it is going to be no nursmg home bed. It is that clear cut. The minister has really been playing with semantics. She knows these figures. I guarantee that they would be tattooed on the back of her eyelids. She may well say that this government will not force anyone to sell their home, but she knows and the government knows that the majority of people requiring nursing home care will have no choice. The minister said about the government's aged care package on Monday, in answer to a question from the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl): It is about delivering comfort. It is about delivering safety and security. It is about access to care based on people's need, not based on people's means. I put it to the minister-that is, I would if she were in the House to listen to her own matter of public importance-that for these people their homes are the very definition of security for them. Go and speak to the aged in the community. Their homes are the very definition to them of safety and comfort, especially when they are sick or weak enough to require a bed in a nursing home. Yet this policy manoeuvres them into selling up lock, stock and barrel. Yet, despite the only interpretation one can draw from this legislation, the minister will not fess up-not even to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you asked the question-and admit what to everybody is the bleeding obvious. So what are the other people in the community saying? The member for the Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), our shadow minister, has touched on what Mrs Norah MCGuire, the Treasurer of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, has said. I would advise the minister to go and talk to this woman because she has been concerned for a long term about this piece of legislation. She was upset enough to label what the minister has said as 'balderdash'. The minister also made a comment about what Reverend Harry Herbert, the general secretary of the Uniting Church's New South Wales board for social responsibility, said about this matter. I would like to remind the minister, in case she does not know this either, that they happen to be one of the biggest providers of nursing homes in this country. What did he have to say? The minister quoted part of it. The member for Jagajaga at least bought the truth to the matter. He said: Most elderly people don't have a lot of cash reserves, and their main asset is their home. Ipso facto, the elderly will just have to sell their one and only asset to get into a nursing home. So the nursing home industry admits it, the aged peak bodies admit it, why will the minister not admit what is the obvious truth about the legislation? I can only think that she has not come forward because she is too ashamed. She does not want to be the minister who presides over an aged care policy which will see our frail and sick elderly in our community go through the trauma and the emotional upheaval of selling their one and only asset in order to receive what we have come to expect in this country as a basic health right-a bed in a nursing home. That is what it comes down to. I do not blame her. I would not want to carry the bag for this piece of political immorality either. Every time she gets up to the dispatch box in this House to deny what has become so obvious to the rest of Australia her front-bench offers a bit of support saying, 'Get into it, Judi.' I will let the minister in on a secret. We watch your front-bench and see it in their eyes and on their faces when your back is turned that they are relieved that you are wearing it and not them. They are relieved that they are not carrying the can for this piece of legislation. I can tell you, minister, that you will carry the stigma of being the minister responsible for this policy through the rest of your political career. There are still some things in this world, in our society, which should be considered above being placed at the mercy of market forces, above user pays, above profit and loss, and a bed in a nursing home should be one of them. Surely there has to be a balance between economic realities and what we consider to be the decent and the equitable hallmarks of a civil society. Surely there are some aspects of our society which should be protected from the government's obsession with bottom lines in order for them to be able to look in the mirror in the morning and feel that they are not ashamed of their actions. After a full life contributing to our society, the elderly amongst us should not have these demands placed upon them. They go to nursing homes sick, frail and often mentally deficient. Some 60 per cent arrive direct from a hospital. How can we call our society civil if we say to these people, 'Oh, sorry, before we let you in here for what might be the final days of your life, you're going to have to hand us your front door keys, otherwise thanks very much-no bed'? How can the minister submit these already weak and fragile people to this kind of unconscionable harassment day in and day out just so she can have her way? By its policy on nursing homes, the Howard government is attacking the elderly in the most sinister and reprehensible of ways. They are plunging them into insecurity and fear at a time when they should be confident of receiving adequate care irrespective of their means.",85

191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Bradfield, I remind all members on both sides of the House that when their time is up, their time is up.

I call the honourable member for Bradfield.",87
192,Dr NELSON,PAPERS,"I came into public life because I have an agenda of things which I wish to see achieved. Amongst them is better care for older Australians. The previous government would not consult, it certainly would not listen and it was not able to see a vision of aged care 20 years from now, which is what this government and, in particular, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) are all about. Mr Deputy Speaker, honourable members and Australians, I would like to paint a picture for you. We are living in a country with an economy growing at about 3Y2 per cent, with underlying growth closer to three per cent. There are 7.8 million people who are working in this country and 6.2 million people relying on some form of social security benefit. Currently, about 13 per cent of the population is over the age of 65. By the year 2030, it will be 19 per cent and by 2051 a third of us will be over the age of 65. At the moment, about five per cent of us end up needing aged residential care, eight per cent of us over the age of 75 years will suffer from dementia and our age dependency ratio will double over the next 35 years from 5.3: 1 in 1993 to 2.6: 1 in the year 2040. The National Commission of Audit, for example, estimates that over the next 40 years we will have to spend another 10 per cent of gross domestic product, above and beyond real growth from present levels of expenditure, on the health and welfare costs of ageing alone. Currently, taxation receipts on PA YE taxpayers is less than all the money we spend on health, education and welfare. Professor Bob Gregory's 1994 stage 2 aged care review, initiated but ignored by the ideologically paralysed Labor government, preoccupied as it was at the time with a republic and other such priorities, found that for this vulnerable, non-vocal group of people, amongst other things, a billion dollars is required to be spent now to bring nursing homes up to health, design and outcome standards. Since 1987, irrespective of the accommodation received, a nursing home resident, irrespective of their income, pays a set amount representing 87Y2 per cent of the age pension, meaning that the wealthiest person in the country can be accommodated in a nursing home for that rate of payment. Yet as Gregory told us, three years ago nursing home residents had income above the pension totalling in excess $238 million a year. The system over which the previous government presided locked in numerous perverse incentives and, in many cases, forced standards of care down. Some 75 per cent of homes, according to Gregory, need to be fixed or completely rebuilt to meet Australian design standards; 70 per cent similarly to meet outcome standards; 13 per cent, according to Gregory's report at the time, did not meet fire standards; and, as is the case at moment, 39 per cent of residents in nursing homes in Australia live in a bay which has at least four residents contained within it. I ask Australians, and some on the other side in particular, to ask themselves whether have they ever been into a nursing home. Have they been into a nursing home, as I have on numerous occasions, at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning? If they have, they should ask themselves the question: are these the circumstances under which I would wish to live? Are these the circumstances under which I would be happy to have my mother or a member of my family live? I can assure you that many things I have seen in the early hours of the morning in nursing homes are not consistent with the dignity, comfort and security which the government is now trying to offer with a long-term vision. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot snuggle into bed with two per cent to three per cent underlying growth, denying taxation, industrial relations, transport and social services reform, and then on the other hand say, 'We want free aged care. We want free health care. We want free education.' You cannot do it. You are spending the future. You are seeking to indulge too many people in Australia at the moment at the expense of our children. The Labor Party introduced the hostel system in 1988. It is the hostel system upon which this program is based, yet entry fees and variable daily fees were uncapped. Standards have skyrocketed as a result. About half of these residents in hostels at the moment would actually qualify for nursing home care. The level of dependency in hostels has rapidly increased over the last decade, yet the hostel subsidy at the moment is $6,892 whereas a person with the same level of dependency has been receiving a government subsidy of around $26,793. Nursing homes, which still generally look after those with the greatest needs, have no capacity whatsoever, except in the three per cent of the market currently covered by exempt bed licences, to charge an entry contribution or fee. Typical ALP logic: make everybody the same going in as you suck on the your chardonnay and tum a blind eye to the outcomes at the other end. From I July this year, income testing will replace the current ad hoc arrangements. Currently, nursing home residents pay a maximum of 85 per cent of the age pension, whether they are millionaires or age pensioners, whilst hostel residents, 50 per cent of whom need just as much care, currently pay open-ended fees with no upper limit. The income tested fee is for 25c in the dollar above the pension area of $49 a week to a maximum of $60 a day. Those who will not be asked to pay an accommodation bond include full or part-pensioners who have not owned their own home in the past year and who have assets under $22,500, for singles, and $45,000, for couples. The government also protects those who have a spouse, a partner, a carer or a dependent child living in the house. Some $2,600 can be drawn down each year for up to five years to a maximum of $13,000. That money and the interest that is earned on it has to be spent on the care of the person who derives the benefit from it. It cannot be taken as profit by the proprietor. It has to be spent only on a home that has met sufficient standards. It can only be spent on improving the accommodation in which that person-and some of them may be our own mothers-is actually living. You can have up to six months to pay the accommodation bond or you can take the option of paying it as a daily or a monthly fee, or you can even, as the Labor Party introduced in 1988 for hostels, take it as a debt against your estate. As well as that, the government will be introducing mandatory prudential arrangements to see that people's investments are protected. To give you an example of what this is all about, the very people for whom this will provide the greatest benefit are the people whose sacrifices made this country what it is. They lived through wars and depression. They made enormous sacrifices and they are people who count their responsibilities ahead of their rights, unlike some on the other side. When 1 spoke to a group of some 200 people affected by this in my electorate, and 1 explained to them what it was all about and what the government's long-term vision was, one woman got up and said, 'I wasn't too sure about all this when 1 first heard about it, but then 1 heard my son having a conversation with my husband. My husband asked my son, ""What do you intend to do with the house when we die?"" and he said, ""I'm going to sell it and then have an overseas trip, buy a car and invest the rest.'"" Then she said to me, 'Once 1 heard that, 1 thought that, if 1I have to spend a little bit of what we have on giving my husband and me better care now while we are alive, that is something we ought to be supporting.' 1 would also draw the attention of the House to comments made by some of those in the industry, those who understand the issues. Maureen Lister, for example, the Executive Director of Aged Care Australia said: We'll be able to see quite significant improvements in the buildings of nursing homes and everyone knows that that is gravely needed. Further to that, on 6WF Maureen Lister again said: We've had entry contributions in the hostel system for some 10 years, and I don't believe residents of hostels would ever say they've been discriminated against on the basis of the amount of assets that they've had. 1I have found in my own electorate, for example, that 1I have had more concern expressed to me about this decision by people my age than 1I have by the very people who are actually going to benefit from the decision the government has made. We are actually setting in place for the future, which will not be repealed by the opposition if they ever win government, a long-term vision in Australia where those who can afford to are actually required to make a contribution toward their care so that those who are working in Australia know that when they get to that end of their lives when they need care, when they have no choice, there is a place available for them and it is a place of quality in which they would like to live. The previous government spent more looking after criminals in Australia than it did looking after people in nursing homes. We are going to make sure that people in nursing homes and residential care get better care than they have had for at least a decade. (Time expired)",87

194,Mr REID,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to continue my contribution in the consideration in detail stage on the Productivity Commission Bill. I was at the stage of drawing to the attention of the House section 8(1)(a), which quite clearly covers what the opposition are putting forward, and that says: to improve the overall economic performance of the economy ... to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community. operative words are 'for all members of the Australian community' and the 'overall economic performance'. I want to use as one example of that the five interest rate drops in the 11 months since the Howard government has been in government. What the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has put forward indicates an absence of understanding of what that clause 8(1)(a) does. It does cover everything. Interest rates have dropped substantially. Interest rates are available universally and they flow on to regional areas as well as to the metropolitan areas and the city centres of Australia. These have had a substantial impact on the improvement of many regional areas throughout Australia. We now have the lowest interest rates since 1974, far lower than we had under the previous government, at 7.55 per cent, which was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) today-a substantial drop of 2.95 per cent. Under clause 8(1)(a), those interest rates are available in regional areas of Australia, without the opposition's amendment. I want to particularly draw the House's attention to the fact that, if you compare that with the government's record and the impact that interest rates had then on the regional economy-when your rates varied between eight per cent and rose up to levels of 21 and 22 per cent at their worse-the flow-on to regional areas occurred then and was quite significant. In fact, it was extremely damaging to regional areas and sent many hundreds of 1996 small businesses bankrupt. As a result, your policies created massive unemployment losses. I am saying to you that you have overlooked the fact that clause 8(1)(a) covers every section of the community. Mr Crean-It doesn't.",90
195,Mr REID,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"It does. It says 'standards for all members of the Australian community'. Nothing could be more clear than that; nothing could be more encompassing than that'the overall economic performance of the economy ... for all members of the Australian community'. Thankfully, we on this side of the House can see that our policies have brought about substantial interest rate drops and that people in regional areas are enjoying the benefits of them. (Time expired)",91
196,Mr CREAN,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"Again I rise to address a number of the points that the other side keep raising. If it is true that the general policy principles in the new legislation cover the impact of commission decisions on regional Australia. I ask the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) to listen to this because he has put the proposition that it is already covered-why is there a requirement in the terms of reference, the first act of this new Productivity Commission",91
197,Mr REID,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I want to correct a misrepresentation. I happen to be the member for Bendigo and am proud to be the member for Bendigo.",91
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"Mr Jenkins)There is no point of order, but the point is made.",91
199,Mr CREAN,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"I notice he had to come back to his seat because he was on his way out. Having put his proposition, he did not want to stay for the response. If it is true, as you assert, that (l)(a) is the catch-all, why is there a necessity in the terms of reference that the Productivity Commission looked at for the auto industry to have regard to regional development objectives? If you say the general policy guidelines are so encompassing and simply reflect that which was picked up off the Industry Commission, why does your own reference have to make specific reference to regional development? That is our point. The legislation is deficient. You think that you are governing for all of Australia, but you are not. You are not governing for regional Australia because you have betrayed them. You are embarrassed at the betrayal and the reaction in the bush to what you are doing, so much so that you have had to set up a new committee to look at the impact on regional Victoria and the need to assess the impact of the cuts in services. So much have you betrayed in the first 11 months of your government that there is enormous reaction and anger out there against you. If you really believe you have the interests of regional Australia at heart, why not require, through the legislation, the new body to have to have regard in its decisions to the impact on regional industry and regional jobs? Nowhere in (l)(a) does it mention jobs, and that is the thing you do not want to mention, because you have no commitment to getting unemployment down. You will not set a target. You introduce mickey mouse schemes. You have schemes that pilot. You have 100,000 youth unemployed and the best you are coming up with is a pilot for 1,000. This is your problem. You just do not have a clue as to the importance in regions of sound industry development proposals. You talk about the fall in interest rates. The only reason the interest rates are falling is that you have flattened the economy. You have only to look at the DEETYA leading indicator today; you have only to look at the consumer confidence figures today. There is the eighth consecutive fall in one and, I think, the sixth consecutive fall in the other-all of your own work. This has all happened under your government-all happened since your budget. This is the point. The budget has flattened the economy. There is no confidence in the economy. No wonder interest rates are falling. If you believe the measure of prosperity is the level of interest rates, then you are deluding yourselves. The level of interest rates is important, but so too is the level of economic activity. You have flattened that economic activity. Now you have a report out from the Industry Commission-to be the Productivity Commission-that recommends further flattening of the automotive industry in this country if the majority of recommendations are adopted. I have not heard one word in this debate from those opposite in the parliament sticking up for the minority report in the car industry. Mr O'Connor-They're running already.",91
200,Mr CREAN,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"They are running scared. They want to pretend in the newspapers that they have the interests of their regions heart, but they will not defend those interests in this parliament. There is a simple proposition before this parliament: if you are looking at the future of the industry policy settings, why should you not have regard to the gional impact? That is the question. Anyone who votes against this is further voting against regional Australia. Anyone who votes against this is continuing the betrayal of regional Australia. We will not betray them, we will stick up for them, and that is why we are moving this amendment. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for not being prepared to support it.",92
201,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.14 p.m.)-I want to draw the debate on the Productivity Commission Bill back amendment that has been moved by the opposition. This debate has been pretty ranging for a debate at the consideration detail stage. Clause 8(l)(a) of the bill states: ... the Commission must have regard to of the Commonwealth Government ... in order to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community ... We include in the 'Australian community' regional Australia. Obviously, the opposition wants to segment, divide and cut up the Australian community into small bits. There is no logic whatsoever in the argument that regional Australia is not included in the Australian community. It is included, and that is why we will reject the amendment. The amendment is totally redundant. Regional Australia is included in the Australian comwas wrong. munity-full stop. To argue otherwise would defy anybody' s imagination. Anybody listening to this debate would be able to understand the logic of the opposision tion when they say that the people regional Australia-for example, out in Ballarat, Bendigo, Toowoomba, Kalgoorlie or Launceston in Tasmania-are not part of the Australian community. That is what we have just been told by the opposition, and we reject that as a government. They are part of the Australian community-in fact, they are an important part of the Australian communityat and there is no need for this duplication. Mr Crean-There was no mention of it.",92
202,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"The member for Hotham has caused a delay. We have had a very long debate so he could go and meet people. He rewas not in here when he was supposed to move his amendment, so we had to delay. Mr Crean-You did not.",92
203,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was on the floor filling in for you. You were not in here on time.

That the desire is how interested he is in it. Let me make a couple of points on the comments that have been made during this debate. The first is in response to a comment which I think was made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). The Treasurer does not bring the cabinet submission in from the Productivity Commission. It is actually the relevant minister who does that. For example, in regard to the automotive report, it will be the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) who will bring that in. I am just correcting the factual information which Another argument raised was that the Productivity Commission could draft its own not terms of reference. The Productivity Commisdoes not draft the terms of reference for living in public inquiries. Mr Crean-I didn't say that.",92
206,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"No, another OppOSItIOn speaker said that and I am just correcting it. Drafting the terms of reference is the responsibility of the Treasurer in conjunction with the appropriate minister. The Productivity Commission can initiate its own research, but that is not a public reference. I just wanted to clarify that for the member for Corio. I come specifically to the amendment, because quite a bit of reference has been made to it in regard to the automotive industry. In the draft report on the automotive industry, the Productivity Commission is seeking more analysis of regional effects. We are quite appreciative in some inquiries of the importance of what the regional parts of Australia need to have put before them. So regional Australia is taken into account in these matters. What we are putting down here are the general overall guidelines for the running of the Productivity Commission, and I think they are quite appropriate. You can put down specifically in the terms of reference details such as regional interests. (Time expired) Question put: That the amendment (Mr Crean's) be agreed to. The House divided.

207,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I move opposition amendment No.2: (2) Clause 8, page 5 (line 31), at the end of subclause (1), add: ; and (g) to have regard not only to Australia's international obligations, but also to the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers. Given that the government has voted against regional Australia by rejecting the previous amendment, it should also be noted that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was not even in the House to participate in that vote. Our second amendment also seeks to give more perspective to the considerations of the new Productivity Commission. It essentially requires, through legislation, the Productivity Commission to have regard to not only Australia's international obligations but also the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers. This proposition argues that our industries should not be subjected to unilateral disarmament. It is the proposition that says our industries are prepared to participate and contribute to the discipline and rigour of breaking down the world trade barriers but that they should not be the only ones doing it. Look at the rhetoric that those on the other side go to when they seek to criticise the Productivity Commission's report into the automotive industry. They share the sentiments that we are trying to reflect in this amendment to the legislation, yet they are not prepared to back it by way of legislative change. In other words, it is lip-service, not commitment. They want to be able to get themselves off the hook out there and say, 'We think we should have regard to what our trading partners are doing.' If they believe it, let them vote for it. Let them support the amendment that requires the Productivity Commission to have regard to that consideration. The reality is that, if you look at the automotive industry report, you can see yet again the fact that the Productivity Commission says, 'Yes, the car plan of Labor has been effective. Yes, it involved a reduction in the tariff levels. It also involved an export faciligrams. tation scheme that was very successful. But, having been successful, we believe that it should be ended.' That is the conclusion of the Productivity Commission. It is not with any regard to what the rest of the world does or the impact on regional Australia. The purpose of our amendments is to require them to have that regard. How can a government commission a report that looks at the place of the automotive industry or the textile, clothing and footwear industry or any other industry reference? They are industries that have had to develop partnerships with government, that have recognised the need to reduce tariffs but also recognised that if they are going to make the sacrifice of tariff reduction they should be entitled to assistance in getting them into export markets. I was absent earlier today. The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) sought to make some issue of the fact that I was out meeting people. Mr Adams-A cheap shot.",93
208,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"It was a cheap shot. Do you know who I was meeting? It was members of the textile, clothing and footwear industry. They came to this parliament and said, 'We want the government to give us certainty for the future of this industry.' They are concerned about your reference to the Productivity Commission. They support the amendments that we are putting in the House. That is whom I was talking to-I am proud to have been talking to them-so do not come in here with any cheap shots and say that I had to be covered for. I am proud to have been covered for in this House while I am out there talking to the people who are contributing to the wealth of this nation. They are people who are prepared to make a commitment to significant growth in export earnings if they get government support and accept the need to reduce tariffs. They needed the import credit scheme and the export facilitation scheme. They needed the innovative agricultural marketing program and the export market development grants scheme. They needed the overseas assistance proMr Miles-Why did they toss you out?",94
209,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"Why did they toss us out? Here he comes. They tossed us out, that is true, but they voted for you because you promised to keep those programs. You promised to keep them. When we said, 'No cuts to industry assistance programs,' you said, 'Me too.' When we said, 'No cuts to research and development,' you said, 'Me too.' You lied to the Australian people, and you have been found out lying. That is why they are welcoming us now. That is why they recognise that their future depends on backing us.

Clause 21.",94
210,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 3 to 5: (3) Clause 21, page 14 (line 4), after ""person"", insert ""or organisation"". (4) Clause 21, page 14 (line 11), at the end of subclause (1), add: ; or (c) a particular Commonwealth business or business activity faces net competitive disadvantage and restraints in its capacity to compete against the private sector. (5) Clause 21, page 14 (lines 15 to 18), omit all words after ""June 1996"", substitute ""(the aim of which is to ensure that significant government business activities do not experience net competitive advantages or disadvantages against their competitors by virtue of their public sector ownership)"". These amendments confinn the Labor Party's belief that competitive neutrality should be a two-way street as it is written into the government's competitive neutrality statement and also the provisions of the Productivity Commission Bill. It is very clear that the coalition parties see competitive neutrality as a one-way street that is designed for private sector organisations to make complaints against unfair advantages of the public sector, but not designed for the reverse-that is, the opportunity for public sector organisations to make complaints about instances where they are prohibited from fair competition in the marketplace. The provisions as they stand reflect the coalition's ideological obsession with private ownership. They work on the basis that only private ownership can achieve desirable social and economic goals. They see no legitimate role for an active public sector. I would have thought that by any common understanding of the two words 'competitive neutrality' one could expect the competition to be neutral; that is, the public sector should not have unfair advantages in competition against the private sector and, just as much, it should not have unfair disadvantages. So the purposes of my amendments-three in total-are to entrench that particular purpose, to make sure that competition between public utilities and organisations is absolutely neutral and fair and to ensure that competitive neutrality effect, a two-way street and not a one-way process. At the end of the second reading debate I listened to the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who was again in the chamber representing the government on this matter even though he has no economic responsibilities within his executive duties. He was making the point that the words as they stand in the Productivity Commission Bill reflect the intergovernmental agreement that was arrived at by the former government. He did not put it exactly in those terms. He just said, 'These are the words that were taken from the former government.' Because the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was not here and the member for Braddon has so little expertise or background in any of these matters, he was not telling the House the full truth; he was not telling the House each of the facts. He should have mentioned that it was an intergovernmental agreement arrived at in April 1995 that carried the words he quoted to the House. He would also appreciate that an intergovernmental agreement in April 1995 carried the signatures of six conservative heads of government and three ALP heads of government. As I understand the proposition for competitive neutrality and policy principles, (3)(i) was a clause inserted at the insistence of the Victorian government. It was the Kennett government that wrote those words into the intergovernmental agreement. Then the member for Braddon further refused to explain to the House or read out the next clause, which said: Each party is free to determine its own agenda for the implementation of competitive neutrality principles. As I understand it, the former government was locked into the words in clause (3)(i) that were written and commissioned by the Kennett government. It was the Labor Party, then in federal government, that insisted on each party being free to detennine its own agenda for the implementation of competitive neutrality principles. I can assure the House that, if we had been in government throughout the course of 1996, we would have come up with a very different Commonwealth competitive is, in neutrality policy statement from the one released by Mr Costello in June 1996. I invite members of the House to check the words given to the House by the member for Braddon against the terms and conditions of this policy statement. The statement says: Competitors of government businesses, and others, will be able to have Commonwealth business activities investigated by the Productivity Commission where they consider that competitive neutrality arrangements are not being applied. No mention of the reverse. The Labor Party in government, in a Commonwealth competitive neutrality statement, would have also applied the reverse principle-that is, government instrumentalities could have made a complaint to the Productivity Commission if they were being unfairly restricted in competing against the private sector. The statement then talks about the role of the complaints mechanism, and it lists three roles for that mechanism: - respond to concerns that govern--nt busines-es are not complying with competitive neutralIty principles; - advise on whether resource allocation distortions are being caused by significant government businesses; and - consider whether Government businesses have net competitive advantages resulting from public ownership. Again, no mention of net competitive disadvantages. It is those disadvantages that the Howard government is so determined to inflict upon the public sector. We have had government backbenchers saying t-at. they do not believe the Government Pubhshmg Service should be able to compete against the private sector. They say that the private sector should compete against government but not the reverse. (Extension of time granted) We have had government backbenchers saying those things. They think compe-itive neutrality is a one-way street. The pnvate sector can compete against government, but not the reverse. We have had the Attorney General (Mr Williams) placing a restriction on the Australian Protective Service. They are no longer allowed to tender for private security work. So he is allowing the private sector to tender against all the work of the Australian Protective Service, but they are not allowed to do the same thing by the same standard as the private sector. They have been barred from tendering for any private security work. So this government sees competitive neutrality as a one-way street. That is just the backdoor way, the unfair way, of shrinking the public sector. The government do not believe in a level playing field of competition; they do not believe in competition which is neutral. They believe in one ideologically driven and inadequate view of the world that only the private sector knows and does best. That is totally unfair to any decent principle. The best way to work out the role of the public sector is to adopt a philosophical and pragmatic assessment of where it can playa useful role. Once that role is established, if there is to be competition against the private sector, we should make sure that the competition is on the fabled level playing field and is completely neutral and fair. The government is not applying that principle. I believe it is very important that the House adopt these amendments to make sure that in clause 21 competitive neutrality is a two-way street. For instance, look at clause 21 (1). It says a person may complain to the commission, but it does not allow a government authority to complain to the Productivity Commission about the sorts of restrictions that it might be facing. Have a look at clause 21(3). It talks about net competitive advantages over their competitors, but it does not talk about net competitive disadvantages that the public sector might face. F-rther, I am - roÂ­ posing to add, among the hst of - oI?plamts that might be made to the commISSIOn, the following words: ... a particular Commonwealth business or business activity faces net competitive disadvant;age and restraints in its capacity to compete against the private sector. So these Labor Party amendments are sensible. They live up to the literal meaning of the words 'competitive neutrality'. They apply a neutral set of competition rules in instances where public and private sector organisations are engaged in an active market. What could be more fair and reasonable than that? I just cannot understand why a government that produces a competitive neutrality statement and talks about competitive neutrality in the Productivity Commission Bill does not put in place guidelines that are neutral in terms of competition. Surely it is not reasonable for the private sector to make complaints when .the public sector can make no such complamts about instances where it is restricted. The Australian Protective Service should be allowed to tender for work of a private security nature. If the Attorney-General does not allow them, they should be able to m-e a complaint to the Productivity CommissIon. Under the guidelines before the House at the moment they would not be able to do that.",95

213,Mr LA THAM,PAIRS,"The member for North Sydney has had a big day, but he is willing to make a contribution to this debate.

One would hope that the patron saint of the John Stuart Mill Society would take a more enlightened position and that even though he sits so far down the back of the chamber-I know he is large but I am struggling to see him-he most of all among government backbenchers would stand up and favour genuinely neutral competition. Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. We have got some specific amendments before us and I would ask you to ask the speaker to come back to the topic.",98

215,Mr LA THAM,PAIRS,"I had the impression that the member for North Sydney was supporting us, so I was quite buoyed by those words of encouragement. He would know the folly of this legislation and these provisions because he has a background in examining such principles and would understand that competitive neutrality means a level playing field, that it means neutral competition. So what has the government got to hide from and fear in these things? By its own proposition, it is effectively damned because if it believes the private sector is superior under all circumstances it should have nothing to fear.(Time expired)",98
216,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.57 p.m.)-I just make the comment that we have had a pretty extensive debate on the amendments to the Productivity Commission Bill. The government has facilitated a fairly wide-ranging debate. I know that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has moved three amendments together. I trust that if he has another five minutes we may be able to draw the debate to a conclusion. I will make my comments now very briefly. He has made one or two comments about the words which he wants to include-in particular, 'enjoy' and 'competitive advantage and disadvantage'. The words preferred by the Labor Party in February 1994-the words which we have brought into this legislation-were 'Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage'. Mr Latham-What's your source? What are you reading from?",98
217,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"In 1994 they were the Labor Party's preferred words. The document I am reading from is an extract, but I have been given information that these were the preferred words of the Labor Party back in 1994. Mr Latham-What is the document?",98
218,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"The document is the Commonwealth Competitive Neutrality Policy Statement of June 1996, but the words as an attachmentMr Latham-So you're making it up.",98
219,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"No, I am not making it upnot at all. I am saying that those words were the preferred words back in 1994 of the Labor Party. The other thing I want to say is that, in regard to disadvantage, if you go to this document, you will also notice that on page 3 of this 1996 document we do talk about other advantages and-in brackets-disadvantages. I point out to you that we are conscious of that. I think most people who are across this area would know that the areas in which you have Commonwealth agencies which are at a disadvantage are not all that well known or highlighted extensively. It is usually the other way, and that is what this competitive neutrality is mainly about. But I indicate to the member for Werriwa that there is mention of disadvantages on page 3 of the 1996 document.",98
220,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"It is breathtaking to try to comprehend what the member for Braddon, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), has just tried to tell the House. He was in here at the end of the second reading debate, saying that my amendments were inappropriate because the words in the Productivity Commission Bill were words that the Labor Party favoured in 1994. I have challenged him over that, and I have quoted the relevant clauses from the 1995 intergovernmental agreement. What is his response? To say that the words in the Liberal Party competitive neutrality statement in June 1996 prove that in 1994 the Labor Party favoured those words. He has no proof. He has worked on the Demidenko principle, that what he does not know he is willing to make up, to fabricate and to plagiarise. It is a shameful thing that you have no proof for the serious claim you have made before the House. Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That is not the case, and I ask the member to withdraw that implication of fabrication on my part.",98
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Do you take offence at that remark? Mr Miles-I certainly do.,99
222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"If offence has been taken, I would ask you to withdraw.",99
223,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker, but",99
224,Mr KERR,PAIRS,You are a very generous man.,99
225,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"As the member for Denison points out, given my generous spirit and nature I am willing to withdraw, but the proposition, morally and intellectually, breathtaking. The member for Braddon has made the charge that my amendments are inappropriate because the current words in the legislation are words that the Labor Party favoured in 1994. His proof is to read from a Liberal Party document of June 1996. He has got no proof, he has got no documentation. I had a conversation during the last division with the former Treasurer, Mr Willis. I asked him about Labor's progressing of competitive neutrality statements, and he said there was basically no consideration of these matters during our time in government, that we moved into the campaign at the beginning of 1996 and it was some six months after the end of 1995 before the coalition government produced its competitive neutrality policy statement. It is terrible that the member for Braddon is trying to raise evidence in the House without a source, without a document, without any proof whatsoever. It really is shameful for the parliamentary secretary to behave in this fashion. The government's whole handling of this matter is inappropriate and disrespectful to the parliament, because the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has not been present for any of these amendments or their consideration. It is very hard for the Labor Party to get a fair consideration of its propositions if the Treasurer is not willing to be in the chamber. He was here for the divisions-we have had two. I will read to the parliament the relevant clause from the ministerial code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard): Ministers should ... whenever possible, be present in the Chamber to guide the legislation through the various stages of debate. It goes on to say that it is only in circumstances when their absence is unavoidable that they should be out of the chamber. It can barely be unavoidable for the Treasurer not to be here if he can come in for divisions, walk back up to his kennel and then come back in for another division. This is a clear breach of the ministerial code of conduct. Mr Hockey-I rise on a point of order. I ask the member for Werriwa to withdraw that comment about the Treasurer.",99
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Do you take is still offence at the remark? Mr Hockey-I do.,99
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Offence has been taken. I would ask that you withdraw the remark.,99
228,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"Which remark? Mr Barresi-You know which one, Mark.",99
229,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"That the Treasurer has got a kennel? If that offends the member for North Sydney, I am more than happy to withdraw. But I still make the point that the Treasurer is in breach of the Prime Minister's ministerial code of conduct, because he should be in the chamber, unless he has got a legitimate excuse. What excuse can he have, if he is here for divisions, walks out, comes back in for the next division and leaves the parliamentary secretary-who makes things up as he goes along-to handle the legislation ? Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that you bring the speaker back to the topic which is in hand at this stage. There are three specific amendments. He should not be talking about the things he is going on about.",99
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The question is that the amendments moved by the honourable member be agreed to. The speaker should restrict his remarks to those three amendments.,100
231,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe it is legitimate, when the member for Braddon has failed to produce any evidence to support the serious claim he made earlier in the debate-his only proof of what the Labor Party did in 1994 is to read out from a Liberal Party document from June 1996for me to make the point that the member for Braddon is not the appropriate person to be handling this legislation on behalf of the government. The Prime Minister's own code says the Treasurer should be here. You can imagine the frustration of the opposition. We are not getting accurate information out of the executive representative at the table. We have not got the Treasurer here. It is not accurate information, because your only proof of what we did in 1994 is what you did in 1996. (Extension of time granted) This is an immensely frustrating process for the opposition. We have a common sense amendment to move-the idea that competitive neutrality should mean neutral competition. There can be nothing more rudimentary, nothing less controversial, nothing less intelefits. lectually challenging for the member for Braddon than that basic proposition. Why should the public sector not be competing on a truly level playing field, without unfair advantages and disadvantages in its operation? The memher for Braddon has made a claim to try to disparage my amendments, to make suggestions about what the Labor Party was doing in 1994. He cannot substantiate that in any shape or form, and the ministerial code of conduct clearly requires the Treasurer to be here. For a party-the Liberal Party-that made so much noise about respect for the parliament, I could not imagine anything more disrespectful than the way in which this Productivity Commission Bill is being handled. It makes it very hard for the Labor Party and indeed for all parliamentarians to get fair consideration of constructive amendments. But we bat on, wanting to do the right thing by the public sector. When it comes to the ideology expressed in the Commission of Audit, the way in which so many ministers are trying to wind back the public sector by not allowing it fair competition and fair access to markets, when it comes to the loss of jobs and the loss of investment that comes out of that attitude, particularly in regional Australia, we stand on strong ground. We cannot have proper and fair process in the House of Representatives, but morally and intellectually our argument is superior. I hope in the fullness of time the Australian public understands that. The narrow Liberal ideology that only the private sector knows and does best is replicated all over the country. The Kennett government has adoptedÂ· this philosophy. For instance, it will not allow public hospital pathology units to compete against the private sector, but private pathology can compete against public hospitals. As the member for Denison indicated, the Kennett government will not allow local government to compete against the private sector under any circumstances, yet it invites a ridiculous and arbitrary rule of how much private sector work local councils must contract out. This is ideology run wild. This is ideology gone mad. Mr Barresi-People are reaping the ben",100
232,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"People like the member for Deakin should know better than this because narrow ideology does not make for good governance, and a very narrow attachment to one set of ownership principles does not make for good public policy. If you want to run the country properly, you need good policy and good policy comes from a good philosophical underpinning. There is nothing better than competitive neutrality. The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has just nodded. He has not interjected, he has just nodded to say that my proposition is correct-he knows the merit of this particular amendment. There is one thing about this Liberal government that we have seen in under 12 months. They have a political strategy which is to tear Australia in half, to set a mainstream against minor streams. They have a political strategy but no theory or practice of creati ve governance. They talk about real jobs, private sector activity-all the vacuous rhetoric of their side of politics-but the truth is, if you want to do something about insecurity, if you want to do something about the impact of globalisation, the answer does not lie in the private sector alone. The answer does not lie in rampant individualism. The answer does not lie in winding back social capital. It does not lie in further fragmenting society. It lies in the active role of government. It lies in collectivist institutions looking Hollis, C. after the collective interest. That is why fair competition and competitive neutrality for the public sector is so critical. It should be one of the pillars on which good governance is built in the 1990s. For all the debates we have in this place, unless the public sector gets a fair crack at market opportunities and a fair chance to compete, then it is very hard for government to use its countervailing role, its instruments of public policy to get the best public outcomes. I am a little sad that those opposite know better than this but they cannot do anything about it because the Treasurer is not here. The Treasurer has breached the ministerial code of conduct. He is not in the House for the conduct of this particular legislation. The Productivity Commission Bill is so important, why can't the Treasurer come here for anything more than a division. Why can'the participate in debate.",100

234,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"He is dogging it. The Labor Party is moving valid and correct amendments, but we know that those opposite are not empowered to deal with them effectively because of the shabby way in which the Treasurer treats this parliament.

239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I ask members to make their remarks through the chair.,102
240,Mr LA THAM,NOES,"I will. I wanted to make the point about the difficult position the government has now placed the Productivity Commission in. They advised the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration on 2 December that they are expecting to receive competitive neutrality complaints from public sector organisations. I asked Mr Pitkethly of the Productivity Commission the following question at that public hearing: If, for instance, the Government Printing Service complained to you that they have been barred from competing for private sector work but the private sector is encouraged to compete for their work, would that be regarded as a legitimate complaint?  I think that the AGPS could come to us and say, 'Yes, we are competing with one hand tied behind our back compared to the position of our domestic competitors. ' It seems to me that the government now has a most awkward situation on its hands. The Productivity Commission has been gearing up all its work, all its administration and all its printed material on the basis of the supposition that public sector organisations could in fact lodge complaints with it regarding competitive disadvantages and restraints they might face. I raise that matter to try to ease the burden of the parliamentary secretary. He has shots coming at him from all sides. He does not have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) here to try to help him out. He has now placed the Productivity Commission in a terrible position where all their preparations for the administration of competitive neutrality have been thrown in the air by the government's faulty bill and its inability to accept the Labor Party's sensible amendment. The best thing the parliamentary secretary could do in response to that-his only get out, his only debating point in this considerationwas to say that Labor agreed to something in the middle of 1994, and his proof of that was a Liberal Party document dated June 1996, which he quoted from. This is a sort of sleight of hand. This is a new form of logic, an argument the House has not yet seen. It is the osmosis of how one party's document two years after the event proves what another party did in 1994. It does not make sense. The Productivity Commission now stands with a problem on its hands, given the second reading and the consideration in detail. I would urge the parliamentary secretary to correct this anomaly before this bill passes the third reading stage. It is now the only sensible way out. He has a glazed look. He does not know what to do, but I would urge him to correct the problem as soon as possible.",102
241,Mr KERR,NOES,"I would like to join my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in requesting the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) to take the opportunity of consulting with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to see whether these matters can be remedied. It does seem that there has been both a misunderstanding, to put it at its kindest, of the history of this matter and a practical deficiency in that the organisation and the community at large no doubt expect the outcome will be, as was predicted throughout the course and under our government, an opportunity for an actual level playing field. The parliamentary secretary displays no signs of moving to discuss this with the Treasurer, but it would be of assistance to us were he to seek some instructions in relation to this. If the Treasurer were here, he could give a response to us directly. It does no honour to this House to find that the parliamentary secretary stands up and says that in 1994 there was a document in existence which suggested that the Labor Party adhered to this particular vision of how the principles of competitive neutrality ought to work. He has not been able to produce any source of it. He says he was so advised and is directing us to a document which his own government produced to source this. This is a fairly cynical act to say the least. As the member for Werriwa says, worthy of the Demidenko label. I should say that it is a little puzzling that we do not have the opportunity of the Treasurer's coming to the dispatch box to actually say on what basis he has sent his parliamentary secretary down here to make the allegations he has made. Secondly, we are not able to address this question which could well be resolved to the satisfaction of members on both sides of this House were we to actually get a commitment to the principles that I am sure the Productivity Commission and the community at large thought they were getting when this government spoke about these lofty principles of competitive neutrality.

NA NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",103
242,Mr LEE,LEGIS LA TION,"-by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for DobeII moving forthwith that the consideration of the Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the associated telecommunications measures should not be proceeded with until after the government has responded to the report on telecommunications reform by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. I acknowledge that there is an agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles). I thank the Chief Government Whip also for agreeing to allow two opposition members to speak for five minutes on this particular motion. The reason the opposition is moving this motion is to make the clear point that believe that this legislation should not before the House of Representatives when Senate Environment, Recreation, Communicadown tions and the Arts Legislation Committee is still dealing with the issues that go to the heart of this legislation. We think that after the committee has finished its work, after it has tabled and made its report public, and after the government has responded to the recommendations of that committee is the right balance. time when this parliament, and in particular the House of Representatives, should be considering the detail of the legislation. I know that leaves some difficulties for industry because the legislation is meant take effect from 1 July 1997. I think no-one is to blame except the Minister for Communiyou cations and the Arts, Senator Alston, for the government being in this pickle. They are in a pickle because Senator Alston just could not help himself when he was appointed Minister for Communications and the Arts last year. We set out on this path of reform in telecommunications way back in the early 1980s. At that time it was agreed that we would move to full and open competition on 1 July 1997. During the last government I had the honour of serving as Minister for Communications and the Arts. Towards the end of 1994 we outlined the Labor government's plans to go through a process of consultation and Orders drawing up of legislation that would provide the transition to full and open competition on 1 July 1997. The plan was for legislation to be passed by the end of 1995 or the middle of 1996 to give the industry at least a year's notice of what the law would be, so that people could make their plans for investment and start to hire their staff-so that they could hit the ground running, probably before 1 July 1997. As the new law took effect on that date we would have hoped that we could have had the most rapid development of a more competitive communications market. In fact, what happened was that after Senator Alston was appointed minister, on the election of the Howard government, he took every possible measure to pour scorn on the former government's efforts, and to pour scorn, in some cases, on the hard work which we had been done by many members of the be industry, representatives of consumers, the the carriers, the ACCC and others, who had sat with me over a period of more than 18 months, working on the detail of this legislation, coming up with a whole series of compromises that meant no-one got everything they asked for. But everyone, I think, came to the conclusion by March 1996 that we had a legislative package that tried to strike the Senator Alston just could not help himself. He made foolish comments about the industry being totally opposed to the former govern the ment's legislation and he claimed that he was to wiping the slate clean. It is a bit hard to understand the logic of those remarks when now look at the legislative package that is about to go before that chamber. Nevertheless, Senator Alston had his chance to grandstand. The result of his grandstanding was another period of delay of up to 12 months. We are now in a pickle where a Senate committee is investigating what the legislative package would be at the very time that the legislative package is sought to be introduced and debated into the House of Representatives. We believe that this is not good enough for a minister of the Crown. We think that the only people who will suffer as a result of Senator Aston's grandstanding is the industry. There will be a greater period of uncertainty before we finally know what the legislative package would be. For all those reasons, we believe that it would be best for this House if we delay consideration of this bill until the Senate committee has had an opportunity to finish its deliberations. For all those reasons, I put this motion before the House. We are very optimistic of having the government's support, but if we are not able to persuade them with the eloquence of our arguments, then we will move on to the debate on the legislative package.",104
243,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,LEGIS LA TION,"This is a very substantial package of legislation which entirely replaces the tion which currently regulates the telecommunications industry and overhauls the current industry structure. It will have an enormous impact on the business plans of Telstra, Optus, potential carriers, service providers and, most importantly, consumers. Seemingly minor changes to key provisions, such as the competition rule in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill, the tariff provisions, the universal service obligations-all those things-will have a massive impact on the sale price of Telstra and will also affect all carriers and service providers investment decisions. They will dictate the speed of the rollout of what has been referred to as the information superhighway. The people who should be most concerned to ensure that their interests are protected by the legislation are residents of rural and regional Australia. These consumers will be the ones who could be bypassed by the information superhighway unless there are airtight guarantees of universal access to its standard telephone service. For these reasons we believe it is appropriate that consideration of this bill should not proceed until after the government has responded to the report on telecommunications reform that it has received from the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. Provided we can persuade the minor parties and Independents to vote in favour of amendments which the opposition will move in the Senate, the competitive model which the legislation puts in place could in fact result in lower prices, enhanced services and a greatly increased variety of services for many consumers, particularly large businesses and metropolitan consumers. However, the legislation which we currently have before us does not ensure that rural or regional Australia will receive these benefits. On the contrary, it is our view that rural and regional Australians will be substantially worse off than they are under the current telecommunications legislation. For those reasons, I support the motion moved by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). I urge all honourable members to support the motion legislamoved by the member for Dobell.

244,Mr LEE,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"At the start, I will outline to the House the amendment which the opposition intends to move to the second reading motion for the Telecommunications Bill 1996. The amendment states: NA That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its concern at the Government's refusal to: (l) maintain the 1 Jul y 1997 cutoff for carriers' exemptions from State and Territory planning laws; (2) ensure that rural and provincial customers benefit from local call price reductions; (3) honour its election promise on ISDN connections for rural and provincial Australians; and (4) honour the Prime Minister's guarantee that no charge would be introduced for Directory Assistance. "". If I provide copies of the proposed amendment to the clerks then the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), who has to leave shortly, can take a copy with him. I would like to turn in detail to the legislation. The opposition remains strongly committed to the introduction of full and open competition on 1 July 1997 for the reasons I outlined in my speech in moving the suspension of standing orders. I outlined our concern that Senator Alston's grandstanding placed at risk the 1 July transition date for the introduction of full and open competition. Over the last decade, the Labor Party has worked very hard to introduce full and open competition in telecommunications. It was the Hawke Labor government that made the decision to allow Optus to be the second carrier, to allow that licence to be issued. We now have Vodafone as the third competitor with mobile telephony. The Labor government also changed the law so that there could be service providers out there snapping at the heels of the major carriers. Several years ago, in no small measure due to the efforts of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, we had the government commit to the introduction of full and open competition on 1 July 1997. During our period of working through the best way to achieve more competition in telecommunications, it was the Labor Party's firm view that one of the premises of our approach to telecommunications should be that Telstra remained in public ownership. We believe that in keeping Telstra as an entity owned by the government we could ensure that there was a large carrier out there making sure that people who live in the bush, people with disabilities, were not left out; that people who, if left to market forces would have to pay very large sums of money for basic telecommunications services, were not left behind. We wanted to make sure that people who perhaps need to have special equipment can have it at an affordable price. It was our view that by keeping Telstra 100 per cent government owned we could ensure that the government ultimately could be held responsible if people in the bush were not looked after or if people with disabilities could not purchase equipment at a reasonable price. For all those reasons, the former government worked very hard at developing a legislative package that sought to move Australia in a rational way towards a more open and competitive market. I would now like to turn to some of the areas where the Labor opposition remains concerned about changes the government has made to the legislation. Perhaps I could begin with an area of great controversy, and that is the powers and immunities that carriers have had in the past-the exemption from the state and local government planning laws. I remind the House that during the last government there were some changes to what is known as the telecommunications national code. It was the former Labor government that gave local councils the ability to refer proposals to build mobile telephone communications towers, for example, to the secretary of the department of the environment. If a local council was against it, you could call in an umpire. In January 1996 the former Labor government outlined a proposal which would give local councils the power to force carriers to install pay TV cable underground in areas where the existing telecommunications cable was underground. As I understand the detail of this legislative package and the government's announced intentions in this area, there will be a number of changes that we have reservations about. In particular, the government has decided to allow a three-month extension beyond that 1 July cut-off date for the powers an- immunities that are granted to the carrIers. That extension is apparently to allow broadband cable roll-out to continue in areas where the roll-out has allegedly begun. Before he left, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts in the House, said that he would be willing to answer any questions that the opposition raised during this debate. Knowing the efficiency and diligence of the officials in the box, I am sure they will make sure every one of these questions gets to the minister. What we would like to know, for example, is how the government intends to define an area where broadband cable roll-out is already taking place. Do they mean that because Optus Vision is about to begin-or has recently begun-roll-out in Adelaide they can continue to install overhead aerial cable in Adelaide up until 1 October 1997? Or do they mean that if the roll-out has begun in a particular local government area in Adelaide, then Optus is exempted from the normal rules until 1 October in that local government area? Or does the minister mean that to apply to a particular town or street? What does the government mean? I think the House would benefit from some clarification of that issue. I would also be keen to know what the government's position is on proposals to build mobile telephone communications towers in areas. At the moment the telecommunications code gives local councils the ability to refer off to the arbitrator-in effect, to the department of the environment-to look at proposals that local councils resolve that they are opposed to. I note that there are provisions outlined for the Australian Communications Authority to have the ability to hold public inquiries into particular proposals that might affect the environment. I would be keen to know what the threshold test will be for the ACA in determining whether proposals should be allowed to be approved or rejected. For example, is it to be a test of national interest? Several years ago, there was a lengthy dispute between Telstra and the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service about whether a mobile telephone tower could be erected on top of a mountain in one of the national parks on the New South Wales south coast. I believe it was strongly in the national interest that that tower be installed to fill a gap in the mobile telephone network used by fishermen on the New South Wales south coast. I was very pleased that Telstra, CEP A and the New South Wales environmental authorities were able to reach agreement about the very strict environmental conditions that were placed on Telstra to allow that tower to be built. That is an example of the construction of a tower being in the national interest. We made sure that we covered a gap that was placing the lives of fishermen, sailors and recreational sailors at risk. I do not think you could argue that a communications tower in a suburban neighbourhood would be in the national interest. Often carriers have the ability to select from many different sites for a mobile telephone tower. It is becoming increasingly common that proposals near schools and densely populated residential areas are triggering strong opposition from local communities and councils. I would be keen for the minister to outline what will happen under the new government's regime if a local council resolves to oppose to a telecommunications tower. I have also noticed in the legislation that there is a proposal for Austel to convene a public inquiry to determine what 'low impact' will mean. There are certain exemptions given for low impact activities. I seek an assurance that no mobile telephone tower will ever be considered to be low impact, given the great lengths we have gone to in the past to ensure that there is a proper and thorough investigation of proposals for mobile telephone towers. That is the first point: we are quite concerned about this government's attempts to water down that 1 July 1997 cut-off that I have outlined. The carriers have known for some time that the 1 July cut-off will mean an increase in the number of carriers competing in the Australian telecommunications market. I, for one, think it would be wrong for an unlimited number of carriers, some Australian owned and some possibly 100 per cent foreign owned, to be exempt from planning and local government ordinances. Once we move from a limited number of carriers, such as one, two or three, to dozens of carriers or an unlimited number, we cannot grant dozens of domestic and foreign company exemptions from the normal planning and environmental laws. I also draw the minister's attention to a remark in the explanatory memorandum at page 7 of volume 1. In passing, it makes the obvious point that, in the face of increasing demand for mobile communications services and restrictions on the use of aerial cabling, there will be a continuing and increasing demand for transmitter sites and underground ducts. Perhaps the minister could outline to the House whether the government has conducted any estimates of how many towers are expected to be constructed between now and the year 2000 and, in particular, what impact there may be in the sale of blocks of spectrum. I would be quite interested to know whether the current round of erections of large numbers of mobile telephone towers will fill the gaps or whether we can expect there to continue to be a substantial increase in the number of mobile telephone towers constructed between now and the year 2000. The next point I want to raise concerns part (b) of the opposition's second reading amendment, which expresses concern at the government's refusal to ensure that rural and provincial customers benefit from local call price reductions. We are concerned about this cause the government has taken a quite fundaTelstra mental step in getting legislation through the Senate and this parliament to sell off one-third of Telstra. I do not want to revisit the past debate, but from the opposition's point view this is a fundamental change. While government will retain two-thirds of the spoke shares in Telstra, it will not be able to oppress the minority shareholders. That means ability of the government to determine what Telstra does has changed fundamentally. For that reason, we believe there need to be additional protections for people who live in rural and provincial areas, and certainly more tections than we envisaged when our package had that first premise of Telstra remaining completely in government ownership. I would like to bring to the House's attention a remark made by the member for Bass, representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, when the government was accepting the opposition's amendment to give the minister power of direction. I will quote from the House of Representatives Hansard of 12 December 1996. This is what Mr Smith said: It is the government's expectation that any public interest controls would be exercised through regulatory mechanisms which apply to all carriers and that, if the Commonwealth sought to exercise any control over Telstra in its capacity as a shareholder, it would do so by exercising the rights attaching to the two-thirds of the shares which it owned, not by exercising the power of direction. In the debate that took place at that time, I made the point that it may be the government's view but it is certainly not the view of those of us on this side of the House. We believe that, with the government accepting that amendment, it is retaining the right for a future government to issue directions to Telstra. I am sure people who are purchasing shares in Telstra will understand that that is the clear, express wish of the parliament. No weasel words from the minister can seek to restrict the future decisions of an elected government. Certainly it cannot restrict the decisions of the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is quite fortuitous that, during that debate, we sought to obtain an assurance from the beminister that if at any time in the future sought to introduce price discounts for local calls for city customers it would use that power of direction to make sure that Telstra passed on those reductions in local call prices of to people who live in rural and provincial the Australia. We know that the Prime Minister to his party room earlier this year about the matter. I will quote from a report in the that the Weekend Australian of the time: ... Howard's pledge to the Government partyroom that those in remote areas will have all the ""whiz-bangery"" that the new technology has to offer-at the same price as those in the cities. pro Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, there is no more basic and more important service to someone who lives in the bush than the local telephone call. If you cannot be guaranteed your local telephone calls at the same price as those in the city, the Prime Minister's promise to the party room does not mean much at all. Yet, within a day or two of the Prime Minister giving that assurance, his office was quoted in the Australian as saying that local call charges would not be allowed to rise in regional Australia or anywhere else but the extent of price reductions could vary between areas. Also, we had the minister for communications, Senator Alston, confirming in the same article that Telstra will be free to charge different prices for consumers in different cities or towns where the industry is opened up to all comers. So it is clear-certainly with the package that is before the House at the moment-that the government is expecting that there are going to be significant reductions in local call prices in city areas. If Telstra is not prepared to pass on those price reductions to people who live in the bush, then we want a direction from the government that makes sure that that is the case. It is not that hard to do. We saw the Prime Minister almost do it at question time today when he made it clear that the government had been embarrassed into agreeing to maintain its promise on directory assistance charges. I will say more about that later. I think that if we were to see a difference in the price of local calls emerging, then that would also be an issue worthy of a direction from the government. I now would like to move on to another promise which was made by the Prime Minister in a very important speech, a speech that I am sure is clear in your mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it helped persuade the National Farmers Federation, and perhaps other people who live in the bush, to support the coalition's proposal to privatise one-third of Telstra. In the speech the Prime Minister made on 21 November 1995 to the National Farmers Federation-this was his big policy announcement of the day in that address-he said: Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service. We will also require Telstra to substantially complete its FMO or digitisation of exchanges by 1 July 1997, instead of its current year 2000 target date. So in that speech to the National Farmers Federation in November 1995, the Prime Minister promised access to ISDN as a standard service right across the country-a promise which the then Labor government said would cost many billions of dollars, a promise which we said the coalition could never deliver on and a promise which has not been met to date. It is quite interesting that we have had some new developments on this in the last few days. Senator Alston commissioned a review group headed by Jock Given from the Communications Law Centre-a very able organisation and a very able man, I might say. Nine out of the 10 members of the review group submitted their majority report, which recommended that ISDN be guaranteed to all residents and businesses by the year 2000. It did not quite meet the Prime Minister's timetable in the promise he made to the National Farmers Federation. But you can understand why the review group might have been encouraged to make ISDN the standard service when the Prime Minister outlined that promise in his speech to the National Farmers Federation. Let me repeat it: Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers who have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service. That is what John Winston Howard promised the National Farmers Federation. It is what got them to agree to support prlvatisation of one-third of Telstra. It is what got the National Party to agree to the one-third privatisation of Telstra. And the promise is getting broken as we speak. When the review group divided nine to one, Senator Alston put out this very misleading statement on 6 February: Two reports assessing whether the standard telephone service should be upgraded were released today ... It was not indicated that it was one report of who a nine to one vote, a nine to one recommendation and a minority report from one member, Professor Ergas. But Senator Alston claims we have two reports. He went on to almost equate the two opinions-the opinion of the nine majority members of the group and Professor Ergas-as if they were two reports of equal weight and equal merit. In fact, if anything, Senator Alston in the press report is very heavily leaning in favour of Professor Ergas, who, as I understand it, is it long-term friend of Senator Alston and someone who he had worked closely with during his studies. In this report, Senator Alston, the minister, said: I am particularly concerned to ensure that any change to the current arrangements does not impose undue costs on users of the ordinary telephone service. Professor Ergas' report makes it clear very substantial sums of money could be involved ... My eyesight might be failing me, but I cannot see any such conditions on the Prime Minister's promise to the National Farmers Federation. I am not sure that when the Prime Minister spoke to his party room and to the National Party over the last 18 - onths he would have put this condition on this clear promise to provide all the people who live in the bush, everyone who is connected to a digital exchange, with access to ISDN as a standard service. Senator Alston is trying to walk away from the promise he gave the National Party and the promise that John Winston Howard gave the National Farmers Federation. There was a quick response from the industry. The Australian Financial Review of Friday, 7 February said: The Minister for Communications, Senator Richard Alston, came under fire from key sections of the telecommunications industry yesterday after expressing concern at the potential costs of providing digital services to all Australians. The industry outcry came after Senator Alston appeared to undermine a report presented to him by a committee he appointed to consider upgrading the telephone service. Senator Alston upset committee members when he issued a statement appearing to endorse Professor Ergas' comments. The managing director of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, Mr Allan Horsley, said the Minister risked losing the ""confidence of the industry if he ignored a substantial body of work undertaken over a reasonable period of time"". There you have it-an industry reacting with complete shock to the government's intention to walk away from the promises which the Prime Minister gave the National Farmers Federation before the last election. The last point, the fourth point, I want to touch on before finishing concerns the government's refusal to honour the Prime Minister's guarantee that no charge would be introduced for directory assistance. Before the last election, the coalition promised to make sure that there would be no charges for directory assistance for local calls, long distance calls or international calls. It was a clear promise in the policy released by the Prime Minister and Senator Alston, and it is a promise that the government has obviously been discussing with Telstra. The government has obviously been trying to work out a way that it can break that assurance given to the Australian people before the last election. The difficulty for the Prime Minister is that it has been a bad week. He forgot about the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) briefing him about Senator Woods, he forgot about coming out against work for the dole when he was on Lateline in 1991-92 and today he was faced with the difficulty of admitting that he forgot that he had also told the House in June last year that he would not allow the introduction of charging for directory assistance. Senator Alston, I understand, was asked a question about the same issue earlier today. It is on the front page of every newspaper in the country today and all Senator Alston could say was, 'There is no formal proposal before the government.' I would like to know how many times Senator Alston has discussed the introduction of charges for directory assistance with Telstra staff. I will bet it is more than a dozen times. I would like to know why Senator Alston did not say to Mr Blount, 'There is no way we can do that, Frank. We promised the people before the last election there would be no charges for directory assistance', the first time Frank Blount raised the issue with him. I wonder how many times Senator Alston discussed the proposed introduction of directory assistance charges with Mr Blount and Telstra staff after June, when the Prime Minister had given his solemn word in this chamber that the government would not introduce charging for directory assistance. I will bet it was at least more than half a dozen times. Mr Kelvin Thomson-Not just Andrew Robb; the Prime Minister.",106
245,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"Not just Andrew Robb, but the Prime Minister, as my colleague interjectsMr Billson interjecting",112
246,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"You reckon it is justifiable in those circumstances to break your promises and for the Prime Minister to break his word. I am glad the Prime Minister did not take your advice, and I am glad that the Prime Minister was forced into a humiliating backdown not just on the proposal to move the Speaker's chairMr Ronaldson-I rise on a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, the member is straying well away from the matter of the bill.",112
247,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"On the point of order: the member for Ballarat obviously has not seen part (d) of the opposition's second reading amendment. Having been embarrassed to back down on the Speaker's chair, today we also get a backdown from the Prime Minister on the introduction of charging for directory assistance. What we want to know is why did it take a story appearing on the front page of every newspaper in the country to force the government to teIl Telstra that this was not on. Why didn't Senator Alston tell Frank Blount the first time he raised this issue that it was not on? Why didn't Senator Alston tell Frank Blount it was not on after the Prime Minister had given his word in this House that the government would not aIlow charging for directory assistance? It is quite clear that there have been negotiations between this government and Telstra about how to introduce these charges. Having had the Prime Minister on two occasions tell this House that charging for directory assistance will not be introduced, I would like to see a similar statement from Senator Alston. It would really make our day if we could get slippery Senator Alston to also agree to put on record his commitment that he will resign as minister if there is ever a charge introduced for directory assistance. We will make sure that the pressure is kept on this government to make sure that ordinary Australians do not have to pay for directory assistance. This attempted plan by Telstra to offer people a $5 discount on their rental charges to make up for the introduction of a 50c charge for every call made to directory assistance for a number in the White Pages is just ridiculous. It is ridiculous because it would not take long for Telstra to claw that money back through increases in quarterly rentals, but that directory assistance charge would be there forever. We are pleased that the government has been forced to back down. They have been embarrassed into backing down on the Speaker's chair, they have been embarrassed into backing down on directory assistance charges, and we can give them the promise that at any future time they raise this matter we will keep the pressure up because we believe it is a measure that should not be imposed on residential customers. For all of those reasons, the opposition does remain committed to the introduction of fuIl and open competition in telecommunications. We remain concerned about the major changes that the government has made, particularly to the intentions on powers and immunities for carriers. We think it is outrageous that the government has walked away from the promises that were given to people, such as the promise to the National Farmers Federation and farmers to provide the latest high speed digital connections through ISDN. We want to ensure that wherever Australians may live, whether it is Ballarat, Launceston or suburban Melbourne and Sydney, people will receive those reductions in local caIl charges that will flow from competition. If Optus Vision's local calI service on its pay TV network results in price cuts in Hunters Hill and the Prime Minister's electorate, we think that it would be a good thing if Telstra tried to match those price cuts. If Telstra cuts its local caIl charges in Hunters Hill, I want to see price cuts for local caIl charges in my own electorate of the Central Coast. I would like to see them in the electorate of BaIlarat, where the shadow cabinet is heading on Monday. We would like to make sure that the electors of Ballarat also benefit from any price reductions that the residents of Hunters Hill might enjoy. We will be very disturbed if the member for Ballarat, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), who is at the table, is not also concerned and is not working hard in the background trying to ensure that his constituents also benefit from any price reductions. Mr Ronaldson-Always working hard, Michael.",112
248,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"We know he is also working hard in the background. We just hope he might be successful on this. For these reasons, we will not be opposing the legislation. Through this second reading amendment we are seeking to make sure that our concerns are raised in this chamber with the intention that the government can respond to them.",113
249,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Kelvin Thomson-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,113
250,Mr BILSON,PAIRS,"Dunkley) (6.21 p.m.)Those opposite can rightly lament the contribution from the shadow minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), for had he shown any interest in the material that was available to him he would have found that most of his questions were answered, perhaps with the exception of those he raised out of sheer curiosity. The 11 telecommunications bills before the House today fulfil the coalition's pre-1996 election promise of putting the needs of my Dunkley community and other Australians first. Half the people in the world have never made a telephone call. Australia has about 52 fixed telephones and 16 mobile phones for every 100 residents. In 1996, 96.7 per cent of Victorian residents had a telephone connection. The rating agency Standard and Poor's has claimed that the Australian telecommunications industry would have a $30 billion annual turnover by the year 2004. This sector is demonstrably a big deal to our economy. The overall market in telecommunications traffic is still growing strongly. Communications charges account for a growing proportion of most small businesses' costs. Emerging telecommunications technology is revolutionising the way small businesses operate and people recreate. Proprietors and households want to see the promises of competition delivered to them in terms of reduced costs and widening product choice. The phased introduction of competition in telecommunications, commencing with an industry regulator in 1989, has brought benefits but has some way to go. I acknowledge the 1991 comment of the then Minister for Transport and Communications, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley: . . . the creation of one strong competitor is the best way of achieving genuine and strong competition quickly in a market the size of Australia's. It is true that we do now have a viable and strong multi-service competitor to Telstra in Optus Communications and a third established player in the mobile market in Vodafone. This has produced some gains. It is time that we opened up the telecommunications market further. Call rates to both Australian and overseas long distance destinations have come down although the coalition's election document Better Communications stated that local call charges under Labor remained among the highest in the world. In 1995 Australia still ranked 11 th out of 24 OECD countries when comparing a basket of all calls and service charges, a ranking unchanged since 1989. Our competitive position will improve only if we secure gains at a faster rate than the nations we compete with for investment and trade. Clearly, under Labor the 8,000 small businesses in Dunkley were not getting even close to a competitive trading boost from telecommunications competition. This package heralds a host of benefits targeted at the consumers beyond the imperative produced by the Telecommunications Act 1991, sun setting on 30 June this year. We observed telecommunications competition finding its feet and getting used to the light and, to the previous government's credit, without them making too much of a mess of it. Now we must move forward. That is what this package of legislation is about, heralding in long awaited opportunities and the promise that a new era of telecommunications competition presents-an era of regulatory framework more concerned with delivering benefits of a competitive sector to consumers than chaperoning in the forms of technology is what this government is offering. These bills also address some of the deficiencies of Labor's technology first policy approach to competition in the telecommunications sector. Let me provide some evidence. Small businesses in Dunkley regard the telephone as a lifeline. About the only thing worse than having a telephone out of order for more than half a day is having an incorrect entry in the phone directory. Under the 1991 regime, Telstra manages to connect only 76 per cent of new requested business services on or before the agreed commencement date. Only 57 percent of metropolitan or residential telephone service faults are cleared within one working day of notification. Although the figure is clearly up for business faults, at 79 per cent, after two days eight cent of business faults in metropolitan areas still have not been rectified. It also concerns me that over the past five years Telstra's fault clearance record has generally been on a downward trend. Costs have to keep falling. Residents of Dunkley by the bay demand it. Small and large businesses alike are calling for it and the government is facilitating price reductions. If call costs other charges for telecommunications decrease our businesses have a better chance of staying in business and we can attract an increasing share of the region's corporate headquarters and service sector activities. More open competition will help to ensure our telecommunications costs do not become grossly unattractive compared with what is charged in Singapore and Hong Kong. The entry of new Australian and international carriers and service providers, either in their own right through equity interests or via interconnect and strategic alliances with offshore providers, will provide an added boost to our already vibrant telecommunications equipment and content industry. Helen Meredith, in a special Australian Financial Review article of 9 September 1996, drew attention to the telecommunications equipment sector as the star performer of manufacturing, with $4.5 billion in sales in 1995 and a 33 per cent increase in exports since 1990, to $1 billion annually. At six per cent of revenue, telecommunications technology supplies outpace the national average for business R&D expenditure and leave the one per cent average for manufacturing far behind. Carrier licences will be available to providers of carriage free of network roll-out obligations. Carrier industry development plans will encourage further strategic planning and investment in a manner driven by the businesses' market and commercial imperatives. Subject to meeting the requirements of a light-handed service provider regulatory regime, content and service providers can be assured of access to carriage within a framework of commercially reasonable terms and conditions. Seamless interconnect capabilities will be mandated by industry driven access per codes backed up by clear rights of arbitration available to all parties on matters of price, conduct and access standards. The words of part 4 of the coalition's 1996 communications election promise define and differentiate the government's approach from what has preceded it. It is worth recalling: . .. the objective of telecommunications policy should be to give Australians a world class teleand communications industry, not only in terms of technology, but also pricing and quality of service. The coalition's changes to the laws governing telecommunications are unashamedly customer focused. The government has decided that the industry not only will be subject to general trade practices laws contained in part 4 of the Trade Practices Act but also will have additional industry specific regulations overseen by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Where competition is substantially lessened, the ACCC will be able to issue what is called a competition notice. If a carrier or service provider continues to engage in anti-competitive conduct, it will face onerous civil penalties or the threat of private action for damages. This is great news for consumers. Dominant service providers and carriers may also be required to file their tariffs with the ACCC and to keep records and report on their conduct against the access code and towards competing and related industry parties. These rules will all expire on 1 July 2000, to allow an assessment by the government before that date as to how effective they have proven to be and whether further changes are required to produce open and competitive market conditions. This package includes a world class comprehensive consumer protection regime that leaves the previous government's so-called 99-principles proposal back in the analog era. The coalition's universal service regime provides greater scope to upgrade obligations and to increase the flexibility and contestability of usa provision by providers. Remote and rural communities will not be left behind in the era of open competition in telecommunications. Beyond the usa regime the government has the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund initiative, price control and consumer guarantees to ensure that non-metropolitan Australia benefits. The Australian Communications Authority, which combines the former umpire Austel with the Spectrum Management Agency, able to set enforceable standards for customer connection time, the rectification of faults the keeping of appointments to meet with customers. I draw the attention of the House to the continuation of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The incumbent, Mr intentions John Pinnock, does a very good job with constituent problems generally addressed with little fuss and in a professional and responunnecessary sible manner. The bill also ensures that customers will continue to enjoy access directory assistance services, operator serme vices, itemised billing, preferred carrier selection and override capability, and privacy protection for their personal information. The Australian Communications Authority will be required to monitor the performance of carriers and service providers each year and to report findings to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. The regulatory framework provides many opportunities for public involvement. The untimed local call obligation not only has been retained but also has been extended. Business consumers now have the legislative right to untimed local voice calls. Residential customers will have their current entitlement to untimed voice calls preserved, reinforced and extended to include untimed non-voice data and facsimile traffic where this can be accommodated using the standard telephone service. Price controls will continue to apply to Telstra at least until 1999, including a cap on local call prices and a basket of services. But for many people in Dunkley by the bay the sharp edge of telecommunications regulation relates to the powers and immunities granted to carriers. When Labor introduced the original legislation in 1991, the sixth general principle of the bill was: . . . it gives the carriers, on an equal footing, certain exclusive rights and powers. These include rights to install certain types of telecommunications facilities; and certain powers in relation to land and immunity from laws. The national code that attempted to guide carrier behaviour under the previous government, in the absence of state local land use planning and development controls, was clearly deficient. It lacked teeth and was is excessively skewed to the advantage of carriers. It was thick on procedural steps but and wafer thin in terms of encouraging better network deployment outcomes. Residents were upset that the carriers did not comply with the spirit of the law or, better still, the of the code. Instead, mobile phone towers were erected and pay TV cables deployed in many areas at the expense of an loss of visual and neighbourhood the amenity. The member for Flinders, who was to just giving me some encouragement, reminds of a situation in Somerville where we had two towers side by side providing the largest goalposts that I have seen on the Mornington Peninsula. That outcome was delivered under the former Labor government's regime. Mr Jull-Outrageous!",113
251,Mr BILSON,PAIRS,"Outrageous! Despite a few rehashes and the 30 June 1993 assurance from the then Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell, that its 'new and stringent code seeks to balance the rights of carriers and the consumers with the importance of protecting the environment', Labor fumbled the issue of powers and immunities. It took a coalition government to respond to the legitimate community concerns. We have once again been left to clean up the mess. Twenty-one improvements have been made to Labor's lax arrangements to produce a new code with some real teeth. Far greater attention has been given to amenity considerations and increased local control. The available time does not permit me to detail the significant enhancements that aim to genuinely balance the rights of residents to have their visual amenity protected and the demand of local students, residences and businesses to have access to exciting new technologies. Time also does not permit me to recall how the former minister fumbled and mucked around with this particular situation, delaying and procrastinating until it would be dealt with after the federal election. Clearly that gives an indication of what Labor would have delivered to the Australian community. While regularly being an advocate of the cause of local government, I have to disagree with the Australian Local Government Association's criticisms of the new code. The code is, by any measure, a substantial improvement on what has existed to date. Well before this House rose in 1996, the Minister for Communications and the Arts recognised the need to inform state governments that their land use planning laws could enable standard approvals processes to be applied to telecommunications infrastructure as is provided under the new code. I informed my local councils of the need to provide for the significant increase in local control within their own planning schemes and to develop local planning guidelines which carriers need to take into account. The ball is clearly now not in the Commonwealth's court, given that the greater local control that has been sought is facilitated by this legislation and the new code. Streamlining approvals for low impact facilities is a carrot to carriers to do the right thing and work to amenity friendly facility designs and configurations. I encourage those with a particular view on what should constitute low impact facilities to contribute fully to Austel's public inquiry into this matter. I particularly encourage the member for Dobell, given that he appears to have some views on that subject. Allowing standard normal land use planning regimes to apply to telecommunications with limited reserve powers to the Commonwealth is not a new concept. The bill requires carriers to first argue for the approval of their facility on amenity grounds. If unsuccessful on amenity grounds, scope is provided for the carrier to argue the case for their facility against national interest tests. While some argue these national interest tests grounds are lax, others claim these arrangements are too stringent and will freeze out new carriers. It sounds like the government has got the balance pretty right from that critique from both sides of the argument. The nomination of a minimum cable diameter before a council has the power to veto a rollout seeks to ensure that people are not needlessly denied access to the standard telephone service which this package mandates as the right of all Australians. This provision is not some Machiavellian plot to enable broadband carriers to slip under this minimum and roll over local communities to roll out new pay TV cable or the like. I say to my local government friends and to the Dunkley community: let us give this new regime a go. I say to the member for Dobell-he has had some experience in this field-how about contributing to the debate and the shape the telecommunications regulatory regime will be beyond 30 June? If the package fails to fulfil its stated intentions and legitimate community concerns, or the worthwhile public policy objectives articulated by the government, I will be willing to go into bat to argue for the necessary changes. But let's give it a go. Labor, through its shadow spokesman, have offered nothing towards what the industry structure should look like beyond 30 June. In fact, I think Hansard might reflect only a handful of paragraphs in which the member for Dobell actually referred to what is in the package. I would certainly encourage him to acquaint himself with the material. He might find it quite enlightening, particularly in responding to many of the questions he asked which are very clearly dealt with in the material that is available to him. This package of bills takes Australia into a new era where competition is not an end in itself but one where delivering the benefits of competition to Australia and its businesses and citizens is the focus of the regulatory framework. These bills give the industry the confidence to expand and invest and contain comprehensive legislative safeguards for consumers. This package facilitates openended competition, which is the No. 1 driving force that will improve the quality and range of services that are available, and continue to bring the real cost of telecommunications down. This package is good news for consumers, investors, businesses and households. It is good for the economy and continuing jobs growth within the sector. I urge honourable members to reject the opposition's amendment as a pathetic and pointless contribution to the debate about what shape telecommunications regulations should be beyond 30 June, and commend these bills to the House. Debate interrupted. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Hollows, Ms Gabi",115
252,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I seek the indulgence of the House, Mr Deputy Speaker. At question time today the member for Melbourne addressed a question to me concerning a letter written by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to a member of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. I said in response that I would investigate the matter and take whatever action is appropriate. The clear thrust of the question was that in some way the letter represented a breach of section 73 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. I have obtained an opinion from Mr H. Burmester, the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's Department, and I will read that advice and then table it, together with an attachment: You have asked for advice as to whether or letter signed by the Minister for Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Affairs on 6 May addressed to Ms G Hollows gives any cause for concern that an offence may thereby have been committed against Section 73 of the Crimes Act 1914, or any other provision of that Act, or any provision of any other Act of the Parliament. Section 73 has, in my opinion, no application to the facts and circumstances set out in that letter. Additionally, in my opinion, there is no other provision of that or any other Act which would apply. Accordingly, I consider that there is nothing contained in the letter which would make it necessary or appropriate for the matter to be referred either to the Australian Federal Police for consideration of investigation, or to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of prosecution. In addition, I was asked whether the behaviour of the minister, or indeed of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, represented any breach of the ministerial guidelines. I have perused those guidelines again and I am satisfied, on the information given to me by the two ministers, that their conduct in this matter has not breached those guidelines. Could I additionally state that, prior to coming into the House, attempts were made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as a matter of courtesy, to contact Ms Hollows because it was my intention, as it is necessary given the nature of the advice, to table the letter from Senator Herron to her to inform her that that was going to occur. Unfortunately, in the time available he was not able to reach her, although I understand a fax is being sent to her to advise her of it. I would also add that, in all of the circumstances, the contribution that has been made to the Australian community by her is appreciated. I simply emphasise again that any suggestion of any breach of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, any suggestion of any breach of any other Commonwealth act, is absolutely repudiated and destroyed by the independent opinion of the Chief General Counsel. I am also absolutely satisfied, on the advice given not a to me by the two ministers, that there has and been no breach of ministerial guidelines. I 1996 and table the opinion and the letter.

253,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,"I want to deal with a number of issues raised by the Telecommunications Bill 1996. The first one I want to cover is one that, I dare say, will not be referred to by other members of the House for the simple reason that they probably will not have encountered this particular problem. We are discussing here, as well as the telecommunications legislation, the Radiocommunications Amendment Bill 1996, the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1996 and the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1996. These bills provide that the existing agency, the Spectrum Management Agency, will, as part of the proposed post-1997 changes in regulation of telecommunications in Australia, merge with the telecommunications regulator, Austel, to form the Australian Communications Authority, or ACA. Presently, the Spectrum Management Agency is a Commonwealth statutory agency within the portfolio of Communications and the Arts. It was established by the Radiocom1996 munications Act 1992 and its primary function is to manage and allow access to the radio frequency spectrum. Technically, that spectrum is the range of frequencies used in radiocommunications. In such a vast continent as Australia, radio based communications are essential for industry, safety and telecommunications, as well as providing important cultural and recreational services. Australia depends on effective and efficient access to and management of that spectrum. The Spectrum Management Agency and the 1996 Australian Broadcasting Authority are responsible for the FM radio channels 86.7 and 88.0. They relate to a set of frequencies the ABA has made available for low power, open narrowcast services around Australia on a first come, first served basis. These licences are issued under a streamline procedure which assumes certain technical criteria will, in most cases, allow the operation of a maximum of two transmitters in an area without interference to existing services. The broadcasting power level is set at one watt maximum in residential areas-lO watts in rural and remote areas-and the antenna height is limited to a maximum of 10 metres above average terrain level. At least 10 kilometres must separate transmitters operating on the same frequency-for example, 88FM. In general, these arrangements allow a good signal to be received out to a twokilometre radius from a one-watt transmitter site under normal conditions. Any person may apply for a transmitter licence to operate an open narrowcast service. By far the most common purpose for which these licences are employed is to provide tourist information radio, especially in regional areas. I found these things out after I wrote to the Australian Broadcasting Authority inquiring about the broadcasting activities of a Mr Neil Thomas, who set up his own church in 1978 after being sacked by the Overseas Mission Service International and the Wesleyan Methodist Church when money he was responsible for went missing. I will tell the House more about Mr Thomas shortly. The Australian Broadcasting Authority advised me, in response to my inquiries, that their records showed a number of licences originally issued to applicants denoting their proposed narrowcast services as religious or Christian. They attached a schedule of those licences and advised me that a total of 1,124 such licences had been issued, 249 for transmitters in the state of Victoria. Those licences are current for one year and are renewable and transferable. Licence holders may also authorise third parties to operate their transmitters. Authorised users have to comply with the licence conditions, including that the service be open narrowcast. There is, however, importantly, no obligation on licence holders to advise the relevant Commonwealth authorities-the ABA and the Spectrum Management Agency-if a licence is transferred or if a third party authorisation is given. Given these factors, neither the Australian Broadcasting Authority nor the Spectrum Management Agency will necessarily be aware of the current licence holder of every licence issued nor the specific type or content of the service that is being provided. The Australian Broadcasting Authority provided me with a list of licences of this character which they had issued. Most of the licences said to be of a religious or Christian character had been issued to a company by the name of Gospel Across Australia-one of the companies associated with Mr Neil Thomas. The contact name is Mr Jason Lee and there is a post office box number in Brunswick West. I can assure the House that if any of these stations get into any difficulty that post office box number will disappear very smartly. Gospel Across Australia has licences for: Emerald, Queensland; Murgon, Queensland; Taylors Lakes, Victoria; Beaudesert, Queensland; Blackwater, Queensland; Broughton, Victoria; Cloncurry, Queensland; Dalby, Queensland; Katherine, Northern Territory; Morphett Vale, South Australia; Moura, Queensland; Mount Morgan, Queensland; and Yeppoon, Queensland.The ABA notes that services provided under class licences, because of their specialised, closely targeted and limited nature, have significantly less power to influence when compared with commercial broadcasting services. They nevertheless indicate that their approach is designed to protect the public interest. I have been told that Mr Neil Thomas has been seeking out these licences on a grand scale. It has been said to me that Neil Thomas Ministries representatives claim to have access to 400 such licences and to have lodged an order for 400 transmitters, which could be right, given the capacity of these licences to be subleased. Even given the narrow range of each transmitter, it is not unreasonable to believe that Mr Thomas could reach a potential audience of up to, or even in excess of, one million people. If Mr Thomas has the potential to be something of a media baron, what kind of man is he? What kind of character checks would he pass? The fact is that Mr Thomas and companies associated with his church-a church which belongs to him and is accountable to no-one else-have since 1980 raked up debts to individuals, companies and the taxpayer in excess of $2 million. In 1980, Mr Thomas set up a building project referred to as Orrniso Valley just south of Canberra near Hall. It collapsed with the South Pacific Evangelical Fellowship owing creditors $250,000. In 1987, Mr Thomas personally filed a part 10 bankruptcy statement with debts of $212,000. Since then, other companies of which he has personally been a director or other members of his church have been directors have constantly gone broke. A company called NSC left behind debts of $600,000, including massive liabilities to the tax office and Telecom. Cowman College left behind debts of $515,000 and Laindon left behind debts of $100,000. A Croydon confectionary manufacturer, Sloane Enterprises, went to the Supreme Court to try to recover a debt of $330,000 from Lexvale, another enterprise of Mr Thomas and his members. As a result of his business ventures, many individuals, companies and taxpayers are owed massive sums of money. It does not simply stop at financial affairs. I have to say that Mr Thomas is active in America, where I understand he is presently residing, and in Vanuatu. For a time he was banned in Vanuatu because of his activities. I understand that more recently he has been allowed to re-enter. He is said to go around Vanuatu with a man he claims to have raised from the dead. This is the kind of person we are dealing with. In June 1991, a fire destroyed a hall owned by the Grace Church, which is the name Neil Thomas gave to his church at that stage. This hall was next to the Grace Church in Balmoral A venue, Pascoe Vale. The arson squad investigated. Several years later a long-term member of the church confessed to having lit the fire in association with Mr Robert Gelsi, another Grace Church member, on the orders of Neil Thomas. This was reported to the arson squad, which conducted investigations and interviewed Mr Gelsi and Mr Thomas. He was a hard man to interview because he was spending a lot of his time in America. The arson squad did not proceed to lay charges because Mr Gelsi and Mr Thomas backed up each other's stories and there was a problem with motive. The hall was uninsured. My sources within the church say the hall was uninsured due to a keystone cops type bungle with Mr Thomas's son, Peter, believing that their accountant, Tom Griffiths, had insured the building while Mr Griffiths believed Peter Thomas had done so. The significant point is that Neil Thomas believed the building to be insured and, in any event, why would a church member confess if he was not guilty? I know who I believe was responsible for the fire. More recently, I have been contacted by a young man concerned that Neil Thomas and his pastors are encouraging social security fraud. This young man went guarantor for rent on a property in Pascoe Vale. He ended up being left with debts of $3,000 because he was a guarantor in relation to the rent at that property. Not only is he irate about that; he is most concerned that many members of the church, young people in particular, receive social security benefits-I have asked Coburg Social Security to investigate this matterwhile still working for Neil Thomas based enterprises such as Neil Thomas Ministries Engineering, his confectionary company and so on. In my view, this is not a church; it is a money making machine and a front organisation for a parasite who fastens himself and his pastors to families, some of whom have very deep and very genuine religious convictions. Sometimes these families have personal problems or have suffered serious tragedies and this man tears families apart and bleeds them until they are destitute. The church in fact receives hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from its adherents, but it is perpetually broke and all its ventures have failed. It preaches the sanctity of marriage, but it causes marriages to breakdown. It says you should not live with ungodly people so, if your husband or wife cannot be converted to the church, you should leave them. It preaches the gospel, but its senior pastor has bodyguards who threaten anyone who stands in the church's way. It is an ugly fraud. I would seek from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) rules regarding the granting of open narrowcast licences and checks to ensure that people cannot get monopolies or large collections of these licences so we do not find these airwaves being taken over by Jimmy Swaggart type phoneys. Indeed, Mr Thomas has links with Mr Swaggart, and I have no doubt he has fantasies about becoming an Australian tele-evangelist. The second issue I want to raise concerning this legislation is the propriety of this bill's being here in the first place. It follows on from the government's legislation to sell off one-third of Telstra. We have learnt in the House in the last couple of days that this bill was in tum able to get through the Senate following a set of events as follows. On 21 October, Independent Senator Mal Colston's original request for an upgrade worth some $23,000 for a staffer went to Senator Margaret Reid. On 31 October, Senator Reid wrote back to Senator Colston saying she was very reluctant to seek the approval of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), which was not surprising in all the circumstances, as she had left a similar position in her own office unfilled in order to save money. On 15 November, at Senator Colston's insistence, she wrote to the Prime Minister conveying the Colston request, but pointing out that she had left a similar position in her office unfilled to save money and she asked for extra money, if the Prime Minister agreed to the Colston request. On 29 November, however, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff wrote to Senator Reid's office saying the upgrade had been approved. On 4 December, Senator Reid wrote to the Prime Minister saying the total cost to the Senate budget could be up to $65,000 and requested extra money. On 10 December, Prime Minister Howard wrote to Senator Reid saying he would consider extra money in future years and a day later the Telstra sale passed in the Senate. Together with other matters that have been brought out in question time today, these are matters of great concern as to the propriety of this bill being here. The third issue I want to raise relates to that issue of directory assistance. It is a matter of great concern that Telstra has announced that it intends to introduce a SOc charge for calls to the 013 directory assistance number. I point out to the House that the coalition promised in its January 1996 policy document, Better Communications: A Coalition Government will not permit carriers to charge for operator assisted calls and will set an overall requirement that 90 per cent of all operator assisted calls be answered within ten seconds. This requirement will cover directory assistance, emergency calls, long distance and international calls and fault reporting. In stark contrast to this very clear, unequivocal policy commitment, the package of bills before the House contains no reference to the provision of free directory assistance. The only reference to directory assistance is in schedule 2 of the Telecommunications Bill, which sets out the standard service provider rules. So this legislative requirement is clearly not enough to prevent Telstra charging a SOc fee or, indeed, any other fee for directory assistance. I point out that the introduction of fees for directory assistance will specifically disadvantage the elderly, including those with poor eyesight, and other customers who are unable to use a telephone book. This is a matter of great concern to the opposition. We believe that Telstra's directory services are highly profitable without their charging for calls and we believe that benefit should carry with it a responsibility to provide free directory assistance services. We will, therefore, endeavour to amend the bills accordingly in the Senate. The fourth issue that I want to raise concerns the telecommunications national code. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Billson), made reference to the issue of overhead cables and mobile phone towers. This has been an issue of great concern in my electorate and in other electorates also. It is a matter of great concern to us that the code which the government has recently introduced is quite inadequate. It replaces the former code, which had been in operation since mid-1995. When the former code was introduced, there was no reference to broadband cables as it was not envisaged that cables would be used to establish pay TV in Australia. As a result, that code was inadequate in terms of requiring the carriers to follow accountable processes and in assisting councils to make an environmental assessment of the establishment of telecommunications infrastructure. This revised code, which came into operation from 1 January this year, is fundamentally flawed. It does not address the major concerns of local government or of local communities, and most of the changes included in the new code under the guise of applying a stricter regime are essentially cosmetic. It fails to provide any real mechanism for councils to exert influence over aerial broadband cables and towers and there are many loopholes for carriers to exploit. For example, the code defines low impact facilities to include towers with collocated antennae and most aerial cabling in industrial and rural areas. The code restricts requirements for undergrounding of cables to very limited circumstances--essentially when there is no other overhead cabling in an area at all. Conversely, carriers appear to be able to go overhead if they can find any existing aerial cabling of another carrier or public utility. Its provisions on notification and consultation in the final analysis mean that carriers can ignore community views in virtually all circumstances provided they go through the motions. The time frames for notification and consultation are very short indeed. In addition, it should be noted that the carriers' exemptions from state and territory laws have been extended from 1 July to 30 September this year for cables and to 31 December thi""s year for towers. These are matters of great consternation and concern in my electorate. The code faIls far short of providing an acceptable framework for the instaIlation of telecommunications facilities. It would appear that it is the government's intention to ensure a roIlout for the carriers at the expense of environmental considerations and community consultation. The extension to the state and territory laws exemptions will mean that the carriers have been given a reprieve so that most of the telecommunications infrastructure such as aerial broadband cables and telecommunications towers will be established. What is needed, firstly, is greater powers for local government in relation to the planning issues and, secondly, the banging together of the heads of carriers like Optus and Telstra to make use of the capacity which we have to underground facilities. (Time expired)",118
254,Mr HARDGRAVE,RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,"The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) is making my heart bleed tonight with his protestations about the inadequacy of the legislation before us. He is a current representative of the party which formed a government in this country for 13 years but which did nothing to address the issues being addressed in this bill. I would also like to look at one of the other matters he raised in his contributi0n. I think it is quite outrageous that tonight he has tried to continue with this nonsense about Telstra allegedly wanting a SOc charge on directory assistance calls. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) clearly knocked that on the head in question time today. I admit those opposite choose to tune out on these particular matters, but I find it absolutely outrageous of them to attempt to scare particularly older Australians. Their comments are aimed towards older Australians each and every time they bring these sorts of matters up, and I find it absolutely indefensible of the member for Wills to get up here tonight and attempt to perpetrate this sort of nonsense and this sort of scare campaign particularly directed at older Australians. It is quite simple-the Prime Minister knocked it on the head in question time today, and government members will ensure this sort of nonsense will get buried, which is where it should be, and where the cables running around this country should be-buried. As far as the contribution of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) is concerned, as an exminister in the area we are discussing today, in Yes, Minister parlance his was a 'very courageous' contribution: to spend his time defending the regime which he administered in part I found a very courageous decision indeed. Essentially we have a 'not quite as good as it should be' telecommunications regime, particularly as far as infrastructure is concerned in this country. This biII before us tonight is part of a package of 11 bills which together will provide for the establishment of the new competitive telecommunications era which begins on 1 July this year. This legislation will go a long way towards fixing the blighted legacy which the previous Labor government left us. It will do this by repealing the 1991 Telecommunications Act introduced by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he had responsibility for this area. It will enable real and open competition in telecommunications and establish a worldclass consumer protection framework which the previous government promised but-guess what-did not deliver. They never quite got around to it. Firstly, the Australian Communications Authority Bill 1996 will establish the Australian Communications Authority. It will merge Austel with the Spectrum Management Agency and this new body will manage the radio frequency spectrum, administer licensing of carriers and administer consumer and technical issues relating to telecommunications. This particular bill will also enable the administrafor tion of all competitive regulation in Australia's telecommunications industry to transfer to the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. There are three other bills, the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Bill 1996, the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Bill 1996 and the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Bill 1996. Each will provide for relevant taxing arrangements under the new regime. The transitional arrangements which started on 1 January and go right through to 1 July will be facilitated by the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996. It will also provide for the continuwhich ation of some existing regulatory arrangements after that date pending the introduction of these various new ones. The last three bills in the package of 11 before us are the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Termination Bill 1996, the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1996 and the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1996. Altogether these bills deal with the transitional arrangements for carrier licence fees and amendments to radiocommunications tax legislation which will apply once this ACA mechanism is actually up and running. These various reforms were foreshadowed in the government's pre-election statement 'Better Communications' and since then we have further refined them through a process of public consultation which has involved various members across the government parties talking with people in their constituentions cies. In particular, as secretary of the government's communications policy committee of the backbench, I also participated in this process and worked with the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), along with colleagues, in shaping the final outcomes which have resulted in the legislation which is before us today. I should take a moment to congratulate the minister on his consultative approach with the backbench committee on these various bills. The chairman of the committee, the member Hinkler (Mr Neville), should be congratulated for his role in ensuring the voices of private members representing the real concerns of their constituents were heard, which was certainly not the case in the previous government. The member for Dunkley (Mr Billson)-a good contribution tonight-the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) and, in particular, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) should also be congratulated for their very effective advocacy on the concerns of local residents. Each of these members and so many others vocalised the concerns of their constituents and offered solutions to the minister, and they were listened to. It is hard, though, to have all the results we wanted to have. In a sense, because of the ineffective regime put in place by the previous government, a lot of what we need to do in this country today is all a little bit too late. The horses have well and truly bolted. The previous government left us with a situation where, effectively, two tonnes of cure were needed to address the problems which a simple ounce of prevention would have addressed back in 1991 if the Labor Party had bothered to do their job properly. I believe these bills before us tonight prove this new government has made some progress in the massive task of fixing up the mess which Labor created in telecommunications infrastructure under Mr Beazley'S stewardship as minister back in 1991. Mr Jull-He was hopeless, wasn'the?",122
255,Mr HARDGRA VE,RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,"He was hopeless. I thank the minister for his comment. Based on his experience over a long period in this place and also his attachment to the telecommunicaindustry, I think the interjection from the minister carries a great deal of weight. There can be no doubt this legislation is a vast improvement on what the previous Labor government introduced in 1991. As I said before, it will bring in real and open competition in the telecommunications industry and real benefits to consumers in the form of improved service and choice. In a lot of ways, as I said, it has not gone far enough. I know the member for Moore (Mr Filing) believes this. We all have our concerns this has not gone as far as a lot of people in this country would have liked. A lot of people in this country would have liked us to go into a very expensive exercise of undoing the visual pollution caused by the previous government's lacklustre approach. From what the member for Dobell has said, perhaps they had a could-not-care-less approach to telecommunications infrastructure in this country. Mr Billson-They can't work it out.",123
256,Mr HARDGRAVE,RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,"Exactly. They are not really sure exactly what they have created. Back in 1991 the previous government laid down the ground rules for the industry. It had a unique opportunity to insist that Telstra-or Telecom OTe as it was called then-actually shared its existing and future underground cabling infrastructure with industry newcomers, such as Optus. But did they take it up? No, they let the tail wag the dog and allowed Telstra to dictate what the ground rules were going to be, which left competitors like Optus-its only really big competitorboth figuratively and literally up in the air. It was the only place Optus could really its cables and still compete with the established Telecom-Telstra infrastructure. Telstra said to the government at the time, 'We're not going to share our underground infrastructure. We're not going to assist in making sure, from the national good point of view, infrastructure is available to competitors. We don't care about the social good.' Yet the previous government specifically legislated to protect carriers from the abuse of market powers by other carriers by giving Austel, the telecommunications industry watchdog, a charter to promote competition. This watchdog had absolutely no teeth, even though the previous government insisted it had supplied it with a very effective set choppers. It was a lap-dog and not a watchdog. It has let down so many average Australians because the regime it operated under in Labor's legislation was insufficient. Mr Billson-It wasn't a poodle?",124
257,Mr HARDGRAVE,RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,"It was not a poodle. In fact, the current Leader of the Opposition, in his speech to the parliament as communications minister on 7 May 1991, said: Austel is, therefore, being given a clear mandate to create the conditions necessary for genuine and sustainable network competition between the carriers and is being authorised to take appropriate action to ensure that this occurs. Yet we had Telstra, in the reality of it all, for five or more years after, simply saying, 'No, we're not going to share infrastructure with the new competitor in the regime.' So much for ensuring real competition occurred; so much for ensuring the outcomes. As well, the now Leader of the Opposition said at the time: In developing its framework for reform, the Government has remained mindful of the social importance of telecommunications to Australian society. This government is certainly doing something about ensuring the social needs of Australia are well meet by the telecommunications industry. It was a 'never mind the quality, feel the width' kind of regime set up in 1991. It leaves you wondering just how come so many Australians have had to settle for less than the put best when it comes to our national telecommunications infrastructure which should have been established a far better way six years ago. The overhead cable rollout has effectively been a $4 billion duplication of existing infrastructure in this country. The Optus organisation was put in a position of a $4 billion spend to get cables up in the sky. I submit there are some virtues which can come from this duplication, but it is in effect a cost this country can nary afford. It would be like duplicating a four-lane Pacific Highway running through your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl. It would be like having two sets of four-lane Pacific Highways. What an of absolute farce; an absolute waste of money in the overall. It has resulted in so many people in my electorate of Moreton wondering why they have to welcome the introduction of this new competition and this new infrastructure by looking at cables stringing across their views. People in Wellers Hill, Moorooka and Tarragindi are wondering why their views of the city are being blotted by this large cable which has be-n put in by Optus. It is a blot on the landscape. It is, essentially, Beazley's blot on the landscape. I have seen some of the very worse examples of this aerial infrastructure cabling has gone wrong. The member for Dunkley has shown me some in, around and near his electorate. The member for North Sydney has done the same, as has the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes). As secretary of the backbench committee, I have made it my task to have a look at what some of my colleagues have been complaining about. Most of those complaints centre on the fact a lot of the contractors did not do their job properly and the cables were drooping all over the place. Where was Austel? Very quiet in the whole procedure. So many people in this country have been let down. This legislation before us tonight does so much to address some of the worse examples of this poor infrastructure installation. So many of these cables will be reviewed and fixed as a result. In my own electorate, I noticed one example just the other day at Cornwall Street and Ipswich Road at Annerley. It is obvious. The cable hangs so low. It is one of those that Optus will need to have a closer look at. There are some very bad cases that will be addressed as a result of bill. I must stress that Optus has copped the PR blame for all of this, and this has actually suited the TelstralLabor Party plan rather well. It really has, I think, been part of an overall master plan. The socialist left-which ran the Telstra unions and had so much influence on the previous government's decision making on this front-really have had a lot to do with ensuring that Telstra did very well, despite their apparent claim six years ago that they were setting up fair competition mechanisms. Through the course of this cable roll out and the introduction of competition, Telstra have acted like your typical corporate thug. They have acted like the bully on the beach. They have acted like the type of person who would stand on the top of a sandhill and kick sand in the face of anyone who came too close. In my own street, I do not have any choice. I do not have any competition. It is Foxtel or it is nothing. It is all underground cable. That is fine, but so much for competition. What did which the previous government deliver on this? It is important to emphasise that this is not just about pay television, although that has been the glamour item which has been talked about. After all, if this cable infrastructure was all about pay TV, we probably would have gone down the road of some encoded transmission infrastructure rather than cables. This is all about telephony. It is all about putting a second set of copper wires, a competitive set of copper wires, into every house in Australia. It is all about going to the core, to the heart, of the business of Telstra. This is why Telstra have fought so hard-and, in so many ways, so dirty-through the regime that the previous government set up. The previous government promised so much and, of course, they did not do enough. Looking back, and perhaps it is great to be wise in hindsight, it seems to me that the previous government could have used their relationship with the exclusive Telecom OTC organisation, as it was then, to look at the commencement of some sort of national cable this authority. They could have said, 'You have a social benefit to perform as a long held stakeholder in telecommunications in this country. You have a role to play in ensuring a competitive regime will work in this country, and our stated policies of telecommunications will actually occur by providing the infrastructure.' That is perhaps the way the previous government should have gone. They should have looked at establishing a standard cable system right throughout this countryMr Lee-A monopoly basically; a government monopoly.",124
258,Mr HARDGRA VE,RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,"They should have looked at a standard cable system right throughout the country, a standard authority, a government provider of infrastructure, a standard approach which typifies the development of this nation. The member for Dobell can protest and suggest monopoly, but that underscores the silliness of his contribution tonight in his defence of the previous government's regime. This country has been built on government inspired infrastructure. It is a fact that, in a country so large, so sparse and with such a small population, government does have a role to play in this, and the previous government did not do enough about it. They have left a big mess for us to fix-in fact, a $4 billion waste in expenditure in infrastructure in this country. That is $4 billion which could have been invested in some other areas or some better cases in this country. Overhead cables have now become a way of life for people in the three eastern states, and they are being installed currently in South Australia, in Adelaide. It would be wrong for the current government to now commit the sorts of funds needed to unpick the previous government's mistakes in this matter. So this legislation does not do anything about that, although it does look at the worse cases and it stipulates a rethink by the people who have installed the cable infrastructure. That is the good news about this legislation. It will force companies to fix the very worse cable mistakes that have been created as a result of the previous government's slack approach to this whole regime. The previous government promised a futuristic, world-class facility. They promised it but they did not deliver it. The future outlook appears very good as a result of this bill. It will provide real competithe tion. It will do something about removing some of the cabling and fixing others. It will provide a tougher regime in putting the powers back into the hands of local authorities and, as a consequence, to state government. Planning is a local government issue. Planning should be in the hands of local authorities, and that is what the previous government did not address. That is what this government is doing. There are so many hopes and aspirations for average Australians as far as what this bill does-and there are 21 examples of what this bill does. It does help so many Australians who wanted a better deal as far as telecommunications infrastructure was concerned. I back up the contribution made by the member for Dunkley some moments ago. It really is a case of give it a go and let me know. Those who are not happy with the results that come from this tougher regimethat is, the 21 tougher points that the companies are going to have to work within-are going to have to keep the feedback coming to members of the government parties and let us know exactly what we can do to try to improve the situation. We are looking to the future. We are looking to new technology. We are considering all of the aspects that are important to people we represent in this place. It is a pity the previous government failed to do that back in 1991.",125
259,Mr FILING,RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,"I feel very sorry sometimes for the backbench of the government-my former colleagues, in many instances-because sometimes you have to sell the unsell able. We all know that this new regime in relation to planning issues is not going to make any difference. It is going to make very little difference, as a matter of fact. Let me point out the main thing. There is a very good reason why the minister, the previous minister and .his predecessor gave such extraordinarily wide-ranging powers to the telecommunications carriers to construct telecommunications towers and lay cables without interference from local authorities. In effect, it was a very substantial net subsidy to carriers and, in the case of the sale of Telstra, is a very valuable part of the asset of Telstra. We can compare our telecommunications policy with those policies elsewhere in the world-particularly in the United States, although they are probably not the best role model for Australia because they have a much greater population. If you look at some of the problems affecting their telecommunications carriers in trying to get cable laying permission from local communities, there is a substantial difference. I was suggesting that what has happened is that the two major telecommunications carriers have had a very substantial net subsidy and, in the case of Telstra, a subsidy that is a very substantial asset. It is an asset the government hopes to realise from in order not only to fund its environmental package but also to write off some of the debts that have been incurred in the 13 years of Labor mismanagement of this country. I am happy to see here the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), because he has an extraordinary amount of expertise, in his former capacity as the Telecommunications Ombudsman, in dealing with all of the complaints, some of which I am going to talk about now in relation to telecommunications. In relation to his role as the Telecommunications Ombudsman, he would no doubt not only be fully aware of the shortcomings of the previous government's policies but also have a valuable insight into the shortcomings of the government's own legislation. The purpose of this legislation is to implement a new regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry. Obviously, a telecommunications industry framework is important because it sets a future for future telecommunications development not only in the telecommunications field but also in the other industries that rely so heavily on telecommunications. As we approach the age of the so-called information superhighway, there are going to be substantial flow-on effects not only in the core telecommunications industry but also in a whole range of industries which will probably touch every single aspect of our lives. It is of the utmost importance that we get this formula right. We have to ensure that the long-term view is taken in the best interests of all the people in Australia; that is, taken consideration of not only the likely proceeds of the sale of Telstra but also the best interests of the customer, the people who are going to be using telecommunications. I want to touch on a couple of areas, even though my time is going to be cut tonight and I will have to speak again. One of the things that interests me is the area of Internet access. One of the great concerns-a matter that I raised with the minister representing the minister for communications in a question without notice and that is still unsatisfactorily resolved, as he knows-is the question of the extraordinary conflict of interest that Telstra has as an Internet access provider, an Internet service provider and the carrier. We now have the basic prospect that we are going to see Telstra time charging Internet access providers. What this effectively means is that those Internet access providers are no longer going to be able to have a local call to their particular service centre-say, OzEmail-that may be in one of the capital cities or regional centres. Those service centres are going to have to bill their customers or the customers will be billed themselves for a timed call for the provision of the Internet access service. I would presume that that call charge will, in fact, occur at the Internet access service centre. This is a matter of grave concern to Internet users, to Internet access providers and to Internet service providers. It is a matter of grave concern, because this conflict of interest is an extraordinary one. I would say to the House that, if it were the United States, it would not occur. There would already be trade practices or monopoly arrangements made in order to prevent that sort of arrangement occurring where the carrier is providing the access service. It is an extraordinary situation, because the very companies with which Telstra are competing have to go to Telstra to get their cables. You do not have to be Albert Einstein to have worked out that, at the end of the day, Telstra is in a very high pressure competitive environment with Internet access providers. I am not making an allegation that they are in going to sit on the requests that they are getting for extra cables, but it puts them in an extraordinarily difficult position because they have this substantial conflict of interest. Some of the Internet access providers are requiring hundreds and hundreds of extra lines a week in order to take into account the extraordinary growth in the use of the Internet. This particular conflict of interest may well end up with the Internet access providers being forced to time charge their clients' access to their own particular services, which, of course, is another opportunity for Telstra to increase its market share of Internet access services. When we consider that this situation will continue irrespective of these new pieces of legislation, it is a matter of great concern to Internet users. I know that some members here use the Internet and would be fully aware of the consequences of this. I can give the House one instance: a constituent approached me about a problem he had experienced when he was trying to get an extra line into his house to allow Internet access for him and his brother, both students, without disrupting their normal telephone line. They live in the suburb of Carabooda where calls are charged at the standard residential rate. The neighbouring suburb of Yanchep is one where time charges apply-something I am going to talk about a bit later on. Telstra informed him that, though his extant line remains connected to the Carabooda switch, his new line will have to be connected to the Yanchep switch and therefore attract time charges. This is a ludicrous situation. This is the result of Telstra's decision to upgrade the Yanchep switch rather than the Carabooda one, knowing that the Carabooda's capacity was almost full. Faced with the government decision-supported overwhelmingly by public opinion-that timed calls will not become universal, Telstra has very cleverly been able to circumvent the intent of government in this way. No matter what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) may say about time charges, I am sure they will find ways around the rules that this new legislation is introducing. I say to the backbench of the coalition that you will, in the future, get complaints about towers going up--like I did. I asked the minister a question before Christmas and was told that we were going to get some action on it but, in the meantime, Optus shot out and threw up towers in my area. Mr Lee-Why didn't the local council send it off to CEPA?",126
260,Mr FILING,RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,"Let me just say to the honourable member that, in every single instance where there has been an objection from the local government authority, it has been absolutely a waste of time. At the conclusion they have got their towers exactly where they wanted it. Let me say to the backbench of the coalition that this has occurred under their regime and it has occurred under the regime of the Minister for Communications and the Arts. What worries me about this is that, if they can find a way to circumvent the intent of government-I know what the backbenchers think about this particular thing because they probably share my views-there should be very substantial local input into planning matters such as this. Unfortunately, the former minister at the table, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), failed in his time to implement changes. I can remember long periods of debate over this. The minister was one of those fiercely advocating these changes, although he is very quiet now. But at the time we were being assured that something was going to be done. When we got it, it was a paper tiger. Debate interrupted. NA",128
261,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjoum. Youth Unemployment",128
262,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to see the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) come over to my side to join with me in my expression of concern at the way in which the Howard government is approaching what remains the most critical social and economic issue in this country, and that is unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. Young Australians do not ask all that much of their governments, but what they do ask is for the opportunity to learn and the opportunity to work. They expect equal access to education and, as a result, the right to earn a decent living and to live as normal Australians. Prior to the last federal election, the Minister (Mr Howard), and in particular the member for Goldstein, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), travelled the country bleating about the rates of youth unemployment in this nation. Of course they were going to fix the problem. Mr Bob Baldwin-And we're working on it. Mr FITZGmBON-He says that they are working on it. But what do we have after almost 12 months of coalition rule? Unemployment is back up and youth unemployment is at a record high. What an absolute disgrace. Let us look at the way in which they are doing something about it. The member for Paterson indicates that they are doing something about it. How about increases to HECS charges and an acceleration in the rate at which HECS must be repaid. How about the tightening of the Austudy criteria, resulting in hundreds of kids dropping out of the system every day. Mr Bob Baldwin-What's that got to do with it? Mr FITZGmBON-I will tell you what it has got to do with it. It is about access to training. You get skills in order to gain employment; that is what it is all about. That is what cuts to university and TAFE places do not provide. A $1.8 billion cut over four years to labour market programs also does not provide that. The cutting out of the minimum youth training allowance for those whose parents might earn more than a paltry sum does not help those who are seeking work much either. Let us look at the demand side of the economy. Let us look at this government's management of the macro economy. You create jobs in this country by promoting economic growth. What have we seen? We have seen the economy all but ground to a halt. What do those opposite tell us when we ask them what they are going to do about unemployment and, in particular, youth unemployment? They go back to what I will call the traditional excuses of the Liberal Party. They say, 'We're going to fix IR and Prime introduce some changes to capital gains rollover. We'll fiddle with the provisional tax uplift factor and cut red tape.' When all else fails, they bring out the old red tape phrase. I ask. those members on the other side, particularly the member for Paterson, how many employers have been to them cheering and told them that, because of some fiddling with the IR legislation, capital gains tax and the provisional tax uplift factor, they will take on a few extra employees? I suggest that noone has been to them. I suggest that it simply is not happening. When we ask the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) during question time how he is progressing with his attempts to cut red tape, we get a blank look, if we are lucky, or usually a smile. That is the best we can get from the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. The Prime Minister is very conscious that he is losing credibility on this issue, so he rings Andrew Robb and asks, 'What am I going to do about this?' Andrew Robb says, 'Well, polling shows that this phrase 'work for the dole' is very popular.' So the Prime Minister says, 'Well, that's got to be my line. We'd better work something out for a while. We'd better get some detail.' But then we had the Woods affair. They needed to knock the Woods affair off the front page, so he announced the scheme on the Sunday program just last week. I will support any scheme that is a genuine attempt to put young people into jobs in this country just as I supported the former Labor government's labour market programs, which were doing just that. They were providing training and real jobs and producing worthwhile projects in my electorate, in the electorate of the member for Paterson and in the electorates of all those sitting opposite. The shadow minister on this side has outlined an II-point criteria test that we will apply to the scheme if we ever get some detail. We will move amendments to ensure that that criteria is complied with. (Time expired) Aboriginal Welfare",128
263,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Members of the opposition forget that the CDEP schemes introduced by the Fraser government have worked in Aboriginal communities for many years and continue to work well. It is interesting to see how at Cherbourg, an area which I has become very dear over the years, the elders have come out in support of the government's proposal to introduce the work for the dole scheme. They are saying, quite rightly, that the people in the Cherbourg area have done this for years and produced great results from it. In that context, I wish to refer to an article sent to me by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I am indebted to the right honourable member not only for the pleasure and privilege to be serving in a parliament with someone of his experience and background but also for his assistance in matters of this kind. He sent me this article which appeared in the Readers Digest in December 1996. It is entitled 'What Welfare Did for Thomas Dutton' and is by William Ecenbarger. I will quote selectively from it: From the rim of consciousness, Thomas Dutton felt his life draining away. He was vomiting blood. His breath was reduced to a wheeze as his lungs filled with fluid. Double pneumonia. Tears streamed down his face from a chest pain that words could only hint at. On that night of November 24, last year, the Aboriginal man was wheeled into the emergency ward of Broken Hill Base Hospital, put on a respirator and moved to the intensive care unit. This time he was lucky. Gradually, he recovered his strength. But a week later the doctor delivered an ultimatum. ""If you don't stop drinking, you'll be dead of liver failure within a year."" Dutton was left to ponder the rubble of his It had begun with such promise. He was once the brightest child in his preschool class, once a league player who many thought would become a highly paid professional. Instead he had dropped out of school, was functionally illiterate and unemployed-indeed he had never had a job. He was an alcoholic. And in less than a month he would tum 24. Dutton could only ponder as well the fate of his family and of his people. Over the past 40,000 years, some 1600 generations of Aborigines have lived in Australia. Since the arrival of European settlers a mere 200 years ago, they have endured diseases to which they had no immunity, the loss of their land, racism and even murder. SOJ?ehow they have survived. But now Aborigines hke Thomas Dutton are being subjected to something they may not outlast: a welfare system that creates dependency and destroys self-respect. The article goes on to refer to the tremendous background of his forebears. It refers to his grandfather, who was a shearer, was used to hard work and had achieved a lot. It referred to the fact that hard work had never hurt him and the fact that he had done very well at that hard work. But over a period of time the welfare state impinged on Aboriginal life. Unfortunately, and sadly, what has happened to him and his family is that he became dependent on it, so much so that it became inculcated into his consciousness. He would say to a friend, 'Why don't you go on the dole?' The answer was, 'I like to work for my money, mate.' Thomas Dutton did not understand. His attitudes had been seeded in childhood and watered every day since. He was constantly told by adults that Aborigines were entitled to welfare because of past treatment by whites. He had turned down innumerable offers of farm work. 'It is my right not to do it,' he said. 'Pick grapes? Too bloody hard, too bloody hot.' So it went on. Along with all of that background, the article goes on to describe the situation at Wilcannia and the despair there. The government's announced work for the dole program feeds right across the boardnot just to the Aboriginal community, which has CDEP, but right through to the white community. We need this scheme. We need something that will help young people. Young life. people have welcomed it. That is the beauty of it. I have had it in my electorate. I have rugby had a lot of calls of support, and it is probably reflected in many electorates across Australia. This is a hope for young people, a chance to get them into a job and give them hope and a chance for the future. This is something that the Labor Party should seriously look at and support in a bipartisan way. Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers of Australia",129
264,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to acknowledge the many fine achievements of the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers of Australia. APESMA, as it is euphemistically known, is a professional union which represents the industrial interests of professional employees in a wide range of disciplines. As a former employee, I am proud to acknowledge the fact that the association has just celebrated the fiftieth year of its foundation. I know that both Senator Barney Cooney and I were delighted to have been invited to a celebratory dinner in December last year. A book titled Status and Reward: a History of Industrial Representation of Professional Engineers in Australia, authored by Brian Lloyd and Helen Vines, has just been written. As the book's back cover note by General President, Rob Allen, suggests, the story of Australia's most successful and enduring union for professionals is one that is overdue in the telling, not simply because it is indeed both an absorbing and instructive narrative but because it finally gives public credit to the men and women whose hard work, perseverance and dignity changed the face of industrial relations in Australia. In many ways, APESMA has been at the forefront of Australian unionism. It has pursued the challenge of amalgamation with some vigour-in fact, with the same vigour it has pursued every other challenge it has been confronted with. Existing as the Association of Professional Engineers of Australia for its first 45 years, amalgamation with the Association of Professional Scientists in 1991, to form the APES A-the Association of Professional Engineers and Scientists of Australiasaw it broaden its coverage in 1993 and again in 1994 to incorporate managers in its jurisdictional coverage. So it has become what it currently is-APESMA. It offers a range of services to its 20,000 members-both industrial and non-industrial services-which are indeed second to none. Among those services are highly regarded distance MBA programs, offered through Deakin University and other similar highly regarded tertiary institutions. It offers discounted Commonwealth Bank mortgage rates and discounts on a range of other goods and services, from stockbroking fees to accommodation. Those that lead the APESMA-notably its General President, Rob Allen; its executive director, John Vines; its director, industrial, Bruce Nadenbousch-are responsible for bringing together a first-rate group of employees which are guiding the association towards a sound and secure future. The leaders I have just mentioned would have made the founding father of the association and its first president, Mr Reg Newlands, duly proud. It was Mr Reg Newlands who first laid down the guiding tenets of the association when he contended that the work of engineers was unlike that of many other employees and should be rightly differentiated on industrial relations matters. I am proud to continue my association with APESMA, which has developed into an efficient and adaptable organisation recognised internationally for its dedicated services to professionals. I commend the book Status and Reward to interested parties as a first class account of the history of the organisation and of the dedicated and relentless efforts of those to whom this fine work is dedicated. Kingsford Smith, Sir Charles",130
265,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Sunday, 9 February, was the lOOth anniversary of the birth of a very famous Australian- Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. Most Australians know something of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's successful flight across the Pacific in 1928. However, few of us realise what he and his crew went through to obtain that success. Previously, the longest any pilot had flown westward from the United States was to Honolulu, and that is only a third of the way to Australia. Affectionately known as 'Smithy', Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's epic flight broke every flying record in the book, including the longest non-stop flight on the second leg between Honolulu and Fiji. This part of the flight lasted 35 hours. Imagine spending 35 hours in any aircraft, let alone one as small as the Southern Cross. Even a fierce electrical storm after the Southern Cross left Fiji could not halt Smithy. He flew the Southern Cross blind for five hours during that storm. This feat is a testament to Smithy's courage and determination. The total flying time for that flight was 83 hours and 38 minutes, which translates to approximately 3Y2 days. I am very proud to say that Smithy was born and bred in Brisbane and his home in Riverview Terrace, Hamilton, is part of the federal electorate of Lilley, which I represent. To mark the centennial celebrations of Smithy's birth, the Brisbane FAC led by Tim Rothwell and Cam Spence organised a day of festivities. I was honoured to be able to officially accept a commemorative $1 coin from the Royal Australian Mint. The coin features a profile of Kingsford Smith and the Southern Cross. With the help of Ted Wixted, I unveiled a plaque in Smithy's honour. A book written by Ted, The Life and Times of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, an Illustrated Chronology, was launched. Over 1,000 people attended the celebrations to pay tribute to Smithy's historic accomplishments. One of the highlights of the festivities was a flyover by three Tiger Moths and a daring aerobatic display by the Royal Queensland Aero Club. With all his fame, Smithy always considered himself a Brisbanite and a Queenslander. In fact, the whole Kingsford Smith clan were born in Queensland. This fact did not escape the notice of his co-commander on the Southern Cross, Charles Ulm. After their successful crossing of the Pacific, Ulm was quoted as saying that he too was a Queenslander. He said he was born in an outer Brisbane suburb--Melbourne. Smithy always hoped he would be wealthy enough to present the Southern Cross to a museum. In 1935 the Southern Cross became the property of the federal government. It languished in a civil aviation bulk store in New South Wales until it was moved to Queensland where it was lovingly restored and is proudly displayed in the vicinity of Brisbane's international airport just a short distance from where he landed on that historic day in 1928. Smithy will always be remembered as one of Australia's greatest aviation pioneers, and I am sure he would have felt honoured by the centennial celebrations that were held in his home town of Brisbane on Sunday. Glory Cape: Budi Santose  p.m.)-I want to bring to the attention of the parliament tonight the failure of international maritime authorities to deal with the owners and operators of the Glory Cape. The Glory Cape is a vessel that loaded iron ore and departed Port Hedland on 31 October 1995. On the night of the departure, five of the crew members who were Indonesian were attacked by officers and other crew of that vessel. There had been a dispute over non-payment of wages. The five Indonesians had sought the assistance of the International Transport Federation and the Australian Maritime Union in Port Hedland in obtaining their underpayment and unpaid wages. At about 2.30 in the morning of 31 October, the radio operator, Budi Santose, was held by the Chinese cooks while he was beaten with iron bars by the Korean officers. Ultimately he managed to escape. According to the depositions from the crew that I have read, there were a number of altercations and brutal beatings. The five crew members went over the side with lifebelts, spent the night in the sea and were rescued the follow morning at daybreak by local authorities. The radio operator, Santose, died in the water. What really happened was that he was murdered by the Korean officers of the Glory Cape. The vessel has not returned to Australia since. In the meantime, Lloyds Maritime Information Services have told the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and, through it and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), me, in answer to question No. 968, that they have no record of any change in the status of this vessel and that her most recent report is that she departed Vancouver in British Columbia on 23 November 1996. So she is up there trading, large as life, and no action has been taken. In the intervening period that vessel has traded from Dampier to China, through the Panama Canal, to New Orleans, to Panama, to Japan, to South Africa, to Portugal, to Canada, to Japan, to New Orleans and ultimately back to Vancouver on 23 November 1996. I asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development in matters contained in question No. 968: . . . what action had been taken to identify those persons responsible for the injuries inflicted upon, and subsequent death of, Mr Santose Budi, radio operator of the MV Glory Cape . .. The answer that came back states: The investigation into, and any action relating to, the injuries sustained by crew members and the death of Mr Budi is as I knewa matter for the Western Australian State Police Department. He goes on to say: Any further action by AMSAin respect of this attack and murderis dependent on the outcome of the Western Australian inquest which has not yet been held. I have not had a chance to contact the Western Australian police, given the time. I have had the answer, but I will be following up with the Western Australian authorities why the inquest has not been held. But the flaw in all of this abuse, exploitation, mistreatment and murder of Third World seafarers by operators of ships trading to this country on a regular basis is that the flag state, the state where the ship is registered, is responsible for the discipline of the officers of the ship and those who operate that ship. In this case it is Panama. It is a totally unacceptable situation where this goes on, where these people have been killed-and there are other instances I will bring to the attention of the parliament in the coming weeks. I ask those companies that have anything to do with our trading activities to bear in mind whether by having their product on board they want to wear the stigma of crew being murdered or ill-treated, or jumping overboard or being thrown overboard. On the night of 20 January-just a few weeks ago-one of the crew members of the motor vessel Hunter went over the side at 1 a.m. several miles off Newcastle. His presence in the sea was not notified to local authorities until 8.46 in the morning. There were rescuers with him in a few minutes. The rescue authorities were tremendous. They were Australians-professionals. If the man had been in the water for another half hour he would have been dead. That kind of practice cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. I will bring all the details to the attention of the parliament in the coming session after the week's break. Needlestick Injury",131
266,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to briefly talk about a product that is manufactured in my electorate. Some of you might not be aware that the Dunkley electorate has been quietly establishing a reputation as a centre of high technology and innovation. This particular product is manufactured by one of our local businesses, Uni-Ject Australia Pty Ltd, under the directorship of Nap Curie. This product is a worldleading product that is not quite getting the local recognition it deserves. What you are looking at is a disposable, retractable safety syringe. They call the product ENSI, an acronym for 'eliminating needle stick injuries' . The product enables a normal needle to be stuck on the end, the dose entered and then when it is ejected a click occurs. When you retract the arm of the syringe the syringe is sucked back into the casing, therefore eliminating needles tick injury. To avoid it being projected at somebody or protruding from the end of the capsule you simply break the end of the handle off and you have a very safe and simple product that brings to an end one of the great fears of the health profession, the needlestick injury. What you are seeing is a very simple product that is battling to establish itself in the domestic market, despite a very serious concern among health professionals about the effect of needlestick injuries. In a 1992 survey of hospital emergency departments accredited by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine it was found that an average rate of reported needlestick injury was two per hundred hospital beds per month, or at least 4,200 injuries across Australia per year. A United States source estimates that the cost of each needlestick injury varies between $A525 and $Al,700. With an average cost of around $1,000, let me assure you that the slight additional expense that comes with purchasing this product over and above the more conventional version is quickly absorbed within one or two needles tick injuries. It does not take a genius to work out that $1,000 goes a long way towards buying these sorts of products. The importance of this product is reflected in the fact that this country imports the vast majority of its syringes-about 450 million of them each year. With that amount of product coming into the country you can understand why this local manufacturer is keen to establish itself within the domestic market, but there is some reluctance by hospitals to take up the product notwithstanding the fact that my local public hospital, the Mornington Peninsula Hospital, does use this product. A Sydney University 1994 study suggested that 27 per cent of nurses in medical wards at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and 42 per cent of surgical ward nurses have sustained a needles tick injury over the past two years. Every doctor in a surgical unit as well as 57 per cent 0f those in surgical wards have received a needlestick injury. What I am basically alluding to is the fact that with that high rate of risk and the extreme cost of needlestick injury, it is a false economy for some of our purchasing officers to overlook this product in favour of the conventional product which is a couple of cents cheaper per unit. Interestingly, the only competitor for this product is also imported and its cost is twice that of the local product, for a less effective mechanism. I am urging all health professionals, as I have urged the Victorian state Minister for Health, the Hon. Rob Knowles, to get the message out to our health community that needlestick injuries are an unnecessary risk facing our health professionals. There is an excellent local product that has been developed to bring an end to the needlestick injuries which are quite common in routine surgery. and procedures in hospitals-and that is something that is manufactured in my electorate. It surprises me that the product has not taken off but it has been suggested to me that it is perhaps because a trip to the US plant where the imported product is manufactured is far more attractive than running down to sunny Dunkley by the bay to look at the sanitised workplace and factory of the manufacturer in Seaford. I commend the transnational company Becton Dickinson for the role they are playing in trying to manage needles tick injury but suggest that with this sort of product available that approach of managing needlestick injury and circulating information is perhaps a bit out of date. Health professionals all around the country, I would encourage you to familiarise yourselves with this product as I certainly encourage the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services. As I was discussing with the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), those medical staff in the defence services ought to have a look at this product. It does prevent needlestick injury. It is an important innovation. It is available now and I think the local manufacturer deserves some encouragement for producing world's best innovative technology in dealing with very serious incidents and episodes in the health industry. Vehicle Repairs",133
267,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"Very briefly in the short time remaining I wish to express my concern about plans that I believe will affect many New South Wales motorists-plans by NRMA insurance to have all damaged vehicles taken to a centralised holding yard and repair work being put out to tender. This means that policyholders will lose their right of choice of a vehicle repairer in the event of an accident. I believe this erodes the rights of the NRMA members who choose to insure their vehicles with the NRMA. Not only that, it will have a vast effect on the many hundreds of small smash repair businesses throughout New South Wales that will not be able to tender for work from the NRMA. The NRMA is the largest motoring organisation in New South Wales and has close to 60 per cent of all vehicles insured with it. The effects of this, I believe, have not been fully examined. I have been contacted by Mr Tony Selmes of the Motor Traders Association of New South Wales. He certainly has expressed his concerns on behalf of his members. He has said that smash repairers are telling him that their customers are horrified at the loss of their ability to choose their own repairer. They reject the NRMA's claim that policyholders do not want to be involved in getting their cars back on the road. I believe NRMA should have a look at this decision and consult more widely with its members before it goes ahead and implements this decision.",134

(2) Is it a fact that under the development of standard national firearms laws, some States or Territories are proposing that firearms made before 1900 will not require any form of licensing. (3) Is there a guideline or consensus on how collectors' weapons are to be rendered temporarily inoperative; if so, what are the details. (4) Will prohibition of hand grenades tors apply to inert as well as live grenades. (5) Is there a guideline for storage of weapons for gun owners who live in caravans or in remote settlements such as Aboriginal communities; if so, what are the details. (6) What measures will the Commonwealth take to monitor the maintenance of common legislation which is consistent between the States and Territories once a standard national firearms legislative approach is achieved. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) meeting on 10 May 1996, all State and Territory Police Ministers agreed that at the conclusion of the national compensation and amnesty scheme, each jurisdiction would have severe penalties for breaches for the firearms control laws. It was further agreed that, to the extent practicable, the penalties should be uniform. At the national level, a public education campaign has commenced to persuade firearm owners to hand in prohibited firearms and to encourage compliance with the new firearms legislation. (2) At its meeting of 17 July 1996, the APMC agreed that jurisdictions may consider not applying any requirement for licensing or registration of collection firearms manufactured before 1900, and for which cartridge ammunition is not commercially NA available. This is a matter for the individual State and Territory Governments to determine. (3) The APMC agreed on 17 July 1996 that firearms manufactured after 1900 held in a collection must be rendered temporarily incapable of use by removal and separate secure storage of the bolt and/or firing pin or, if not feasible, by an appropriate trigger lock. Ministers further agreed that Category D firearms in a collection must be rendered permanently inoperable, and that jurisdictions may require Category C collection firearms to be rendered permanently inoperable. (4) The APMC has not addressed requirements for hand grenade collections. This is a matter forconsideration by the individual State and Territory Governments. (5) There is no specific guideline on this matter. On 10 May 1996, the APMC agreed upon the following minimum basic standards for the secure for collecstorage of firearms and ammunition: Licence Category A and B: storage in a locked receptacle constructed of either hard wood or steel with a thickness to ensure it is not easily penetrable. If the weight is less than 150 kilograms the receptacle shall be fixed to the frame of the floor or wall so as to prevent easy removal. The locks fitted to these receptacles shall be of sturdy construction; Licence Category C, D and H: storage in a locked, steel safe with a thickness to ensure it is not easily penetrable, bolted to the structure of a building; and all ammunition must be stored in locked containers separate from any firearms. The APMC further agreed that a firearms owner who wished to store firearms through other measures would have the burden of persuading the firearms regulatory authority that he or she can provide a level of security not less than that required by the relevant approved standard. (6) The Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board (""the Board"") has been involved in the development stages of the new firearms legislation in all States and Territories. The Board will continue to monitor the legislation to ensure that the APMC agreements are implemented and remain in place. As noted at the APMC meeting on 15 November 1996, the Australian Institute of Criminology has agreed to monitor and evaluate the new firearms controls. As part of this process, I have requested the Australian Institute of Criminology to prepare a detailed analysis of the State and Territory legislation. There is no common legislation as such, nor is there a ""standard national firearms legislative approach"". It is up to each State and Territory Government to decide whether to incorporate the APMC agreements into existing legislation or to draft new legislation based upon the agreements. Standing Committee of Attorneys General: Human Rights (Question No. 848) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) What items on human rights were placed on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Sydney on 11-12 July 1996. (2) Who placed each item referred to in part (1) on the agenda and what was the outcome. (3) When and where will the next meeting of the Standing Committee be held. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Human Rights Paper placed before the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys General on 11-12 July 1996 referred to the following human rights issues: Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; ILO Convention 169, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989) Commission on Human Rights; Optional protocol to the Torture Convention; Proposed optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; Fourth World Conference on Women Possible optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; Complaints under international communications procedures and cooperative arrangements regarding these complaints; Reporting under international communication procedures; Joint Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissionl Australian Law Reform Commission reference on children and the justice system; National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families; Disability anti-discrimination legislation; Amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984; Enforcement of human rights determinations; SCAG working group on human rights; Human rights forum for non-Government organisations; Decade of human rights education. Review of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 Other human rights agenda items for the July SCAG meeting were: Aboriginal justice Aboriginal customary law The response to the decision in Teoh. (2) The Human Rights Paper is placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. The general outcome of this Paper is to inform States and Territories about the activities of the Commonwealth in this area and discussion of these issues is ongoing. I am advised that, in relation to the July SCAG meeting, the paper was noted. Aboriginal justice was placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. I am advised that Ministers noted the Report of the Third Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committee (NAJAC) which was tabled. They also noted the report on cross-cultural awareness and non-custodial sentencing options for offenders and agreed to provide a copy to the NAJAC. I am advised that Ministers also noted that ATSIC has commissioned reports on those recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC) which relate to the over representation of aboriginal people in custody and the implementation of the RCIADIC recommendations as reflected by coroners reports of deaths since the release of the Report. Aboriginal customary law was placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. Discussion of this issue is ongoing. I am advised that at the July SCAG meeting, Ministers noted the views of the Commonwealth Attorney General on recognition of Aboriginal customary marriages under the Marriage Act. Ministers also noted the preliminary views of other jurisdictions in response to the recommendations of the ALRC Report on The Recognition of Aboriginal Customary Law. Additionally each officer was asked to develop an appropriate consultation strategy for consideration by their Minister, recognising that this will involve discussions with the relevant Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in each jurisdiction and it was agreed that officers will report back to SCAG on the outcome of consultations. The issue of treaties and the response to the Teoh decision was placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. I am advised that at the July SCAG meeting Ministers noted the oral report that the Commonwealth was reconsidering the need for a legislative response to Teoh. (3) The next meeting of SCAG was held in Canberra on 25 October 1996. Kimberley Land Council (Question No. 849) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) What sum has the Government funded to the Kimberley Land Council (KC) in each year since 1990. (2) Has the KC been audited during this period: if so, (a) who was the auditor and (b) were any queries raised. (3) Have the activities of the KC been subject to any reviews; if so (a) when and (b) what was the outcome of the reviews. (4) When will the KC be next reviewed. (5) When did the KC have its last election of office bearers. (6) How many persons voted at the election. (7) Was the election conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission; if not why not. (8) Does the KC have substantial resources and is it in receipt of Commonwealth funding; if so, what reasons prevent the KC from holding open elections based on an electoral role. (9) Does the (a) Minister or (b) Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations have the power to enforce an open election for the KC.",167
289,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. (1) As indicated to the member in the previous government's response to Question on Notice number 766 of 16 December 1993 funding for the years 1991192 through to 1993/94 are as follows: 1991/92-$879,020; 1992/93-$2,039,393; 1993/94-$1,929,287.

(2) 1995/96 Auditor: Mr RN Richards, CPA, PO Box 257, Ravensthorpe 6346 The auditor's report for 1995/96 did not include any major concerns regarding the KC. 1994/95 Audited financial statements: Filed on 31 October 1995 Auditor: Mr RN Richards, CPA, PO Box 257, Ravensthorpe 6346 Qualifications: Minor qualifications. 1993/94 Audited financial statements: Filed on 30 December 1994. Auditor: Mr RN Richards, CPA, PO Box 257, Ravensthorpe 6346 Qualifications: Some minor technical breaches (not of major concern) The Registrar raised the audit qualifications with the Corporation and received a satisfactory response. 1992/93 Audited financial statements: Filed on 11 January 1994 Qualifications: Federal and State tax obligations (tax exemption claims were pending) Grant condition breaches (in relation to tendering process) Some minor technical breaches (not of major concern) 1991192 Audited financial statements: Filed in November 1992. Auditor: Mr RN Richards, CPA, PO Box 257, Ravensthorpe 6346 Qualifications: Federal and State tax obligations (tax exemption claims were pending) Some minor technical breaches (in relation to approval of payments by the Governing Committee) 1990/91 Audited financial statements: Filed in January 1992 Auditor: Mr RN Richards, CPA, PO Box 257, Ravensthorpe 6346 Qualifications: Payments not approved by the Governing Committee Unsupported payment totalling $26,140 P AYE tax deduction anomalies Register of members not maintained Asset register not maintained Unsupported/acquitted advances/payments to staff and/or committee members. 1989/90 Audited financial statements: Filed in January 1992. Auditor: Mr RN Richards, CPA, PO Box 257, Ravensthorpe 6346 Qualifications: Payments not approved by the Governing Committee Technical anomalies in relation to cheque signing PAYE tax deductions anomalies. (3) ATSIC has reviewed the KC's periodic financial statements and audited annual financial statements. No formal major reviews into the activities of the KC have been undertaken. (4) ATSIC proposes to conduct a major review of the KC's activities as a Native Title Representative Body in March!April 1997. (5) Information available to ATSIC shows that the KC's last election of office bearers took place on 23 November 1995. The KC's rules requires election of office bearers every two years. (6) It is understood that in excess of two hundred persons attended the meeting. (7) The election was not conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. There is no statutory requirement for it to do so. However, I am led to believe that approaches have been made to the Australian Electoral Commission in the past for assistance with conducting elections but the Australian Electoral Commission has declined to become involved as it does not generally conduct elections for Aboriginal Corporations. (8) The Corporation is required to conduct elections of Committee Members at Annual General Meetings. In accordance with the rules of the Corporation all members may participate in elections. (9) No. Elections must be conducted in accordance with the KC's rules of incorporation. Standing Committee of Attorneys General: Human Rights (Question No. 902) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 4 November 1996: (1) What items on human rights were placed on the agenda of the meetings of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) in Canberra on 25 October 1996. (2) Who placed each item identified in part (1) on the agenda and what was the outcome. (3) When and where will the next meeting of the Standing Committee be held. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Human Rights Paper placed before the meeting of the Standing Committee on 25 October 1996 referred to the following human rights issues: Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; ILO Convention 169, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989) Commission on Human Rights; Optional protocol to the Torture Convention; Proposed optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; Fourth World Conference on Women; Possible optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; Complaints under international communications procedures and cooperative arrangements regarding these complaints; Reporting under international communication procedures; Joint Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission!Australian Law Reform Commission reference on children and the justice system; National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families; Disability anti-discrimination legislation; Amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984; Enforcement of human rights determinations; SCAG working group on human rights; Human rights forum for non-Government organisations; Decade of human rights education. Review of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 Additionally, the following items were also listed: ILO Convention No. Ill-Discrimination in Employment and Occupation (1958); Reform of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Scheme; Co-operative arrangements with the States; Status of anti-discrimination complaints upon the death of a party to the complaint. Other human rights agenda items for the October SCAG meetings were: Aboriginal justice The response to the decision in Teoh. (2) The Human Rights Paper is placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. The general outcome of this Paper is to inform States and Territories about the activities of the Commonwealth in this area and discussion of these issues is ongoing. I am advised that at the October SCAG meeting, the paper was noted. Ministers also agreed to the continuation of the Working Party on Human Rights but that its usefulness would be reviewed from time to time. Aboriginal justice was placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. I am advised that Ministers noted the reports ATSIC commissioned in respect of certain matters arising out of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody will be available for distribution in December and noted the Commonwealth proposals for a Deaths in Custody Summit. The issue of treaties and the response to the Teoh decision was placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. I am advised that at the October SCAG meeting the Commonwealth Attorney General indicated that the government has not yet made a decision on its response to Teoh. (3) The next meeting of SCAG is scheduled to be held in Melbourne on 12-13 March 1997. Parkes Airport Proposal (Question No. 956) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 19 November 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments reported in the Parkes Champion Post of 18 November 1996, made by Connell Wagner's Environmental Impact Statement Project Manager, Mr D. Brady, relating to the proposed Parkes airport initiative. (2) Is he able to say whether the operation would grow from 2 aircraft each day to a 4 aircraft per day operation by 2010, based on a 1997 commencement with 50,000 tonnes of air freight and a 5% growth rate. (3) Is he also able to say whether the operation would grow to a 10 to 15 aircraft per day operation, based on a 15% growth rate. (4) Are the figures referred to in parts (2) and (3) sufficient to operate a profitable airport. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware of the specific comments reported in the Parkes Champion Post of 18 November 1996. However, the Government has closely considered the Inland Marketing Corporation's (IMC) proposal for the establishment of an inland international air freight facility at Parkes. (2)-(4) The IMC has not provided any evidence of any intention by any international airline to operate services to Parkes. On the basis of current and projected freight flows and the economics of operating dedicated international freight aircraft, it is considered implausible that any international flights would operate to Parkes. The IMC projections must be balanced against the reality of the airfreight market. Currently there is approximately 9,400 tonnes per week of air freight capacity offered on outbound services from Australia. About 8,100 tonnes of this total (or 86 per cent) is operated in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. Of the nearly 700 scheduled international services per week to/from Australia, there are only 26 dedicated freighters operated and of these only 15 operate traffic rights (ie take on loads) out of Australia each week. The focus of operations of these dedicated freighters is to Sydney and Melbourne with Adelaide and Perth each receiving only one international freighter service per week. Brisbane and Cairns are two rapidly growing international freight gateways. In the year ended 30 June 1996 Brisbane airport handled 34,753 tonnes of exports and 15,948 tonnes of imports while Cairns handled 6,636 tonnes of exports and 578 tonnes of imports. Despite this level of business and being in close proximity to some of the most productive agricultural production and export regions in Australia, neither airport can attract dedicated international freighter operations. The freight is carried in the belly holds on international passenger services. Accordingly, Parkes is unlikely to attract dedicated freight aircraft when these major airports, with established freight operations and infrastructure are unable to do so. The Department of Transport has undertaken a detailed analysis of the IMC's throughput projections. The Department's analysis highlights that the IMC's export projections are based on attracting some 90% of the existing market of agricultural produce from NSW, Victoria and South Australia where its costs are competitive. This is considered extremely unlikely to be able to be realised. Distribution of Newspapers (Question No. 1036) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 5 December 1996: (1) Further to his answer to a question without notice (Hansard, 2 December 1996, page 7256) concerning newsagents, has the Government lodged a submission with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) expressing a view that the present authorisations for home delivery should be retained for a fixed, four year period and no longer. (2) Has his attention heen drawn to any publishers intending to withdraw from existing distribution systems. (3) Are third parties able to appeal any decision by the ACCC on this matter to the Australian Competition Tribunal. (4) When did the Tribunal last consider this matter and what did it determine. (5) Did he state in 1996 that he would permanently retain the present authorisations; if so, how.",171
290,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) On 26 November 1996, the Government presented its submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC) review of the authorisations for the newsagency distribution arrangements in New South Wales/the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and Victoria. The submission fulfils the Government's pre-election commitment to support the home delivery system for newspapers. This system is currently authorised under competition law because the public benefits have been held to outweigh the anticompetitive aspects of the system. The submission outlines the Government's views as to the benefits that derive from an efficient, low cost home delivery system for newspapers. The submission proposes that the present authorisations be allowed to continue for another 4 years. After that time, it is envisaged that publishers and newsagents would be free to seek new authorisations, which would be assessed in light of any structural change which has occurred during that time. The submission acknowledges that the Government cannot direct the publishers on the distribution channels for their publications. (2) No publishers are known to have expressed an intention to withdraw from existing distribution arrangements. Advertiser Newspapers Ltd, publisher of the Advertiser in South Australia, has sought the ACCC's approval for revised distribution arrangements. However, the Advertiser has asked that a decision on the proposal be held in abeyance pending developments in the industry. (3) Subsection 101(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (along with Regulation 20 of the Trade Practices Regulations) provides that a person dissatisfied with a determination by the ACCC in relation to the revocation of an authorisation may, within 21 days of the date of the determination, apply to the Tribunal for a review of the determination. If the Tribunal is satisfied the person has a sufficient interest, the Tribunal shall review the determination. (4) In November 1994 the Australian Competition Tribunal considered a determination of the Trade Practices Commission (now the ACCC) in relation to revised arrangements for the distribution of the publications of the Age and Herald and Weekly Times groups in Victoria. The determination of the Trades Practices Commission was made in 1993 following a fresh application for authorisation of a system designed to replace the then system, which was authorised by the Trade Practices Commission in 1982. The Tribunal set aside the 1993 determination of the Trade Practices Commission. As a result, the system authorised by the Trade Practices Commission in 1982 continued to operate. The findings of the Tribunal regarding the anti-competitive effects and the public benefits of the system in that matter led the ACCC to commence a formal review of the authorisation for Victoria and, because of the similarity of arrangements, those for New South Wales/the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and Victoria. (5) See answer to question (1). Haasts Bluff Land Trust (Question No. 1037) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 5 December 1996: (1) What are the (a) names and (b) populations of communities within lands for which title is held by the Haasts Bluff Land Trust. (2) How many houses were constructed within those communities referred to in part (1) (a) prior to 1990 and (b) between 1990 and 1995 and (c) have been or are funded for construction since 1995. (3) For the houses referred to in part (2), (a) what was the cost, (b) how was construction funded, (c) did the organisation or persons funded have secure title to the land upon which houses were constructed; if so, what form did it take; if not, who held secure title and what form did it take and (d) are rents charged; if so, (i) what sum is charged and how is it determined, (ii) who collects the rents, (iii) to whom is rent paid, (iv) how many houses have more than six weeks outstanding rent and (v) what is the sum and percentage of the collectable rents in each community that is outstanding. (4) Did houses constructed after 1990 within those communities fail to satisfy established Northern Territory public housing standards; if so, (a) why were they constructed below the standards, (b) what was the cost and how was construction funded, (c) did the organisation or persons funded have secure title to the land upon which houses were constructed; if so, what form did it take; if not, who held secure title and what form did it take and (d) are rents charged; if so, (i) what sum is charged and how is it determined, (ii) who collects the rents, (iii) to whom is rent paid, (iv) how many houses have more than six weeks outstanding rent and (v) what is the sum and percentage of the collectable rents in each community that is outstanding.",174
291,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission with the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (1) Papunya approx 250 people Areyonga approx 180 people Papunya-8 houses Areyonga-3 houses Haasts Bluff-l house Mount Liebig-2 houses Kintore-4 houses (c) Papunya-3 houses Areyonga-l house Haasts Bluff-nil Mount Liebig-l house Kintore-nil (3)(a) see above. (b) In each case the standard ATSIC Grant procedure was followed. Funds were approved and Letters of Offer issued to the incorporated bodies representing the communities. Grantees appointed consultant project managers and public tenders were generally called. (c) Title to the land in question is held by the Haasts Bluff Aboriginal Land Trust, granted as inalienable freehold title under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. (d) Yes. (i) Rental levels are determined by the community organisation in consultation with community members/tenants. The organisation is advised of the Haasts Bluff (Ikunji Community) approx 80 people Mount Liebig (Amundurrngu Community) approx 300 people Kintore (Walungurru Community) approx 350 people. (2)(a) Detailed information on houses funded and constructed at the communities mentioned prior to 1990 would require considerable research. However data from the 1992 ATSIC Community Housing and Infrastructure Needs Survey shows the stock of houses in each Community as at mid 1992 as: Papunya-21 houses and 17 shelters Areyonga-31 houses Haasts Bluff-tO houses Mount Liebig-19 houses and 16 shelters Kintore-42 houses and 6 shelters. (b) Total cost $685,000 $230,000 $80,000 $170,000 $546,000 Total cost $300,000 $100,000 $100,000 ATSIC guidelines on rental policy; which is that rents must be collected to a level which allows the Housing Organisation to pay rates and insurance, maintain the houses in a good state of repair and pay administrative expenses. (ii) and (iii) Rents are collected by the funded organisation or their appointed agent. (iv) and (v) ATSIC holds no information on the number of houses which have outstanding rents of more than six weeks or the sum or percentage of outstanding collectable rents in any of the listed communities. (4) ATSIC advises that they have been advised that building standards in the NT are determined through the NT Building Act (1993) and its provisions generally reflect those of the Building Code of Australia. Under this Act construction standards are applied to declared areas which are generally large towns. The communities in the Haasts Bluff Lands Trust area are not declared areas. Outside of declared areas agencies providing funds rely upon contractual arrangements to achieve housing standards. ATSIC requires grantee organisations to employ professionally qualified/registered contractors to undertake housing construction. Haasts Bluff Land Trust (Question No. 1038) Mr Campbell asked the minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 5 December 1996: (I) How many areas of land has the Haasts Bluff Land Trust been granted title to under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory Act). (2) For the titles referred to in part (1), (a) when were they obtained, (b) what are the areas of land involved and (c) how were they obtained. (3) What are the names of the persons or bodies who hold leases for areas of land from the Haasts Bluff Land Trust, and in each case (a) what is the area of land involved, (b) what is the purpose of the lease and (c) what are the terms and conditions of the lease. (4) Do (a) traditional owners or (b) Aboriginal persons have security of tenure to reside on the lands; if so, is security of tenure absolute or qualified, and if it is qualified what are the qualifications; if not what must they do to obtain security of tenure.",175
292,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs with the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (1) Haasts Bluff Aboriginal Land Trust has been granted one area of land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. (2)(a) Former Governor General, Sir Zelman Cowan, granted title to the Trust to the area described in Schedule 1 of the Act, on 30 August 1978. The grant excluded from the area described in the schedule an area of 1.796 hectares being Lots 1,2, and 3 Areyonga Townsite, Lots 2, 3 and 4 Papunya Townsite and Lot 3 Haasts Bluff Townsite. The grant also reserved to the Crown all rights to minerals in the area. The Commonwealth Government subsequently amended the Act and this necessitated new deeds of grant to the Trust. Therefore, on 30 May 1980, the Governor General again granted the area to the Trust. However, the grant was effective from the date of the original grant. The new deed excluded certain roads from the land granted. These were firstly any land on which there was on the 26 January 1977 (when s.3 of the Act commenced) a road over which the public had, at that time, a right of way and secondly any land over which there was, at the time of the execution of the Deed of Grant, a road over which the public had a right of way. On 29 October 1986, the Governor General, Sir Ninian Stephen, granted the town sites excluded from the initial grant to the Trust. (b) The area is the land described in Schedule 1 to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (copy of relevant part of schedule attached) and is Northern Territory Portion 1635. It is shown on Compiled Plan 4189 deposited with the Registrar General, Darwin. (c) The area of land was obtained as a grant of Schedule 1 land under the Act. (3) Insofar as most if not all the lease documents from the Trust have been registered against the title the appropriate method of obtaining the information is to apply to the Registrar General of the Northern Territory for a title search. It is not appropriate that I provide such information given that it would be commercial-in-confidence. (4) Traditional owners have tenure provided for under the Act for Schedule 1 land. I do not consider it appropriate to provide legal advice in response to this question on notice. People who are concerned about the issues raised by the Honourable Member should seek their own legal advice. Native Title Act: Security of Tenure (Question No. 1039) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 5 December 1996: Do (a) traditional owners or (b) Aboriginal persons have security of tenure to reside on the lands for which title has or will be granted under the Native Title Act; if so, is their security of tenure absolute or qualified, and if it is qualified, what are the qualifications; if not, what must they do to obtain security of tenure. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I do not consider it appropriate to provide legal advice in response to this question on notice. People who are concerned about the issues raised by the honourable member should seek their own legal advice. Counterfeit Cigarettes: Newspaper (Question No. 1049)  Small Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 9 December 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article on page 26 on the Sun-Herald, dated 1 December 1996, entitled ""Customs made bludger caught red handed"". (2) Is he able to provide details relating to the scam involving container loads of counterfeit cigarettes mentioned in the article; if so, (a) what were the names and addresses of the Chinese cigarette factories referred to, (b) who is the person with a Chinese diplomatic passport referred to as the head of the operation, (c) what companies are associated with that person and (d) what is the nature of the $40m worth of property assets associated with that person and those companies. (3) Is he also able to provide details relating to alleged importation of 60 vehicles by a multimillionaire; if so (a) what sum of duty was avoided by the practices mentioned and (b) what are the names of the importers referred to in the article.  member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Customs, in co-operation with several other Federal and State agencies and with the assistance of a number of cigarette manufacturing companies have been investigating allegations that counterfeit cigarettes have been illegally imported into Australia. A number of containers have been examined as part of this work and there was one seizure in Sydney of 696,000 cigarettes (700 kgs) late last year where the cigarettes were concealed in a consignment of textiles. Prosecution action in respect of that consignment remains under consideration. There is no evidence establishing the involvement of any person holding a diplomatic passport. It is inappropriate to make further comment at this time. (3) Details of importations are provided to and held by the Australian Customs Service in confidence.
