3,Mr HOCKEY,MOTIONS,"That is a little disappointing. I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for North Sydney from moving the following motion forthwith-That the resolution of the House of Representatives of 8 May 2012, regarding the management of proceedings in respect of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 20112012, be rescinded to allow consider the proposal contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013, to increase the Commonwealth debt ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion.

17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,No! Lock the doors; too late-no way; not on. Out!,19

20,Mr Hockey,MOTIONS,The Government Whip,19
21,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The Government Whip does not have the authority. I actually said he should return to the chamber because the doors had been locked and he was actually in the chamber when I said, 'Lock the doors.' In accordance with the rules, I had asked him to stay in the chamber, as the doors had been locked. I think that is the right way to proceed.",19
22,Mr Hockey,MOTIONS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Just to clarify: as we said that we would not accept the vote of the member for Dobell, when we realised",20
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The member for North Sydney does not have the call. Member for North Sydney, it is not for the opposition or the government to accept a member's vote. We need to clarify this: it is for the parliament to accept a member's vote. The member for North Sydney.",20
24,Mr Hockey,MOTIONS,"The coalition has said it would not accept the vote of the member for Dobell and, if the member for Dobell entered the House and voted with us, we would have someone leave the chamber. To provide clarity: we became aware that the member for Dobell was sitting on our side, and that is Grierson, SJ why the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business attempted to leave the House, on that note. The member, obviously",20
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The member for North Sydney has made his point. We are in the middle of a division. The issue still remains that, when the call for the doors to be locked has been made, those in the chamber must be counted in the vote. I understand the point the member for North Sydney is making, but there is no ability for the parliament to exclude a member's vote. The member for Groom is seeking the call. I would like to now, before that, put the question. The question is that the member be no longer heard. Mr Ian Macfarlane: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: you are classed as outside the chamber if you are past the advisers' box.",20

Thank you. Carbon Pricing",23
42,Mr HUNT,PAIRS," I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Flinders from moving the following motion forthwith-That this House requires the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to come into the Parliament: (1) to tell the truth and correct his statement that ―on road fuel costs are not increasing under the carbon price and in fact off road costs will decrease. Excise is being cut. It will fall from July the 1st for local Governments‖, given that: (a) the carbon tax will apply to off road commercial activity from 1 July 2012; (b) the carbon tax will apply to on road commercial activity from 1 July 2014; (c) the Government's own projections show a total increase in fuel excise revenue as a result of the carbon tax package of $920 million over the first three years of operation; (d) the Minerals Council estimates that the fuel tax changes will hit 60,000 businesses in year one and will hit almost 100,000 businesses by year three; and PAIRS (e) the South Australian Local Government Association has confirmed in its report, Financial Implications of the Carbon Price on South Australian Councils, that councils will have increased off road charges from 1 July 2012 and increased on road charges from 1 July 2014; and (2) to explain why he says fuel taxes are going down when in fact they are going up by $920 million. Fuel taxes are going up under the carbon price, not down. The minister has deceived this House and he should have the courage to make a statement about it now.",23
43,Mr Albanese,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I seek your clarification. There are specific provisions in the standing orders, if a member has deliberately misled the parliament, for it to proceed in terms of substantive motions. The member for Flinders has not had the courtesy to provide us with a copy of the resolution in order to make a judgment as to whether we will support the suspension of standing orders or not.",23
44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," The Leader of the House is correct that there are other forms of the House if the member is claiming the minister has misled the parliament. I also do not have a copy of the motion before me, so it does generally",23

46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I am not disputing who did or did not. I am just stating: I do not have a copy. I am not trying to apportion blame. If there are portions of the motion about misleading the House, then there is another form to do that. But the member has the call, as there are other issues in respect of the motion he is moving. I will ask him, though, if it is a suspension of standing orders, to refer to the actual motion before the chair.",23
47,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"I will indeed, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is urgent that this minister explains himself. He made a statement in question time yesterday which was completely at odds with the $920 million of additional fuel taxes outlined in the government's own MYEFO.",23
48,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The member for Flinders will resume his seat-and it is not just about the Leader of the House seeking the call; it is about me requesting people to resume their seats, and people should respect that call.",24
49,Mr Albanese,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member is now attempting to move a suspension of standing orders. He must outline to the House why the suspension of standing orders should be allowed as opposed to the budget that is before the chamber-the budget of the Commonwealth of Australia.",24
50,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Flinders has the call and will refer to the motion before the chair.,24
51,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"This matter is urgent, immediate and important, precisely because a statement was made which was completely at odds with the budget of the Commonwealth. The reason that it is important is that yesterday the minister denied the fact that fuel excise is going up, Smyth, L under the carbon tax, not down. He claimed that it was going down; it is going up.",24

54,Mr BILSON,PAIRS," I second the motion. Labor's carbon tax would push up fuel costs and we need to suspend standing orders so that we can establish just by how much those fuel prices will go up. This is extraordinarily urgent and the reason for suspending standing orders is that in one month's time Australian businesses and consumers are faced with the world's largest carbon tax. We need to suspend standing orders so people have an understanding about how much fuel prices will go up so they can make decisions about pricing in their business. Certainty is required. That is O'Connor, BPJ why we need to suspend standing orders. We need to suspend standing orders because, without that clarity, how will businesses be able to price their services and products, how will the households of Australia be able to manage their budgets, and how will those marauding ACCC inspectors threatening a $1.1 million fine on businesses that do the wrong thing in relation to the carbon tax know what they can do if we do not suspend standing orders and get clarity?",25

57,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (10:05): I am pleased to bring the second reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 to a close. I thank those members who have made a contribution. Despite the impacts of a sovereign debt crisis in Europe and unprecedented natural disasters here in Australia, Australia's economic prospects remain strong. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world and our economic growth is expected to be stronger than every single major advanced economy over the coming two years. We will confirm our position by returning the budget to surplus in 2013 and growing that surplus over the forward estimates. In this budget we are returning to surplus while ensuring that families and small businesses are sharing in the benefits of the resources boom. This budget provides a $1.8 billion increase in family tax benefit part A for all eligible families from 1 July 2013. It also provides a further $1.1 billion for a new supplementary allowance for unemployed, students and parents with young children on income support, with the first payment commencing on March 2013. The government is also providing an extra $2.1 billion over five years for a new schoolkids bonus paid directly to eligible recipients, despite opposition from those on the other side of the chamber. From 1 July 2012 we are more than tripling the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 which will free up to one million Australians from the need to lodge a tax return. We will invest $1 billion over four years in the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This is a very important Labor reform which will see around 10,000 people start to benefit from mid-2013 and expand to cover 20,000 people from mid-2014. This budget will also help businesses to invest. We have announced a new initiative to allow businesses to carry back their losses to offset past profits and to get a refund of tax previously paid on that profit. From 1 July 2012 companies will be able to carry back up to $1 million worth of losses to get a refund of tax paid in the previous year, and from 1 July 2013 companies will be able to carry back up to $1 million worth of losses against tax paid up to two years earlier. We are also delivering tax breaks which will significantly help small business from 1 July 2012, such as the increase to the instant asset write-off threshold to $6½ thousand. A number of comments have been made by members as part of this debate concerning the amendments to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911. While I note that similar amendments were included in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) of last year, I will spend a little bit of time explaining, particularly to those opposite, the rationale behind these amendments. I state upfront that the Commonwealth government securities on the issue, subject to the current legislative limit, are projected to be below $250 billion at the end of each financial year across the forward estimates. However, fluctuations in cash requirements that result during the financial year are a normal feature of the Commonwealth's annual financing task. The number of Commonwealth government securities on issue during any part of the financial year varies in order to adequately manage any mismatches in the timing of revenue collection and expenditure outlays. Being able to manage these fluctuations in an efficient manner is critical. The Australian Office of Financial Management should not be affected by shortterm borrowing constraints, as these have a negative impact upon the AOFM's ability to operate its normal cash management functions in the current financial climate. The increase in the legislative limit on borrowing from a total of $250 billion to $300 billion will allow the AOFM to most efficiently manage within-year mismatches. It will also provide the flexibility to maintain a liquid and efficient government bond market in the years to come. Australia looks toward the future from a position of strength-strength in our economy, strength in our people and strength in our policies. This government is focused on prioritising spending to provide lasting gains to convert an increasingly productive economy into a fairer community for all Australians.",26

Question agreed to. Broadcasting Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Albanese. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,28
60,Mr ALBANESE,NOES,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (10:21): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Access to electronic media is important to all members of our community, including those with a hearing impairment. It is expected that by 2020 hearing loss is likely to affect more than five million Australians. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Bill 2012 implements the government's response to the media access review. This was a review in access to electronic media for people with hearing and vision impairment. It involves significant public consultation, including receiving more than 200 submissions on two discussion papers. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to provide for greater access to free-to-air and subscription television for the hearing impaired. The bill will achieve this by introducing new legislative requirements and, where applicable, increasing existing requirements for captioning on commercial, national and subscription television broadcasters. The bill will implement captioning targets that are comparable with international best practice. Reaching these targets will be a significant achievement, as we move toward equal access to electronic media, for all sections of Australian society. A gradual, incremental increase in targets will assist the nation's broadcasters adjust to the increasing costs associated with the changes. The bill will also provide for improved access to televised emergency warnings for people with a hearing or vision impairment by mandating that these must be transmitted in the form of text and speech, and captioned where reasonably practicable. The bill will also address issues with variability in the quality of captions. Under this bill the Australian Communications and Media Authority will determine standards relating to the quality of captioning in terms of readability, comprehensibility and accuracy. There are a number of programs that broadcasters are not currently required to caption for practical reasons, and these exemptions will be maintained. The bill will prescribe the new captioning requirements in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. This will provide both consumers and broadcasters with a level of regulatory certainty through one set of clear future targets and one overarching regulatory system. This will remove the current duplication where broadcasters are subject to targets under both the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. The Attorney-General will develop the required regulation. The government will ensure that meaningful improvements to levels of media access for people with hearing and vision impairment are achieved in a way that is practical for broadcasters and content producers. The passing of this bill will improve the accessibility of television, ensuring a more inclusive viewing experience for all Australians. I commend this important bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Maritime Powers Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",29
61,Ms ROXON,NOES,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (10:25): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the Maritime Powers Bill 2012. The maritime domain poses particular challenges to the effective enforcement of laws. Enforcement operations in maritime areas frequently occur in remote locations, isolated from the support normally available to land-based operations and constrained by the practicalities involved in sea-based work. Commonwealth officers across a range of portfolios work tirelessly on the community's behalf to enforce Australia's maritime laws. This work often takes place in treacherous conditions. We owe it to these hard working Australians to provide a legal framework that fully supports their commitment by being tailored to the conditions and recognising the inherent difficulties of the environment. Under the current legislative structure, operational agencies use powers contained in at least 35 separate Commonwealth acts. This structure is inefficient and can lead to operational difficulties for the primary onwater enforcement agencies. The government has undertaken an extensive review of existing arrangements. The product of that review is the Maritime Powers Bill. The bill provides a smarter and simpler approach to maritime enforcement through a single maritime enforcement law. This single law consolidates and harmonises the Commonwealth's existing maritime enforcement regime. The powers contained in the bill are modelled on powers currently available to operational agencies. Outline of bill The bill contains a comprehensive framework for enforcing Australia's laws at sea. The bill establishes a system of authorisations under which a maritime officer may exercise enforcement powers in the maritime domain. In addition to providing the necessary operational flexibility, this system of authorisations puts in place a range of safeguards to make sure maritime enforcement powers are authorised and exercised appropriately and for a proper purpose. A key safeguard is the requirement for the exercise of powers to be authorised on specific grounds by a senior maritime officer or member of the Australian Federal Police. This provides clarity around who must make decisions to take enforcement action and ensures appropriate oversight in relation to the exercise of powers. The types of authorisations available under the bill will cover the full variety of situations which arise in the maritime environment, including fishing, customs and migration matters. Once an authorisation is in force, a maritime officer generally has access to the full suite of powers set out in the bill. The powers contained in the bill are based on powers currently available to operational agencies and under the bill the role and functions of these agencies will not change. The powers include searching things and people, seizing and retaining things, boarding of vessels and requiring persons to cease conduct that contravenes Australian law. Enforcement powers under the bill will be exercised by officers of the Australian Defence Force, Customs, the Australian Federal Police, and other persons appointed to conduct enforcement and monitoring activities in the maritime environment. Conclusion The Australian government is committed to ensuring that Australia's laws are monitored and enforced in the maritime domain. The unique aspects of the maritime environment merit a tailored approach to maritime powers, helping to ensure flexibility in their exercise and to assist maritime officers to deal with quickly changing circumstances and often difficult and dangerous situations. As the Leader of the House noted recently, we are getting on with the business of government. These reforms are just one aspect of the government's work to provide Australia with a modern legal framework. This bill will streamline and modernise Australia's legal framework for maritime enforcement and thereby support the hard working Australians who work on our behalf to uphold Australia's maritime laws. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",30
62,Ms ROXON,NOES,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (10:30): I am pleased to move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and the Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 provide a smarter and simpler approach to maritime enforcement through streamlining the framework for use by our on-water enforcement agencies. Where existing maritime enforcement powers overlap with powers in the Maritime Powers Bill, this bill will reduce that duplication. The bill has been the subject of an extensive consultation process with agencies to ensure that the consolidation exercise maintains current operational powers for agencies. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum and a correction to the explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",31
63,Ms ROXON,NOES,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (10:32): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-Like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 will protect some of the most vulnerable people in Australian society. With this bill, the Gillard Labor government is protecting vulnerable women and children and, in some cases, men from trafficking and slavery. For many in our community, the notion of 'slavery' evokes 19th century images of people sold as chattels, shackled and transported between countries. Tragically, 19th century slavery has not been abolished. It has simply taken other forms. People traffickers recruit, transport, transfer, harbour or receive their victims through force, coercion or other means in order to exploit them. This is the modern-day face of slavery. A common factor of contemporary slavery and trafficking-from forced labour and forced marriage to organ trafficking-is the misuse and abuse of power. And such an abuse has no place here in Australia. I want to send that message loud and clear to all Australians and to all young people: duress, violence and intimidation are not acceptable in contemporary Australian society-in any context. Slavery, trafficking and forced marriage are unacceptable and they will now be very serious crimes. That is why Labor is bringing forward this bill to improve protections for victims of all forms of slavery and trafficking, and to help law enforcement agencies detect, investigate and prosecute perpetrators. Fortunately, slavery and people trafficking are not common in Australia, but the effect on victims is traumatic and can have lifelong consequences. The bill will strengthen and expand the capability of investigators and prosecutors to combat these crimes by introducing new offences of forced labour, forced marriage, harbouring a person for the purposes of furthering the offence of trafficking, and organ trafficking into the Commonwealth Criminal Code. More specifically this bill will:  create a standalone offence of forced labour where a reasonable person in the position of the victim would not consider him or herself to be free to cease providing, or leave the place where they provide, labour or services because of the use of coercion, threat or deception  criminalise the conduct of a person who uses coercion, threats or deception to bring about a marriage or marriage-like relationship. The offence would also apply to a person who is a party to, but not a victim of, a forced marriage  criminalise the conduct of a person who harbours, receives or conceals a victim and in doing so, assists or furthers the purpose of a third person who has committed, or is committing, a trafficking, slavery or slavery-like offence  create standalone offences criminalising trafficking a victim, either to or from Australia or within Australia, for the removal of his or her organ. The bill will also insert general relevant evidence provisions into both divisions 270 and 271 of the Criminal Code. These provisions set out a list of matters a court or jury may have regard to in determining whether a victim has been coerced, threatened or deceived, whether the victim or the guardian consented to the removal, in the case of the organ offences, of the victim's organs, or whether another person has caused the victim to enter into debt bondage. It will also insert general consent provisions into divisions 270 and 271 to make it clear that a victim's consent or acquiescence cannot be used as a defence in a proceeding for an offence against those divisions. Reducing a person to a state of slavery or servitude often involves suppressing the person's free will and their self-respect, as well as their ability to make decisions for themselves. To allow a defendant to escape liability because his or her offending achieved the desired effect in bringing about these changes in a victim so that they appear to consent would be inexcusable. This provision makes that clear. These measures will establish a continuum of offences criminalising exploitative conduct ranging from slavery to debt bondage. The definition of 'exploitation' in the Criminal Code will be expanded to cover broader forms of exploitation including debt bondage, forced labour, forced marriage, and all forms of servitude including non-sexual servitude. Forced labour goes against everything that Labor stands for. And that is why we must act to make sure that no-one in this country is subject to such a misuse of power. And that no-one is able to get away with forcing someone to work in that way. The Labor Party has a long history of protecting Australia's most vulnerable-whether through the government's introduction of Medicare, the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act or our current steps to introduce the National Disability Insurance Scheme. And this bill will continue that proud tradition. It was the Labor Party which repealed Tony Abbott's unfair workplace laws. And it is the Labor government which is now introducing a new offence of forced labour. While the majority of identified victims in Australia have been women trafficked for the purposes of exploitation in the sex industry, law enforcement agencies are increasingly identifying both men and women who have been subjected to exploitation in a range of other industry sectors and workplace environments. This bill will introduce a stand-alone offence of forced labour and expand the existing offences of sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting to ensure they apply regardless of industry. Where a person who does not consider himself or herself to be free to cease providing, or leave the place where they provide, labour or services because of the use of coercion, threat or deception they will be protected. Penalties for the existing debt bondage offences will also be increased, reflecting the seriousness of these crimes. I would like to take this opportunity to say something about one particular aspect of this bill and that is forced marriage. As Australia's first female Attorney-General, I am proud to be introducing legislation which makes forcing someone into a marriage illegal. It is a serious matter and should be treated as such. Marriage should be a happy event, entered into freely between consenting adults. Forced marriage places young people at risk, and can result in many harmful consequences including the loss of education, restriction of movement and autonomy, and emotional and physical abuse. Some critics have asked: 'Won't this just force this underground?' I say to them that it is already underground and it cannot afford to stay that way. As Attorney-General it is my role to make it completely clear that in Australia, marriage must be entered into freely, without duress or constraint. In order to strengthen the law's ability to deal with the perpetrators of slavery and trafficking offences, this bill also makes it a crime for another person to assist or further the commission of these offences. The new offence of harbouring will extend criminal responsibility to those who facilitate a slavery or trafficking offence by harbouring, concealing or receiving a victim of a slavery or people-trafficking offence. This is to ensure that there is no way for people to avoid prosecution because they did not themselves transport, recruit or transfer the victim into the country. The bill also creates stand-alone offences of organ trafficking. Trafficking a person to remove his or her organ is currently criminalised through offences relating to exploitation. This amendment will clarify the circumstances in which an offence of organ trafficking will apply, including situations which the victim's organ is not ultimately removed. These organ-trafficking offences will ensure that Australia meets its international obligations and comprehensively criminalises this exploitative conduct. The bill will increase the capacity of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute perpetrators, and to better support and protect victims. It will assist in addressing the impact of crime by improving the availability of reparation orders to individual victims of Commonwealth offences, including slavery and people trafficking. In conclusion, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 was prepared following extensive public consultation. The government released two discussion papers on slavery, people trafficking and forced marriage, and also submissions on an exposure draft of the bill. May I digress for a moment to thank my predecessor the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr O'Connor, who was strongly involved in this, and also the officials from my department and the Federal Police who have had particular carriage of what has been a challenging piece of work. I thank them for their determined efforts. With this bill, the government will clarify and strengthen the operation of existing slavery and people-trafficking related offences to make sure that the perpetrators of these offences and those who facilitate them cannot escape prosecution. The bill reflects the government's commitment to doing all it can to prevent slavery and people trafficking. It is easy to say no. It is harder to stand up and do the right thing. And that is what this bill is about. in For the Labor Party, it is about protecting the most vulnerable in Australia. It is about us getting things done to make this country a fairer, safer place for all of us. The Gillard government is carrying on, in introducing this bill, the great Labor tradition of standing up for those who are less powerful against the strong and giving a voice to those who cannot always speak up for themselves. I am very proud to commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dreyfus. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",31
64,Mr DREYFUS,NOES,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and sought Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (10:43): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill 2012 implements a commitment by this government and the Council of Australian Governments to achieve nationally consistent regulation of equipment energy efficiency. The national framework established by the bill will, for the first time, establish uniform national legislation for energy efficiency. In doing so, it will replace seven overlapping pieces of state legislation and allow future expansion of the Equipment Energy Efficiency Program, commonly known as the E3 program. Australia's energy efficiency regulation began with energy labelling for household refrigerators and freezers in 1986 in New South Wales followed shortly after by Victoria. In 1992, a national program was established and funded collectively to coordinate energy efficiency regulation across all Australian states and territories. Today, the E3 program now includes New Zealand and covers 23 product types in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors, delivering energy and financial savings to Australian households and businesses. The consistent efforts and contributions of all Australian and New Zealand governments for over two decades makes ours one of the world's longestrunning energy efficiency programs. The E3 program aims to overcome some of the market barriers impeding the development of more energy efficient products. It relies on two main tools: mandatory minimum efficiency levels, and energy rating labels. Minimum efficiency levels help to keep the most inefficient products out of the Australian market. Energy rating labels help Australian consumers and businesses compare upfront costs with costs over time, assisting them to make the best purchasing decisions. These labels also provide an incentive for manufacturers to innovate and produce more energy-efficient products for all Australians. Together these cost-effective measures support two of Australia's most important policy objectives: helping households and businesses to manage energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The E3 program's familiar energy rating label is one of the most well recognised brands in Australia. In 2005, 83 per cent of surveyed consumers reported referring to the label when purchasing major household appliances. The program is not only popular but delivers real and significant benefits to Australia. In 2010 alone, energy-efficient air conditioners and refrigerators promoted by the E3 program saved Australian households and businesses over $1 billion in electricity costs. National consistency Despite the successes of the E3 program, further improvements are possible. Australian governments have coordinated well to achieve energy savings, but over 26 years inconsistencies have arisen across the state based programs. These inconsistencies increase the regulatory burden for businesses and governments alike. To address these inconsistencies the Council of Australian Governments agreed in 2009 to establish national legislation to regulate energy efficiency. This commitment was recorded in the National Strategy on Energy Efficiency (measure 2.2.2). The agreement reflects the cooperative history of the E3 program, which has benefited from the cooperation and contribution of every Australian jurisdiction for the past 20 years. The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill 2012 will implement the joint commitment to address the inconsistencies in the E3 program and streamline processes for Australian businesses. The bill will establish a single national regulator and a single program framework. The new law will replace seven state based legal frameworks. The new national regulator will replace four state based regulators. Obligations, efficiency standards, registration processes and fees will be harmonised. The national system will improve the regulatory framework while retaining the best of the existing system. Existing efficiency standards and the popular energy rating label will remain unchanged. The national regulator will work cooperatively with state and territory agencies and draw on their expertise. New Zealand, which is a participant in the E3 program, will continue to collaborate on energy efficiency regulation, ensuring the greatest net benefit for both countries. Expansion Over the past two decades the E3 program has focused primarily on electrical equipment. The new national framework will allow Australian governments to regulate energy efficiency for a greater range of products. The expanded E3 program can cover electricity, gas or other energy sources. regulate products such as windows and insulation, which affect the energy use of heating and cooling systems. Into the future Australians will benefit from increased energy efficiency across a greater range of products. Any expansion of the E3 program is of course subject to consultation and rigorous assessment procedures to ensure regulatory action will deliver positive economic benefits, but the bottom line is that more efficient products save energy and that saves Australians money. Key points on how the bill operates Under the new framework businesses must register regulated product models with the national regulator. This maintains the practice of the existing E3 program. Registration allows the national regulator to monitor which products are entering the Australian market. The regulator records registered products on the public energyefficiency database, which allows the Australian public to research and compare all registered product models to inform purchasing decisions. Businesses that deal with regulated products must ensure their products meet minimum efficiency standards and carry accurate labels. For the first time, businesses that directly import products for commercial use will also be subject to these obligations. The existing E3 program only targets businesses that supply products in Australia and does not regulate businesses that purchase products overseas. The GEMS bill will end this double standard, closing loopholes in state law that might encourage businesses to purchase products overseas instead of purchasing in Australia. The bill will establish a range of enforcement options to support these business obligations. It will allow the It can national regulator to issue infringement notices or ask businesses to compensate consumers for the costs of products that do not comply with regulations. For more serious breaches of the law the bill allows the courts to impose financial penalties. Experience under the current program emphasises the importance of regulators having a range of powers to test products and inspect business premises to ensure a high level of compliance with the act. The GEMS bill introduces new powers for the national regulator to obtain information needed to administer the E3 program. This includes requirements for registrants to provide information on the number of regulated products sold in Australia each year. These powers are modelled on similar powers already used in the New Zealand energy efficiency program. Accurate market information will allow the national regulator to identify market areas that may require regulatory intervention to overcome non-price barriers to greater energy efficiency. This information will also allow Australian governments to better coordinate the joint E3 program nationally and with New Zealand. The Australian government is aware of the potentially sensitive nature of the commercial information and is committed to protecting it. The GEMS bill institutes strict controls on the handling of commercially sensitive information, including criminal offences for government officers who share information without authorisation. The government will support these legal safeguards with a detailed informationhandling policy. Conclusion The E3 program is an important part of ensuring affordable energy for all Australians and assisting Australia's transition to a low-carbon future. The benefits are real and significant. By 2020 existing E3 measures are forecast to save Australian households and businesses $5.2 billion per year and reduce household electricity use by 13 per cent per year compared with business as usual. The planned regulatory program is forecast to bring about a further reduction of almost 15 per cent, saving Australian households more than 25 per cent of their yearly power bills. The Australian government is committed to reducing energy costs for Australian households, to reducing market barriers for Australian businesses and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the entire country. The improvements made by the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill will ensure a strong foundation to continue this important work well into the future. Debate adjourned. Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards (Registration Fees) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dreyfus. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",34
65,Mr DREYFUS,NOES,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (10:53): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards (Registration Fees) Bill 2012 accompanies and supports the main Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill 2012. The main GEMS bill implements a commitment by the Council of Australian Governments to establish national legislation to regulate energy efficiency. The national framework will improve Australia's existing Equipment Energy Efficiency Program by replacing seven state and territory legal frameworks with a single, nationally consistent law. The national framework will also allow the expansion of the E3 program in the future. The enhanced E3 program will retain many existing practices, including a requirement for businesses to register regulated product models. Registration will allow Australian consumers to research and compare different products on the energy rating website. Registering products will also assist the national regulator to monitor trends in energy efficiency. Consistent with existing practice, the national regulator will charge fees when businesses register their products. This bill, the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards (Registration Fees) Bill 2012, grants the national regulator the power to set registration fees. The purpose of registration Registration fees will recover a portion of the costs incurred administering the E3 program. For example, fees may recover the cost of processing registration applications, and costs incurred monitoring compliance with the law. Recovering a portion of the registration and compliance costs will enable the national regulator to expand the product testing program and increase the number of store inspectors. Cost recovery will also facilitate a faster, more streamlined registration process. These measures will allow the national regulator to deliver a more effective E3 program. Australian business stakeholders consulted during the development of GEMS legislation gave strong support for an enhanced compliance monitoring regime, backed by registration fees and cost recovery. Registration fees bill separate for constitutional reasons Legally, fees to recover costs of the compliance monitoring regime may be considered a form of taxation, rather than a fee for services provided. Section 55 of the Australian Constitution requires laws imposing taxation to deal with no other issues. The GEMS registration fees bill therefore separates the power to set fees from all other provisions in the GEMS legislation. The existence of the separate registration fees bill does not alter the way in which fees are calculated or the way in which fees are charged. It does not alter the proposal to deliver a more effective compliance monitoring regime for all Australians. The separate registration fees bill simply establishes a clear legislative basis to introduce the enhanced E3 program supported by Australian businesses. Fees specified by legislative instrument The GEMS registration fees bill grants the national regulator the power to set fees in legislative instruments. This ensures that fees set by the national regulator will be developed in a transparent manner and tabled in parliament for the public record. Setting fees in legislative instruments allows flexibility to alter fees in the future. Conclusion The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards (Registration Fees) Bill 2012 is integral to the success of the enhanced E3 program. The bill will establish a clear legislative basis to recover a portion of the costs incurred administering the program. This cost recovery will assist the national regulator to deliver an expanded compliance monitoring regime, a measure supported by Australian business stakeholders. Together with the main GEMS bill, the GEMS registration fees bill will deliver an enhanced and more consistent E3 program. This enhanced program will help to drive even greater energy efficiency for the benefit of Australian households and businesses. Debate adjourned. Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",37
66,Mr GRAY,NOES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (10:58): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012 would, if enacted, amend 21 acts across six portfolios to regularise Commonwealth payments supported by special appropriations (including special accounts) consistent with the legislative requirements and section 83 of the Constitution. It is the 10th financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. It forms part of an ongoing program to address financial framework issues as they are identified and assists in ensuring that specific provisions in existing legislation remain clear and up to date. This has been done in collaboration with the relevant ministers and their departments. The bill addresses issues that have been raised by the Australian National Audit Office recently, although many of the issues have existed since before the introduction of the Financial Management Accountability Act 1997. The amendments are technical in nature but important and in some cases relate to statutory schemes that have been in place for more than a decade. Specifically, this bill implements amendments that can be discussed thematically. The bill would amend nine acts to provide a mechanism called a recoverable payment. These amendments permit agencies to make payments on the basis of information available at the time but require overpayments, including those made in error, to be recovered in line with section 47 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (relating to the duty to pursue recovery of a debt). The bill would also amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 within the Treasury portfolio, to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to decide to make a recoverable advance. These advances would apply where the commissioner, or delegate, decides to make payments because the likely cost of not making these payments would exceed the total of the advances. If a recoverable advance were made, then the amount of the overpayment would remain a debt due to the Commonwealth and would need to be recovered. The bill also amends seven acts that operate in the area of public sector superannuation, to authorise the Commonwealth to make recoverable death payments. These amendments allow payments to be made to recipients until ComSuper or the relevant departmental secretary is notified of the recipient's death. Where payments have been made in the interim period, those amounts would be recoverable from the deceased's estate. The bill provides that where the recoverable payment, recoverable advance or recoverable death payment provisions are used, the relevant departmental secretary or and chief executive is to ensure that a report is published. This means that parliament would directly be requiring transparency on these issues in future. The bill also amends 10 acts to better align current payment practices with the relevant legislation such as in the recovery of administrative costs. The bill would also validate certain benefits under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 to regularise the treatment of certain benefit recipients, consistent with existing practice. The proposed acts being amended relate, largely, to routine activities of government and, if enacted, would allow the continued effective management of these activities, while having parliament require appropriate levels of transparency and accountability. This bill is, accordingly, another step to help ensure that specific areas of the Commonwealth's financial framework remain effective and up to date. I commend the bill to the House.

67,Mr BRIGGS,NOES," I will continue on from where I left off last night, when I was interrupted by the adjournment of the House. I was making the point that this is a terrible piece of legislation. It is probably one of the most insidious aspects of the Labor and Green alliance that we have seen in this hung parliament. Long-term damage will be done by this allocation of some $10 billion of Australian taxpayer money, which will be allocated for projects which have not met commercial viability tests, which the market will not fund, and which will distort an already existing market for renewable technologies. It is widely accepted that in renewable energy markets those companies and entrepreneurs who have already invested much in those technologies will be damaged. Those people have already put their own capital and work into creating these circumstances. The member for Melbourne nods his head-he accepts that. The member for Melbourne knows better than the market does! The member for Melbourne knows exactly which of his mates, which industries, he would prefer to fund with $10 billion of Australian taxpayer money. That is exactly what this is all about. This is part of the sorry deal that the Australian Labor Party have made, much to their shame. We know that there are good ministers in that government Bill 2012 who are increasingly stepping out of this deal, who no longer want to be associated Bill 2012 with it. One of the ministers at the table, I know, is increasingly uncomfortable. I say, good on that minister, for some of the hard policy decisions he has forced through the Labor caucus in the last week. Good on you, Minister Grey. Good on the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and good on the Minister for Resources and Energy for standing up for good public policy in this nation against the vested interests of those on their left who are putting so much pressure on their base with their idealism, which is outside of the reality of how you need to govern this country. This will be one of the worse legacies of this Labor government-this Labor-Greens alliance. The minister at the table knows it. That is why he is slowly but surely making his views the real policy views which need to be taken to ensure that this country is successful in the future. We know that the Greens approach to Australian public policyThe DEPUTY SPEAKER Grierson): Member for Mayo, I remind you to confine your comments to the legislation before the House.",40

70,Mr BRIGGS,NOES,"This is a Greens wish list. This is a Greens desire. The new leader of the Greens, Senator Christine Milne, is taking the Greens even further to the left. I never thought I would see someone-she has taken over in recent days-take Bob Brown further to the left. We know there is not a lot of happiness in the Greens, because we have read about it recently. There is not a lot of happiness with the new leadership team. Dr Leigh: I rise on a point of order. Deputy Speaker, the member for Mayo is defying your ruling, which was very clear. He should restrict his comments to those that are relevant to the bill before the House today.",41

74,Mr BRIGGS,NOES,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am being completely relevant regarding this legislation, because we know that there are members on that side who are very uncomfortable with these pieces of legislation, for very good reason: because it makes no economic sense. We know how much this Labor government have wasted over the last five years. Now we are going to hand them $10 billion to give to their mates in the Greens as a little reward for the support in keeping them in government. That is what this bill is all about. It is a shameful waste of Australian taxpayers' money. That is why there is so much sensitivity from those on the other side, trying to interrupt coalition speakers on this bill-because they know this will hang over them for a generation of Labor MPs who have stood by this piece of legislation. One of the other issues that I will touch on, briefly, as I have been interrupted on so many occasions during this contribution, is that it strikes me as passing strange, in relation to the appointment of the CEO of this organisation, that the CEO's remuneration will not be set by the little Remuneration Tribunal. I wonder how the member for Melbourne stands by that in his electorate? Presumably we will see an NBNstyle CEO payment of about $2 million a year. I wonder if the member for Melbourne will go out to his electorate and tell his Green constituents that-that the member for Melbourne's piece of legislation, that he and Senator Christine Milne want and support, would encourage and allow market rates for this so-called bank. The market rate is not going to be anywhere under seven figures. So I look forward to the brochure from the member for Melbourne talking about executive salaries. What hypocrisy! What utter hypocrisy! What an absolutely hypocritical thing for you to do, sir, when you claim that you stand by the low-paid in society and rail against high bank salaries. I bet you this salary will be nothing under seven figures. Why else would it be outside the Remuneration Tribunal? And those on the other side know it. They know it. This is a terrible piece of legislation. It should not pass the parliament. It will inflict damage on our economy for years to come. They should be ashamed of themselves for supporting it.

75,Mr BANDT,NOES," It is always a thrill to follow the member for Work Choices, because it reminds you just exactly how muchMr Tony Smith: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In accordance with your strict traffic-cop ruling, I suggest you call the member for Melbourne into line. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Grierson): Member for Casey, please do not reflect on the chair.",42
76,Mr BANDT,NOES,"It is always a thrill to follow this member because you realise just how much those on that side of the House are completely out of touch with what is happening in the rest of the world, even in the conservative side of politics. If one were to ask the Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, what they are doing to tackle climate change and what steps they are taking to support a renewable energy industry in their country, one would learn that, even though they participate in European emissions trading scheme, they are looking at increasing their carbon tax-and it is a tax in that country-because they have been worried that the level of the price imposed on carbon was not high enough to allow them to develop offshore wind to the point necessary to give confidence to investors to make the substantial amounts of investment that they would need to deliver long-term offshore winds. These are expensive projects that are being done for the first time and that need the kind of government support that the government gave dirty energy when it was built for the first time. If you were to go to the United Kingdom you would hear them there saying, 'Yes, we want offshore wind, and we will do what we need to do to sustain it.' If one were to go to Germany-an economy that is a shining light at the moment in the European crisis-and ask the conservative chancellor of Germany and the conservative government what they are doing there, they would say, 'By 2050 we are going to get 80 per cent of our electricity produced from renewable energy, and we are phasing out nuclear power.' What you would also find, if you went and asked the conservatives in Germany about progress there, is that last year they produced 20 per (Ms cent of their electricity from renewables. They are ahead of their target. During the recent cold snap in France, France, with all its nuclear power, got energy imported into the grid from renewableenergy-rich Germany because they ran out. In Germany they got 20 per cent of their electricity last year from renewables. How did it happen? It happened because the government got behind it when there were Greens in government, a long time ago, who helped set these settings that have been continued by the conservatives. There are now 382,000 jobs in the renewable energy the sector in Germany. That is around 102,000 jobs in Australian numbers, or more than twice as much as in coal mining, oil and gas put together. That is the kind of future we can have in Australia if we as parliamentarians and we as a government get behind the clean energy industry and give it the kind of support that governments previously did and still continue to give to polluting energy. And that is something that you never hear the modest members talk about: the enormous $15 billion subsidies per year that are given to coal and dirty, polluting industries.",42
77,Mr Briggs,NOES,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On your ruling as to relevance to the bill before the House: this is far outside that. He is attacking other members of the parliament. He should be",43
78,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I listened very carefully.,43
79,Mr Briggs,NOES,brought back to the provisions of the bill and explain,43
80,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Thank you, member for Mayo; please resume your seat. I am listening carefully to the Deputy Leader of the Greens, and he may continue.",43
81,Mr BANDT,NOES,"The fact that the member interjects and suggests that subsidies that are given to dirty, polluting industries is not relevant shows just how out of touch the conservatives here are with the conservatives in the rest of the world. We know two things. Firstly, industries, when they begin-especially in Australia, where we do not do enough to support innovation and commercialisation-can go through, and often fail in, the valley of death. That is especially the case for these industries that are new in Australia but are increasingly entrenched in the rest of the world, and we risk being left behind in this clean energy race if we do not give our nascent clean and renewable energy industries the kind of support that is being given elsewhere around the world. That is why I commend the government for introducing this legislation, because one of the things that it is going to do is to give those clean and renewable energy industries the support they need to get to a viable commercial stage. Secondly, it is suggested that that is an aberration but, as I have said, we continue to give up to $15 billion a year in subsidies to fossil fuel industries. Why is it that when someone goes to the petrol pump in Melbourne or Sydney they pay 38c a litre in excise, but when a wealthy mining company does it they pay zero? Why are they entitled to that subsidy? This is the unlevel playing field that renewable energies and the new industries are competing against. And that is why it is absolutely appropriate that we here give whatever support we can to these industries to allow them to become commercially viable in their own right. It has got to the point now in Germany that, because their renewable energy subsidies-including a green bank, a green finance corporation-have been in force for so long and have worked so well, they are able to start winding back some of those subsidies because their firms are so commercially successful and viable in their own right. That is the point we will get to in Australia in a very short period of time because of our incredible intellectual and natural resources, but we will only do it if government is the midwife of the renewable energy industry in this country. That is why I commend the government for the introduction of this bill, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, and I note just how well the consultation and preparation phase has been done and how professional it has been. The fact that previous speakers in this debate have said it is outrageous that we are going to have industry experts who might have skills comparable to their peers in the private sector coming to work in this corporation does not show that there is anything wrong with this bill. It shows exactly what is right, because those experts will be making the decisions about how to allocate the substantial sums of money they will have at their disposal based on sound business propositions that come to them and they will be able to tailor the kind of support for a particular business based on what that business actually needs. It might be some form of loan guarantee; it might be underwriting some continuous purchase arrangement. That is exactly the kind of flexibility that this finance corporation will have and it will be run professionally. This package of legislation happened because of the constitution of the parliament that we have at the moment and because it was something that we as the Greens pushed for very hard during the course of negotiations. That is why I am disappointed that the member for Fraser is not here. I respect the member for Fraser, but in a previous debate he said: 'Why are we even debating this now? The Greens should have supported this many years ago.' When that came from someone I respect, I was very disappointed to hear the most intellectually dishonest contribution to this debate that I have heard for some time. How can one get up here as we are debating this package and this Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which has never been on the table before and is only on the table now because the Greens are here, and say that the previous package should have been passed? If you were to say that that would have been better, then you would have to take into account, as the member for Fraser did not, the emissions savings we are going to get from this Clean Energy Finance Corporation. You would have to take into account the fact that we now have an 80 per cent by 2050 reduction target. You would also have to take into account the fact that we have a significant amount of money going into a biodiversity fund, that we have a floor price, that we have a climate change authority that will look over the targets we have set and recommend them downwards and that we have a tapering-off of the compensation that is going to be paid. None of those were in the original proposal cooked up between Labor and the coalition that the member for Fraser urgently wanted us to pass, and yet he has the gall to come into this chamber and say that somehow that would have resulted in a better outcome for the planet. It is folly, and I hope he gets the chance to come back in here during this debate and respond to it. As someone who prioritises evidence, he should have been more careful about what he said and he should have been more intellectually honest about calculating the emissions reductions that will come from this package, instead of using this as an opportunity to suggest that there is some political mileage that might be made. This package is in fact a reflection of what happens when people from differing political positions work together, and it will stand as a testament to this parliament that we have achieved such significant reform. Just think about this for a moment. In this parliament we have managed to get conservative country Independents, the Labor Party and the Greens together on the same page to pass one of the most significant reform packages that this parliament has seen. It is completely unlike any package previously before the parliament. It will set Australia up for a clean and renewable energy future. It will deliver more for rural Australia than any other package that has ever come before this parliament. And it will fast-track the development of renewable energy technologies in a way that no other package that has ever come before this parliament would have done. This is not an opportunity for division and point-scoring. This is an opportunity for recognising what can happen when people of goodwill, coming from different points of view, are prepared to work together for the benefit of the planet. This is going to stand the Australian economy in good stead. It will only be a matter of years before we have those 102,000 jobs in renewable energy in this country. I am extraordinarily pleased that we are able now to assist those renewable energy industries to develop and flourish. And I do hope we get to the point where, in five, 10 or 15 years time, we can say, 'Perhaps we do not need to give them the support anymore because they stand on their own two feet.' The University of Melbourne predicts that it will be somewhere around 2022 before solar becomes cost competitive with coal, absent any other subsidies. It may not be that long before we are able to talk about Australian inventions like the one that is being researched in my electorate where they are now printing solar cells onto almost any surface, working together with the note printers of Australian currency. BlueScope Steel is part of that project will be able to print directly onto surfaces so that your rooftop or your wall becomes a power source in and of itself. Newcastle university are looking at ways of getting microscopic solar cells into paint so you can paint the side of your house and use that as a power source. These are exactly the kinds of innovations and developments that this bill is going to fast-track. So I look forward to the day in 10 or 15 years time when we can come back here and say, 'This corporation is no longer needed,' because, like Germany, we will be getting the majority of our energy from renewable energy. I commend the government for the introduction of this bill. I commend the people of Melbourne for the role that they played in getting this on the table, getting it into the House of Representatives and getting it passed by the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.",43
82,Mr TUDGE,NOES," There is a long list of terrible programs introduced by this appalling government: pink batts, green loans, $700 set-top boxes, cash for clunkers-I could go on. But the program which underpins and is proposed by this Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 would have to be right up near the very top of the worse of all programs that this government will be introducing. This bill involves an appropriation of $10 billion from taxpayers to put into a government fund to invest in speculative projects that the commercial sector would not invest in. Hence, I predict that billions of dollars will simply be wasted. It is the sheer magnitude of this that is astounding-$10 billion! If you lined up $100 notes end to end, it would go for 20,000 kilometres-from here to the other side of the world. That is the size of this program that we are talking about, and it is all on the government's credit card-or, should I say, the taxpayers' credit card. It is because it hopes it astounding. I want to raise three core arguments against this bill. Firstly, this proposal, despite the sheer magnitude of it, comes with no mandate and no detailed policy underpinning it. This is simply a grubby deal done with the Greens. Secondly, it is entirely funded by government debt at a time when we can least afford to be adding to it. Thirdly, this bill will have no impact on the renewable energy sector, as the member for Melbourne would like us to believe, because the renewable energy sector is governed by the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target and not by this. What is worse, we will see billions of dollars wasted. If I can go to the first point, the only reason we are discussing this bill at all is because the Greens have forced it upon the government. The member for Melbourne, who spoke just before me, was very clear in that regard. In fact, the Greens first raised this concept back in July 2007 and had the opportunity to implement it through its negotiations with the government when they were discussing the carbon tax proposalthat tax that the Prime Minister said that she would not introduce. As you might recall, Deputy Speaker Grierson, after they had negotiated the carbon tax deal out popped this green energy fund-$10 billion worthand Senator Milne, the deputy chair of the multi-party task force which was investigating this, proudly proclaimed that it was her idea, a great initiative and therefore it will occur, because what the Greens call for the Labor government will introduce. There was no mandate for this. It is a $10billion appropriation, but the government did not take it to the last election to reach a mandate. There was actually no policy paper underpinning this proposal. There is no discussion paper to get community views about this. In fact, the government would not even allow a House of Representatives standing committee to investigate this proposal before we are forced to debate it and vote on it. No, it was just a grubby deal with the Greens. It is as simple as that, with no policy underpinning at all. We cannot just hold the Greens responsible for this fund. Yes, they were the catalyst for it, but Labor agreed in part to $10-billion fund-in part because the philosophy underpinning the fund perfectly aligns with modern Labor's philosophy of having the government at the centre of the economy. Kevin Rudd talked about this, as you will recall, Deputy Speaker Grierson, very loudly and clearly in his essays. Prime Minister Gillard, of course, supports this proposition, and we can see it in the government's other policies, most particularly the National Broadband Network policy. We are the only country in the world that is renationalising its telecommunications network. We see it in the carbon tax policies, which re-regulate the economy. We see it in the 16,000 regulations which the government is proposing. So this bill is actually very much in keeping with modern Labor philosophy of having government right in the heart of our economy. It was not the philosophy in the Hawke-Keating era, when they knew that the private sector had to flourish, but it is the philosophy of modern Labor and this bill is in keeping with this philosophy. The other reason that the Labor government are supporting this, despite it being advocated by the Greens, is because they have realised the politics of it. The first tranche of money-the first $2 billion-will start to be paid out merely weeks before the next federal election is due. What a coincidence! This government has seized upon this and thought, 'Geez, we can put this towards our marginal seats, all underneath the budget radar.' That is the reason. So, yes, it started as a deal driven by the Greens but is very much aligned with the Labor Party philosophy and the whatever-it-takes group that now drives the Labor Party. My second point is that this bill and the financing that underpins it is all done on borrowed money. The concept of this green energy fund managed by the government and this invested in speculative projects that the commercial sector would not touch would be a bad enough concept in and of itself and under fantastic economic circumstances. But it is particularly bad when the government has so categorically blown out our government finances. Of course, we all know the numbers. They started with a $20-billion budget surplus; they started with $70 million in the bank. But for the next five years we had the four biggest budget deficits in Australian political history and now we have net debt of $145 billion. We have interest payments on that debt of $8 billion per annum and we have had to increase the debt ceiling to $300 billion. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Grierson): The member for Aston will resume his seat. The member for Throsby on a point of order? Mr Stephen Jones: My point of order goes to relevance. We are debating the clean energy legislation, not the appropriation bills. Perhaps he has got his speeches mixed up.",45
83,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Thank you, Member for Throsby, I take your point. You have outlined your premise. Please continue Member for Aston.",47
84,Mr TUDGE,NOES,"This goes to the heart of this bill-it is about where it is going to be financed from. It is not getting financed from some magical budget surplus that the government would like to think they will have, but rather this is just getting added to the government debt-$145 billion in net debt already, and this just adds another $10 billion. I can see why the member for Throsby is very sensitive about this topic. He is supposed to be one of the smarter members on the other side of this chamber, so he does not want this discussed. But this is $10 billion",47
85,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I have taken your point that you were relevant, but you will desist from reflecting on other members. Please continue.",47
86,Mr TUDGE,NOES,"This goes straight to the heart of how this is financed. The other side of this chamber will say, 'This actually isn't borrowed money because it doesn't appear on the budget papers'. No, this is the accounting trickery that also goes to the heart of this particular proposal, because the government would like to proclaim this as being a commercial venture and therefore it does not have to appear on the budget papers. It does not have to appear on the underlying cash balance of the government finances. We all know from a few weeks ago (Ms the Treasurer proudly proclaimed that the government was going to be delivering a $1.5 billion surplus in 2012-13, but if you just took this fund alone and you added it to next year's budget it would rapidly turn that tiny budget surplus into a deficit. That is the accounting trickery that also underpins this particular proposal. Ten billion dollars, whether it is on the budget or off the budget, is still $10 billion of taxpayers' cash that will be added to government debt. That is the bottom line. More debt means more upward pressure on interest rates and it means mortgaging future generations. My final point is that this bill will not actually grow the renewable energy sector, but worse it will probably end up with literally billions of dollars wasted. It may seem incredible that there is a $10 billion fund that is going to invest in renewable energy projects and that it will not expand the renewable energy market in Australia. The reason this is the case is that the size of the renewable energy market in Australia is entirely driven by the mandatory renewable energy target, which yesterday, before this bill was introduced, was set at 20 per cent. Today and tomorrow it will still be 20 per cent. So all that $10 billion of investment into renewable energy will do is simply replace projects that otherwise would have got up on a commercial basis with more expensive renewable energy that will be funded through this particular fund. That is what will occur. It will not change the amount of renewable energy that we will actually consume in this country. Most egregiously though, this bill will result in the waste of billions of dollars-that is my prediction. I say that for two simple reasons. First, by definition, and as outlined in this bill and the explanatory memorandum, the $10 billion will be invested into projects that the private sector would not invest in because there would not be a sufficient return and because they would be too speculative. This is where this $10 billion will be invested-into speculative projects. Second, governments have a terrible record at investing into projects generally. It is astounding that we have to repeat the arguments as to why this is the case. It is astounding that we have to repeat the arguments that it is better for the private sector rather than the government sector to invest in commercial projects. The reason is that the government sector (a) does not have the expertise and (b) does not have the same skin in the game that the commercial sector has. The commercial sector has the expertise, has the financing, has the skin in the game, can analyse projects properly and can take the risk. This will be invested into projects that will be highly speculative and it will billions of dollars of taxpayers' money simply wasted. You do not have to believe me, but you can look at some of the evidence abroad and you can look at some of the evidence back home when governments tried to invest in speculative projects. Abroad, of course, most recently we have had the Solyndra projects: the United States set up a similar type of fund and put $700 million into the Solyndra project and, of course, that has all disappeared-$700 million. We have also seen the Solar Trust of America project, which had a $2.1 billion loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy, again under a similar program to what the Labor government is proposing here, and that $2.1 billion just disappeared because it was in a speculative investment which the private sector, quite rightly, did not want to touch. And of course, for the Victorians in this parliament or in the gallery, we only need to look back a decade or two to when Joan Kirner and John Cain were running our state and we had the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, which was investing in all sorts of speculative commercial projects, which quite rightly should not have been invested in with taxpayers' money. That almost bankrupted the state. We thought that we had moved on from this style of economics from the Labor Party, but clearly we have not. I say in conclusion that if the member for Throsby, who will be speaking next, and the other members on the other side of this House honestly believe that this is such a great idea-to appropriate taxpayers' money to invest in speculative projects-then I suggest this weekend, before they vote on this bill, they go out to their community and speak to constituents and say, 'We're going to put $1,250 against your household's credit card to invest in speculative projects' and see what they will result in have to say. (Time expired) Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (11:37): It is a pleasure to be speaking on this package of bills. These are bills for all of Australia, not, as many of those on the other side have suggested, bills for the Labor Party or, as the member for Melbourne was just claiming, bills for the Greens. The objective of these bills is to build capacity in clean energy technology, which is critical for our energy security and critical for the future of the nation. It is also critical that this legislation be passed by the House, because what it actually does is address a market failure. The member for Aston just gave a great dissertation on the importance of markets. He obviously did not get that argument up in his own party room when they were addressing their response to climate change and how we implement policy here in Australia, because if ever there were an example of the rejection of a market based and evidence based approach to dealing with reducing carbon emissions and building a clean energy future it is the policy proposals of the member for Aston's party, which presumably he is going to get up at some point in time and defend in this place. The reason we need this legislation is that essentially we have a market failure. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will encourage private investment that would not otherwise occur to help overcome financial barriers to commercialising and deploying clean energy technologies. There is a global recognition of the importance of moving to clean energy sources, and due to its endowment in the use of low-cost fossil fuels Australia is a late starter in the transformation to clean energy technology. It does not mean that we have not been great innovators in the research and development of clean energy alternatives. Indeed, we have, and the University of Wollongong in my own electorate has been a leader in the area of developing new cleaner energy technologies. But it is one thing to invest in the research and development; it is another thing entirely to bring that research and development onto a commercial footing and to make it available for large-scale use. that purpose that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is directed to. Some background to the bills is important because a number of the contributions to this debate have talked about the process, and I will go to that in some detail. But, in essence, on 17 April this year the government released the expert panel's review on a report on the design of the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the bills before the House accept almost in full the recommendations of that expert panel. I know members of the coalition parties do not like to listen to expert advice in this area. In fact, they reject it at every turn. But the bills before the House today are based on the expert advice commissioned by this government, a detailed consultation process, and a research process and, on the basis of that advice and sound policy making, we have introduced this legislation. Why have a Clean Energy Finance Corporation? It is a part of a suite of government initiatives designed to transform the Australian economy for a cleaner energy future. The government's $10 billion investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will play a role in unlocking significant new private investment and clean energy projects and the supply chain that feeds into these projects. Australia's clean energy market is at an early stage, categorised by incomplete knowledge and a limited experience of the risks associated with investing in these technologies on a commercial basis. That means that there are barriers inhibiting the efficient and effective allocation of capital. The corporation will leverage private sector financing for renewable energy, low emissions and energy efficiency technologies investments, which are critical to the transformation of the Australian economy. The CEFC will make investments and It is encourage private investments in clean energy technologies which build upon the core of our policy-that is, to put a price on carbon, because it is the price on carbon which is key to changing behaviour and to creating a market in this area. There still may be market barriers that prevent these projects from going ahead, such as the incomplete knowledge or the lack of familiarity with investors in these emerging technologies, but the CEFC will have tools at its disposal to tailor investments to address market barriers. Over 50 per cent of the investments of the CEFC will have to be in renewable energy technologies. So it is good legislation and it is directed at that critical purpose of addressing the market failure which exists in ensuring that we are able to move to a clean energy future. There are alternatives to the proposals in the legislation today. One of those alternatives is for us to do nothing. But daily we see the consequences of what doing nothing means. It means, for example, falling behind China, which is investing more in clean energy technology than any other country on the planet, a country which we are daily competing with in terms of our technology and our exports. I would argue that it is in our national interest to ensure that the government is doing its bit to ensure that we as a nation, with an abundant supply of non-renewable and renewable energy sources, is investing in the research and technology and putting in place mechanisms such as the clean energy fund to ensure we can commercialise that research and development. The second alternative not mentioned by the member for Mayo, the member for Aston or, in fact, any of the coalition members who have contributed to this debate is that the consequence of doing nothing means, quite literally, we will be paying more for electricity. This is not because of the carbon price but because every single party, and by inference every single member of this parliament, has signed up to the renewable energy targets. We said that it is our commitment to ensure that we increase the amount that renewable energy contributes to our national energy load. Unless we put in place large-scale investments into large-scale renewable energy projects, we will be relying on the sorts of small-scale projects which currently characterise the renewable energy market. The feed-in tariffs from people having solar panels on the roofs of their houses is the best example that comes to mind. Every economic expert that has had a look at this has said this is probably one of the most expensive ways to generate renewable energy. Quite literally, unless we put in place the sorts of mechanisms that are contemplated by this legislation, we will be paying more for our electricity. We need to ensure that we are not paying more than we need to pay for the renewable energy proportion-that members on that side of the House and members of this side of the House have all signed up to-by investing more in commercialising and bringing into the market large-scale alternative renewable energy or we will be paying more for electricity. That is a fact that those on the other side do not wish to mention. The simple fact of the matter is unless we put in place mechanisms like this, which enable us to commercialise large-scale renewable, alternative and clean energy technologies, we will be paying more for electricity. That is the nub of the policy of those on the other side of the House. Of course, there are other alternatives that have been floated. We had an excellent dissertation from the member for Aston earlier-and repeated by the various contributions from the member for Mayo. I love being in the House when the member for Mayo is speaking. With the amount of energy that he emits, I always feel like bringing in a bag of washing and some soap and throwing it in his direction because, with all the sound and fury and activity, we could get a fair bit of recycling of energy going on-more noise than light. One of the interesting things in his earlier contribution was his astounding statement that he abhors the proposition the government should pick winners, that it is not the role of the government to enter into an area of activity that should be filled by the market and we should not be throwing billions of dollars into this area by essentially picking winners. Obviously, he lost that argument in his own party room because, if you have a look at the coalition's own policy-and this is one of the alternatives to that which we see before the House this morning-you see that their alternative is simply to set up a billion-dollar fund without the rigorous commercial guidelines that are included in the clean energy fund. They would set up a billiondollar fund which would provide grants, presumably to those people who can convince coalition ministers that their proposals are worthy of support. Well, if ever there was an example of a government an alternative government attempting to enter the market and pick winners, it exists in the coalition's policy. Absent in their policy is the proposition that you would put in place commercial principles or that you would require an interest return on the investments made. The same sort of rigour that a bank or a venture capitalist would apply when investing in a new project would be applied in their grants based scheme. I really found it quite amusing when I heard those on the other side, those from the coalition parties, attacking this proposal because it was an example of the government intervening in the market and picking winners. You would hope we would pick winners, because winners are the things that are going to ensure that we do have a clean energy future. I will spend a bit of time addressing some of the other criticisms that have been made by coalition members. In particular, the member for Higgins made the astounding observation: It is important to note that the consultation this bill has been negligible. The consultation process has been virtually zip. I have done some work on this and I can inform the House that since 1992 there have been around 36 parliamentary inquiries into climate change and the appropriate government response to it. I have about six pages here which list, line by line, those inquiries from 1992 through till today. I would be happy to table those pages if other members of the House do not believe me. There have been over 36 inquiries since 1992 looking into this area. The legislation, as I already said, follows the report of the expert committee. This expert committee was chaired by Ms Jillian Broadbent, an eminent Australian who has a 30-year career in banking. I know her because she happens to be the vicechancellor of the University of Wollongong as well. Her career in the finance and business sector, I would say, is entirely remarkable. She is a board member of Woolworths and Coca-Cola. She is known to all members in this place. She is a Reserve Bank board member and she has served on the boards of Woodside and Qantas. If you were thinking about anyone who could bring to this area a more commercial focus, you would think it would be the chair, Jillian Broadbent, together with other eminent members of the expert committee. The expert committee received 151 public submissions to the inquiry. On the basis of those public submissions and their own research, they said to the government that they see the establishment of a clean energy finance corporation playing an important part in addressing the government's vision for a clean energy future, tackling climate change, lowering carbon emissions and transforming Australia's energy sector. In attacking the consultation process which has led to the introduction of these bills, the coalition are on attacking the process that has been set up by the eminent people on the expert committee and the recommendations that were made. The expert committee was not the first time we dipped our toe in this water in this particular parliament. It follows the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation's inquiry in October 2011, an inquiry that received several hundred submissions and held numerous public hearings. I have also had a look at the number of questions that we have had in this House on the particular matter. Over 300 questions have been asked and in excess of 20 matters of public importance debates have been had on this in the last 12 months alone. In my estimation, on the parliamentary debates(Time expired) Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (11:52): I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012. To start with, putting aside the carbon tax and the NBN, this legislation is one of the most economically irresponsible pieces of legislation that have ever been introduced into this parliament, for what this legislation actually does is to take $10 billion-that is $10,000 million-and hand it over to as yet unidentified groups to spend on so-called green investment projects-projects that the private investors would not touch with a 40-foot barge pole. Let us not forget that on top of that $10 billion there is an additional $57 million in the forward estimates thrown in for some sundry expenses. So where is the government going to get this money from? Where is the government going to find another $10 billion? It simply plans to borrow it-every single last cent, most of which will be borrowed from foreigners. What the people in the gallery need to understand is that every time you borrow money someone has to write the guarantee. So it is the Australian taxpayer who is writing the guarantee for this borrowing. In fact, every Australian family of four has to guarantee $2,000 to underwrite this legislation. That is the cost. This bill, like many others, is destined to end in tears. Mark my words: when the carnage of the long-term economic damage arising from this government's policies is finally tallied and engraved on its tombstone, this boondoggle will be right at the top. It is not surprising when I look at the speakers list that there is a complete dearth of speakers from the government side that are prepared to come into this chamber and mark their name down in the Hansard as having spoken in favour of this bill, because they know that, like the long list of other failed so-called green schemes, this will end in tears and a very substantial part of that $10 billion will simply be vaporised in failed schemes. For those that have been foolhardy enough to come into this chamber and debate on this bill, if you think that it is really a good idea to invest this $10 billion and you truly believe that this money is going to be wisely spent, it is very simple: you should be putting your own money up. You should be writing the guarantees out to provide for these loans. Why don't you put your own superannuation savings up? You simply will not, because you know this is going to end in tears. The absurd waste of resources that have so far been expended on so-called green energy in the delusion that we can take action to manipulate our climate should make us weep. Consider how many lives could be changed for the better if, instead of being wasted on this boondoggle, this $10 billion were invested to help our kids with disabilities and their carers, taken to fix up the mess of our hospitals or used to invest in our roads, in our public transport or in fast rail. Every cent that is spent has an opportunity cost. I would like to refer to a few words in the explanatory memorandum to this bill which clearly demonstrate that the authors of this bill have not got a clue. It speaks of a government that knows little about the real world of industry and business and is simply determined to try to reshape it in its own politically correct image. The explanatory memorandum to this bill states: The Corporation will finance Australia's clean energy sector using financial products and structures to address the barriers currently inhibiting investment. The barrier currently inhibiting investment is that so-called green energy is hopelessly inefficient. No-one is going to invest in green energy unless they are guaranteed a huge taxpayer subsidy. The explanatory memorandum goes on: The Corporation will apply capital through a commercial filter … To talk of a commercial filter and to suggest that a commercial filter can somehow magically limit losses to 7½ per cent of its capital in unsuccessful projects is an absolute absurdity. It is the complete commercial naivety that you would expect from someone that invests in a Nigerian 419 scam. But sadly this is the type of commercial naivety we have seen over and over again from this government, from GroceryWatch to the BER to the set-top projects et cetera, et cetera, cetera. In the time left, let us have a quick look some of the past so-called green schemes that supposedly would have passed through a commercial filter. I am sure we can all remember the ZeroGen project in Queensland, promoted by their former Premier Mr Beattie. A press release from 30 August 2007 titled 'Smart state takes step closer to clean coal with ZeroGen' states: Premier Peter Beattie welcomed news today that development of vital technology to help secure the future of Queensland's coal industry and thousands of jobs it creates had reached a major milestone. We all know what happened to ZeroGen. When our then resources minister, Ian Macfarlane, warned that ZeroGen in Queensland would collapse, Mr Beattie accused Mr Macfarlane of being on drugs. Well, the only thing that went up in smoke was $50 million of taxpayers' money. Then take an example of a project passing a commercial filter, with the example of Solyndra from the USA. Solyndra was meant to be the flagship of the Obama administration's effort to drive the clean energy industry. Back in May 2010, President Obama visited the solar panel manufacturer's Californian headquarters to celebrate the $500 million of American taxpayers' money that he had thrown at it. The President declared: The true engine of economic growth will always be companies like Solyndra. How misguided. Solyndra is now closed. The $500 million of taxpayers' funds has been vaporised. But even worse, the so called clean and green solar manufacturer has closed its doors leaving behind tonnes of toxic waste. While the solar energy industry claims to be clean and green, the Solyndra debacle highlighted the fact that toxic waste is et produced in the manufacture of solar cells. This has been a problem for years. Solar at panel production creates many toxic by-products including silicon tetrachloride, an extremely toxic substance which renders crops infertile, causes skin burns and increases the likelihood of lung disease, and transforms into acids and poisonous hydrogen chloride gas when exposed to air. The lessons from these debacles should be clear: when governments force taxpayers to subsidise any business it almost always leads to economic damage and collapse. Today, the we see the green energy bubble bursting around the world. And around the world, the claims of those that prophesied for the IPCC are collapsing. Just take the recent statement from Professor Klaus-Eckart Puls, a leading German physicist and meteorologist: Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data – first I started with a sense of doubt but I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it. … … … … Scientifically it is sheer absurdity to think we can get a nice climate by turning a CO2 adjustment knob. He also said: The CO2-climate hysteria … is propagated by people who are in it for lots of money, attention and power. And that is what this bill does. It hands over lots of money-$10,000 million. We should be looking at what is happening around the world. In Germany, they have already given away $130 billion in green subsidies, mostly to solar power companies. Yet in Germany, solar power makes up a minuscule percentage of the German power supply while at the same time doing nothing towards the original objective of reducing German greenhouse gas emissions. So it is no surprise that, last February, Germany's Minister of Economy and Technology announced a pullback from green power subsidies, stating that such a cost was 'a threat to the economy'. In Spain, where they have poured billions of dollars of cash into solar and wind power subsidies, they have little to show for this except a $25 billion increase in that financially crippled nation's debt, an unemployment rate of 25 per cent, and, for those under 30, it is getting close to 50 per cent. In the United States, where green power companies have received more than $4 billion to build wind farms, a recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that these projects have created only 7,200 temporary-temporary!-construction jobs then at the amazing cost of US$600, 000 per job and only 300 permanent jobs at the unbelievable figure of US$14 million per job. Around the world, the green energy bubble is bursting. Take the recent comments from Fiona Kobusingye, a director and coordinator of the Congress of Racial Equality in Uganda. Ms Kobusingye wrote: Life in Africa is often nasty, impoverished and short. AIDS kills 2.2 million Africans every year according to WHO (World Health Organization) reports. Lung infections cause 1.4 million deaths, malaria 1 million more, intestinal diseases 700,000. Diseases that could be prevented with simple vaccines kill an additional 600,000 annually, while war, malnutrition and life in filthy slums send countless more parents and children to early graves. And yet, day after day, Africans are told the biggest threat we face is – global warming. … … … It's the almost total absence of electricity keeping us from creating jobs and becoming modern societies. It's that these policies KILL. … … … Not having electricity means millions of Africans don't have refrigerators to preserve food and medicine. … … … Not having electricity also means disease and death. It means millions die from lung infections, because they have to cook and heat with open fires … … … … Hypothetical global warming a hundred years from now is worse than this? Ms Kobusingye concludes: Telling Africans they can't have electricity and economic development – except what can be produced with some wind turbines or little solar panels – is immoral. It is a crime against humanity. The other reason the green energy bubble is bursting is the misguided theory that renewables will soon be able to compete with coal and gas, because coal and gas will become more and more expensive. That is how as the theory goes. But this overlooks the ingenuity of the free markets in developing new technologies-the very type of new technologies that this bill actually retards. In the last couple of years, we have seen the price of coal fall from a high of $140 per tonne down to, today, around $55 per tonne. Gas, back in 2008, was $125 per kilojoule; today, the price of gas has fallen less than $25. So our conventional production of electricity should be getting cheaper. So it is no surprise that we have seen the failure of billions of dollars wasted on green energy subsidies that not only increase our power costs but also do absolutely nothing to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide. An article titled 'Perfect storm hits green energy stocks' recently reported that 10 wind and solar energy equipment manufacturers in China, India, Europe and the USA have seen their share prices collapse by 86 to 98 per cent since 2008. That is why this scheme is destined to fail. But there is perhaps one thing that we could invest this money in. Perhaps this fund could buy 1,000 pairs of $2-pliers and send them off to every morgue in the country. The climate change commissioner, Professor Flannery, following his expertise in predicting endless drought, now wants undertakers to pull the fillings from dead people. He said the solution for undertakers was to remove them, adding, 'You just need a set of pliers.' It is a $2 solution. This bill is a tragedy and a train wreck waiting to happen. The ultimate victims will be the ordinary working people of this country. (Time expired)",47
87,Mr DREYFUS,NOES,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (12:07): I rise to speak on the group of clean energy bills that are before the House. The bills include the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, which will establish the long-awaited Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and a number of clean energy bills which make improvements to the Clean Energy Act 2011, the Fuel Tax Act 2006, the Excise Act 1901, to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These amendments will improve the working of the Carbon Farming Initiative, enhance the powers of the Clean Energy Regulator, improve working relations with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and amend the coverage of gaseous fuels under the carbon-pricing legislation. These are important bills because they take Australia closer to a low-carbon future. They are important bills because by establishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation they will help us unlock our national potential by securing a strong and sustainable renewable energy industry. The establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will act to overcome market failures by providing financing for Australian based renewable energy technologies, low-emissions technologies and energy efficiency projects. This is nation building; this means jobs for Australians. These bills are an example of the best aspects of the Australian Labor Party being forward thinking and being unashamedly determined in our desire to reshape our nation for the better. It is a great honour to be part of a government that is putting in place such a substantial change that will create jobs and reduce pollution. I know that there have been a great many speakers on this bill and I know that there will be more. But I would like to take the time to outline in a little more detail the shape of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation because it is such an important initiative. I think this is important because, usual, we will see the same grab bag of untruths, misrepresentations and outright lies from the opposition. The speeches we had yesterday and today and the hysteria that we continue to see from the opposition simply underscore the vast gulf between the two main political parties. We are a party with an optimistic vision for the future. We are acting to put in place far-reaching legislation that will reshape this nation for the better. The coalition is a party with no vision and whose only reason for being is to oppose. They will say and do anything at all, no matter what the cost to the nation as a whole and no matter what the cost to the lives of all Australians, if the Leader of the Opposition believes it might take him closer to the Lodge. The latest example of this insistence on acting as wrecker, as opposer-in-chief no matter what the cost, is their opposition to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Let us go through the facts. It is clear that while the carbon price will provide a massive incentive to invest in clean energy, new technologies do face a range of obstacles in attracting financing. Because of this, the government is creating the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which will invest in renewable energy technologies, lowemissions technologies and efficiency projects. The government will provide $2 billion in funding per annum for five years, and any interest earned will be available for reinvestment. This bill requires that the corporation have at least half of its investments in renewable technologies by 30 June 2018. The corporation will apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions and will focus on projects and technologies at the later stages of development. This is to ensure that the corporation will invest responsibly and manage risk while also making sure the corporation values any positive externalities as which are generated by financing. Establishing the corporation will mean that we have taken a very large step towards reducing our carbon emissions. We must act now or be left behind. The need to establish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a pressing one. I am prompted by another ridiculous speech, the one that we heard just now from the member for Hughes, one of the climate change deniers of those oppositeand there are quite a number of them. We need to face this. There is a clear consensus among climate scientists that climate change is real and we will have significant future impacts if no action is taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The world is acting to reduce carbon emissions and to create a global low-carbon economy. That is what the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is for. That is why the 195 nations of the world that are participating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meet every year in one very large formal meeting and at a range of smaller meetings during the year. There is agreement on the end objective, which is to reduce the world's carbon emissions. Of course, as is always the case in large multilateral negotiations, there is not yet agreement on energy- how the world is to go about reducing carbon emissions, but many nations are already acting to reduce national emissions. Australia, in the Clean Energy Future package and in this part of the Clean Energy Future package setting up the Clean Energy energy Finance Corporation, is joining that global effort. If we do not act now, we will be behind and we will miss out on the global jobs that will come from investing in clean energy and investing in renewable technologies. A low-carbon global economy is coming and it is up to us to decide whether we help Australian business to take advantage of this or simply bury our heads in the sand. There are many countries around the world that are assisting their businesses to move on lowcarbon technologies and to invest in lowcarbon businesses. We should be doing the same. Many other countries have acted to put in place similar financing arrangements to this Clean Energy Finance Corporation to kick-start the clean economy. I can give some examples. These are some of the larger finance corporations, which countries around the world have, that invest in new technologies, that invest in sustainable technologies and that invest in low-carbon technologies. I would start with the example of the United States Department of Energy, which has issued loans and guaranteed loans to encourage early-stage commercial use of new or significantly improved technology and energy projects. The United States Department of Energy has given to around 35 projects, between September 2009 and September 2011, loans and guarantees worth around $35 billion, dwarfing the size of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that this legislation proposes. Germany's main development financing agency, KfW, is also a significant financier of clean energy by providing commercial banks with liquidity at low rates. This same German agency has provided funding to 80 per cent of Germany's newly installed wind energy and 40 per cent of the solar panels installed in 2010. It is estimated that this agency will commit over €100 billion in the energy sector over the next five years. Another example of international action is left Brazil. The Brazilian economic and social development bank, BNDES, provides long term finance with a very strong clean energy focus. In 2011 this bank approved financing of approximately US$1.8 billion for the construction of wind farms, and there are a range of other projects. I have had a presentation from that Brazilian development bank and I know the range of clean technology projects that the Brazilian development bank is investing in. The world is acting and many countries are putting in similar financing arrangements to those that we are proposing with this legislation for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It is time for Australia to play its part. As part of the clean energy future package we must look after people. I think it is worth talking briefly about the impact of the carbon price more generally and what we are doing to ensure that we are helping working Australians, mainly because it is an issue that the other side of this House raises again and again. They consistently and deliberately get it so wrong. Our whole reason for being in politics is to provide support to working families, to improve services and to make this country fairer. Apparently the reason the Leader of the Opposition is in politics is to help Clive Palmer. Our budget-and our clean energy future package-contains important measures to help households make ends meet. More than 1.5 million families will benefit from increases to family tax benefit part A from 1 July next year, with nearly half of those taking home an extra $600 a year. A new supplementary payment will help the unemployed, students and parents on income support meet the cost of essential bills, worth $210 a year for singles and $350 a year for couples. Earlier this week pensioners started to receive upfront household assistance payments of $250 for singles and $380 for couples combined. These payments will be paid straight into pensioners' bank accounts over the coming few weeks. About 2.1 million pensioners who are on the maximum rate of the pension will be better off by $134 a year for singles and $201 a year for couples, on average-a buffer of more than 65 per cent against the expected modest impact of the carbon price. And 93 per cent of pensioner households will be at least 20 per cent better off, thanks to these new payments. Of course, we are putting in place tax cuts for all taxpayers earning up to $80,000 a year from 1 July through a tripling of the tax-free threshold. By advocating to abolish the carbon price and scrap this assistance, the Leader of the Opposition wants to make millions of pensioners worse off and millions of benefitrecipients worse off. I think that when such an opposition engages in such negative scare campaigns-an opposition that opposes sensible measures like the bills that are before the House today-we should also look at the alternative that is being presented by that opposition. We should look at the opposition's so-called plan-a cobbled together policy that they have no intention of pursuing if they ever do hold office-its direct action policy. Do not be fooled. This a plan which is not designed to reduce emissions. All the policy is designed to do is give an appearance of action, give some kind of appearance that the opposition care about this policy area. The member for Hughes, who spoke before me, needs clearly to take up with the leadership of his party this direct action policy, because it appears that he thinks that we should not be seeking to reduce Australia's national carbon emissions and, indeed, that the whole world should not be seeking to reduce carbon emissions. If that is so, he needs to take up with the leadership of his party the Direct Action Plan, the purpose of which is said to be to reduce Australia's national emissions. Their direct action plan-if you can call it that-is even worse than this. It involves the purchase of abatement of emissions at taxpayers' expense. That method of attempting to reduce emissions has been tried before and has proved to be entirely ineffective and very expensive. Everyone looking at the alternative plan to reduce Australia's emissions, from those who like to badge themselves as the alternative government, needs to bear in mind that families will be worse off under the plan put forward by the Liberal Party. Families will have to pay $1,300 more in taxes and that money will be given straight to the big polluters. It is mystifying to think what the coalition's policy is in this area when one listens to speeches like that delivered by the member for Hughes or those regularly delivered by the member for Dawson or the member for Tangney. These are selfexpressed climate change deniers who would assert that there is no purpose in seeking to reduce Australia's carbon emissions.",55
88,Mr Morrison,NOES,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy, I would ask the member to withdraw the slur on those is members. He knows full well the use of the term 'denier' has a connotation that he would be particularly familiar with and I would ask him to withdraw that.",58
89,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, There is no point of order. The member for Cook will resume his seat.,58
90,Mr DREYFUS,NOES,He is wasting the House's time with his nonsensical objection. I absolutely reject the suggestion put forward by the member for Cook. Mr Morrison interjecting,58
91,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Cook will desist from interrupting.,58
92,Mr DREYFUS,NOES,"It is ridiculous and I will repeat: these are climate change deniers on the other side of this House. It is an entirely legitimate phrase. It is an appropriate phrase to use about those on the other side of the House who do not accept the science of climate change, and they need to start accepting the science of climate change. The member for Cook is lending his assistance to the ridiculous suggestions put forward on the other side of this House. We are acting on climate change and will continue to do so. (Time expired)",59
93,Mr MATHESON,NOES," I rise today to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and the suite of bills to amend the Clean Energy Act 2011. This set of bills seeks to establish an incorporated entity under Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to be known as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, CEFC. These bills will give CEFC substantial powers to invest in financial assets for the development of Australian based renewable energy and lowemission technologies along with energyefficiency projects. The bills will also provide the CEFC with the power to enter into investment agreements itself, provide commercial loans and, as well, make investments for its subsidiaries. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is the brainchild of the Greens members of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, of course. It is, however, nothing more than a slush fund for the Greens to grant funding to projects that fit within their green utopian view of the world. As the member for Mayo brought up earlier today, the CEO's salary is outside the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction so what are we going to have? Are we going to have a union hack being the CEO, or are we going to have Mr Bob Brown himself coming back to head it up? If I were a betting man, I am sure that they know who it is going to be. For the creation of the CEFC's special account, $10 billion will be appropriated over five years with the first instalment of $2 billion to be paid on 1 July 2013. The government intends the CEFC to be selfsustaining once it has matured. Any funds returned to the CEFC for its investments will be available for reinvestment. While this sounds wonderful and economically sound, the bill already predicts a loss to this monumental taxpayer investment. Indeed, Treasury officials have confirmed to a House of Representatives Economics Committee that around 7.5 per cent of the loans for investments made by the CEFC will not be recovered. the Mr Morrison interjecting Ms King interjecting",59
94,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, Order! Would the member for Macarthur resume his seat. It is very difficult to hear what the member for Macarthur is saying while the member for Cook and the parliamentary secretary conduct an ongoing exchange in light of the recent point of order.,59
95,Mr MATHESON,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In yet another feat of tricky accounting, most of the lending is offbudget, yielding a deceptive budget surplus. This is risky business indeed. There will be operating costs and there will be write-offs, but the tell-tale signs that this scheme is yet another Greens inspired pipedream is the concessional component of the loans made by the CEFC to renewable energy projects. Only a Labor and Greens government would borrow money at one rate and then lend it out for incredibly risky projects at an even lower rate. This aspect of the CEFC will expose the belly of the beast to the world of heartache. We have seen first hand the problems created when a government backs a so-called winner. In Australia alone we have witnessed the monumental collapse of the Queensland government's ZeroGen project, costing taxpayers well over $100 million of losses. This was despite many warnings from the opposition as well as industry experts that this project was doomed to fail from the start. The government's $700 million Solar Flagships program in Moree and the Queensland Solar Dawn projects are struggling to gain industry support. For international examples we only need to look at the United States with the monumental failure of their $700 million Solyndra project, a project that had been the President's shining example of a greenenergy company. The failure of Beacon Power also occurred under a remarkably similar scheme to this one proposed by this government, as did Solar Trust of America which collapsed despite having a $2.1 billion loan guarantee from the US energy department. History does not bode well for the CEFC. If the finance sector is not convinced of a project's economic viability, why does the government think that it should then expose billions of taxpayers' funds to these exceptionally risky projects. Indeed, the Greens believe, as announced by Senator Milne, that the CEFC will be able to access finance from the private sector on top of its own taxpayer funding for renewable energy projects. Judging from the interest that the private sector has shown in our nation's largest renewable energy projects, this may not be as easy as the senator thinks. The corporation has a lofty aim to overcome the market barriers to big renewable energy investments. However, one point that this government seems to miss time and time again is that the private sector knows that money does not grow on trees. Private investors in general part with their hard earned money wisely. The private sector will not often expose itself to anything that it sees as too risky, whether this be actual investment risk, the perceived risks of a new type of investment, or pressure from the tightening of purse strings by banks looking towards Europe's pending financial disaster. So where the private sector dares not tread, this government is blindly barging ahead with billions of taxpayers' dollars hastily shoved into its pockets ready to be thrown at risky and commercially unviable projects. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill also establishes a board of the CEFC. The board will be tasked with the statutory responsibilities for decision making and managing the corporation's investments. The government has gone to lengths to claim that the CEFC will be an independent bodyindeed, the legislation stipulates that the CEFC will make investment decisions independently of the government. However, this independence is skin deep. The bill requires ministers to issue an investment mandate for the corporation. Indeed, the explanatory memorandum of the bill states: The investment mandate may include, but not be limited to, directions on matters of risk and return, eligibility criteria of investments in renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficiency projects, allocation of investments, limits on concessional investment, types of financial instruments in which the Corporation may invest and broad operational matters. It seems to me that this is one hell of a mandate for a minister to give an independent corporation. It is apparently clear that the government is happy to allow the CEFC to independently select the individual investments and projects for funding, but the criteria for investment selection as well as the suitability of a project will be tightly controlled by the minister and the government of the day. To further the government's grip on the CEFC's so-called independence, the investment mandate will take the form of a written nondisallowable legislative instrument. This is consistent with ministerial directions issued to statutory bodies such as the Future Fund. The bill also states that the CEFC will apply a commercial filter when making investment decisions. Business hopes to ensure that the CEFC will invest responsibly and manage risk so that it is financially self-sufficient able to achieve a targeted rate of return. One of the objectives for the CEFC, as agreed by the CEFC expert review panel, is to apply capital through a commercial filter to facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector, thus preparing and positioning the Australian economy and industry for a clean energy future. Nobody would question the need for increased flows of finances into the renewable energy and low emission energy technology sector. However, this raises at least one very serious concern about the potential for the CEFC to have disproportionate impacts on the market and at the same time not stimulate tangible results for progress in renewable energy projects. The board of the CEFC will have to be assiduous in their decision making to avoid creating chaos in the renewable energy sector. This concern has largely been ignored by the government in their eagerness to pick a winner and pull the renewable rabbit out of their clean energy hat. The renewable energy target is the best way to ensure that the private sector continues to invest in affordable and sustainable renewable energy. The coalition has offered bipartisan support to a commitment to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply will come from renewable sources by 2020. It is highly unlikely that the government's $10 billion slush fund will be invested successfully and even less likely that any new renewable energy above the 20 per cent target would ever be realised as there is no incentive for energy companies to purchase higher cost renewable power above their mandatory target. The renewable energy target has been the driving force behind private sector investment in the renewable energy sector. The renewable energy schemes that have been able to show their viability and return and on investment have, of course, secured finance. The private sector has identified the most cost-effective and efficient means to produce renewable energy. Through thorough risk assessments and extensive analysis of project viability, the market has supported renewable energy projects that will be financially sustainable. This outcome, which is undeniably a win for consumers and the environment, is in direct contrast to the objectives of the CEFC, which are to provide finance for technologies which the market considers to be unproven, too speculative or too risky for commercial financing. Origin Energy hit the nail on the head in their submission to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation expert review. They assert that the CEFC could aid in the operation of effective markets 'if it is able to identify and address financial market failures to investment'. However, Origin Energy is very careful to point out the risks of the CEFC to the renewable energy sector if it only serves as another source of unsustainable subsidy or high cost technologies. For the government to now introduce this $10 billion slush fund will throw a spanner into the works for large scale renewable energy projects that have already sought out and obtained commercial financing. New projects that are fortunate enough to secure the concessional loans and finance from the CEFC will have the benefit of receiving direct subsidies and could, in turn, jeopardise the viability of current investments financed through far more expensive commercial lending. If the CEFC merely adds its $10 billion to the mix of high-cost technologies that are economically unviable in the long term, then all that will eventuate are higher electricity prices paying for unsustainably expensive technology. Programs very similar to the CEFC have experienced massive failure and controversy in the United States. Billions of taxpayers' money in loan guarantees have been lost because the United States government tried to pick a winner. This bill is economically irresponsible and unlikely to achieve its stated aims. There is little doubt that the CEFC will end up as nothing more than a $10 billion slush fund to be spent on the whimsical dreams of the Greens, a waste of taxpayers' money and a waste of an opportunity to truly help the Australian environment in an innovative and practical way. That is the price you pay to stay in government. I move on to the three bills which seek to amend the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill, which seeks to amend the Clean Energy Act, the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act , the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act, the Fuel Tax Act and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting-NGER-Act. Amendments proposed in the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill aim to extend the reach of the carbon tax to include fuels which are eligible for the opt-in scheme and the definition of carbon dioxide equivalence. This bill will effectively bring LPG, LNG and CNG directly under the carbon tax. There have been some reasonable technical amendments to the way the Carbon Farming Initiative, or CFI, is administered. These include the backdating of a methodology to enable greater access to the scheme for projects that were underway before the CFI came about. This will allow existing projects to benefit from the scheme. The Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill also amends provisions in the NGER Act to allow people to nominate who has the operational control of a facility where it is not already clear. This amendment is necessary for organisations where there is no majority owner or where the entity may be controlled by a trust. Other elements of this bill seek to amend the Clean Energy Act and the Fuel Tax Act to apply the carbon tax to LPG and LNG rather than through fuel tax arrangements. The Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill and Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 amend the Excise Act and the Customs Tariff Act to provide that, from 1 July 2012, CNG used for non-transport purposes can be covered by the carbon tax because they are no longer subject to the effective carbon price through the fuel tax system. This system will be similar to the structure provided for the aviation industry to administer their carbon tax liabilities. This is yet another tax grab by the government and I cannot support it. When I look at the amount of money that is being spent here and I try to explain this bill to people in my community, they say, 'We're a growth centre in south-western Sydney and under 16 years of a state Labor government we received very limited support for infrastructure in a growth centre.' There is nothing in this budget for the people of Macarthur. I look at the roads round my area like Narellan Road, Spring Farm Parkway, Camden Valley Road, Bagdally Road, Raby Road. These are all connectors to the growth centre, to Campbelltown city. There is also St Andrews Road, Denham Court and Campbelltown Road. There is not even a reasonable sports centre for Narellan or a PCYC for Gregory Hills. When I explain these types of bills, which are slush funds for the Greens for investment in projects that are never going to get off ground, my community say, 'What is going on with this government?' You go door-knocking and people say, 'This is the worse government I have seen in my lifetime.' I am talking to people who are 50 or 60 or 70 years of age who saw the Whitlam government and how bad that was. All of a sudden they are saying to me they have never, in their whole lives, seen a government that has wasted money like this government. The government allow growth centres to occur in north-western and southwestern Sydney. The government does not give any funding towards these sorts of projects. They cannot build sustainable communities. There is a distinct lack of infrastructure. Then we give $10 billion away to a bunch of whackos and the Greens that are going to run these programs. The people of my community just go: 'What is going on here? How come they're getting $10 billion and we're getting nothing?' There is nothing in the budget for the people of Macarthur. They walk up to me day in and day out",59
96,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Macarthur will address the bill before the House.,63
97,Mr MATHESON,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, when you talk about poor policy and poor political parties and when you have a government that is a hung parliament, take a look at the deal that has been struck between the Independents, the Greens and the Labor Party. My community are becoming so frustrated at the lack of funds that are going into building sustainable communities and the lack of infrastructure. When they ask me what is going on I say to them, 'Go along and watch question time. When we ask questions the questions are never answered. When we ask for money, the money is never delivered.' The south-west growth centre was the released for urban development all of a sudden, and then no infrastructure. Nothing in the budget for my community, nothing in the budget for Macarthur. They ask me, 'How does all this occur? There is all the pork-barrelling that occurs with the government and the Independents. All of a sudden there are billions and billions of dollars being given away because of a hung parliament and because people have the balance of power.' Other communities miss out because the Independents and the Greens are reaping all the money that was sown. It is put into their pockets and given to their communities and it is not being equally shared amongst the broader Australian community.",63
98,Mr WINDSOR,NOES," I think we just saw a very good example of why the people of south-western Sydney deserve better. It is a great shame to hear a discussion such as that, particularly given that the basis of this debate that we are having-and the clean energy bills are part of that-is that both sides of this parliament agree on the target in reductions: that of five per cent. We have this extraordinary circumstance that has developed in this place, and I understand why it has developed; it is because the Leader of the Opposition decided very early on in the hung parliament negotiations that he was going to play the game as if there were a majority government. Rather than become part of a process for various determinations, whether they be about economics, regional development or clean energy, he decided-and his apostles have followed quite blindly; and I think that the speech we just heard is a classic example of that-that this was an issue where even though they agreed with the absolute target-the five per cent reduction and 1990 levels by 2020-that he would play the game of majority government and minority opposition. So rather than be part of a constructive process they have set out to develop a process that sounds as though they deny that climate change exists. And there is some discussion about that at the moment. Their policy position is that climate change is occurring, that as a nation we should do something about it and the target level is identical to the government's-that of five per cent. The method of achieving the reduction in the emissions is different. I am a farmer; I have been working with soils all my adult life and if there is one thing that I think I might have a little bit of knowledge about it is soil humus and organic matter and the way in which it impacts on the productivity levels of soil, the ways in which the soil processes work, the infiltration rates of water et cetera and, obviously, the plants that grow in that soil. I have been an advocate for soil carbon for many, many years-when the opposition just laughed it off, years ago when they were in government. If soil carbon were the answer to this I would be the first to say that the Abbott way is the way to achieve the outcome. Regrettably, it is not. That is not to suggest that we should not introduce-and the package of bills actually does introduce-incentives to encourage changes in farming technologies that do have an impact on soil humus and organic matter levels and that do have an influence on moisture infiltration that will have an influence on drought proofing soils. But it is unproven that in most of Australian soils there is the capacity to develop an increase in soil carbon levels that can be retained through dry periods as well as wet. It is unproven and probably will not be proven that our soils will be able to accumulate vast quantities of carbon and hold it. In some parts of Europe and parts of North America the soils will be able to do that and, hopefully, in the future we will be able to improve on our soils even if global warming ceases to be a debate. We should be trying to improve our soils. The point I am making is that if you have both sides of parliament agreeing on the target, surely the most cost-effective way of getting to the target would be the way that we would go? The previous Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, could see that pathway. Obviously, he could see that a market mechanism was the way to go. We have this extraordinary juxtaposition in the sense of political philosophies: the party that believes in a market mechanism is arguing against it. Some would say that the party that historically has not agreed with a market mechanism would normally go the other way! So we have this circumstance that has developed where raw politics is being played in this issue-raw politics. I think it is a great shame that the Leader of the Opposition did not take the opportunity to be involved in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. He was invited, or his representatives were invited, to be part of that process. I was part of that process and I was very proud to be part of it. I think there were some enormous issues to be dealt with and, in fact, it is going to be a hung parliament that is actually going to do something about it. The Leader of the Opposition, as I said, decided to play opposition politics in a parliament where he could have become part of the government, in a sense, in terms of the governance of some of the policy issues. The climate change debate is one of those significant issues. From a regional perspective, and with the nonsense that is being peddled out there to create fear in the minds of people that the sky will fall in on 1 July because of this initiative-the carbon-pricing arrangementmany people are starting to recognise that there are extraordinary opportunities. And this investment fund that we are debating today is part of that. It is not the totality the opportunities. There are enormous opportunities for renewable resources-wind, solar, geothermal, bioenergy; the list goes on. I would like to spend a moment talking about a few examples. Most of those opportunities will occur in regional Australia. They will not be located in the cities-because of landscape issues et cetera. The opportunities of the new clean energy future are going to be in the country. Some of them may be agriculturalbiodigestion of waste, bioenergy from biomass and those sorts of processes. In fact, we could see some of our agricultural land turned over to the production of biofuel-not through the production of food and then into biofuel but the production of biomass and then to biofuel. Those are the opportunities that are going to be out there. I will give you a couple of examples of the sorts of things that I am talking about, the real opportunities that are out there. James Cook University is not in my electorate but it is part of the deal that the last speaker spoke about between the Independents and the government. Part of that arrangement was that some money be put into research of biomass and biofuel. James Cook University has been doing some extraordinary work in terms of algae in water-and I think the minister for regional Australia, who is in the chair, would be aware of this. The university is showing extraordinary leadership in this debate and has been doing so for some years. Some of that money is going towards that research. Originally when they started off they were looking at the possibility of using algae as a source of biodiesel. As the research has gone on and been developed up in terms of the varieties of algae and how to actually farm algae-it is a farming process rather than an industrial process-they have found that the uses for algae are far greater than just biodiesel. The protein in algae can of be used for food production. I am sure members have dogs. I imagine that the energy member for Cook, who is in the chamber, has a dog. He is shaking his head. Mr Morrison interjecting",63
99,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,"Anyway, I am sure he has had occasion to have a tin of dog food in his cupboard. When you tip out a tin of Pal dog food the contents remain upright. It is the properties in algae that make it stand upright",65
100,Unknown,NOES,Honourable members interjecting,65
101,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,"The member for Higgins should make way for that great Treasurer of the past, Mr Costello. The former member for Higgins would not have interjected like that about a product of the future such as algae! Algae can be used for a whole range of products. For those who have not been to James Cook University, it is worth a visit there to see international scientists from all over the world, young people in their 30s, working on our future. There is a lot of talk about food security into the future-how we are going to produce protein for a growing population et cetera. There is a lot of talk that we need clean energy, we need to reduce CO2 and we need to reduce greenhouse emissions in the atmosphere. There is a lot of talk that we need to clean up emissions from coal fired power stations. Well, this is just one example of how those sorts of things are happening. As we speak, the people at James Cook University are developing pilot operations at two power stations. Why are they doing that? What they intend to do-and they have done this at quite large trial sites-is use the flue gases from the power station to grow algae in a confined environment. They use massive bladders that are half full of water. They put algae in them and then they harvest the algae. I asked them: what is the potential of this? We have coal fired power stations producing emissions and we are trying to come to grips with that through a whole range of options. Is it possible to capture the CO2 emissions, put that through an algae farm and convert it into protein products? The answer is yes. An algae farm of something like 10,000 acres, in theory at least, could ingest the flue gases of a normal sized coal fired power station. That is why we need a Clean Energy Finance Corporation. There is an endless list of projects. The minister in the chair is aware of the activities that are going on in the meat processing business to convert their wastenot only the waste from the animals but also the paunch waste et cetera from the animals' insides-into an opportunity, into energy and into fertiliser. That is waste that they may well be charged $23 a tonne for if they have over 25,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. They want to turn it into energy, into fertiliser into cleaner water to be used for other productive purposes. I think what we need here is some degree of leadership. Those people are out there. They are at the cutting edge of getting some of this technology right and getting it put in place to produce renewable energy for the future, to produce a cleaner future for future generations and to produce the circumstances where food can be produced in a healthy world. We need to give them some leadership, rather than the nonsense that we are hearing in here about global warming and climate change. When both sides agree on the same target, surely we should agree that research for future generations of Australians is a worthy avenue for funding. These shortterm political fear tactics have to stop if we want to be part of the future. We have seen a lot of our scientists go overseas in the last decade because of it and we need to stop it now. (Time expired)",65
102,Mr FRYDENBERG,NOES," I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and related bills, the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012. While the latter bills will see the scope of the carbon tax cover LPG, LNG and CNG, it is the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill to which I will give my primary focus. This $10 billion new initiative, colloquially known as the 'Brown Bank' given its genesis with Bob Brown and the Greens, is fervently opposed by the coalition as it is an indulgent, expensive, misguided, big government idea. Not only will it distort the market in the renewable energy technology space and put a brake on existing players in that market but it will also see the loss of billions of dollars of taxpayers funds and at a time when this government's economic mismanagement is driving the country further into debt. In the time available I want to make the following points. Firstly, I will analyse the inherent contradictions in the explanatory memorandum outlining the key features of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and shine a light on the devastating impact the CEFC will have on the government's bottom line. Secondly, I will explain how market distortion under the CEFC will actually occur. Finally, I will point to international experience with similar governmentsupported renewable energy investments as a warning sign of what the Australian taxpayer should expect. Firstly, to the bill itself. The explanatory memorandum sets out that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has: … the power to invest in financial assets for the development of Australian-based renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficiency projects. It sets out the corporation's power to ensure: … at any time on or after 1 July 2018, at least half of the funds invested at that time for the purposes of its investment function are invested in renewable energy technologies. It also has: … the power to enter into investment agreements itself, and make investments through subsidiaries. A special account for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 is established which will see this CEFC special account credited with $2 billion a year for five years. Funds returned to the corporation from its investment will be available for reinvestment. The explanatory memorandum explicitly states corporation will make individual investment decisions independently of the government'. But this sentence does not sit comfortably with me, with the point made a few lines down in the explanatory memorandum: The Bill gives the responsible Ministers powers of direction over the broad mandate of the Corporation … It then goes on to say: The investment mandate may include, but not be limited to, directions on matters of risk and return, eligibility criteria of investments in renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficiency projects, allocation of investment, limits on concessional investments, types of financial instruments in which the Corporation may invest and broad operational matters. To any independent observer this must seem an incredibly broad mandate which is at the discretion of ministers. The potential here for political decision making is real and disconcerting. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say that in applying its mandate: It is expected that the Corporation will apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions, focussing on projects and technologies at the later stages of development. By adopting a commercial approach, it is expected the Corporation will invest responsibly and manage risk so it is financially self-sufficient and achieves a target rate of return. Again, there is a contradiction. This commitment to applying a commercial filter does not sit comfortably with the government's explicit intention in setting up the CEFC, as announced by the Treasurer and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in a press release on 12 October 2011: The objective is to overcome capital market barriers that hinder the financing, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions 'the technologies. If the market will not take a favourable commercial decision to invest in these technologies then how can the government apply their own so-called commercial filter and reach a different decision-namely, to invest? It just does not make sense. You are either a commercial entity competing in the private sector or you are a publicly funded entity with non-commercial goals. You cannot be both. The government goes on to say in the explanatory memorandum: The Corporation is intended to be self-sustaining once mature. Why, then, does the explanatory memorandum outline a hit to the fiscal balance of $1,346.4 million over the forward estimates, suggesting: … a prudent recognition that some investments will not be recovered. This includes operating costs of the CEFC as appropriated, loss provisions on loans from the CEFC to renewable energy projects and the concessional component of loans to renewable energy projects. If this corporation is to be so-called 'selfsustaining', why is it projected to lose so much money? I put it to this House that $1.346 billion loss may end up being the tip of the iceberg when the losses of this corporation are extended over its life. This will extend to many billions of dollars falling on the taxpayers' shoulders. This is because even these numbers of $1.346 billion are predicated on the CEFC having a very high success rate with its strategy of 'picking winners'. In testimony before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics on 28 May this year, senior bureaucrats from the Department of Finance and Deregulation said they are predicting that only 7.5 per cent of investments each year are not recoveredwhen my colleague the member for Moncrieff, Steve Ciobo, put to them that a 92.5 per cent success rate was extraordinarily high and a 7.5 per cent default rate extraordinarily low, they said it was their 'best guess'. We have to remember we are talking about billions and billions of dollars that will be spent on this new slush fund, and we deserve much more than the bureaucrats' 'best guess'. In fact, the Australian people deserve a lot more scrutiny of these bills they have been allowed-particularly the bare 150 minutes which was given to the economics committee to debate this new $10 billion body. When talking about the transparency and scrutiny of the CEFC, it is important to note that the government has hidden the corporation from its budget bottom line, just like with the $50 billion NBN, which was so called 'off balance sheet'. This $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation is also off the balance sheet because they are treating it as an equity investment in the forlorn hope that the government is going to get a commercial return. I will tell you they will not get these commercial returns. The second point I want to make is about the distortions that this Clean Energy Finance Corporation will have on the renewable energy market. Both the government and the opposition are united in their support for a 20 per cent renewable energy target. This target has driven and will continue to drive investments in the renewable energy sector. But, by setting up this $10 billion fund to pick winners and assist technologies that the commercial markets will not support, they are basically saying to other players in this market who are existing under the funding constraints that we currently have, 'You will be disadvantaged.' It is these existing players who are going to be the real losers from the CEFC body. What is more, the $10 billion will not produce additional renewable energy other than what this existing 20 per cent commitment is going to. So you are going to have $10 billion spent by this government picking winners with no net environmental gain. Third, I mention the overseas and domestic experience with governments stepping up to fund and finance renewable than energy technologies. In the United States there was the failure of the $700 million Solyndra project, the collapse of Beacon Power after the US Department of Energy gave them a loan guarantee and the unravelling of Solar Trust of America after receiving a $2.1 billion line of credit from the US government. In Queensland there was the ZeroGen project collapse, which received $100 million of co-investment from the Beattie government. There was the $700 million Solar Flagships program, which has failed under this Labor government. You see this is the government that gave us the Green Loans program. This is the government that gave us the failed Green Start program. This is the government that came up with the wonderful idea of cash for clunkers and the citizens assembly. And there was the daddy of them all: more than $2 billion wasted on pink batts and then another $500 million spent trying to clean up 70,000 roofs. Tell me if you believe that this government with their record should be trusted with $10 billion of hard earned taxpayers' money in picking winners. What about the roads that need to be built? What about the new ports to get our exports off to their markets? What about the hospitals? What about the schools instead of this $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is about picking winners and a political deal? Finally, in order to understand the context of this announcement you have to understand why it was agreed to in the first place. You have to look back to the formation of the 43rd Parliament, because the Prime Minister did not win an outright majority. In fact, we the coalition were the ones who deserved to form government. So this Clean Energy Finance Corporation is the product of the backroom deal between the Greens and Labor in order to win the Greens vote in this House and in the Senate. That deal is behind the Prime Minister's backflip on 'no carbon tax under a government I lead' and that deal is behind the government's decision to provide this $10 billion for this Clean Energy Finance Corporation. In conclusion, this is an experiment-a $10 billion experiment-which Australia cannot afford to take. Born out of political weakness rather than a product of a considered policy process, this Clean Energy Finance Corporation will saddle Australian taxpayers with a huge financial burden as billions of dollars are wasted on uncommercial projects in the coming years. International experience shows that governments are not designed to pick winners, particularly in the renewable energy space. What is more, with this bill currently before the House there is scope for unwarranted ministerial direction in pursuit of political not commercial goals; there is the potential to distort the existing renewable energy market to the disadvantage of those players operating under the current constraints; and there is the inherent failure of this initiative to increase the production of renewable energy over and above the already bipartisan commitment to 20 per cent. It is for these reasons, as well as the obvious, blatant political manipulation which is behind the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, that I join with my colleagues in opposing the bills before this House.",66
103,Mr CHRISTENSEN,NOES," Looking at these bills, in particular the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, I get this eerie, creepy feeling at the back of my neck, and I am not sure if it is deja vu or a premonition. I get a horrible feeling that this bill is going to be a horrible disaster, and I am sure I have seen this train wreck before. We have a big-taxing, big-spending Gillard Labor government which has managed to turn wasting taxpayer money into an Olympic event and a giant barrel of money$10 billion worth of taxpayer funds-and I am sure there was a similar situation when Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, was Prime Minister. I would have thought that keeping these two things apart would be imperative for the sake of the country, because putting the Labor Party in charge of setting up and looking after such a barrel of money is like letting the wolf guard the flock-sure he is keen to do it, but you would be mad to trust him. If I were a betting man I would go with the odds, and that means voting against this bill and keeping the wolf out of the lambing yard. Supporting this bill would be like backing a rank outsider-like having a threelegged donkey up against Black Caviarbecause we know this nag of a bill is a loser before it even lines up in the barriers. Here is why: the bill itself tells us it is a loser. It out in the fiscal impacts the forecast of operating costs and write-downs. There will be failed projects, and this bill admits this before it even comes into effect. This bill is like the kind of horse that stands at the barrier and says, 'There are 13 hurdles out there, and I intend to trip over one; my plan is to trip over one.' This was pointed out very clearly in Senate estimates this week when Treasury confirmed that they expect that 7.5 per cent of loans for investments made in this barrel of money will not be recovered. The plan is to take $2 billion of taxpayer funds ripped out of families' back pockets with the carbon tax and then to put the money into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation barrel, and Treasury is telling us that it expects to lose $150 million a year. That is even more than the Victorian Labor government lost in Victoria with the CainKirner venture. They had their venture capital fund and they tried to pick winners, but they racked up losses estimated at $110 million. The Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund already does the job proposed for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, so this is already a two-horse race. There is also the Emerging Renewables Program, and both of those seasoned runners make their intended loss public. These are not the sorts of horses I want to put my money on either. I do not like to back horses that have no intention of winning. Two weeks ago, possibly Australia's worse racehorse, a horse called Vote For Lust, attempted to break through for its maiden victory in Mildura after 87 starts and no wins. Even with champion jockey Glen Boss on board, Vote For Lust managed to beat just two runners home. It was a great story about a horse that has a cult following for being a champion loser; but his title is in danger. At least Vote For Lust had a chance and his sets form is no worse than the bill we have before us today, but the clean energy bank has form that reads something like this: a maiden for little or no talent; needs blinkers, as it loses focus and is easily distracted; prone to changing jockeys mid-race; has no sense of direction; and has a habit of running backwards. Horses that run backwards are very rare. This bill has a specific aim: it is supposed to create a barrel of money to invest in clean energy so that Australians produce fewer carbon dioxide emissions. But it has been designed by the Labor Party and by the Greens, and they have obviously turned the design template upside down, because the result of the bill will be the opposite of the intended result. This is what the Australian Institute, a friend of the people on that side, said about this bill: In theory, complementary policies such as the CEFC should do one of two things: (a) realise cheap abatement opportunities that won't be picked up by the carbon pricing scheme; or (b) accelerate the decline in the cost of lowand zero-emission technologies. If a complementary policy isn't achieving one of these two objectives, it is wasting money. The CEFC doesn't appear to have been designed with these principles clearly in mind. That comes from the Australia Institute, a left-wing supporter of all things warm and fuzzy and clearly a supporter of the LaborGreens carbon tax. Even the Australia Institute admits that the proposal in this bill is a waste of time and a huge waste of money. Business journalist Bartholomeusz summed things up in the Business Spectator on 17 April when he talked about the self-defeating nature of the CEFC. He wrote: The key problem with throwing $10 billion of taxpayer money at subsidies for clean energy while the mandatory renewables target scheme remains in place, however, is that the fund won't actually reduce carbon emissions or lead to more renewable energy capacity being added-it will simply displace what would otherwise have occurred without subsidy. We'll spend $10 billion for no material benefit. As we speak, there are companies out there in the real world investing in technologythey are investing in clean energy and investing in innovation. When the drunken sailors opposite start throwing around $10 billion on the open market, we have to expect absolute chaos. The CEFC will undercut finance in existing projects and kill off real innovation. Instead of a vibrant market generating creative energy solutions and low-emissions technology there will be a raft of lumbering, inefficient public-purse spongers sucking at the taxpayers teat in innovating ways so as to make sure that the free money keeps coming. Highly experienced and respected economist Henry Ergas wrote in the Australian in October last year a very interesting and informative article entitled, 'Billions will be wasted painting pork barrel green'. He wrote: Having enjoyed their international junkets, the suits on the CEFC will hardly reject every proposal put to them. Rather, to justify their existence, they will make some high-profile investments, no matter how dubious. As for the politicians, they will crave ops from contract signings and factory openings. Since the CEFC's mandate includes helping existing manufacturers convert to ""green energy"", every constituency can have one, presumably with a billboard advertising the government funding. Ever alert, the rent seekers won't take long to cotton on. And with the CEFC excluded Stephen from the Productivity Commission's periodic reviews of the government's package, there will be little to slow the gravy train. So Ergas is saying that no good can come of it-at least, no public good. Then he goes on to talk about cost, and this is really important. He said: But none of this will come cheaply. Rather, analyses consistently conclude that each dollar spent on this type of government venture simply crowds out one dollar of private investment elsewhere in the economy. But that government dollar both achieves less than the dollar it displaces and costs more, because distorting taxes are needed to raise it. It therefore ends up costing two or more dollars in lost income. So make that $20bn wasted on painting the pork barrel green. He means $20 billion will be wasted rather than the $10 billion that Labor is initially putting into it. If the Labor Party is in charge of handing out money we would get a better result by sealing up the barrel and hiding it under the stairs. Getting back to my metaphor of the form guide, this nag of a government has prior form. At this distance and on this track it is a loser. I refer the House to the Green Loans scheme, which allowed householders a free environmental assessment and interest-free loans of up to $10,000 to purchase energysaving devices. The Green Loans scheme became a haven for rorting and shoddy service, a monument to bureaucracy and inefficiency. In Queensland, a state with the misfortune of having a Labor government waste its money for 20 of the last 22 years, the Bligh the photo government presided over the ZeroGen project. Despite clear warnings from the Liberal National Party-and from people on this side of the House-and industry experts, the then Queensland Labor government oversaw losses of $100 million on this project. No wonder the state racked up $85 billion in debt under Labor! But there is more than just domestic form to go by. We can look at the overseas campaigns of similar nags. The United States, under a program similar to that of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, backed such spectacular failures as the $700 million Solyndra project, the Beacon Power Corporation project, and Enerl. All of them were spectacular failures. More recently, we saw the collapse of Solar Trust of America, which had a $2.1 billion loan guarantee from the United States Department of Energy to build a 1,000 megawatt power plant in the Mojave Desert. It was called the Solar Trust of America but what happened to the trust that America put into such a scheme?-collapse and waste. While I criticise the 'horse' here-that is, the barrel of money that is the Clean Energy Finance Corporation-we really need to look at the jockey and the trainer. There are elements of this bill that would have us believe that the ones who will hold the reins will be the board of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. But the board will be a puppet of the Gillard Labor Party. That is enshrined in this legislation. This bill stipulates that ministers will issue an investment mandate for the corporation. It says: The investment mandate may include, but not be limited to, directions on matters of risk return, eligibility criteria of investments in renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficiency projects, allocation of investment, limits on concessional investments, types of financial instruments in which the Corporation may invest and broad operational matters. Does it leave anything out? Is there any point in having a board? If this bill sets up a board on the basis of, 'Do whatever you want as long as it is what I tell you to do,' then the lunatics are still in charge of the asylum. One parameter that is a glaring omission from this bill is a guideline for efficiency. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation would not be required to invest in the lowestcost technologies to produce the cheapest emissions reduction. It is as if the Labor Party accepts that it has a problem-the first step to recovery for any waste addict-and has written the rules to redefine it as no longer being a problem. What is truly worrying about this dud of a horse, though, is the trainer, because even the Labor Party could not dream up anything so poorly constructed as this. The whole idea of a Clean Energy Finance Corporation comes from the Greens. We know it and they know it. The corporation comes as a result of lobbying from the Greens MPs and senators on the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, of which the now Greens leader Senator Milne was co-deputy chair. That alone should be enough to set off warning bells. With the Greens having their two cent's worth-actually, $10 billion worthwe are no doubt locking taxpayer money into technologies that are proven to be hugely inefficient and wasteful. It is beyond me why the Greens cling so desperately to windmills and inefficient solar technology when they know, deep down in their hearts, that these are extremely costly and ways to produce energy. The Productivity Commissioner said so. And what they will not tell you is how much energy is used and how many emissions are produced to generate the materials and to build, install and maintain these monstrosities. If you build your windmill really well and find a really windy spot it might produce just enough energy to build another windmillperhaps a slightly smaller one-which you could use to produce another one. And on and on it goes. If backing this bill is backing a guaranteed loser, then backing windmills is backing a guaranteed waste of money, time, and effort. What pains me the most, when I look at how much taxpayer money is going to be poured down this clean-energy drain, is what the Australian families who earned this money will be missing out on. What could we, as a nation, do with $10 billion over five years, instead of putting it all this nag of a horse? We are putting it all on the nose when we know is going to run a dismal last. We could use that $10 billion to pay for-well, a quarter of the funding needed for the NDIS, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, over the next five years. We could use it on flood-proofing all of the Bruce Highway in North Queensland to mitigate extreme weather events. The Mackay ring road could be built with one-twentieth of it. We could supplement local roads funding for every local government in this country over the next decade through a boost to the Roads to Recovery program to $1 billion. But we do not have the chance to debate those lost opportunities here today. Instead we are debating a bill that is not even worthy of a glue factory. I cannot support this bill because it is a licence to waste money. It is a bill that should never have been brought to the starting gate. It is a bill that is not worth the hay and oats that Australian families will have to feed it. Frankly, if this bill were a horse, I would have to shoot it. WYATT ROY (Longman) (13:22): I acknowledge the member for Dawson and his eloquent and common-sense approach to this bill. I also rise to speak to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 and related bills. Every day I am stopped in the street by people in my electorate-small business owners, teachers, parents, independent retirees, single mothers. All of them want to know a simple thing. They want to know why this Labor government seems to be doing everything in its power to make their lives more difficult. They want to know why this Labor government is making decisions that are causing their bills to be higher and the cost of essential everyday items to be more. I speak to families who are facing escalating cost-of-living pressures simply because of the poor fiscal management of, and the bad decisions made by, this Labor government. There is no secret in their minds. They know that their costs are going up because of this Labor government-a government that is plagued by waste and mismanagement. They know that this Labor government has shown itself to be unable to successfully implement any program it puts its hand to or to avoid massive cost blowouts in its failed schemes. The people I speak to have had enough. They want to know when the waste and mismanagement will stop. Unfortunately, I have no confidence, and those opposite have given us no hope, that government waste and mismanagement will ever stop while we are under this Labor government. We are in this place today to debate a bill proposed by those opposite that is designed to make this situation even worse for Australians. It is a bill that will glorify waste and glorify mismanagement. It will give the cold shoulder to responsible fiscal administration. We are here to debate a bill that has the fundamental promise of sinking $10 billion of taxpayers' money into a massive black hole. Let me just say that again so that we can feel the full impact of what this bill proposes. This bill will flush $10 billion down the drain. That is $2 billion every year for five years, starting on 1 July 2013. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 establishes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that will have the power to invest in the development of low-emission technologies and energy efficient projects that the private sector will not touch. The goal behind this bill is a farce. The premise is that this bill will ultimately increase the amount of renewable energies that make up Australia's energy sources, that there will be better renewable energy options, that there will be more money going into renewable energy research and that somehow this will create better technology. But this premise is fundamentally flawed. Bipartisan support exists in this parliament for a total of 20 per cent of all Australian energy to come from renewable energy by the year 2020. This is a target that the industry is already working towards. This bill will not increase this target; in fact, bill pours money into something that will feasibly be achieved by the market without the interference of a government entity such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It is the renewable energy target of 20 per cent that is driving private market investment in the energy sector. This bill will have no positive impact on this target whatsoever. There will be no new renewable energy generated as a resulted of this bill. Currently the market has been a very effective driver behind the development of renewable energy sources, and now this Labor government is, once again, seeking to meddle. This government is attempting to interfere in the form of a bill that installs an entity charged with the challenge of seeking out technologies that the market has already rejected-the technologies that the market considers to be unproven, too speculative or too risky for commercial financing. This bill's sole purpose is to seek out those that were the last ones picked on the team, the proverbial pariahs of the renewable energy market, and put them in pole position for the renewable energies race. Not only will the government be effectively backing the losers, it will also adversely affect those existing, commercially-viable investments. What this will be is a subsidy for projects that the private sector will not touch because there is no security and the cost-benefit ratio is not economically sound. If the market has determined that a technology is unviable then throwing more taxpayers' money at it is not going to help the situation. Throwing more money at it only hurts projects that are viable, that have potential and that already have the support of the market. It discourages, rather than encourages, future investment in the industry. Savvy private investors are not going to put their money into projects that, as this a result of this bill, will be at a distinct disadvantage. Under the framework outlined in this bill, the minister will be responsible for issuing an investment mandate for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the criteria for investment selection and suitability will be determined by the minister and the government of the day, providing the government with what is effectively control over the renewable energies industry. At what point did governments cast aside their responsibility to spend taxpayers' money more efficiently and wisely? At what point did it become acceptable for a government to choose to believe that it has a right to waste taxpayers' money-to waste money on schemes that not only will not provide a return for the community but actually damage existing commercial industries? As I have said in this place before, it is up to governments, just as it is up to the responsibility of individuals, families and corporations, to live within their budgets and to make wise financial decisions. This is not what we have seen or what we are seeing with this Labor government. This Labor government has thrown responsible, logical and sensible financial management out the window. We are seeing with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 that this government wants to mandate that the entity it is creating needs actually seek out irresponsible investments to pour Australian taxpayers' money into. It is trying to engage in speculative share buying that the market does not support. It is a highrisk move; a significant risk taken with taxpayers' money. In fact, those opposite are not even trying to pretend that this bill will pay off. Their own explanatory memorandum for this bill reads: The fiscal and underlying cash balance impacts include a prudent recognition that some investments will not be recovered, and interest revenue. Those opposite are predicting that 7.5 per cent of the $10 billion to be injected into renewable energy sector is expected not to be recovered. That is $150 million each year for five years, equalling a total of $750 million. Unfortunately, with this Labor government's record on program blow-outs as well as debt and deficit, there is absolutely no certainty that this government could keep it at this level. It is almost as if this government is seeking out more ways to waste taxpayers' money on failed quasi-environmental programs and increase the debt burden for the next generation of Australians. We have seen pink batts, green loans, Green Start and cash for clunkers, not to mention school hall rip-offs, set-top box cost blow-outs, the debacles of the East Timor and Malaysia solutions, the live cattle export catastrophe and a failed class war. This list goes on, and this government is determined not to learn its lessons. This government is also determined not to learn the lessons of our friends who have tried and failed in similar programs. Whether it is the United States' Solyndra project, which alone cost $700 million, or Beacon Power, Enerl or even the Solar Trust of America, all of these catastrophes occurred under programs similar to the Clean Energy to Finance Corporation and all were massive economic failures. Where others have gone and failed and will not go again, this government is blindly forging ahead. On our own home soil we have witnessed the devastating failure of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, which shared many of the hallmarks of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. This should be a wake-up call for a government that has no intuition. But in the same way that this government disregards the views of Australians, it is dismissing what the market is saying about these technologies and stubbornly ignoring expert advice. Industry the experts have offered a clear warning about interfering in the market process. In addition to clear advice against embarking on such endeavours, the industry also categorically rejected the Queensland Solar Dawn project and the Moree Solar Project. And with the help of the former Queensland Labor government, this Labor government has itself stacked up more than $100 million of losses on the failed ZeroGen project. With failures already under its belt, it is beyond comprehension why this government is ready and willing to put itself on the chopping block for yet another failure. With such compelling evidence against interference in this industry and with demonstrated, proven examples of how pursuing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and its investments into renewable energy is simply disrespectful of the Australian public, pursuing this activity under these circumstances is nothing more than a flagrant disregard for the hard earned dollars of the people in my local community and in every other electorate in Australia. If it is not bad enough to be pursuing a project that experts, evidence and prior experience reject, it appears that those opposite are determined to do everything they can to shut the Australian people out of having any say on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The government is attempting to push through this legislation without the time for scrutiny by the Australian people, as well as funding the corporation upfront so that the money cannot be withdrawn when the people have their say-and, inevitably, they will say no to this scheme. It is my firm belief that we are here in this place to represent the views of the people, not to exclude them from decision making about the future of our nation. Senator Milne, the Leader of the Greens, would appear to be proud of these attempts to subvert the say of the Australian people and is even on the record as saying, 'With a legislatively guaranteed stream of funding outside the budget, no future government will be able to undermine it without changing the legislation.' It was interesting to hear what political and economic commentator Ross Greenwood had to say about this initiative. 'Frankly,' he said, 'if they have been rejected by the market in the first place they are going to be rejected by them in the second place also.' Blind Freddy could see that this decision has no positive impact on the environment or on developing sustainable renewable energy alternatives. If the Labor Party and the Greens truly wanted to achieve these goals, they would have been better off giving tax incentives to private investors for them to invest in speculative energy companies. This would have been a far more mature and logical approach to developing this sector. Such an approach would have ensured that taxpayers' money would not be used to take on the risk of initiatives that the private sector will not touch. Such an approach would have been a far more responsible management of taxpayers' money. The point remains that for all the money spent and the effort and the time that go into this scheme, Australians will see no benefit for the environment. The point remains that the bipartisan supported target of 20 per cent by 2020 will not be positively impacted on as a result of this bill. As long as I am elected to represent my community in this place, I will fight to defend their fair expectation that their hard earned taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately. This bill is just another tragic example of this Labor government wasting taxpayers' money. It is waste that I do not condone. For the reasons I have outlined I strongly oppose this bill. Debate adjourned. Report from Committee",69
104,Ms OWENS,NOES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee's Advisory report on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 201 and Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes of proceedings. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",76
105,Ms OWENS,NOES,"by leave-The Australian government's clean energy future legislation package in 2011 included a commitment to establish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to facilitate the flow of finance into the clean energy sector. Following a review by an expert panel, chaired by Jillian Broadbent AO, the government adopted the recommended design and introduced the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012. The CEFC's objective is to overcome capital market barriers that hinder the financing, commercialisation deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies. In short, this market failure in Australia means that the private sector is not investing in clean energy technology projects on a scale that is desirable if we are to realise potential as an innovator and producer of clean energy. The CEFC is a mechanism to bring the finance and clean energy sectors closer together. In establishing the CEFC, the government is making a significant investment in Australia's clean energy future. While the government will provide the organisation with a broad mandate, the independent CEFC board will be responsible for investing in clean energy projects. All investment decisions will be made through a commercial filter. Finance will be offered on the least generous terms-enough to enable a project to enter the commercial arena, but not to create substantial negative externalities or market distortions. It is envisaged that there will also be co-investment with the private sector. The CEFC will expect to make returns on investments, but in making its investment decisions will also take into account other positive community and environment benefits that the private sector would not necessarily consider. This commercial approach to investment decisions, combined with its consideration of the positive external benefits, make the CEFC a key component of Australia's clean energy strategy. The CEFC will complement the carbon price, Renewable Energy Target and other programs and initiatives to encourage and facilitate development of the clean energy sector. The CEFC will be part of an innovation chain, investing in projects and technologies that are at the later stage of development and are viable commercial and prospects. Other programs such as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency provide grants at the earlier research and development stage. To give effect to these agency and program relationships as part of the clean energy future package, provision is our made for the sharing of appropriate information between the CEFC and relevant agencies. As part of its inquiry, the committee also looked at the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012. Changes in the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill: support the establishment of the CEFC; give effect to other government commitments in relation to the coverage of gaseous fuelsliquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas; and make other technical amendments to improve the operation of the carbon pricing mechanism. In response to calls from the gaseous fuels sector and the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation, LPG, LNG and CNG not used for transport purposes will now be covered by the carbon pricing mechanism rather than the fuel tax system. This amendment will mean that it will be easier for industry to manage its cash flow, firms will have more flexibility in managing their carbon liabilities and compliance costs will be reduced. The treatment of LPG and LNG that is not used for transport purposes will align with the arrangements for liquid fuels under the carbon pricing mechanism. The changes to the coverage of LPG and LNG will take effect from 1 July 2013 to allow transitional and compliance arrangements to be considered, developed and implemented. Bringing non-transport CNG under the carbon pricing mechanism will reduce compliance costs for small producers and reduce administrative costs for government in relation to excise. If the bill is passed, CNG changes will be able to commence on 1 July 2012 as CNG is produced from a natural gas that is already subject to an upstream price under the carbon pricing mechanism. The excise and tariff bills also give effect to changes to the treatment of non-transport CNG by exempting it from customs and excise duty. The Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill also contains provisions to enhance the operation of reporting entities under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act by streamlining the nomination of the person responsible for reporting on the organisation's carbon emissions. The bill also seeks to remove the requirement for regulators to publish 'total energy consumption', and retain the more appropriate 'net energy consumption' requirement, as it does not include the transformation of one energy commodity to another. The bill also proposes to enhance the security of the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units, by providing the regulator with additional time-from 48 hours to five business days-to make decisions about giving effect to a transfer instruction and dealing with suspicious transactions. This bill also includes technical amendments to the Carbon Farming Initiative by simplifying the process of finalising methodology determinations to provide more time to approve the methodologies of existing projects and facilitate their transition to the CFI. I would like to thank the organisations that participated in the hearing in Canberra. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report.",76
106,Mr CIOBO,NOES," by leave-I welcome the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Economics's contribution with respect to tabling this report. Indeed, it is almost equal to the total time the committee had to actually explore the bills that were before the committee. In fact, another 30 seconds or so and it would have been longer! Liberal members of the committee that participated in the inquiry were frankly gobsmacked at this government's approach to dealing with the CEFC. Our primary concern rested with the fact that we are seeing invested $10 billion of Australian taxpayers' funds over five years, $10 billion that will be going into the CEFC, for which Liberal members of the committee were allocated just on two hours for a public inquiry. At $5 billion an hour Liberal members of the committee were astounded that the Labor Party would spend $10 billion of taxpayers' funds and in a complete aberration, completely inconsistent with their desire to so-called 'let the light in', as the Prime Minister said, they then shut down the inquiry after only two hours. Apart from that I rise to raise a number of concerns that were evident to Liberal members of the committee as a consequence of the public hearing. Those relate to a number of comments that have been made and outlined, indeed, by the chair of the committee. These were the actual words that the chair used just now in this contribution that the CEFC will be part of an investment 'chain' supporting 'viable' projects. It begs the question-and this is what became very evident to Liberal members of the committee-that if these projects were viable then they would be funded by the commercial sector. Make no mistake, the entire rationale of the CEFC as outlined to the committee, which we picked up upon as part of the Liberal contribution to the inquiry, was that these are not commercially viable projects because the commercial sector is not investing in them at the extent required in order to receive 100 per cent commercial support. That underscores the serious concerns that Liberal members have when we see $10 billion of taxpayers' funds being decided upon by the Labor Party to invest into projects that are not commercially viable by definition.",78
107,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, Order! The member's statement is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. NA Minister for Health,79
108,Mr SCHULTZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It does not often happen in this place, but I rise today to thank the Minister for Health, the honourable member for Sydney, for the significant contribution she has made to easing the suffering of one of my constituents. I wrote to her on 27 April about a very serious issue centred around a drug that was not on the PBS, and to her credit showed the compassion that we should all show to our constituents in this place and did something to make sure that that lady did not have to pay the amount of money that was needed to get the drug. I thank her most sincerely on behalf of my constituent and I thank her most sincerely for doing what needs to be done in this House from time to time-wonderful things done in a bipartisan way. Tourism: Tasmania",79
109,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to applaud the recent announcement by Jetstar that it will increase its flights into Tasmania. I would like to particularly applaud the announcement of seven additional flights per week to Launceston from 16 August. In November this year, a further seven flights per week between Launceston and Sydney will also be added to Jetstar's flying schedule. This is good news for the tourism industry in Northern Tasmania and for the state as a whole. It will mean that it is easier for people to travel to our wonderful state, with increased flexibility in flights and greater access to our state. I am sure that Northern Tasmanian tourism industries will also join me in applauding this decision to add additional flights into Launceston, especially over the peak tourism periods. The availability of flights with low-cost airlines, such as Jetstar, is strong reassurance for our local tourism industry and businesses. The increased access to the state will assist in boosting confidence in Tasmania for the unique and easily accessible holiday destination that it is. Boosting confidence is important, as our budget support for families does. Labor cares for families and we do care for boosting confidence in communities. Aston, Mr Geoff Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (13:47): I rise this afternoon to recognise a young she sporting achiever in my electorate of Casey. Geoff Aston is a clay target shooter. He is 19 years old and lives in Chirnside Park. He is a member of the Melbourne Gun Club and he first began shooting at the age of 15 when his dad, Steve, introduced him to the sport. He has won a host of local, state and national titles including a hat-trick in the prestigious Mackintosh teams event and he has also been a member of the All Australian trap team three years in a row. His success at this year's national titles in Wagga Wagga secured his place on the team for the World Down The Line clay target championships in Wales in July this year. Geoff will change disciplines after the world titles with the aim of representing Australia at future Olympics. He trains 10 hours a week. He spends $250 a week on clay targets and cases of shells. He is a future sporting champion at Olympic level and I want to pay tribute to him in the House today. Harvey, Mr William Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:48): I would like to pay tribute to the life of a local legend William Harveybetter known to all as 'Billy Bunter'. Unfortunately Billy passed away earlier this month following a short battle with cancer, and whilst his death was deeply mourned his memorial service paid tribute to a life well lived. They rarely make men of Billy's quality these days. He went to sea at the age of 14, working as a deck boy before making the transition-some say defecting to the other side-to ship's steward. He was a committed Christian, a committed unionist and a proud member of the MUA and the Port Kembla branch of the Australian Labor Party. He was forever on my back about the passage of the shipping industry bills because he was passionate about the restoration of the maritime industry, something that he spent most of his life working in. He was a generous volunteer who gave years of his life to the Port Kembla Mission to Seafarers. Billy was a humorist and a fountain of knowledge and he always gave freely of his time to causes that he believed passionately in. He had a great gift as a fundraiser. He had the ability to squeeze a quid out of the tightest pockets and he sold raffle tickets with a single-minded determination to sell one to everyone in the room and every ticket in the book. Over the years he raised thousands of dollars for various charities and causes around the Illawarra. I extend my condolences to his family and friends. I wish him fair weather and calm seas. Syria",79
110,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The government's decision to expel the Syrian charge d'affaires is welcomed. In fact it is an action that could have been taken some time ago. The chilling execution of around 100 women and children in al-Houla just days ago will open a new chapter in this conflict. We know that for the Assads and the nearly 13 per cent of the population who are Alawites this is a fight to the death. But what we do not know is how far Russia and China will go in defending the indefensible. For Russia, Syria provides both a naval base and a big acquirer of its arms, so the strategic and economic imperative weighs heavy. China on the other hand may be more amendable to international pressure to step away from the regime, leaving Russia isolated on the UN Security Council. This is where the international community's immediate energies need to be targeted. So too we must expose Iran's deep military and political ties to the Assad regime and hold them accountable for the atrocities taking place. The Shiite and Sunni split is causing a rift over Syria between Turkey and Iran, the Arab League and Hezbollah, but, at the end of the day, we making up the rest of the international community must fall on the side of the innocents and do what we can to prevent greater bloodshed-a level of bloodshed that has not been seen in Syria since the days of Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez, who was responsible for slaying more than 20,000 people in 1982 in the town of Hama. If the death of so many children is not a game changer, what will it take? I for one do not want to wait to find out. Square Kilometre Array",80
111,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," congratulate the Australian government on successfully bidding for the rights to co-host the world's largest radio telescope, the $2 billion Square Kilometre Array. The Square Kilometre Array will see thousands of small receptors built across Australia, South Africa and New Zealand that, when combined, will cover an area of around one square kilometre and represent a truly international effort to expand our knowledge of the universe and our place in it. This revolutionary new radio telescope will give scientists from across the globe the ability to peer further into space and further back in time than ever before in an attempt to answer age-old questions such as: how do galaxies evolve, what is dark matter, how were the first black holes formed and, of course, are we alone in the universe? The core Australian site is in Murchison, WA, a radio-quiet zone around 300 kilometres north-east of Geraldton. The SKA will result in around 100 new jobs in WA during the construction phase and a further 100 jobs by the end of the decade, when the Perth based operations facility is due to come online. However, the Square Kilometre Array is about more than jobs. This international project will put WA on the map for astronomy and I expect that it will spark more people's interest in science, particularly young people. As International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research Director, Peter Quinn, told the Sydney Morning Herald, the SKA is like the Apollo of our generation and, as Sputnik once inspired millions, the Square Kilometre Array will inspire billions for decades to come. Beaudesert Race Club",81
112,Mr BUCHHOLZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to inform the House of the concerns that I are being raised around the Beaudesert Race Club at the moment. This is a jockey club in peril, a jockey club waiting for funds that were committed under the Labor government, and I support the LNP in Queensland's commitment to Queensland Racing. However, it was imperative, once I started looking, to check where some of these funds have gone. Not five months before the election, the board of Racing Queensland Ltd found it within themselves to renew their contracts on five-year terms, knowing that the current polls had Labor destined for decimation. On the day that the LNP took office, these members of the board of Racing Queensland Ltd took their five year golden handshakes and left the Beaudesert Race Club in peril. I have great concerns that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, just about to be set up, has off-budget expenditure when it comes to remuneration packages for board directors, as does the NBN. We have made it quite clear with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that, when in government, we will repeal the carbon tax and we will repeal this body so that it will not do the same as the board of Racing Queensland Ltd in setting themselves up with five-year terms. If one cent of this money ends up with people who are not working in the organisation, I will be disgusted. (Time expired) Kidney Health Week",81
113,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This week is Kidney Health Week. It is a week organised by Kidney Health Australia and renal doctors, nurses and patients to raise awareness and improve understanding about chronic kidney disease and what to do to avoid this truly dreadful condition. One in seven Australians, or over three million of us, have some level of impaired kidney function. Chronic kidney disease is one of the fastest-growing diseases unfortunately some 50 Australians will die today and every other day this year as a result of kidney related disease. This is more than from breast cancer or prostate cancer, yet very few of us are aware of this silent killer. It is called that as people can lose 90 per cent of their kidney function before realising that they are sick. By that stage it is just late, and only dialysis or a transplant will keep them alive. Over 10,500 Australians are now on dialysis, and anyone who has been to a dialysis unit knows it is a terrible way to live. However, early detection and early treatment can slow down kidney disease, save lives and reduce the need for dialysis. So during Kidney Health Week I encourage everyone to get their kidneys checked out by their GP. A simple blood test is all that is involved. Climate Commission",81
114,Mr HAWKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I raise on behalf of constituents in Western Sydney to raise their ongoing concern about climate commissioner Tim Flannery's assault on Western Sydney. The travelling roadshow that is the Climate Commission turned up at Parramatta last week to tell residents of Western Sydney that more people will die under climate change-a direct quote from the commissioner. He said: We know mortality goes up in heatwaves. He also said that mental health complaints would rise and severe weather events would, in particular, target residents of Western Sydney. This claim was rubbished by James Cook University Adjunct Professor Bob Carter and environmental scientists, who said, 'So what? There are always going to be more or fewer hot days per decade.' In the debate on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation this week we heard that and Professor Flannery's solution for climate change now centres around using a $2 pair of pliers to remove the teeth of dead people, so I ask: is the Clean Energy Finance Corporation considering funding these $2 pairs of pliers for people across Australia to remove the teeth of dead people? Considering that this man, the climate commissioner, is paid over $300,000 of too taxpayers' money to come up with this absolute rubbish and present it as climate change solutions, can this parliament be expected to put up with this kind of nonsense anymore from the climate commissioner, telling people they are going to die and then their teeth should be taken because they might change the climate? Education Funding",82
115,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," As we know, education is life's great leveller. It is the means through which young people's hopes and potential are made real, and it is the means through which a fair and forwardlooking society enables its young people to leave productive and rewarding lives. This government has made the largest capital investment in schools in Australia's history, and it has taken on the difficult task of improving the consistency of national standards and testing, so it is only right that we should now address the biggest challenge of all, which is the fundamental reform of schools funding. The Gonski report, released in February this year, was the first significant review of how schools are funded in over 30 years. The report concluded that schools are significantly underfunded, with 75 per cent of the shortfall missing from public schools. That is an inequity that we cannot tolerate and that we must address. Last week's MCMorrow report on the implications of the federal budget for schools suggested that our current commitments would not meet the growing needs of our education system. This report highlighted the importance of overhauling the current arrangements and of making a substantial additional investment in schools. It is for reason that I welcome the minister's commitment to legislate in response to the Gonski review later this year. I strongly support the implementation of a new and comprehensive schools funding model as soon as possible, and, while this must be done in partnership with the states, it is clearly a matter for federal government leadership, such as we have shown on a number of key issues in the last 4½ years. Higgins Electorate: 2011 Australian Student Prize",82
116,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I am thrilled to rise to congratulate those recipients of the 2011 Australian Student Prize in my electorate of Higgins. It is a significant honour which is awarded to only 500 students nationally, an award that recognises excellence in academic achievement. Students in my electorate that have received this award include: Sarah Jeffreson of Methodist Ladies' College, Bronte Payne of Lauriston Girls' School, Amelia Hamer of St Catherine's School, Jake Hinton of Caulfield Grammar School, Maple Huang of Melbourne High School, Max Kausman of Bialik College, Stephanie Lightfoot of Sacre Coeur and James Toohey of St Kevin's College. I also acknowledge the families of these students, the parents and siblings, whose understanding helped these students to achieve their best. I would also like to congratulate and pay tribute to the principals, staff and students of the schools in my electorate, which include Lauriston Girls' School, St Catherine's School, Melbourne High School, Sacre Coeur, St Kevin's College and the King David School. These students and their schools should be congratulated for achieving excellence. I pay funding tribute to the hard work undertaken by these students, their principals and their teachers, that and celebrate with them their significant achievements.",83
117,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Syria",83
118,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," On indulgence-for more than a year now the Assad regime has been at war with its own people and the world has watched with a growing sense of horror and, I would have to say, with a growing sense of anger too. On Friday, the village of Houla was witness to scenes of unspeakable brutality. More than 100 people were massacred, among them, according to the United Nations, 49 children and 34 women. Some were killed by government artillery and tank shelling of a residential neighbourhood. Many were executed at close range by armed men. Eyewitnesses have told of a brutal intent to murder. Victims were shot in their own home and there were young children with their throats cut. 'They had no mercy,' one told the BBC. 'They went into people's houses and opened fire and killed them all,' another said. We grieve with the families of the dead. Yesterday, Australia expressed its revulsion by expelling the Syrian Charge d'Affaires and another Syrian diplomat from this country. Around the world, other nations are taking a similar approach. We understand all too painfully that such actions pale against the measure of the lives lost in Houla. But we will not have any further official engagement with the Assad regime until it abides by the ceasefire proposed by the special envoy Kofi Annan appointed for this purpose. Mr Annan has again visited Syria. Now is the moment to end this violence. We call on Syria to immediately honour its commitments under the Annan peace plan to get the military out of civilian areas, to end the use of heavy weapons and to begin a political process that will bring peace. Australia will maintain our robust unilateral sanctions against this regime. We will maintain our humanitarian assistance and we will not stop our pressure until this violence comes to an end.",83
119,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister and to support, on behalf of the coalition, the decision by Western governments including Australia's to expel Syrian diplomats. It is clear that the Syrian regime is waging war on its own people and there is absolutely no excuse ever for the indiscriminate slaughter of unarmed civilians. Our objective must be to secure a democratic government in Syria that respects the rights of all its citizens lives in peace with all its neighbours. NA Olympic Dam",84
120,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to today's report of the Minerals Council and to recent comments from the chairman of BHP both indicating that the proposed investment at Olympic Dam in South Australia is at risk because of higher taxes, higher energy costs and greater uncertainty. Will the Prime Minister apologise to the people of South Australia for jeopardising investment and jobs by breaking her solemn pledge that there will be no carbon tax under the government she leads?",84
121,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Leader of the Opposition in his question refers to a Minerals Council report that was reported in today's newspapers and has been the subject of some discussion since. I think it is worth noting that that article, which was in the pages of the Australian and the Financial Review today, was written by Angus Taylor. That name may be familiar to some because he has just been preselected as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Hume at the next election-a very important point. Is it of any surprise to me that a man who is presenting for election as a candidate for the Liberal Party at the next election is talking the economy down? That is of no surprise to me whatsoever. Is it of any surprise to me that someone preselected as a Liberal candidate for the next election is making absurd claims about carbon pricing? Well, no, that is of no surprise to me either. It is not of any surprise to me that he is actually a very vocal and proud supporter of Work Choices? Apparently he has not got the memo yet that tells members of the and opposition to not be truthful about their support for Work Choices. What the Leader of the Opposition ought to be acknowledging in this parliament are the following facts: our economy is strong on a point of order. This is the largest mine expansion in the world. It is a very serious issue and the Prime Minister should answer the question, not make light of it.",84
122,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,84
123,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a serious issue. It is too serious for the petty politics of the opposition, far too serious for that. Running the economy is a serious issue. Making sure our economy is the envy of the world has required serious work. Making sure that there are $500 million of investments in the pipeline has required serious work. And at every step of the way, this government has worked with the government of South Australia because we want this Olympic Dam project to go ahead. We worked hard with the government of South Australia to achieve that result. What will not help the achievement of that result is a reckless negativity, talking the economy down and making false claims about carbon pricing. Those things are calculated to destroy jobs and opportunity in South Australia and right around the country. Budget",84
124,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. With the budget bills going through their second reading stage this morning, how does this bring the government a step closer to spreading the benefits of the mining boom to help families make ends meet?",85
125,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question, because I think everybody on this side of the House was proud to stand up in this House this morning and support the 'fair go' budget-very proud to support a budget that was coming back to surplus, very proud to support a budget which is going to spread the benefits of the boom to every corner of our country and certainly very proud to make room in a very tight budget to assist those with disabilities. So everybody on this side of the House is very proud of a budget which will grow our economy and spread the benefits to every corner of our country. We know those opposite are so reckless and so destructive that all they ever want to do is talk our economy down. What we will do on this side of the House is build up our economy and build up our country. We have confidence in the future of this country. Those on that side of the House, led by this negative opposition leader, just want to talk the economy down every day-day in, day out. There are substantial benefits in the budget to assist families in Australia: a $5 billion package over five years of additional support for lowand middle-income families in this community. We are very proud of that, and particularly the additional assistance with the costs of sending kids to school. There is also the assistance in terms of the clean energy package, going out to something like three million pensioners-we are very proud of that-and additional assistance to 1.6 million families and, on top of that, tripling the tax-free threshold. That is going to make an enormous difference to many people on low incomes, giving a tax cut to something like seven million Australians on low and middle incomes. Then, of course, there is the assistance for business-the loss carry-back and, of course, the assistance in terms of the instant asset write-off, which will go to something like 2.7 million small businesses. So we on this side of the House were very proud to stand up and support that assistance for families and business when the Leader of the Opposition was simply running away from it-running away from the families of Australia in terms of the assistance to families to educate their kids, and running away from the assistance to small business. Fair dinkum! You should have seen it in here this morning. It was as if the Three Stooges were back in play, stumbling and bumbling around the corner of the House, and they were joined by a fourth. Shemp over there joined the Three Stooges this morning, running away from the people of Australia and running away from cost-of-living assistance. He is all opposition and no leadership.",85
126,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The Treasurer has outlined how the budget is helping spread the benefits of the mining boom. Can he explain how this will help local communities like mine and what would be the consequences of not providing this assistance?",86
127,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for that supplementary question, because there will be significant assistance to all of the small businesses in the electorate of Corangamite, and of course there will be significant assistance to families-first of all in terms of the clean energy package and then additional assistance for families. There will be assistance to those families with children at school, something like 1.3 million families, and, as I said before, tax cuts for seven million lowand middle-income earners in our community. Of course, when it comes to each and every one of those, what does the Leader of the Opposition say? He says no. He says no to assistance for families with the costs of education. He says no to assistance for small business, particularly in terms of the instant asset write-off. Of course, we read in the West Australian today that his colleagues are getting very sick of him saying no. This is what one of his colleagues said today: … people are so fed up with the current situation, they are starting to blame Tony for the decline public discourse …",86
128,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Treasurer will return to the question.,86
129,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That would be an understatement. Of course, this is what Senator Joyce had to say about the approach of the Leader of the Opposition today. HOST: Do you think he's seen as too negative and too aggressive at the moment? JOYCE: At times that can be the case …",86
130,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will return to the question before the chair.,86
131,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, ain't that the case? Carbon Pricing",86
132,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Mr Craig Glasby, the owner of an independent service station at Empire Bay in Robertson, whose latest tender from TRUenergy includes a carbon tax component of $13,141, a surcharge of just under 18 per cent on his annual bill. How can the Prime Minister continue to claim that the carbon tax will push up electricity by just 10 per cent?",86
133,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the National Party I would say the following: the regulators for electricity prices in major states around the nation have already spoken. They have already spoken about the impact of carbon pricing, and when they have spoken about the impact of carbon pricing they have said that its contribution to increased electricity prices will be the same as the Treasury modelling at 10 per cent, or indeed less than the Treasury modelling. Now the Leader of the National Party shakes his head, but you in cannot shake your head and wish away a fact. That is what has been said in New South Wales. That is what has been said in Queensland. In Western Australia the amount was actually less. Let us remember: not only have these determinations by the electricity price regulators backed in the Treasury modelling, but what they mean is that what the government has been saying to Australian families and pensioners about assistance is absolutely right. People will see July. assistance coming into their family budgets-3.2 million pensioners-and millions of them will be better off. Families on average will see assistance of $10.10 and will experience price changes of less than that. On the specific example that the Leader of the National Party has raised, I am more than happy to take a look at it, but what I would say is this: my experience in this parliament time after time, day after day, is that things are brought into this parliament by the opposition and represented as if they were true, and on further inquiry they are found out to be completely false and just another part of the fear campaign coming from this Leader of the Opposition. Let's remember where this fear campaign has got itself to. It has got itself to a point where Liberal National Party members are now anxious about the relentless negativity of the Leader of the Opposition and his overblown, false claims.",86
134,Mr Truss,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. Clearly, the comments by the Prime Minister have no bearing on the question.",87
135,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Prime Minister will return to the question before the chair.,87
136,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I think it is relevant in assessing claims by the opposition that we have heard so many false ones: the end of the coal industry, astronomical price increases, electricity going up by 30 per cent and on and on it has gone. These relentlessly negative claims, these destructive claims, will be shown to be untrue following 1 July, and then the issue for the Leader of the Opposition will be that he might be able to run but he will not be able to hide after 1 To the Leader of the National Party, if he chooses to forward that information to my office I will have a look at it.",87
137,Mr Truss,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I offer to table the document. It demonstrates clearly that there is an 18 per cent increase.",87
138,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You just asked for it!,87
139,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,87
140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Nationals will resume his seat! The member for Goldstein and the member for North Sydney will remove themselves from the chamber understanding order 94(a). I was on my feet. The members for Goldstein and North Sydney then left the chamber. NA,87
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," I take this opportunity to recognise in the gallery today Mr Stuart Henry, the former member for Hasluck. I welcome him back. I have also been advised that we have the minister for agriculture and forestry from the Kingdom of Tonga visiting us today and I welcome him to our chamber as well. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Budget",87
142,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what are the facts about the effect of the carbon price and the extra assistance that the government has provided through the budget to help families?",87
143,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Calwell for the question. I know that she in her electorate is working hard to ensure that people are getting the right information about the assistance that they will receive available through our clean energy future package. I do note too that she was proudly in this parliament to support the schoolkids bonus against the opposition from those members of the Liberal-National Party who thought working families did not deserve a break and should not get any money to assist them with the costs of getting the kids to school. The member for Calwell asked me about how Australians will experience carbon pricing from 1 July and what assistance is available to help people make ends meet. I do understand that working families struggle to pay the bills, and that is why we have made sure that in creating a carbon pricing scheme we will be giving families around the nation, on average, assistance of $10.10 per week, and that will be more than the impact that they will experience from carbon pricing. Six out of 10 households will receive assistance that fully matches or exceeds these costs. Three point two million pensioners are already seeing advance payments of $250 per single pensioner and $380 for pensioner couples, and then in March they will see more assistance and it will be ongoing. Our economy will also see the benefits of investments in a clean energy future. From 1 July Australians will be able to experience this, they will be able to live it and they will be able to make up their own minds. That ability to make up their own minds will be a very sharp contrast to the relentlessly negative and destructive fear campaign that has been run by the Leader of the Opposition. They will be able to make up their own minds about his claim that price rises will be unimaginable. They will be able to see whether or not whole towns have been wiped off the map. They will be able to see whether or not their fuel bill or their electricity bill goes up by 30 per cent. And they will be able to see that the mainstays our manufacturing sector are here and stay strong. From 1 July, Liberal MPs who have joined the Leader of the Opposition in this negative campaign will then be left to wonder whether their relentless negativity has left them at the point of no returnwhere they will be given the Leader of the Opposition's systematic misleading of the Australian community, on the coal industry, on the cement industry, on jobs, on the cost of living and on electricity prices. We know from this morning that the Leader of the Opposition can run, but come 1 July he will not be able to hide from these claims being revealed to be wholly untrue. Carbon Pricing",87
144,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I refer the minister to his statement in the House: … on-road fuel costs are not increasing under the carbon price and, in fact, off-road fuel costs will decrease. Excise is being cut. Given that the carbon tax will apply to heavy off-road commercial activity from 1 July 2012 and on-road commercial activity from 1 July 2014, and the government's own budget shows a total increase in fuel excise revenue of $920 million, will the minister explain why he says fuel taxes are going down when, in fact, they are going up?",88
145,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:20): I am very pleased to be asked that question because yesterday in question time. I referred to a misleading letter sent by the Leader of the Opposition to local governments around Australia, which erroneously claimed, misleadingly claimed, that the cost of running council trucks is going to go up. He has been dropped into of this, assumedly, by the shadow minister, who has not done his homework in relation to this matter. As I told the House yesterday, this is completely misleading, because the facts are these. In relation to local councils, to which I was referring and to which the Leader of the Opposition had written, their on-road fuel costs will not increase under the carbon price from 1 July. Secondly, and importantly, offroad fuel costs for local councils will actually fall from 1 July. Currently, the fuel tax credit for diesel used by local councilsit is important to listen to the facts occasionally-in off-road activities like road construction and maintenance is 19.0715c per litre. From 1 July the fuel tax credit for these activities will, in fact, rise to 31.933c per litre. That means that the effective fuel tax rate for local councils for off-road diesel use will decrease from 1 July by 12.8615c per litre. If they had had the gumption on that side of the parliament to do their homework, they could have looked it all up on the ATO website. Do your work. Do not come in here and impugn my integrity or go outside. Do your homework! Live Animal Exports",88
146,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, one year ago today Four Corners publicised Australian cattle being brutalised in Indonesia. In response, the government introduced some protections for animal welfare, but recent TV footage of more animal abuse in Indonesia proves the government's reforms are inadequate. Prime Minister, will the government support my bill requiring stunning of all Australian livestock shipped overseas and, if not, why not?",89
147,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Denison for his question. I know that he has had a consistent interest in this issue, as have a number of members of parliament on both sides of the House. I know many of my colleagues are very concerned about it too. I believe all Australians were shocked by the footage we saw on Four Corners 12 months ago. It was truly horrifying footage. At that time we had no ability as a government or as a nation to track what was happening to cattle who were exported live from Australia to Indonesia or to other nations. We responded by introducing a system that enables us to have visibility across the supply chain. Put simply, that means that we are able to track and trace where Australian animals go and where they are eventually slaughtered. That means that we are also in a position, through working with exporters and requiring them to step up to the responsibility, to be able to ensure that there are OIE standards where animals are ultimately slaughtered. They are the international standards for dealing with livestock. That is the approach that we have taken. The member for Denison is right: there was more footage relatively recently. The tracing system enabled us to know which exporters of live animals were involvedthat is, where the animals had come from. Consequently, through the regulation system-the regulator is the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-we were able to take some action in relation to those exporters. I know that the member for Denison, a entirely number of other members of this parliament and other people would want to see other standards applied than the OIE standards, but we have deliberately adopted the OIE standards because they are the standards that have worldwide recognition. Consequently, we believe they are the right standards for a worldwide system because cattle from our country go to a number of export destinations. Can I say to the member for Denison that we do work with industry and exporters to encourage stunning. We believe that should be a practice which is encouraged and we will continue to work with the livestock industry and live cattle exporters on encouraging the use of stunning for livestock in abattoirs overseas.",89
148,Mr Wilkie,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. During the Prime Minister's answer a member of the opposition called out, presumably addressed to me: 'You should go back to Tasmania and rot!' No wonder the community is so concerned about behaviour in this place. I would ask you to invite that member to withdraw that statement.",90
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My difficulty is that I obviously did not hear the statement made. If someone would like to be honest enough to identify himself or herself, I would ask them to do so and withdraw the statement because it is unparliamentary. I am going to thank the member for Durack, Mr Haase, for rising and assisting the House.",90
150,Mr Haase,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If it helps the House, I withdraw. Carbon Pricing",90
151,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. Will the minister update the House regarding the outlook for the LNG industry under the carbon price? What does this mean for communities, workers and households that rely on the LNG industry and why is it important that these communities get the facts about the effects of the carbon price?",90
152,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:29): I thank my colleague the member for Capricornia for her question. As a Queenslander, she has a very keen interest in this issue. We have heard already about the importance of the government's household assistance package to assist people, but it is also important to give careful consideration to the implementation of the carbon price in important industries like the liquefied natural gas industry. The fact is that the LNG industry is experiencing an unprecedented boom and the outlook remains very strong. In its latest report on major resource projects, in fact, the Bureau of Resource and Energy Economics identified seven LNG projects under construction at a value of over $164 billion. In addition, as of last month there were 12 proposed LNG developments undergoing feasibility studies and investors are committing tens of billions of dollars to the LNG industry in the full knowledge of the implementation of the carbon price. The investment boom in LNG production will flow through to communities with stronger employment growth, increased incomes and improvements in local service and for local families in facilities provided. As an example of that, on 27 April Santos announced that it would invest $200 million into roads, affordable housing and environmental and social projects as part of its Gladstone LNG project. But this must be very hard news for the Leader of the Opposition to hear, it has to be said. He has prophesied: The carbon tax is a deadly threat to the economy of Gladstone … That is what he said, and I am glad to see him affirming it. The truth when one looks at these projects is that there is an incredible $56 billion of investment in three LNG projects alone committed and planned in Gladstone. He has predicted the death of Gladstone, that it would collapse as a town and that it would fall off the continent, but there is $56 billion worth of investment in the full knowledge of the carbon price being implemented. The fact of the matter is that there is not just relentless negative comment coming from the Leader of the Opposition; it is relentless deceit. The campaign against the carbon price is a complete fraud. His campaign for the Prime Minister is a complete fraud. (Time expired) Enterprise Migration Agreements Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (14:33): My question is for the Prime Minister. Did the Minister for Resources and Energy talk to the Prime Minister in the week before she left for Chicago and was the proposed Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement discussed?",90
153,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," As it happens, I did talk to the Minister for Resources and Energy in the week before I left for Chicago-and the week before that and the week before that and the week before that. I do talk to my ministerial colleagues, including the Minister for Resources and Energy, so I am glad I have been asked about it. On the Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement: as I have said on a number of occasions in this parliament, I received the brief from my office when I returned from Chicago.  on a point of order. The question was very specific. It was not about a full briefing. It was about whether in the talks she had with the minister for resources before last week",91

158,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:35): I would ask that the interjection that was just across the chamber be withdrawn. It was about a dead man. I think we have had enough of that and it should be withdrawn.,91
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Having met with Greg Wilton's sister over the weekend, I am a little sensitive, as many would appreciate, to any mention of my dead friend. I will not have it thrown around this House, as his family is feeling it significantly at the moment. I will have no more. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has the call. Mr Abbott interjecting",91
160,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we are going to have the Leader of the Opposition say that that was a rebuke of me, the person who said it should withdraw and then we will move on.",91
161,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport will resume his seat. I will certainly clarify. I was not making the comment to anyone individually but to the entire parliament. There are quite a lot of references and issues that nobody in this place may think are issues but certainly Greg's family are finding as such. I am just cautioning us all to be a bit more considerate. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has the call.,91
162,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are indeed well aware of the destructive negativity when it comes to this Leader of the Opposition and the carbon price. He goes around talking the economy down, he visits businesses and talks them down and he tells workers that they will be done out of a job. One company that has been a victim of this campaign is Nolan's Transport, in Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition visited Nolan's Transport, in Queensland, to talk up his scare campaign against the price on carbon. The response that occurred as a result of that company's invitation was a talking down of that company, and that company regrets very much its invitation to the Leader of the Opposition. In this month's issue of Australasian Transport News in an article headlined, 'Nolans fed up over dodgy carbon tax claims', they ping the carbon price campaign and the scare campaign being run by this Leader of the Opposition. In this article, Mr Terry Nolan, the owner of the company, says: … it wouldn't cost us anything like the $3 per year claimed in the email. We're sick of people using our business as a political pawn without checking the facts. Mr Nolan went on to talk about the email that has been distributed talking down this company by saying, 'Whoever sent it, it's definitely for political reasons.' What we need to do when it comes to the price on carbon is to have a rational discussion about what the facts are. There will be some increases in prices, though heavy vehicles, of course, are excluded from the scheme until 1 July 2014. We need to have a rational discussion including the support and assistance measures that have been put in place by this government. Last Thursday I indicated that the Leader of the Opposition would be going to Kurri Kurri on the following Saturday. But he was not welcome in Kurri Kurri on the Saturday-he was not welcome to conduct the scare campaign. If you see this Leader of the Opposition coming to your business, I have a bit of advice for you: lock your doors, because this bloke will just talk down your business. He regards it as his role in life to talk down the economic position of businesses, to talk down the Australian economy and to try to scare Australian workers. That is the role he plays. We are prepared to have a rational debate out there. This Leader of the Opposition is so desperate that he is prepared to tear down the economy and to tear down individual businesses. Enterprise Migration Agreements Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (14:40): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement on Monday that she supports the Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement to import 1,700 overseas workers. Given this claim, why did she tell union leaders on Friday that she was million 'furious' about the announcement by her immigration minister?",92
163,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member for Indi: I think I answered a question either identical to or very similar to this earlier in the week. I am passionate about Australian jobs, and I do not care who hears it. I am passionate about Australian jobs. I have conversations about what we can do to support Australian jobs frequently with my ministerial colleagues, with the trade union movement and with employers around the nation. This is a government with a proud track record",92

165,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Leader of the Opposition has made his point of order. He will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has only just begun her answer. The Prime Minister has the call.,93
166,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, I am passionate about the creation of Australian jobs, so, whether it is a discussion with leaders last Friday or with business people or with my ministerial colleagues or my caucus colleagues, what is always first and foremost for this government is the creation of Australian jobs. We have a proud track record of creating Australian jobs, and we will continue that record of creating Australian jobs. I will always in all circumstances look to see what more we can do to create Australian jobs. We will keep working with the resources sector, with businesses around the nation and with the trade union movement to create Australian jobs, and I am happy to share that passion with this House.",93
167,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a supplementary question to the Prime Minister arising from what she has just told us.

172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The first part of the question was in order; the last part was not. The Prime Minister has the call.,93
173,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I do not recall him being in union any meeting that I was in last Friday-and he would never be there, because the meetings I have are about Australian jobs and he does not care about Australian jobs. When we were meeting about the global financial crisis, there was the opposition leader sleeping off a big night out. That is where he was. He is not frequently in meetings about jobs.",93
174,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, it was a very simple question: why did she tell union leaders that she was 'furious' about the agreement if she supports it? She should tell the truth to this parliament.",93

182,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. The meetings that I had on Friday-as are many meetings I have-were about Australian jobs. The Leader of the Opposition has never been in one of them so he will never be an eyewitness to what happens in them, because there will never be a time that he spends one moment of his life worried about Australian jobs. All he ever worries about is destructive negativity and fear campaigns. Today, like on most days, we can see it written all over his face. Carbon Pricing  question is to the Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Why is it important for local communities to be provided with factual information in the debate over climate change? How is the government addressing any incorrect information about climate change and the carbon price introduction?",94
183,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:45): I thank my colleague the member for Moreton for his question because factual information in this debate about climate change and carbon pricing is extremely important, especially when there is a deceitful campaign being run against it, with misleading claims being made that cause people to feel fearful, that cause anxiety cause insecurity that is completely unjustified. It is very important for local communities to hear the facts. We have heard numerous misrepresentations from those opposite, especially from the opposition leader. We have already heard some instances in question time today relating to the issue of local government. We have heard about the fact that Gladstone is going to be destroyed! We have also heard claims that Whyalla will be wiped off the map. It is not commonly known, but the opposition leader has essentially forecast that the coal industry will cease to operate from 1 July. In fact, nearly $100 billion of investment is coming into the industry. We have heard of unimaginable price increases and that the household assistance will not be permanent or ongoing and will not be indexed. All of that is completely fallacious and deceitful. Last week, questions were asked about an announcement by Norsk Hydro in relation to the Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter. It was falsely claimed by the opposition that this was attributable to carbon pricing. It is very important that members of the public get the facts about these issues. This is a facility in my own region in the Hunter Valley. A person-a member of the public-has contacted my office and indicated her concern about this issue. She indicated that she has contacted the company to ask for a reply about the causes of the closure of the aluminium smelter. She received a reply from Mr Halvor Molland, who is the vicepresident of Norsk Hydro. He said to her, 'I am sorry to see you have based your opinion on Foxtel news and not on what Hydro actually have said.' He went on: We have been quite specific, saying that the carbon tax is not the reason-but shorter term and market conditions and the macro-economic environment. The decision to initiate consultation with a view to close the aluminium production at Kurri Kurri would have been the same-with or without the carbon tax. He said, 'But unfortunately our announcement on Wednesday has sparked a political debate outside our control, where the carbon tax is in the middle.' He went on: Fact is that Kurri Kurri is already losing significant amount of cash every month-before any carbon tax has been implemented. It is deceit. It is fraud. It needs to be corrected, and you should apologise. Enterprise Migration Agreements",94
184,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Did the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship speak to the then Acting Prime Minister last week about the proposed enterprise migration agreement for the Roy Hill mine project prior to the decision being made on this arrangement last Wednesday and then announced last Friday? And if so, did the Acting Prime Minister raise any concerns about the Roy Hill agreement in that discussion?",95
185,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I welcome the question from the shadow minister because I welcome any opportunity to talk about this project and this agreement which delivers 8,000 jobs-6,700 jobs for Australians-2,000 traineeships and a mine which will deliver 55 million tonnes",95
186,Mr Morrison,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order in relation to specific relevance. My question was whether he spoke about it to the Acting Prime Minister, not whether he wants to talk about it.",95
187,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A very telling interjection from the shadow minister! He is not interested in the substance, not interested in policy, not interested in jobs being created; he is only interested in muck raking and point-scoring, just like his colleagues. In relation to timing, it does not matter how many times you ask and in how many different ways, my answer will remain the same. My answer will remain the same in relation to consultations and discussions. I refer the honourable member to my previous answers. Small Business",95
188,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business. How is the government boosting confidence for small business in Australia? Is there any misinformation about this and how is the government addressing it? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (14:51): I thank the member for Deakin for his question and his ongoing concern for 15,600 small businesses in his electorate. The government is boosting confidence for small business by returning the budget to surplus. We have the lowest official cash rate for many a year-lower than at any time under the Howard government. We have low unemployment. We have low debt. We have contained inflation. We have $500 billion of investment in the pipeline, which instils confidence in business, including small business. Of course, we have payments to pensioners and students, tax cuts to workers, and school bonuses to parents, enhancing consumer confidence, which in turn will enhance business confidence. And the budget, of course, helps cut down paperwork and encourages investment through the asset write-offs and the loss carry-back scheme. The member has asked me whether there has been any misinformation in relation to these matters and whether we have some concerns. Well, we need look no further than the Leader of the Opposition, who has not met a voter he has not tried to scare. The Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts continue to talk the economy down, despite the evidence to the contrary. Just over a week ago, the member for Higgins claimed online that a business in her electorate was closing down due to government policies, including carbon pricing. Of course, the truth was somewhat different. The owner in question confirmed he was using the premises to sell his stock from his actual store three doors down the road because his tenant had recently vacated. The member, accompanied by the shadow minister for industrial relations, Senator Abetz, claimed the shop was closing down when in truth it was temporarily expanding its shopfront to sell its stock. I, of course, forgive the owner for what he has advised was an attempt at black humour. But I do not forgive the cruel hoax that the member for Higgins and the shadow minister for industrial relations have done to scare small businesses in that electorate and, indeed, electorates around the country. This is just another part of the scare campaign waged by the Leader of the Opposition on all small businesses across this country. He has no capacity other than to trash our economy contrary to the evidence. He has no capacity to do anything other than talk our economy down, which, of course, affects adversely confidence in small business. Indeed, I tell you: when I talk to small businesses they ask when he is going to say one thing about a positive plan for them and for this country's future.  point of order: I would ask the minister to table that photograph that says, 'No thanks, Julia,' which he was referring to.",95
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. He is abusing points of order. I have told people that this not appropriate. Anyone caught doing it henceforth will be excluded from the chamber. Enterprise Migration Agreements Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:54): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the response by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship yesterday when he said that he had updated the Productivity Committee of Cabinet on the progress of the Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement on numerous occasions since early 2012. How many times has the Productivity Committee of Cabinet met since the beginning of this year, and how many of these meetings did the Prime Minister attend?",96
190,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows cabinet is confidential. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has also misquoted the minister for immigration from yesterday. I refer her to his actual answer, which is very different from what she just said to the parliament-another mislead by the opposition. This is all they do in question time-part of the relentless fear campaign we see everywhere.

What is the government doing through the budget to make sure hard working families benefit from the strong Australian economy, and what does this mean for families in my electorate?",97
201,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:57): I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. She is a very hard working and passionate advocate for the people of Western Sydney. She is right in pointing to the strength of the Australian economy. It is one of the strongest economies in the developed world, with low unemployment, contained inflation, low net debt and a record pipeline of investment-in fact, half a trillion dollars are coming into resources sector alone. On top of that, we are returning this budget to surplus and, in returning the budget to surplus, we are determined to spread the benefits of the mining boomMr Tony Smith interjecting",97
202,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for Casey might be looking outside soon.,97
203,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to ensure that hard working families, in electorates like the member for Parramatta's, not only have the opportunity to make ends meet but to get ahead. I am pleased to advise the member for Parramatta that, in her electorate alone, some 9,000 families will be receiving the schoolkids bonus. In addition to that, 45,000 hard working individuals will receive a tax cut. On top of that, 14,000 families in the electorate of Parramatta will get an increase to their family payments. And of course our responsible economic management is giving the Reserve Bank the space that it needs to cut interest rates, if it chooses to do so, to deliver more relief to working families. These benefits are not just confined to the electorate of Parramatta but will be spread right across Western Sydney and, indeed, right across the country. I note that, in the electorate of Macarthur, which is also in Western SydneyMs Julie Bishop interjecting",97
204,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has had her fun.,97
205,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"12,000 families are set to receive an increase in their family payments and 11,000 families will receive an increase in their payments through the schoolkids bonus. The member for Macarthur likes to stand up for working families-or at least he likes to come into this place and pretend that that is what he does. Just a couple of weeks ago he came in the here and said, yes, parents in Macarthur are struggling, they need all the help that they can get. But then he came straight back into the chamber and voted against giving them a schoolkids bonus. He goes back to his electorate and tells people he is here for working families, but then he comes in here and he votes no. Why did he vote no? He voted no because he wants to stand up for those families but the relentless and destructive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition is getting in the way. The Leader of the Opposition says no to increases in family payments, no to increases in the pension, no to the schoolkids bonus. I know they are addicted to saying no, but the member for Macarthur, if he really must say no, should say no to the Leader of the Opposition and come in here and say yes to the relief that we want to provide to working families in his electorate. Enterprise Migration Agreements",97
206,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her promise last week with respect to the Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement that there will be increased scrutiny and, if there is an Australian able to do the work, an Australian gets the work. How can the caucus believe the Prime Minister's promise, given evidence from immigration department officials in estimates that there will be no additional resources or staff provided to monitor the implementation of enterprise migration agreements including this one?",98
207,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Thank you very much to the member for Durack for his question. The member for Durack may not be aware, though he ought to be aware if he has been studying Senate estimates, that appropriate provision has been made for monitoring and compliance work. To the member for Durack: this side of the parliament will always work hard and diligently to ensure that Australians are getting opportunities and getting them first. We are a Labor government and that is why we, during the global financial crisis, voted to support Australian jobs and prevailed against the destructive negativity of those opposite. And that is why in this period when our economy is the envy of the world but around the nation there are patchwork pressures, which means that it is possible in one part of the nation for a skilled worker to lose their job but their very skills to be desperately in demand in another part of the nation, we will work as a Labor government to ensure that people know what the opportunities are that are arising from the resources boom. Common sense tells all of us that it is not possible for everyone to work in the mining industry, that it is not possible for everyone to relocate to where those job opportunities My are, that it is not possible for everyone to work in a fly-in fly-out arrangement. But if there are Australians ready, willing and able to do the work and it is available, then I want them to get that work first. That is what we are determined to do. That is what we will use the resources of government to do. That is what we will work hard to ensure, because we want the benefits of the resources boom to be spread right around the country, whether those benefits are in the form of jobs or whether they are in the form of increased family payments. It is the opposition who want those benefits to be concentrated in the hands of a few. The Leader of the Opposition has been talking about that today to the Minerals Council of Australia. He has been speculating about just how tough it is to be a billionaire. Well, let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that what he should have said to the Minerals Council today is: 'Heaven help working Australian families struggling to make ends meet if this Leader of the Opposition ever becomes Prime Minister,' because his job then will be to rip out of the hands of families the benefits of the boom and to give it back to a few. Queensland Environmental Assessments Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (15:04): question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Can the minister please advise the House on the latest developments in streamlining environmental assessments to avoid duplication with the Queensland government?",98
208,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (15:04): I thank the member for Petrie for the question. It is an important question for all Queenslanders, given the significant job opportunities that will come from the pipeline of investment that is coming before us in Queensland at the moment. With that in mind, at the last meeting of COAG the Prime Minister and the premiers, including the Queensland Premier, made clear that where we can avoid duplication we want to; when we can streamline processes we want to. That is why I was astonished yesterday to find the Queensland government adding a layer of environmental duplication on referrals that was not previously there. They did it on the Alpha coalmine project, which will have 990 Queensland jobs when operational, 3,600 Queensland jobs during the construction phase and which was being assessed under a bilateral agreement-a bilateral agreement which matches what people on both sides of this chamber have been talking about for some time, where we get the state level to do a single assessment process so that we do not have a federal process then a state process and at the end of that it goes back to each minister for approvals. Yesterday the Queensland CoordinatorGeneral released his report. When he released it the Deputy Premier in his media statement said, 'The federal minister for the environment is yet to complete his assessment under the Commonwealth My environmental legislation.' There is a reason why I am yet to complete it: until yesterday there was not going to be a Commonwealth assessment. Until yesterday that duplication did not exist. Until yesterday we thought that, under a bilateral agreement, Queensland was going to be serious on eliminating the duplication so we could meet the same environmental standards which we want to Water, hold-no reduction in the standards-but streamline the process as a company goes towards a final investment decision on a project worth $6.4 billion. While we have been sitting here, the Deputy Premier has stood up in the Queensland parliament and said he has just checked with the Coordinator-General and they did meet all the federal standards. I suggest the Coordinator-General in Queensland reads his own report. On page 198 he acknowledged that he did not only have insufficient information coming back from our department, he did not even wait for the Queensland agencies to comment on whether or not they had met the federal standard. On page 220 of that report he acknowledged that they had not met the survey standards. Mr Dutton interjecting",99
209,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Dicksona Queensland member, of all people-says, 'Hold the front page!'

223,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Will the minister inform the House of how the schoolkids bonus is being delivered to Australian parents? What are the facts about how this will benefit families?",100
224,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (15:11): I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. The passage of the budget's second reading is good news for families around Australia, because in that budget we continue our commitment to supporting education for families right around Australia. Importantly, we continue our commitment on the national partnerships that sees the federal Labor government provide support to the states for specific investments in things like teacher quality, literacy and numeracy, and lowsocioeconomic communities. I was very pleased that the COAG Reform Council reported today that reward payments to the states have been paid by the Commonwealth on these national partnerships-in particular, $147 million in reward payments on literacy and numeracy. This is an important national partnership. We have seen about half a million students benefiting from additional support in schools as they come through primary school, getting their reading, writing and maths under control. We now have many of the schools involved where the kids are performing at above national minimum standards. So that is really good news and the budget provided an additional $250 million to make sure we continue that national partnership. Of course the budget also included the schoolkids bonus. Here, as I am asked about the schoolkids bonus, I have to reflect on the pressures that families face when they want to get their kids off to school and they have those extra expenses coming. Let us just take an eligible family-a typical family with two kids, maybe one is in primary school and one in high school. They can expect over the course of the year just over $1,200 in support from the schoolkids bonus for the pair of runners that are looking a bit tatty, or maybe it is a new backpack or some stationery needs. It is particularly important that parents are given the opportunity to manage their budgets in this way, because they understand the kind of education costs that they are facing for their kids that have to be met. In Hindmarsh, about 5,500 families will benefit from the schoolkids bonus. Across South Australia about 96,500 families will benefit from that schoolkids bonus. The only person who led the charge of 'no' against the schoolkids bonus was the opposition leader, who seems to be hard-wired for negativity. So opposed to the idea of parents getting a schoolkids bonus was he that he claimed that the money would be spent on poker machines. I think that says more about the Leader of the Opposition than it does about families around Australia, who know the education needs they face and know that this government is doing something to meet them.

261,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:22): by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent: (1) the Federation Chamber continuing to meet today until 8 p.m. or until the adjournment of the House, whichever is the earlier. (2) the Federation Chamber continuing to meet on Thursday, 31 May 2012 until 1.30 p.m. and Government business having precedence from the conclusion of Members constituency statements until 1.30 p.m.; and (3) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister. Question agreed to. NA Hastie Group",109
262,Mr SHORTEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (15:23): by leaveFor the benefit of members on both sides, I wish to briefly update the House on matters concerning the Hastie Group. The Hastie Group is made up of approximately 44 separate companies, and that number is on latest advice. It employs about 4,000 people across mechanical engineering and electrical plumbing work on construction sites and also services such as refrigeration and mechanical operations. I have had the opportunity to speak  MCGRATHNicol and Mr Craig Crosbie from PPB, who are the appointed receiver and administrator for Hastie. I am advised that a number of the subsidiary organised companies will or may be sold as going concerns, and as such it is hoped that quite a lot of the jobs for electricians, plumbers and metal tradespeople will continue. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Electrical Trade Union, the Plumbers Union and others have been in touch with me to ensure that their members' interests are represented. In terms of the services part of the Hastie Group, I am advised that the 1,300 staff employed in that part of the businesses are likely to retain their jobs. In addition, I am advised that 500 workers in the two refrigeration businesses are likely to retain their jobs. I will continue to talk with the administrator and others during the remainder of this week. I am aware that the CEPU electricians and PPB reached arrangements yesterday that allow redundancy certificates to be issued. That will mean that some employees will be able to gain access to entitlements in a more speedy fashion. I am aware that the plumbers division of the CEPU are in constructive talks to ensure that the plumbing jobs are maintained going forward. All workers will remain eligible for support through JSA and Centrelink, and the government are doing everything we can to support people. In the event that liquidation is confirmed, employees may be eligible for the GIS scheme. If the administrators believe that they are going to have to liquidate particular operations, we look forward to them informing us at the earliest possible time; thus allowing me to use a discretion. the event that they are not then we are keen to see who is going to buy the businesses and what will happen to the jobs this week. The aim of the government is to make sure that people do not remain in uncertainty for days and weeks. The situation is moving very fast, and we know that there are a lot of people trying to work on this issue. At the end of the day, in relation to the subcontractors, the small businesses and the employees who are caught up in circumstances beyond their control, I appreciate that the jobs that they perform will still be necessary in many cases for the construction projects to get completed. According to initial reports-and I stress 'initial reports'-it is apparent that this unfortunate situation has arisen out of mismanagement, including a multimilliondollar irregularity in the Hastie Group's accounts. ASIC are investigating the matter and making the appropriate inquiries of directors, administrators and auditors. The government, at the appropriate stage, will consider any policy options arising out of these inquiries, including whether or not mandatory rotation of auditors after a set number of years is required in the future. Members of parliament with any questions should feel free to contact my office.",109
263,Ms LEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-I appreciate the update from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The circumstances of the collapse of the Hastie Group are now unfortunately becoming all too well known: 2,700 workers have been stood down without pay for 28 days. Job losses and business closures are shocking when they happen. What I would say is that, while the opposition makes no political comment about a government to blame for this, as we do see more and more company closures, the In creeping loss of confidence across the economy is doing nothing to encourage small and medium businesses-especially in the regional towns affected by Hastie; namely, Albury, Shepparton, Bendigo, Mildura and Geelong-to actually take a risk and recruit a recently retrenched worker. The government has failed to provide the right economic policy settings that would give sufficiently robust local and regional job opportunities to enable these workers to easily find a job. In my own home town of Albury, Watters Electrical had 80 workers stood down on Monday in the car park outside the office. The process of standing them down means they cannot apply for Centrelink or redundancy payments. I appreciate the minister's efforts in encouraging that official retrenchment action take place so that Centrelink and the GIS can step into assist these workers. For those workers who do lose their jobs as a result of the collapse of the Hastie Group, we need to ensure they are assisted with prompt and appropriate support. So I echo that commitment from the minister to ensure that workers are not left in doubt for longer than 28 days as to whether they have a job or not. The government needs to work with the administrators to ensure that where some of the subsidiaries can remain in business they are given every assistance to do so. I appreciate the minister mentioning that he has received advice from relevant unions who represent these workers, but I also seek his assurance that those workers or subcontractors affected who are not members of unions also receive the same level of support. NA Appointment of the Parliamentary Budget Officer",110
264,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENT BY THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker has asked me to inform the House of the appointment of the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer, who will head the new Parliamentary Budget Office. Under sections 64X and 64XA of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, the Presiding Officers have the responsibility appoint the Parliamentary Budget Officer, subject to the approval of the proposed appointment by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. I am pleased to inform the House that on 23 May 2012, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit gave unanimous  Bowen as the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer. Mr Bowen is a highly experienced individual who is ideally suited to this new and important role. Since 2007, Mr Bowen has been an executive director on the board of the Asian Development Bank, representing Australia and a number of countries in our region. Prior to this, Mr Bowen was a senior Commonwealth public servant who held various senior executive positions, including as a long-serving deputy secretary of Budget Group in the former Department of Finance and Administration between 2001 and 2007. Prior to this, Mr Bowen was a deputy secretary of the Property Group of Finance and has also held senior positions in the former Department of Transport and Communications and the Civil Aviation Authority. In recognition of Mr Bowen's contributions, he was awarded a Public Service Medal on Australia Day 2006 'for outstanding public service in the development, delivery and implementation of enhanced whole-of-government budget processes'. Mr Bowen will commence on 23 July 2012. I congratulate Mr Bowen on his appointment and, on behalf of all members, I wish him well in establishing this new and important office.",111
265,Mr OAKESHOTT,STATEMENT BY THE SPEAKER," by leave-On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I am pleased to also advise the House of the committee's decision to approve the proposed  Parliamentary Budget Officer, as referred to the committee by Presiding Officers. The committee welcomes today's announcement by the Presiding Officers confirming the appointment of Mr Bowen as the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer. Mr Bowen's first task will be to establish a fourth parliamentary department-that of the Parliamentary Budget Office. This office will improve the transparency of Australia's fiscal and budgetary frameworks and will help level the playing field by giving all senators and members access to independent policy costings and additional support to scrutinise the budget. The appointment of the right person to establish and lead the PBO was of the utmost importance to the committee. The committee considered that the appointment process undertaken by the Parliamentary Service Commissioner at the request of the Presiding Officers was thorough and transparent. After meeting with both the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and Mr Bowen, the committee did unanimously agree to the appointment. The committee was impressed by Mr Bowen's strong finance related background and also considered his diversity as a real asset. Following our meeting with Mr Bowen, we were all confident that he brings the whole package: knowledge, skills, experience and ability to communicate all of this in his no-nonsense style. Since 2007 Mr Bowen has been the Australian director on the board of the Australian Development Bank. In this role he represented the constituency of 11 ADB members as well as worked to continuously improve the bank's operations. Following criticism of the ADB's operations evaluation department, which is responsible for monitoring the billions of dollars of loans made by the bank to Asian nations, Mr Bowen led a review that made significant recommendations to improve independence and effectiveness of the office. Prior to this international appointment, Mr Bowen held a range of senior positions within the then Department of Finance and Administration directly relevant to the role of Parliamentary Budget Officer, including five years as head of the Budget Group. During this time, as you mentioned, Deputy Speaker, Mr Bowen was awarded an Australian Public Service Medal for his work in developing and implementing enhanced whole-of-government budget processes. Mr Bowen has held senior positions in the former Department of Transport and Communications and in the Civil Aviation Authority. He has served on a number of boards and advisory committees, including the Australian Public Sector Accounting Standards Board. In addition qualifications in agricultural science, economics and accounting, Mr Bowen is a fellow of CPA Australia and an alumni of the Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program. We only get one chance to get this important new Parliamentary Budget Office right. The establishment of a credible, independent and strong PBO is a unique opportunity for this parliament, and all parliamentarians, I hope, will be working together to ensure we make the most of it. Along with the selection of the best person to head the Parliamentary Budget Office, the committee considers that decisions made about the location of the office to be fundamental to its success. While ultimately a decision for the newly appointed Parliamentary Budget Officer, the committee is a strong view that it is an absolute priority that the Parliamentary Budget Officer and his key staff have an office located within Parliament House to ensure ready access for senators and members. The committee welcomes its new the role as the oversight committee for the Parliamentary Budget Office and looks forward to working with Mr Bowen, as prescribed in the Parliamentary Services Act 1999, upon his commencement on 23 July 2012. NA NA Carbon Pricing",111
266,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received letters from the honourable member for Chifley and the honourable member for Cook proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46, Mr Speaker has selected the matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent and to important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Chifley, namely: The urgent need to provide households with financial relief based on facts surrounding introduction of a carbon price on July 1. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",112
267,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE," I am pleased the House can consider this matter of public importance. I am also looking forward to the contributions from the member for Moreton and the member for Robertson on this critical issue because we are in the process of taking action on an issue that has been dodged by federal parliaments for successive decades: action on climate change and meeting our international commitment. It is worth noting that this is an existing bipartisan commitment to meet a mediumterm target of reducing emissions by five to 15 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. Both sides of the House committed to reducing emissions. In doing so, we have sought to do this in a way that will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy. To ensure that we target this action to those that are contributing most to pollution, all the money that is raised by bringing in a price on carbon will go to jobs, will go to clean energy, will go to households. We recognise too that a lot of other parts of the world are acting on this critical issue. As much as we structure our plans in a specific way, it is important to note as well that, under the proposals put forward by those opposite, families would actually be worse off and would be required to pay more. In introducing this price on carbon, I would reinforce the point that, in tackling pollution we are targeting the top 500 polluters. But, along the way, we have admitted and have acknowledged that there the will be price impacts. We asked Treasury to model that impact-not to do so on hunches or to work off guesswork but to rely on facts and reality. It was a significant body of work in terms of the modelling that was undertaken by Treasury and, in addition, it was then tested further and refined to ensure that this work, which would form the bedrock of work in relation to other initiatives, would be solid. As I said, this modelling forms the bedrock of our plans to provide thorough household assistance as we transition to a cleaner energy future. It is used to shape the type of assistance that is also provided through our Jobs and Competitiveness Program to help industry in the transition process too. Both measures are vitally important for the people that I am proud to represent and champion in this place-and I will come back to that later. Let me go back to the modelling. On that modelling alone, it is indicated that the impact on prices and the cost of living will be 0.7 per cent. If you contrast that to other major initiatives-for example, when those opposite were in government and introduced the goods and services tax-bear in mind that we predict prices will move 0.7 per cent as a result of a price on carbon, and when the GST was introduced there was a 2.5 per cent lift in prices. The 500 polluters that are being targeted are the only ones targeted, which again is worth noting. The myths peddled by those opposite suggest that all businesses will pay-every single small business and all businesses in the country will pay. We have 500 of the biggest polluters targeted and, unlike the imposition of the GST-which effectively turned every small business into a small taxation office-ours will only target 500 of the biggest polluters. Again, prices are predicted to go up 0.7 per cent, and it is worth putting it into context. That is less than a cent for every dollar spent. We have estimated, as a result of that modelling, that the overall impact will be $9.90 per week on average, and the assistance we are providing is $10.10 per week to cover that $9.90 per week impact. All sorts of claims have been made about what impact putting a price on carbon would have on everyday goods and services. I think it is important, as the matter of public importance suggests, that we base this on fact. It is worth noting and bringing to the House's attention some of the movements. In terms of electricity we have had all sorts of claims made as to what impact this would have. Electricity will be up on average 10 per cent, or $3.30 per week. Gas will be up nine per cent, or $1.50 per week. For fruit and vegetables the average price impact is 10cthat is a 0.4 per cent impact. Rents are the same-a 40c increase, or 0.6 per cent. I have already gone through utilities. Pharmaceuticals will go up less than 10c, or 0.3 per cent. In terms of urban transport we have all sorts of claims about what impact that will have in terms of fuel and prices of urban transport. For urban transport there will be less than a 10c impact. Again, we have all sorts of claims made about the impact on airlines and travel-and I want to come back to that further in this contribution-but the impact is about 30c as a result of putting a price on carbon. So again it is important to get the facts on the record. These are the facts and these are the figures, and we have built our household assistance around these figures. In terms of that household assistance, families who are receiving family tax benefit part A receive an extra $110 per child, and families on family tax benefit part B receive an extra $69. From July 2013, regular fortnightly or quarterly payments will receive a permanent boost. Pensioners receive an upfront lump sum payment over the next few weeks to help now and over the coming months. Again, it is a fact that single pensioners are receiving about $250 and it is a fact that pensioner couples will receive about $380 combined. We will deliver another permanent boost to regular pension payments from March next year. So, overall, singles will get about $338 a year and couples an extra $510. That is on top of the increases we have already delivered. For example, a single pensioner on the maximum rate is now $4,000 a year better off because of what we are doing. For workers, from July everyone earning less than $80,000 will receive a tax cut, and for most people that tax cut is worth about $300 a year. We are also-and this is a tremendous boost for a lot of workerstripling the tax-free threshold to $18,200. So, if you are a part-time worker earning $25,000, you are going to have an extra $500 in your pocket every year, and if you earn less than $18,200 a year you will not be paying any tax at all-none, zip, nothing. Self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card receive an upfront lump sum payment in June to help now and over the coming months. Those are just some of the impacts. There are around 65,000 taxpayers who live in Chifley-in the suburbs of Mount Druitt, Rooty Hill, Blacktown and Marsden Park-and around 58,000 will receive a tax cut. Out of those 58,000, 49,000 receive a tax cut of at least $300. In total, more than 52,700 people in the electorate I am proud to represent in this place will receive household assistance through income support payments. More than 19,000 will receive extra cash through their family assistance payments. This means, for example, that a typical family with a household income of about $75,000 a year, with two kids in school-and with a price impact of about $549 a year as a result of a carbon price-will, through what we are doing on family tax payments and tax cuts, receive an extra $1,179 a year. They will be $630 better off. These are facts. This is reality. That is what we are doing: lifting payments, cutting taxes, boosting pensions and lifting the tax-free threshold. The response of those opposite is: extra payments gone; taxes back up; pensions reduced; and the tax-free threshold lowered. A million people will benefit from our lowering of the tax-free threshold-60 per cent of them women. Hundreds of thousands of young people will benefit from that move. As I reflected in the House last week, imagine a political party going to those young people and saying, 'We will actually make you pay more tax so we can cut tax for the wealthiest in this country. 'It is a ridiculous proposition, but it is actually reality because that is what those opposite are saying. This is fact. This is what they said they would do. And what else have they done? Not only have they said they would take away the things we support or we are proposing to do, they are also out there pumping mistruths, peddling myths and relying on fear. Sure, fear gets you someplace fast, but it does not get you very far. At some point, once you have scared people, you have to come up with a solution. And if you are going to meet that bipartisan target that both sides committed to, the solution cannot be the biggest tree-planting program in the country. They have told whoppers-no-one can accuse them of a lack of imagination! We have had the Leader of the Opposition saying that the price rise and the effects of the carbon price will be unimaginable, but he himself has been quite imaginative in making up all sorts of myths about its impact. At some point, he has to stop the self-delusion and get with the reality-not say, again, that the price rises will be unimaginable. Listen to some of the things that the Leader of the Opposition has said: This will destroy the steel industry, the cement industry, the aluminium industry, the motor industry. It will be, over time, the death of heavy manufacturing in Australia. Anthony Abbott has morphed into Anthony Robbins, the biggest and greatest motivator of people in this country! Anything that he touches-anything that he turns up to-dies! Apparently, he can go to Whyalla and say, 'We had the AWU in South Australia just today predict Whyalla and Port Pirie would be wiped off the map'. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said: wiped off the map. How does he propose to be the leader of this country and go around the country saying to people that their town will be wiped off the map? It sounds more like a disaster movie",113
268,Mr Fitzgibbon,IMPORTANCE,We'll all be rooned!,115
269,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"Exactly, rooned indeed. Thank you, Chief Government Whip. It is worth noting some of the other myths. I said before that one result of the price on carbon will be to add 0.7 per cent to the costs of living. State-based regulators have confirmed key aspects of that forecast. The Treasury analysis said that electricity prices will be up by 10 per cent. The New South Wales pricing regulator, IPART, confirmed that electricity prices would rise by $3.30 per week. IPART also said the impact on council rates would be 0.4 per cent less than under Treasury modelling. Those opposite have been saying all sorts of things about what the impact would be. It is quite astounding, when you match the reality against the myth, to see what will really be the case. We have had all sorts of claims made about what effect the carbon price will have on councils. IPART and the New South Wales Minister for Local Government confirm that council rates will rise 0.4 per cent as a result of the carbon price. For average households, how much does that add per week? When it is applied to council rates, 0.4 per cent is just six cents a weekthat is all that it will lead to. This has been incredible attempt to spread fear about the carbon price. The New South Wales government has now confirmed the Treasury forecast, and after all that modelling and all the work that we have done, we are in a position to be able to provide facts instead of the fear that has been provided by those opposite. What about some of the other claims that we have had? We have had the member for Wide Bay, who at some point is actually going to ask the member for Grayndler a portfolio related questionMr Jenkins interjecting",115
270,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"You are right, Member for Scullin, it is highly unlikely, but we live in hope. Let us look at the impact on flights. Virgin, for example, has announced that on most flights it will only add $1.50. We had a scare campaign yesterday by those opposite, who said that aviation would be doomedand rooned-yet we have had Rex put out a release for their 2011 full year results which quotes its Executive Chairman, Lim Kim Hai, as saying: I am actually more optimistic and confident of the outlook and potential of the Rex Group than I have ever been for the past nine years. And what about the claims in relation to Brindabella where-and I have never seen this before-we had the shadow Treasurer going to table a document, then folding the document in half, tearing it and handing up the convenient part but leaving out the inconvenient part. These are improvements to the House practice that I have been happy to see as a new member! It is important, as the MPI states, to rely on fact instead of fiction. It is incumbent on those opposite to not only demonstrate exactly what they intend to do but also, importantly, to represent properly what impact this will have. As well as rate rises, an they have talked about the cost of landfills and how that would be affected. The biggest move in relation to increases in landfill costs has come as a result of the waste management levies in New South Wales, not as a result of anything to do with the carbon price. We have taken action on an issue affecting the nation. In the past, we have had delay-governments have delayed, deferred action on this and put it in the too-hard basket. We have acted. Those opposite agree that we need to act. It is a bipartisan target. It is time to get to work, instead of wilting under the pressure.",116
271,Mr ANDREWS,IMPORTANCE," 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Those 11 words-'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'-will haunt this Prime Minister for the rest of this year, for the rest of this parliament and for the rest of her term while she remains in this place. That is because there has been no more blatant refusal to confront the truth than her reversal of this promise that she made to the Australian people prior to the last election: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' This Prime Minister-and her Treasureron more than one occasion went to the Australian people prior to the last election and made a solemn promise to every Australian that there would be no carbon tax under the government she leads. And why did she do that? She knew then that the polls were so close and that the carbon tax was so on the nose with the Australian people that she had to come forth and say on national television and to the national media-to be beamed into every lounge room in Australia-that there would be 'no carbon tax under a government I lead'. That is the promise that this Prime Minister made to the Australian people. And that is the promise that she ripped up in doing a deal to maintain her seat in The Lodge and to maintain her seat here at the despatch box in this parliament. In other words, in order to retain her position as the Prime Minister of Australia, she ripped up a solemn promise that she made on a number of occasions to the people of Australia. What would the government have us believe? Let us nail the lie at the heart of this issue. The government and the honourable member for Chifley, who is not such a bad bloke although he is part this dysfunctional government-he has not been here that long, so I suppose he cannot be blamed for all of their ills-in this motion before the House speak of the 'urgent need to provide households with financial relief'. Why is there an urgent need to provide Australian households with financial relief? Because the government have been saying, if you listen to them, day after day, hour after hour-we heard it again in question time today-that this tax will only be imposed on 500 companies, the 500 biggest polluters in Australia. The government has been saying that ad nauseam. Hardly anybody in this country would not have heard the government's claim that this tax will only be imposed on the 500 biggest emitters-the 500 biggest companies, to put it in other words. If that is the case, if only the 500 biggest emitters are going to have the imposition of this carbon tax upon them, if only those companies are going to be met with the cost, why is there an urgent need to provide households with financial relief? This nails the lie at the heart of this government's campaign. Ms Marino: Bells the cat.",116
272,Mr ANDREWS,IMPORTANCE,"This bells the cat, as my honourable colleague says. The reality is that urgent relief is being provided because of the carbon tax. If you have been listening to the radio or watching the television you could hardly not have noticed the as about the household assistance package. Let me read the transcript: 'Soon millions of Australians receiving government payments will get additional help with their everyday expenses. An initial payment will automatically appear on your bank account from May 2012. It is the first part of the Australian government's household assistance package. This extra assistance will become a regular part of your government payment between March next year and early of 2014. For more information …' Why is this required? If the imposition of this tax is only on 500 companies, why is urgent assistance needed for Australian families? If that were the case, it would not be needed. As I said, this is the lie at the heart of this policy proposal. Everybody knows that when a tax is imposed upon a company, that company will seek to pass on that tax to the purchasers of goods and services from that company. Where they can do it, they will pass on that tax. Where they cannot do it, they will have to try and downsize or cut their costs in other ways. One of the consequences of that would be a loss of jobs in this country, and we are seeing that already. Where those companies are in an internationally competitive position, competing with other companies producing goods or services in overseas countries that do not have this tax, then something has to give so far as the companies are concerned. Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about business, anybody who knows the faintest thing about how taxation works, anybody who has had to balance their own family books, let alone the books of a small business, knows that when there is an additional imposition by way of an additional cost for the business-which this tax is-that has to be passed on in some way, otherwise something has to give within the business. Do you think that this government will come out and honesty admit to that truth? No, they will not. This increasingly dysfunctional government, led by the chaotic Prime Minister and her office, will not come clean with the Australian people. If they honestly believe that they need a carbon tax, they should say, 'Yes, we need a carbon tax and it is going to cost you.' Why don't they have the guts, the courage, to come forward to the Australian people and say that to them? No, they will not. They want to walk both sides of the street: on the one hand this is a tax applied only to 500 companies and on the other hand we need urgent financial assistance for every family in Australia. The reality is those two things do not add up, and anybody who spends a moment thinking about it can see, as I have described at the heart of this policy. Yet day after day after day we get the Prime Minister in here pretending that somehow these realities do not work. Not only that, this tax is so toxic that they cannot mention it in the advertisements on television and on radio. In Senate estimates it was revealed that the focus groups put together to test the best lines in order to present this to the Australian people found that the toxicity of the carbon tax was such that they did not even bother to put it to the focus groups, knowing what the reaction would be. We know that because of reports coming from government backbenchers, they are afraid to doorknock in their own electorates because people will tell them directly what they think about this carbon tax. If my experience is true, they will also say that they want to get rid of this government as quickly as they can. That is the reality so far as this matter is concerned. We have two worlds here. We have this unreal world of Treasury modelling-we had the honourable member for Chifley telling us about Treasury modelling and the impact of prices-and then we have the real world in which ordinary Australians live. Let me tell you something about the real world in which Australians live. From the December quarter of 2007 to the December quarter of 2011, four years, what has happened in the real world of Australians? Their electricity prices have gone up by 61per cent. That is even without a carbon tax.",117
273,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE,That's right!,118
274,Mr ANDREWS,IMPORTANCE,"You're saying that's fine and you want to do something about the cost-of-living pressures. This is the unreal world that this government lives in. 'That's fine,' interjects the honourable member opposite-a 61 per cent increase in electricity prices. But that is not all. Gas it, the lie prices have gone up by",118
275,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE,"On a point of order, Deputy Speaker, I think that the honourable member misheard my comment which was, 'That is right; that is correct.' He is attempting to mislead the parliament with that misrepresentation. Mr Andrews interjecting",118
276,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," I am happy to let you have the call when I give you the call, but until then it is probably better to be silent. The honourable member for Menzies in continuation.",118
277,Mr ANDREWS,IMPORTANCE,"Electricity prices have gone up by 61 per cent. Gas prices over four years have increased on average across Australia by 37 per cent. Water and sewerage rates across Australia have increased by 58 per cent. Petrol prices across Australia are up by eight per cent. Health costs have increased by 20 percent. If you go to the doctor or you need some medical attention, health costs have gone up by 20 per cent across Australia in this government's term. The price of bread has gone up by nine per cent across Australia and the price of food on average has gone up by 13 per cent across Australia in four years. Fruit and vegetables have gone up by 20 per cent and rent, where people do not own their homes, has increased by 25 per cent over the last four years. We have these two worlds: this totally unreal world that the honourable members opposite are trying to pretend we live in-as if things just go according to whatever Treasury has modelled-and the real world of people who are going to the supermarket, the people who are going to the service station to fill up their car, the people paying for their rent, the people using public transport, the people driving on the freeways-the millions of Australians and their world. The great English statesman, Benjamin Disraeli, said 150 or so years ago that between two nations there was no connection. At that time he was talking about the rich and the poor. There are two nations here between which there is no connection-between the government and the real people of Australia, because these costs are going up and we have not even got to the carbon tax. What is the carbon tax going to do to Australians? Just today in question time we had an example of transport. What the government expects of their fuel excise over the next forward estimates is a $920 million increase in revenue. That $920 million is going to get passed on by every transport company that is transporting goods around this country. If we are talking about transport, consider the service station owner who has just tendered out for his electricity under this competitive arrangement and in the tender documents that came back there was a carbon tax component of $13,141. That represented just over 18 per cent on his annual bill, and yet we are being told that it will have only a few dollars impact. This one service station is faced with an 18 per cent increase on what is being projected for the carbon tax. The City of Sydney will have to collect an additional $921,000 in rates and the cities of Wollongong and Blacktown will need to collect almost half a million dollars extra in rates. If anyone wants to check this, I make this suggestion: ring up your local council and ask them how much are they factoring in for the carbon tax in terms of their expenditure in the next year. I have spoken to my local councils and they are factoring in a very significant amount for what they will have to find. In other words, how much will rates go up because of this carbon tax? I have mentioned just two things. One is ordinary transport costs for every good that is supplied and provided around this country, which flows through to food prices. It flows through to the goods that we buy from the shelves of shops which are usually trucked in from somewhere else around the country, often overnight. The other is the councils. When the street lights are turned on, when the waste is disposed of-all of that attracts a carbon tax. Somehow, these people come in here and pretend that this is not going to have an impact. But, as I said, you cannot be saying it impacts upon only 500 companies in this country and yet come in here with a motion which says there is an urgent need to talk about financial assistance to familiesand they are spending $36 million on media advertising to sell this particular proposalthe one in which the carbon tax does not speak its name. It is hidden away in the budget as a nice little line item under the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. That is on top of the $70 million this government is already spending on advertising. It is estimated that this government is spending something like $270,000 per day of Australian taxpayers' money in order to advertise this urgent need to provide financial assistance for something they tell us is not going to affect us. This is a joke. It comes from a government that is not even a joke. This is a government that is dysfunctional and a Prime Minister who evades questions she is asked here in question time. This is a Prime Minister who told the unionists she was furious about a labour agreement and yet turned around and said she knew nothing about it. This is a totally dysfunctional government. I hope that some of the backbenchers in the Labor Party do go door-knocking, because what they will hear is that Australian people are totally fed up with this government, with the lies, with the dissembling and with the dysfunction. They want some security. It is about time we delivered hope and reward and opportunity to people of Australia and that will only come by having an election.  pains me in a way to follow the member for Menzies, who I used to share a corridor with and had quite a bit of time for. I was pained because I thought he had actually stolen my speech. When he was talking about the rise in electricity prices of 61 per cent, of water and sewerage by 50 per cent, of gas over the last four years of 37 per cent, I thought he had stolen my speech. It is difficult for me use exactly the same information in my speech, talking about why we need to provide some relief for families. It is important that we do that in the context of putting in a carbon price on 1 July, because as the member for Menzies-I was going to say passionately-so vociferously put it",118
278,Mr Andrews,IMPORTANCE,"Eloquently.  interjection! There are a lot of families in my electorate and in the member for Menzies's electorate who are doing it tough. In fact, that is why we have been putting money into the member for Menzies's electorate. In Menzies 6,000 families have received extra money over the last few weeks-more than $1 million for his families going into his communities that can then be spent as his electors see fit. There are 17,000 pensioners in Menzies who are receiving more than $3½ million that will then circulate through those communities, through those community organisations, through those clubs, through the business, all because of the Gillard government's commitment to look after those people who are doing it a bit tough. So if the member for Menzies wants to tell his 6,000 families that he wants to vote no to that money, if he wants to tell those 17,000 pensioners in his own electorate that they do not deserve this extra support in that context of rising electricity prices, he will have some explaining to do. My understanding is that the Commonwealth government does not actually own any power stations and it does not actually deliver any power to people. That is the business of state governments and private enterprises. We do not own any gasfired power stations delivering electricity, or even any water plants. But I do understand that when I go around my electorate, when I doorknock, when I talk to to people at community functions about the mining boom and how great things are, the people in my electorate say, 'There might be a mining boom on but I am not experiencing it. There might be a guy down the street who works in the mining industry who is getting a new back deck and a new car, but I am not experiencing that.' You talk to builders and they say, 'If you do renovations and you are not building for someone in the mining sector, you are not building.' It is as simple as that. The reality is that it is a two-speed economy. If you are working in the tourism sector in Queensland, you know how tough it is. You go to places like Cairns where there is unemployment north of 14 per cent and you understand that there are households throughout Australia particularly in the patchy parts that need support. But let us go back a bit and put the overall context for Australia. Let us remember the underlying facts here. We have a triple-A rating from all ratings agencies for the first time in Australia's history. Forget the doom and gloom, the jeremiah as and the Hanrahans opposite; the reality is that we have got a triple-A rating. The rest of the world, the IMF and the World Bank included, say, 'Australia you are doing great!' It is admitted by those opposite when they are overseas. When they are overseas they say, 'Yes, we have got serious bragging rights. We have got a healthy economy. Things are going well.' Imagine that conversation with the Spaniards where they have got youth unemployment nudging 50 per cent. Our overall unemployment has got a four in front of it-4.9 per cent. Sure, our cash rate compared to the rest of the world is a little bit different-we have still got a lot of room to manoeuvre-but it is significantly better at 3.75 per cent now than the 6.75 per cent it was one we came to power. The average family with a mortgage is $3,000 better off. The member for North Sydney, with his mortgage, a loan that he forgot to declareand I think I have some information on his mortgage here; it was written up in the paper as $710,000-is about $7,000 better off per year, thanks to the policies of the Gillard Labor government. We have got great investment pipelines of half a trillion dollars-and that is a term you do not see used very often-of development and manufacturing and the like, particularly in mining, coming towards Australia. Retail sales figures came out today-and obviously things could be a bit better there. The balance of trade is the best it has ever been in the history of Australia. There is a bit more work to be done in productivity, but hopefully with some innovations and post the Queensland floods we will see productivity start to head in the right direction, particularly with the NBN. Obviously, that will be an advance in the future, with jobs of the future being via the NBN. That puts the overall context of what Australia is like, but obviously we do need to do a lot to help households. So how are we doing it? For a start, we say yes to giving money to parents who have school kids, the 1.7 million Australians who have kids in school. There are people in the chamber who have children at school and they know how much this would be appreciated-not that they will be receiving this money. For primary school students it will be $410 each and for secondary students it will be $820 each. If you are a normal family with two or three kids, right now receiving that money will be of great benefit. For families, if you are receiving family tax benefit part A, there will be $110 extra per child. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said no. Families receiving family tax benefit part B get $69 extra. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? No. The 3.2 million pensioners will receive upfront lump-sum payments-a lot of them right now and over the coming months in my electorate will receive the money. If they are singles, they will receive $250; if they are couples, they will receive $380 combined. Again, in March next year that there will be a permanent boost to their pension payments. So, overall, the singles will receive $338 extra a year, and couples $510 extra a year. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said, 'We will claw that back. We will take that back.' He said no. So a single pensioner on the maximum rate is now $4,000 better off because of this Labor government. Let us not forget the workers, the seven million Australians who in 31 days time will receive a tax cut. Everyone earning less than $80,000 will receive a tax cut. For most people it will be $300 a year-not to be sneezed at-but, if you are one of the lowerpaid people, we are going to triple the tax-free threshold. It is a great thing to do. I thought the party of Menzies and the like would be in favour of tax cuts, but instead the Leader of the Opposition said no. As for part-time workers, if they are earning $25,000, they will have an extra $500 in their pocket every year, and they will have that in the first week or so of July. When they go to the shops they will have more money in their pocket, more money in their wallet, from the very first pay packet. And, remember, if they earn less than $18,200, they will pay no tax at all. Self-funded retirees-a very vocal group in my community who make sure that I know their concerns-who receive the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, will also receive an upfront lump-sum payment in June to help over the coming time, because, as we do admit, the pricing signals associated with this pricing pollution will have an impact on people. We are trying to change behaviour. That is why there will be an impact. But they too will receive $250 as part of the seniors supplement. Obviously, the low-income households on $30,000 a year or a couple earning less than $45,000 a year could be eligible for a yearly lump-sum payment of $300. In question time today, mention was made of an article in the West Australian by one of the Leader of the Opposition's colleagues, questioning his negativity, his ability to say no, no, no all the time. There was even a suggestion that some of his colleagues want to rehabilitate him in terms of his inclination to say no. Obviously that would be a very big project and obviously they have started that process. They tried to make him go to rehab but he said, 'No, no, no.' That is what he said. He was not even able to say yes to the pensioners in his electorate, yes to the families in his electorate, yes to the people in the low-income households in his electorate, or yes to the pensioners who need this $250 to $380 to help them with cost-of-living pressures. Instead, he relies on no.",120
279,Mr TUDGE,IMPORTANCE," I rise to also speak on this matter of public importance. It asks us to discuss the facts about the carbon tax. We on this side of the House are very happy about the facts about the carbon tax. In fact, we will talk about them day in, day out right up until the next election and beyond. The first fact we should know about the carbon tax is that it was introduced based on a lie. Every single one of us in this House, with the exception of the few Independents, went to the election in 2010 saying that we would not introduce a carbon tax if we were elected to this parliament. That was every single member on this side of the House and every member on that side of the House. The Prime Minister famously said a few days before the last election that, if she was elected Prime Minister, there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led. It will be a statement that will follow her until the end of her political time in this parliament because that is the basis of the lie. This is the first fact that we need to discuss whenever we discuss the facts about the carbon tax. The second fact that we should be discussing about the carbon tax is that it will have enormous economic pain on this nation at a time when we can least afford it. It will have pain in at least two ways. It will have pain by putting upward pressure on the cost of living and it will cause pain with job losses across the community. Let me address that first one about putting upward pressure on the cost of living for everyday families. You just have to look at the government's own figures. They have tabled the modelling to which the member for Chifley referred, and that modelling itself says that the carbon tax will cause electricity prices to increase 10 per cent in the first year alone. That modelling says that it will cause gas prices to increase by nine per cent in the first year alone. There is modelling from other independent agencies that say it will cause Australian made motor vehicles to increase in price by $400. There is modelling by the Master Builders Association that says that it will increase the cost of a newly built house in Australia by $5,000. We know of other modelling that says that rates will go up by at least one to 1½ per cent. In my own electorate, which covers most of the Knox municipality, they have already made the decision to increase rates by $1½ million for the residents of Knox due to the carbon tax. That is a 1½ per cent increase on the rates for every single residence across my electorate. These price increases are when the carbon tax is at $23 per tonne in the first year. But we know that the carbon tax is legislated to increase to $29 per tonne by 2016 and that it is forecast to go up to $37 per tonne by 2020 and then up to an incredible $350 per tonne by 2050. We talk about the price impact today on electricity, on gas, on rates, on house prices and on motor vehicles, but what about when it gets to $29 or $37 or up to $350? The prices will just continue to go up and up and up and up. The previous speaker, the member for Moreton, said the whole point of this was to put up prices. That is the whole point of the carbon tax regime. It is actually to put up prices. At least the Prime Minister had the honesty to admit this when, back at the beginning of 2011, she said: I want to be very clear with Australians about what pricing carbon does. It has price impacts, it's meant to-that's the whole point. That is exactly right. It is the whole point that it puts prices up and these prices will go up across the board and they will continue to go up as the carbon tax goes up from $23 per by tonne right up to $350 per tonne by 2050. I mentioned the impact on jobs. We have also had some economic modelling done by the Treasury departments in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and elsewhere. In Queensland, under Anna Bligh's premiership, they did some modelling and said that the carbon tax would cost Queensland 21,000 jobs. In Victoria it would be 23,000 jobs according to the Victorian Treasury modelling. In New South Wales it would be 31,000 jobs. Let us have a look at the government's own modelling and the aluminium industry figures in the government's package, which says that the impact of the carbon tax will have the aluminium industry. But, in the government's own figures, perhaps the most astounding number of them all-and the government does not like to talk about thisis that between now and 2050 the carbon tax will decrease our GDP by $1 trillion between now and 2050. To put that into context, that is the equivalent of a whole year's worth of economic output between now and 2050. So, for every single Australian between now and 2050, one of your year's of work will just disappear because of the impact of the carbon tax. To suggest that it will not have any impact on jobs to lose a year's worth of output is, frankly, preposterous. But it is right there in the government's numbers. Let me go to the third fact. I have pointed out the first fact about it being based on and I have discussed the second fact about it having a tremendous economic impact in relation to cost-of-living pressures and jobs. The third fact in relation to the carbon tax is that the compensation will be insufficient for the carbon tax impact in very many cases. It will certainly be insufficient for all of the other price impacts which this government are having through their various other policies. We know, for example, that, in their own words, at least 40 per cent of Australians will be worse off as a result of this carbon tax package. That includes, for example, a person who might be earning $90,000 as an electrician and who is married to somebody who is earning $30,000 as a part-time retail assistant. A family with those incomes would receive $306 in compensation, according to the government, but would be hit by $681 by the carbon tax-that is, they would be $375 worse off each and every year. And this, of course, is reliant upon the government modelling being accurate, when we know that in previous years the government's forecasts have been far from accurate. Two years ago they said that this year's deficit was going to be $12 billion and, of course, it has ended up being $45 billion. So we question whether that modelling will be correct. There are, of course, an array of other areas where the government is putting upward pressure on prices. It is putting upward pressure on prices through the 22 other taxes which it has introduced in the last four or five years. It has been putting upward pressure on families' cost of living by reducing family tax benefits and eliminating the entrepreneurs tax offset. It is also changing the policy settings in child care, in the private health insurance rebate and in shipping reforms, which makes things more a lie expensive. And, of course, in its macro settings it is making the economy less productive overall. The carbon tax, though, is the worse of it all. To address cost-ofliving pressures we must get rid of the carbon tax and we must change this government.",122
280,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE," I just want to put on the record that, while the member for Aston has spoken against the assistance that is going to families, for my part, in the seat of Robertson, I actually believe that my families really do want this money. I know that those who have already received it are extremely appreciative of the support from the federal government. The member for Aston, opposite, has actually just made a speech against 9,000 families in his own electorate. That is 9,000 families that the member for Aston says do not need assistance with the cost of living. Now, I did hear some facts-a few facts-in the speech we have just heard about the real pressure that there is on families. We do acknowledge that there are cost-of-living pressures. That is why we are actually doing something about it and practically helping those people-even the 9,000 families in the member for Aston's seat, whom he seems not to want to help in any way. Yesterday we started delivering extra money to more than 16,000 pensioners from that same electorate. I am sure that those pensioners will be very, very happy to receive that assistance to help them with cost-of-living pressures. I would like to make a comment about the small businesses in the seat of Aston, which could find that the pressure being taken off local families and off local pensioners actually does something-dare I hope for this-to inspire a little confidence and put a little positivity back into the public place instead of the carping, mindless negativity and the permanent nay-saying-the no, no, no, nothat we get day-in and day-out in this place from the Leader of the Opposition. So let us get the facts straight-because this is a debate about facts, not hysteria. The member for Aston is telling 9,000 families and 16,000 pensioners in his electorate that they do not deserve extra support to make ends meet. He is telling them that if the coalition parties actually get into government that he and the Leader of the Opposition will rip off them every single cent that they have seen in their accounts this week. That is the fact. There is a very, very big difference between those on the other side-the take-itaway Tories-and the Labor Party, who are actually supporting people who live real lives in real seats like yours and mine, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am delighted to speak today on the urgent need to provide households with financial relief based on facts surrounding the introduction of a carbon price on 1 July, and I very much thank the member for Chifley for putting this matter of public importance on the record. The Gillard government is building a strong economy for all Australians. We are making tough decisions that have to be made when you are in government. Sometimes in my role as a parent I do not always want to make tough decisions but, in the long term, there are moments where you have to make a choice. And we have made decisions that will ensure that we remain the strongest-performing economy in the world. The facts are that unemployment is very low, inflation is very low and official interest rates are very low. In fact, for the first time in 40 years all of those indicators are under five per cent. That is a definite sign of strong economy, an economy in which Australians should have confidence and hope. But, while they are having a bit of trouble with managing the cost of living, we are going to help them-and we are going to do this despite the whimpering, the whining and the wrecking of those opposite. The thing that marks us out as so different from those opposite is that we actually do understand that families and pensioners are feeling the pinch. We understand that the relentless negativity campaign has only served to benefit the few-those on the opposite side who want to whinge day in, day out-while it has hurt business and consumer confidence. There is nothing good about that for businesses in my electorate and there is nothing good about that for ordinary families, pensioners and self-funded retirees in my electorate. I am very proud to be a member of the Labor Party and the Labor government committed to helping Australians with the reality of cost of living pressures. We stand in stark contrast to those opposite, who assail the public with the same platitudes and negative comments, trash-talking the economy day in and day out. We understand that, by putting a price on carbon, 500 polluters are basically going to pay to put out the trash. That is the sort of trash that we should be paying attention to, not the trashtalking of the opposition. They are polluting, so they are going to pay-500 of them. We know that businesses do pass on costs. That affects prices. The Treasury has made it very clear that there will be a 0.7 per cent price impact. Let's get this fact straight: we are making polluters pay. Let's get this fact straight: we are helping families in electorates right across this country, even if the members who represent them do not want them to have that money. We know for a very a fact that families in Robertson, my electorate, and all across the country deserve support. They do not appreciate all these hollow media stunts. We are giving the support-that is a fact. Another fact: how many households are we going to help? Under our clean energy future package, we are actually going to help six million households, who will get their expected average cost increases fully covered by tax cuts or increased payments, or both. The fact is that there will be changes to tax. So, if anybody is listening to this, remember that you will be benefiting from the tripling of the tax-free threshold. That means that one million people will not have to lodge a tax return after 1 July. Eighteen thousand two hundred dollars is what you will be able to earn before you have to pay one cent of tax. Imagine that. Imagine one million Australians not having to fill in a tax return. This is going to improve their lives, not just because, I am sure, they will be happy to not have to undertake that paperwork but because they will have more money in their pay packets every single week. Let's get another fact on the record. Because of the Labor government's commitment to put a price on carbon, you get to keep every cent you earn up to $18,200. Another fact: in Robertson I have about 56,000 people who pay tax and about 47,000 of those taxpayers in my electorate are going to receive a tax cut. Of that 47,000, at least 38,000 will receive a tax cut of at least $300. I know that right now probably some mums and dads are on the Central Coast driving around, taking kids to sportto soccer or AFL, with the Tigers at West Gosford-or maybe they are going to dancing lessons at Erina. One of the things that they will be thinking about is how they are going to make ends meet. They can be assured. The fact is that money is going into their accounts to assist them with the cost of living. Mums and dads who are returning to part-time work after the birth of a child and people who might be semi-retired and still want to work are going to have the factual advantage of money in their pocket because of the changes that we are bringing in. More than 10,600 families in Robertson are going to receive extra cash through their family assistance payments. This will absolutely make sure that families on the Central Coast will be able to manage their family budgets. We want to take a bit of pressure off the family. We want to give families the best chance to get a good start in life. So we are helping them. That is a fact. Right across the country we are helping them. One point six million families are going to get assistance because of the price on carbon. If families get family tax benefit A, they will get $110 per child. If they get family tax benefit B, they will get $69 per child. In fact, most of the families in my electorate have already received that. What have we heard from the Leader of the Opposition? He is going to get rid of the carbon price. He says that loudly, but do you know what? We do not hear that, when he does that, he is going to put his hand into the pockets of these millions of families and take away all of the assistance that we are giving them. We are going to see a massive impact if that comes to be, not only through a lack of vision for our country but through a real, practical, negative impact on people in the electorate of Robertson and right around this country. We know that a price on carbon is the right thing to do. It is a tough thing to do, but it builds a future for this nation that gives us a strong economic base. We absolutely understand, as the member for Chifley stated in his matter of public importance today, that we need to deal in fact, and the fact is: families need assistance with the cost of living and we are delivering that. The fact is in their bank balances right now.",124
281,Mr MCCORMACK,IMPORTANCE," There is a word which must never be spoken in this place whenever Labor refers to carbon pricing. It is the word 'tax'. I call on those opposite to just once call this insidious policy what it is: a tax. A tax is a tax is a tax. In the days after the 2010 election, Julia Gillard gleefully shrilled, 'Let's draw back the curtains and let the sun shine in.' She was talking about the openness of government and the importance of Australians being fully informed about the decisions of their parliament and the government of the day. She said Labor was a party of truth tellers. If this rhetoric-this hyperbole, as she would probably call it-applies to anything, it should include the impact of the decision by the Prime Minister to introduce a carbon tax. Just five days out from the election, she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' The Prime Minister has already broken that 16 August promise, that there would be no carbon tax, but this is no reason for us not to let the sun shine in by ensuring that all Australians understand the full impact of the carbon tax. I point out the very wording of this matter of public importance. It talks about 'the urgent need to provide households with financial relief based on facts surrounding the introduction of a carbon tax on July 1'-a carbon price, sorry. I have used the word 'tax'. The member for Chifley would not use the word 'tax', but that is what it is. If there such an urgent need to provide households with financial relief, why bring it in in the first place? Why burden families, farmers, businesses-ordinary, everyday hard working Australians-with a tax the Prime Minister said, five days before the election, that she would not introduce? But we all know that this government likes to tax. The regulator in New South Wales has confirmed that, thanks largely to the carbon tax, families and businesses will pay an average 16 per cent more on their electricity bills, adding between $182 and $381 to the average household bill. The federal government knows businesses will pass these extra costs on to their customersyou, me and all other Australians. The government claims to be compensating Australians with additional compensation but even its own modelling shows that millions of households will be worse off. The best way for citizens to know whether or not they are getting enough compensation is to ensure transparency-a word those opposite probably do not know the meaning of-in the price rises the people of Australia are going to be hit with. But there is nothing transparent about this government. Their latest compensation for the carbon tax is nothing but a con. This is a carbon tax Australians did not vote for. Hardly anybody in this place voted for it. The member for Melbourne certainly came to the election with a view that a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme-call it what you like-was necessary. I often hear the member for Lyne grumbling behind me and saying, 'It's not just the member for Melbourne.' Maybe he too was in support of it. That is two out of 150 representatives in this place. The rest of us were against it. The rest of us went to the people at the election saying that there would not be a carbon tax under the government we were in. The regional independents have sold is out their constituencies by siding with Labor and the Greens and propped up the government. On 24 February 2011 we had that awful press conference where Senator Bob Brown, the Greens leader and quasiPrime Minister at the time, almost shouldered Prime Minister Gillard out of the way and proudly announced that there was going to be a price on carbon-a tax. Labor can try to make itself feel better about the burden it is placing on Australia through the introduction of this tax but it should not. Every Labor member-members who claim to represent the disadvantaged members of society and some who even claim to represent regional areas-should be ashamed of the cost they are lumping on everyday, ordinary Australians. They are making people disadvantaged. The best way-in fact, the only way-to ensure that Australians are not crippled by this terrible, insidious tax is to scrap it. The claim that compensation will assist Australians with the financial pressure they will feel under a carbon tax is sheer nonsense. It is a ridiculous money-go-round. It is wealth redistribution by any other name. Many dualincome families will be worse off once they reach the typical income of a school teacher and a shop assistant or that of a policeman and a part-time nurse. Self-funded retirees who do not qualify for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, including all those under the age of 65, will receive nothing. For what? It is not going to reduce the sea levels or change the shoreline by so much as a millimetre. It is not going to drop global temperatures by so much as a degree. It is just a nonsense. The longer this tax is in place, the worse the consequences will be for the economy, jobs, families and, certainly, regional Australia. The compensation simply will not be enough to outweigh the extra costs Australians will be hit with. Australia will pay the carbon tax through higher electricity prices. The member for Robertson talked about people who would be driving their kids to sport-and they would be. In her electorate of Robertson they would also be driving them to dancing practice and those sorts of things. The member for Robertson represents an area which is under 1,000 square kilometres. My area, the Riverina, is over 60,000 square kilometres and I know that people in my area are going to be paying this carbon tax through the petrol bowser, as will the people in the member for Robertson's electorate. When people travel for sport, dancing classes and all those sorts of things in the Riverina it is not just a little drive down the road. Sometimes it takes hours to get from point A to point B to have a game of footy for the kids or dancing competitions for those young ones who enjoy it. Unfortunately, those young ones who enjoy their footy and their this dancing may well not be able to do that, because for some families the cost pressures will be too high. This carbon tax is going to be paid for by everybody: through the power point, the bowser and-certainly in Wagga Wagga, Coolamon shire and Griffith-through their rates, because their rubbish tips are deemed to be over that threshold limit of 25,000 tonnes. Following this year's deferment by the Treasurer, they are eventually going to be forced to pay a carbon tax through their rates. That is just totally ridiculous. I could do no better than to quote an article from the Daily Advertiser, Wagga's local newspaper. They have called for heavy polluters to be punished, not everyone. As the Daily Advertiser quite rightly pointed out, it is just a load of rot that the local ratepayers are going to be forced to pay a carbon tax because they have to take rubbish to their tip. Wagga Wagga City Council is now going to be put right up there with Orica, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and the rest as one of Australia's biggest polluters. When you think about it, those companies that I mentioned are not 'biggest polluters'-they are job creators. They are taking jobs to the people, taking resources out of the ground and creating wealth for this country, and they are being hammered by the government over there which is only interested in creating class warfare that is not needed. Recently, Wagga's annual emissions were reduced to 28,000 tonnes per year. This is good news for Wagga because, instead of having to pay over a million dollars in proposed carbon tax payments, they are only going to have to pay $660,000 in the year after next. That is $660,000 that will not be spent on fixing potholes, on children's playground equipment or on libraries. That is ridiculous. As Tim Blair pointed out on Monday, 14 May in the Daily Telegraph: One tonne of rubbish, according to the government, generates one tonne of carbon tax windfall gas. You might want to ask your own council how many tonnes of rubbish it's piling every year. If the amount is close to the 25,000 tonne tax threshold, you'd actually be doing the council a favour by throwing your old mattresses and televisions in the river. Dump car bodies in the scrub and save the town library. Is that what we want from this government which purports to be so environmentally friendly? Is that what we want from this government which is cobbled together by the Greens here in the lower house and definitely in the upper house, where they are led by the nose by Christine Milne and all the rest, and Adam Bandt? It is a disgrace that we have to have a carbon tax when the Prime Minister said five days out from the election that there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. It is an absolute con. It is a disgrace, and those members opposite know it. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (16:45): I rise to talk on this matter of public importance because I think the public does have a right to know exactly what is going on here. What we know is that this government is being very coy with the facts. Let us remember it was this Prime Minister who said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'-a solemn promise that she made to all Australians at the last election. Here we have less than a month until we have a carbon tax. This is a government that is spending $270,000 a day-$36 million-on advertisements about the carbon tax. It talks about the cash bribes but does not actually mention what they are about, but the public knows it is all about the world's biggest carbon tax, Labor's toxic carbon tax. Everyone knows that Labor's toxic carbon tax will cascade right through the economy, and that is why Labor are desperately out there spending up and calling it compensation. Despite Labor's lie that only the big emitters will pay the price, the cost of virtually everything will go up and up and up up. We know it is not just the big emitters; it is everyday Australians who will pay the price for the carbon tax. Like many Australians, I am very concerned about the increases in electricity, petrol prices and the council rate increases that Territorians and, indeed, all Australians will face from 1 July because of the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax, which will cause us to have the world's highest electricity prices. Australian household electricity prices have already increased by 40 per cent since 2007 and are predicted to go up by at least another 10 per cent in the first year of the carbon tax. Fact No. 1: Territorians will be slugged more for electricity because Power and Water, our only electricity provider, was included on the carbon tax hit list. It is considered one of Australia's biggest polluters, providing electricity to 200,000 plus people. From 1 July Territory families will be slugged on average an extra $2.61 a week for electricity under the carbon tax. Territorians will clearly be worse off under the carbon tax, and the carbon tax compensation being handed out will not be enough for many families. The government's own figures indicate that thousands of Territorian households will be worse off under the carbon tax. Their own figures indicate that 40 per cent of Australians will not receive compensation. Let me share some examples with you. Tiffany V, a constituent of mine, last week told my staff she received a text message to say that she has had $69.35 paid into her account as part of the household assistance payment. This is her quote: 'Honestly, Labor Party, that tiny amount going into help with your carbon tax? Stop kidding yourselves.' She then went on to say that her latest power bill jumped by $250, her most expensive bill yet-and the carbon tax is not even there. We all know that the carbon tax will act as the wrecking ball across the Territory economy and Territorians will be paying for it through increased prices, higher energy bills and pressure on local businesses that are already experiencing high cost of living pressures. I have spoken in this place many times about petrol and how this carbon tax is a tax on remoteness. Everything in the Northern Territory is freighted in. We are completely and utterly dependent on freight and freight companies. Everything from fruit, veg and general groceries to building materials is transported into the Territory by road, rail or air. There is a lot of this freight that comes in by diesel road trains, and we all know that that will be affected by the carbon tax. This toxic tax is definitely a tax on remoteness. Do not take my word for it. I have a letter here from Toll, which is putting Territorian customers on notice that freight costs are likely to go up because of the carbon tax. This is not going to be a good thing for Territorians. Our cost of living is already high, and Territorians tell me every day that they do not support a carbon tax. They tell me that a carbon tax will not do anything for the environment. It will only push up cost of living pressures-something that Territorians are already struggling with. Lyn, another constituent of mine, says she is worried about the electricity and whether she will be able to afford the increase of $2.61 a week under the carbon tax. She is married with no children and will not receive any compensation. I have also heard from Palmerston residents Megan and Scott Smith, who have three children, a mortgage and a dog. They have done the figures, and the carbon tax compensation that they get will not cover their costs. They tell me they already forgo meat on a regular basis because it is too expensive, so any further cost increases will be detrimental to them. Then there are John and Sarah, who are a single-income family with two children under five from the northern suburbs. They have worked out that the compensation simply will not be enough to outweigh the extra costs that they will be hit with. Their household salary is $85,000. Or there is northern suburbs construction worker Clint and his public servant wife. They have one son, a mortgage and two dogs, and they are a typical family. Combined income for them is $130,000 a year, so they are not eligible for any carbon tax compensation. Fishing is their favourite family pastime, but they fear that it may be jeopardised because of the carbon tax and the extra increases in fuel. They do not consider themselves rich; they consider themselves average, hard working Territorians who want a fair go, and they want to be properly compensated by this government. They do not want a carbon tax. Every day I am told how people in my electorate are worried about meeting their home loan repayments and that the Gillard Labor government is now making people pay more for energy, fuel and food because of the Prime Minister's carbon tax lie. Hardworking families are already doing it tough. How are they going to budget for another few hundred dollars in their spending? What about small business? Small business is, as we know, the engine room of our economy. The Territory's small business operators are worried that this toxic carbon tax will spell the end for them. Small businesses will receive no compensation for the carbon tax, and they are in the firing line with average weekly cost increases of $15.80 from the carbon price and $13.38 through an increase in power and water charges. Of course, small businesses will be forced to pass on these added expenses to the consumer, and the business owners tell me that they are burdened by a drop in consumer spending. This government does not understand that, if businesses are hit by the carbon tax, of course they will have to pass it on, and that that means everyday Territorians will be paying extra for electricity, food and fuel under a carbon tax. I have spoken to private airline operators, builders, equipment suppliers, fish-and-chip shop owners, grocers, butchers, florists and market stall owners, and they have all told me the same thing: this tax will make their costs go up and they will have to pass on these costs to everyday Territorians. I was very concerned to hear that this tax will be the final nail in the coffin of some businesses. A few weeks ago, a local business operator who employs 13 people and who earns around $85,000 a year wrote to me saying that Julia Gillard's 'lie' will his business. He is 59 years old, and his wife is 70. She cannot receive a pension because he works, yet, like most Territorian families, they still have a mortgage. He wanted to know why he was not eligible for the welfare gift, and he is angry that Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan consider him to be rich. He told me that he does not know how he will manage his operating costs or how he and his wife will survive. These are real-life Territory examples of people who are doing it tough and who are genuinely concerned about the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax promise. As I have said time and time again in this place, families will be better off under a coalition government because we will remove the carbon tax and deliver real tax cuts. Only a coalition government will give Australia hope, reward and opportunity, because we on this side of the House do not support a carbon tax. Only a coalition government will deliver to Australians an Australia free of a carbon tax.",127

I Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,132
288,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS," I rise to speak today in relation to the Clean to Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012, and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012. Once again the government has sought to mislead the Australian people. I speak on behalf of the people of my electorate of Wright, whom I represent, because I aim to make every effort to ensure that they are made aware of the inherent deception that is the perpetual action of this Gillard government. The carbon tax was legislated in 2010 in a package of 13 bills-a $23 a tonne tax, rising at 2.5 per cent per year in real terms to be replaced by an emission trading scheme from July 2015. With reference to the trading price, the floor price will come in at $15 and that will take us through to the year 2018. Treasury's own modelling tells us that by the year 2020 the carbon price will be at $37. I bring to the House's attention that I believe that the global price for carbon today is around $4.50. However, may I remind you that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill was not part of this package and has been introduced as a stand-alone piece of legislation. The bill establishes the board of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, giving it a statutory responsibility for decision making and management of the corporation's investments. As a parliament we have a duty of care to appropriate funds diligently. The vertical integration of funds-how they will travel through this organisation-will mean that the government will go to the market and raise money from the bond market. That, in turn, will be given to the CEFC. From there it will go on and fund projects. The government tell us that the returns from those investments will then be reinvested back into the CEFC. I want to bring the parliament's attention to the potential make-up of the CEFC, the board and the directors, and draw an analogy. Because the finance corporation is an off-the-government-books investment, not that dissimilar to the NBN, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the remuneration packages that are potentially available to the directors of this organisation could be similar to the NBN. For those of you who may not be aware of what those packages are, the No. 1 bloke in the NBN is on a salary package of about $2 million a year, which I think is outrageous. There are eight",132
289,Mr Ripoll,BILLS,They should be paid the same as politicians.,133
290,Mr Turnbull,BILLS,You've persuaded Bernie already.,133
291,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS,"I would be a starter too, if I could get the gig! There are another eight non-executives on an average of $818,000. When we start looking at remuneration packages of $2 million and an average of $818,000, I take real offence at what we pay the office of Prime Minister. Irrespective of whether we believe she is doing a good job, it makes a mockery of that process when we have an organisation running a budget of $10 million as opposed to the economy of the nation. I draw to the parliament's attention a situation that happened in Queensland, which also troubles me, which we could draw an analogy from to this organisation. About five months before the recent state election the Queensland racing board took it upon themselves to renew their contracts for five years. They wrote into the terms of the contract that in the event that they were disbanded as a board they would be given a golden handshake and the five-year term would be fully remunerated. I have concerns that when we are going to the market looking for potential directors or people to head up this CEFC, the income coming into that organisation will be over a five-year period with lots of $2 billion per year. So you will get $2 billion in the first year and $2 billion in the second, through to the fifth year-a total of $10 billion. I would be absolutely horrified if we were signing up directors with the intent that they would do the full five years on potential salary packages of $2 million, or at the minimum $818,000 if we use the comparison of the NBN remuneration package. We are on the public record as a coalition stating that we will rescind the carbon tax . So this organisation will then be disbanded. The revenue streams that will come in in the first year are $2 billion. I would encourage the government, when they are going to the market for these players, not to embarrass themselves and not embarrass the directors by locking them into five-year contracts, because we will shut this show down. And I do not want to be putting my hand into the coffers of hard-taxpaying men and women of Australia to pay out a director's fee of $2 million per year over five years-$10 million-for one year's work. That is something that may have been overlooked in consideration. How could that have been overlooked? Maybe it was overlooked because we were given 2½ hours consideration at the Economics Committee, when witnesses were called to give evidence. I just make the point that there was not enough time to complete the due diligence that this process deserved. During the inquiry we were told overwhelmingly that there was extensive consultation. I put it to this House that in the extensive consultation that was supposedly undertaken by expert panels they forgot to ask one group of people whether they wanted the carbon tax. That group was the Australian people. The Australian people were not asked if they wanted to sign up to the carbon tax. Go back to a couple of days before the last election-it is the Achilles' heel of this government-when the Prime Minister stood in front of the camera, looked down the barrel and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Why was that statement made? We all watched the polls. We all know how the polling was going. The polling was heading on a downward trajectory. It was a very close election. That single comment turned the election phase around. Do you know why? It was because the people of Australia trusted this Prime Minister. History has now shown that you cannot trust this Prime Minister. So, with reference to the remuneration for directors of the new CEFC, I send a very blunt message to the government and to those people who will be sourcing the directors: do not sign up anyone on five-year contracts, because we have made it perfectly clear that when in government we will be dismantling this. The bill gives the Clean Energy Finance Corporation the power to invest in projects for the development of Australian based renewable energy technologies, low-emissions technologies and energy efficiency projects; the power to enter into investment agreements itself and make investments through subsidiaries; and a duty to ensure that, as of 1 July 2018, half of the funds invested at that time for the purposes of its investment function are invested in renewable energy technologies. On the back of that comment, what this organisation will potentially be funding is sub-economic projects. Those are projects that the commercial market has not found to have a suitable risk rating to invest shareholder, bank or merchant funds in. The risk ratings on these are just too high. I understand that the whole concept of this body of funds is to try to attract those higherrisk organisations-but with that comes a risk factor. When we had the opportunity to question Treasury and the Climate Change Authority on the risk factor, they were rather oblivious. Whilst they had some provision for risk, I think, coming from a commercial background and having seen the number of businesses that have exited this market since 2007, it is timely that as an opposition we put under the microscope what the return on the investment will be. The bill also establishes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Special Account and appropriates funds which total $10 billion over five years, with the first instalment of $2 billion due to be paid on 1 July 2013. The account has the purpose of making payments to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is intended to be self-sustaining once it and therefore any funds returned to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation from its investments will be available reinvestment. If money is being borrowed from the bond market at, say, three to four per cent, and the government then hands that on to the CEFC, who then invest in the projects, I would suggest that R&D will not give an enormous return on investment. Due to the vertical integration and how this is being set up, I do not see a lot of return on investment coming out of that market. I may be proven wrong.",133
292,Mr Ripoll,BILLS,History may have already done that.,135
293,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS,"Go your hardest. What we have been told with reference to this is that there will be a return on investment. My point here in the House is that that will be limited. The government's own bill already envisages a loss to this taxpayer through this investment due to operating costs and write-downs-or, what we would call, failed projects-as set out in the fiscal impacts. With reference to return on investment, I think they are looking to write off forecasted amounts of up to $600 million. In the electorate of Wright, where we were devastated with the recent floods, I could do a lot with $600 million. That amount would take a lot of the pressure off the Toowoomba Range crossing. It would go a long way towards rebuilding the communities of Lockyer Valley, Murphy's Creek, Grantham and surrounding communities. It would help in Mt Sylvia, where the telecommunications network was destroyed, just to get back to where we were. So $600 million seems a big gamble, a big punt. It would seem that spending $10 billion on renewable energy would get you something. What is proposed here is that the government will spend $10 billion and that matures that will generate some form of new renewable energy. The problem, however, is that, before this bill, there was a 20 per cent for renewable energy target and now, after the $10 billion included in this bill is spent, there will still only be a 20 per cent renewable energy target. We believe that, if we had worked cooperatively and co-invested with the market, with those who were already at commercial stage, we could have met our objectives far more successfully than through pursuing high-risk, low-return programs. This bill is economically irresponsible and unlikely to achieve its stated aims. I hope for the government's sake that it does reach its aims-I genuinely do. It is an enormous amount of money. But I suggest, coming from the commercial background that I do, that not many of the ducks are lining up on this project. I say that with all sincerity. Not only is the carbon tax a bad piece of policy; it is the product of an unprecedented deceit and it is an impost on the Australian people. This is money that comes from the teachers, carpenters, farmers and nurses from my electorate of Wright-people who work each and every day to pay their taxes. Their money will be wasted on this. I want to bring to the attention of the House comments from Twiggy Forrest in his recent address at the National Press Club. He likened the government's handling of the carbon tax to a couple of blokes buying a Melbourne Cup racehorse that had the potential to make them millions and millions of dollars and then, rather than racing the horse for the second time to get their dividend, celebrating after the first race by eating the horse. Those words came from Twiggy. Yes, he has a vested interest in the mining resources sector, but it was an interesting analogy for the government's handling of funds. The government are going to talk about how successful they are and how successful this tax is going to be. But let me remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it was the coalition that created, developed and implemented the mandatory renewable energy target-successfully; it was the coalition which created, developed and implemented the then equivalent of the solar PV rebate-successfully; and it was the coalition which created, developed and implemented the solar hot water rebatesuccessfully. We have proven ourselves when it comes to handling the commercial and financial decisions of government. The majority of us on this side come from business backgrounds. We come from places where balance sheets are a basic factor in making decisions on a daily basis. When we make a wrong decision, it hurts us in the hip pocket. So we are a lot more diligent when it comes to making decisions on behalf of the nation and spending other people's money. I would suggest that the other side of politics, the Labor government, do not have the same skill set. In closing, I draw on the words of the previous leader of the Liberal Party, who said one of the problems with the Australian Labor Party is that they have a very shallow gene pool. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (17:14): I rise this afternoon to speak on the bills related to the Clean Energy Finance Corporationanother wonderful boondoggle from this government which will see $10 billion of Australian taxpayers' funds put at risk. I would like to refer to a book titled The False Promise of Green Energy and to paraphrase a little bit from it. The authors make the point that the proponents of green energy would have us believe that if we spend enough money to build windmills, add solar panels to the desert and stuff insulation into buildings there will be myriad benefits for very little risk. The end result is that billions of dollars are borrowed or, in this case, appropriated via the world's most expensive carbon tax from ordinary Australians. They have this confidence that the savings in energy, the environment and health costs will actually be achieved, but given this government's track record I have very serious concerns as to whether that will be the case. According to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's website, the objective of the CEFC is 'to overcome capital market barriers that hinder the financing, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency or low emissions technologies'. This is not the job of government. The job of government is to get out of the marketplace and let the marketplace sort the wheat from the chaff. This set of bills gives the CEFC the power to invest in financial assets for the development of Australian based, renewable energy technologies. These are projects that by their very nature, and according to what the CEFC website says, are uncommercial in nature. Why would we be putting at risk the hard-earned money of Australian taxpayers-mums and dads, small businesses, corporates-by putting it into projects that have a high or very high risk of failure? The risk is high enough such that our commercial lenders and funders and even private equity investors do not want to touch it. As the member for Wright pointed out in his contribution to this debate, we should be looking instead to provide support to the people that are already there, that have a proven commercial project and are going to add value to that project and to our economy. Part of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill sets out the parameters for the CEFC special account, which will receive $2 billion per annum in funds for the next five years, with the first instalment due to be paid on 1 July 2013. It has the purpose of receiving the payments that will ultimately be invested into these projects. I think it is worthwhile to have a look at those who have a track record in this area, and that was the previous coalition government, which committed approximately $20 billion comprehensive range of measures to restore and protect our natural environment and invested $3.5 billion in policy actions to address climate change. Those actions included: the implementation of the world's first mandatory renewable energy target, which has stimulated $3.5 billion worth of investment in renewable energy technologies since 2001; the establishment of a $4,000 rebate to help families install solar panels their homes and then the doubling of that rebate to $8,000, before it was scrapped by the Labor government; the provision of $126 million to establish a national climate change adaptation centre; and the provision of $10 billion for the National Plan for Water Security. We place a great deal of emphasis on a strong and effective policy in dealing with environmental degradation and carbon emissions. The coalition are committed to a climate change strategy based on our direct action plan to reduce emissions and to improve the environment. The direct action plan would cost an average of $800 million a year for the first four years. This compares with more than $1 billion a year that was set aside for the pink batts program over the two years of that failed program, so direct action will actually cost less than the pink batts scheme. To facilitate direct action, an emissions reduction fund would be established to support emissions reduction activities by business and industry, with a goal of 140 million tonnes of abatement each year by 2020, equating to the five per cent target which is shared by all in this House. It is interesting to note that under the government's proposed carbon tax, emissions are still going to increase and that in order to offset that increase we have to purchase carbon permits from offshore. As a country that is already a net importer of capital, why would we be looking to purchase carbon to a permits offshore which rob our future generations of wealth? We would be receiving income from export revenues and then sending money offshore again to buy carbon credits. It makes absolutely no economic sense whatsoever. The coalition's proposed emissions reduction fund will ensure that every dollar of expenditure goes towards actually reducing CO2 emissions. Direct action will in not add any additional costs to households. There will be no new taxes. There will be no pressure onMs Owens: Is that a magic pudding over there? Mr VAN MANEN: Yours is the magic pudding. As I said, there will be no new taxes as a consequence of the direct action policy. However, under this Labor government we face a new tax, effectively the world's biggest carbon tax and the most expensive one. Taxpayers will also end up paying for a suite of new bureaucracies, one of which is the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. This is because for every dollar of carbon tax revenue collected, only 55c is being returned in compensation. The $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been exposed as 'inherently wasteful', achieving 'precisely zero' in terms of real CO2 savings under a carbon tax. This conclusion has come from Centre for Independent Research Studies Research Fellow Dr Oliver Marc Hartwich, who released the report, A waste of energy: why the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is redundant. Dr Hartwich said: The physical effect of energy subsidies is precisely zero in an environment where the total emissions are pre-determined by a trading scheme. Not a single gram of carbon dioxide is saved by pumping money into renewables. Ms Owens: So it's not a tax, then-it's a trading scheme now? Mr VAN MANEN: No, you are introducing a carbon tax. What we are saying is this $10 billion that you are putting in is going to have no benefit. That is what we are saying. I appreciate the interjections from those opposite, but, as usual, they do not contribute much to the debate. As we have seen from this government's track record, we do not expect that the $10 billion will be successfully invested and, even if it was, which as I said is highly unlikely, there would be no new renewable energy generated as the target will still be 20 per cent. In total, through Senate estimates and the government's own documents, we know the Clean Energy Regulator will cost $256 million over the four-year forward estimates, with around 330 staff expected to be appointed. That is on top of the staff and costs associated with the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the $3.2 billion Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the $25 million Climate Change Authority. The CEFC is also not charged with investing in the lowest cost technologies to produce the cheapest emissions reduction. Its responsibility is to find the technologies which the market considers to be unproven, too speculative or too risky for commercial financing. This will mean that not all investments will produce a commercial return; the CEFC sets itself up for failure before it even begins. It will not be the first time we have witnessed failures of this nature. For example, the government's $700 million Solar Flagships Program in Moree and the Queensland Solar Dawn projects struggled to gain industry support. The Bligh government presided over more than $100 million of losses in the ZeroGen project, despite clear warnings from both the opposition and experts. Former Queensland Premier Beattie even said that the shadow minister for energy and resources was 'on drugs' for his warning that ZeroGen would fail. But as we all know, the shadow minister was in fact correct. The CEFC also has many of the hallmarks of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, which left Victoria in a disastrous state only two decades ago. Programs like these tell a similar story in the United States. The failures of the $700 million Solyndra project, as well as those of Beacon Power and Ener1, occurred under a similar program to the CEFC. These companies were recently joined by the collapse of Solar Trust of America, which had a $2.1 billion loan guarantee from the US energy department. I recently read that President Obama spent $90 billion of his stimulus package on green energy projects, yet at the end of the day only some 16,100 people landed jobs in the so-called new green industry. That is a cost of some $5.6 million a job. Direct action is what is needed in my electorate of Forde. A carbon tax and a Clean Energy Finance Corporation will do nothing to resolve local issues with respect to the water quality in the Logan and Albert rivers and other environmental issues. I grew up near the Logan River at Waterford and we spent plenty of time swimming and fishing in the river. These are not activities that I would undertake or recommend today, given the recent water quality reports. There is only one way to solve the issues with the water quality in our rivers and waterways and that is by protecting vital areas of biodiversity future generations. This is a practical, sustainable, long-term measure that can be implemented from the ground up. That is what our Direct Action Plan is designed to do. There is not a single dollar of carbon tax money allocated to practical, on-the-ground environmental projects. Ms Owens interjecting Mr VAN MANEN: I know the member for Parramatta finds this funny. That is a sad indictment on where this government is at. Under a coalition government we have demonstrated that we can deliver practical, on-the-ground solutions for environmental projects. One of those was our successful Green Army scheme. We will look to reintroduce the Green Army to tackle environmental issues, such as the Logan and Albert rivers in addition to planting trees around the nation to improve local environments. I mentioned during the debate on the clean energy bills that it is the height of ignorance to believe that we as a society can control global climate change via a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. It is just as ignorant to believe that the CEFC will produce one watt more of renewable energy by 2020 as a consequence of this $10 billion being spent. The CEFC also says it will not provide grants. It is intended to be commercially oriented and to make a positive return on its investments. Given we are investing $10 billion of Australian taxpayers' money, I would certainly hope that it is focused on achieving positive returns on its investments and that they are significant, given the uncommercial nature of those supposed investments. As this bill presents itself as an extension of the carbon tax, we will oppose its implementation. An economy-wide, wealthdestroying carbon tax, along with its suite of for bureaucracies that provides no practical, on the-ground environmental outcomes, is not the solution for the future of this nation.",135
294,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and cognate bills because this legislation before the House tonight epitomises why Australians have lost faith in this government. Since its election to government at the end of 2007 the federal Labor government has presided over one program debacle after another as they have recklessly mismanaged billions upon billions of taxpayers' dollars. We have seen billions wasted and lives lost over the Home Insulation Program. We have seen billions wasted on school halls as infrastructure was priced at up to three times the commercial rate and it was thrust on to schools whether it met their needs or not. We have seen the government commit $50 billion to the National Broadband Network without a cost benefit analysis, only after their first attempt at a $4.7 billion broadband plan failed to secure a tenderer. Indeed there are a number of similarities between the content of these bills and the legislation relating to the National Broadband Network, but I will return to those matters later in my contribution. But the bottom line is that this legislation has all the hallmarks of what is wrong and dysfunctional with this out-oftouch government. One would have thought after all of these funding debacles the government would have taken a step back and questioned the way they draft policies and the way they implement programs. But not this government. If you believe the BER program was pink batts on steroids, and if you believe the National Broadband Network is the BER on steroids, then I am sad to say that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation bills are the NBN on steroids when it comes to losing money. The reality is that by tabling these clean energy bills the government has shown it is intent on arrogantly pursuing poor public policy that will leave the long-suffering Australian taxpayer with a multi-billiondollar debt. It is also clear that the government is willing to trash democracy and not give the Australian people a chance to vote on a major public policy issue that Labor did not take to the election. The Prime Minister told the Australian people, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Yet on 1 July the world's biggest carbon tax will be introduced and a $10 billion free-for-all will be created without the Australian people having the ability to cast their judgment through an election. It is extremely amazing that the alarm bells are not ringing loud within the government, based on their atrocious record of financial recklessness mismanagement. It is also negligent for any of the Independents who sit on the crossbenches to embrace the merits of these bills when the legislation has been drafted in a way that repeats all the mistakes that this government has made over the past 4½ years. Under this legislation the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will be established with the power to invest in renewable technologies, low emission technologies and energy efficient projects. It will have the power to enter into investment agreements itself or make investments through subsidiaries. And how much funding is to be set aside for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation? Two billion dollars. Yes, $2 billion will be set aside every year for five years. That is a total of $10 billion. While the government spouts that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will have to deliver a return on this $10 billion investment, the reality is quite different. In fact, Treasury have officially confirmed to a parliamentary committee that they expect to lose up 7½ per cent of their capital each year. That equates to $150 million per year or up to $750 million in loans and investments over five years being written off, literally thrown out the window. It is beyond belief that this government-in agreement with the Independents and the Greens-could try to push through legislation where the Treasury believes up to $750 million of taxpayers' money could be literally written off. Imagine what this $750 million in waste and mismanagement could be spent on. It could be invested in infrastructure. It could upgrade the Pacific Highway. It could improve health services. It could be used to on it assist people with disabilities. There is plenty of evidence, both in Australia and abroad, that government funding for large-scale renewable energy projects is no guarantee of success. For and example, in December 2009 the government announced with much fanfare the Solar Flagships Program. In June 2011 the Prime Minister and the Minister for Resources and Energy announced the Moree Solar Farm and Solar Dawn projects, which would receive a total of $770 million in funding for solar flagships. The Moree Solar Farm was to receive $306 million to build a 150 megawatt photovoltaic power plant near Moree. The Solar Dawn consortium received $464 million for a planned 250 megawatt solar thermal gas hybrid power plant near Chinchilla. And what happened to these two projects? Well, it is not a good look. Earlier this year the Moree Solar Farm advised the government that it had failed to secure a power purchase agreement with an electricity retailer-a necessary step for gaining a source of revenue. This forced the energy minister to re-open bidding for the $306 million in government funds. Today the project remains in limbo. The other so-called flagship project-Solar Dawn-although the sun seems to have set before we could have a 'solar dawn'-also struggled to make the numbers add up. The project has received a six-month extension to try to secure industry support and justify the investment. This highlights two key points. Firstly, it is extremely difficult for renewable energy projects to secure a commercial return. Secondly, because of the high degree of risk associated with these projects, the government is placing $10 billion of taxpayers' money at great risk. But this should come as no surprise. It seems that every time the government tries to subsidise clean energy or carbon emission reduction technology the taxpayer gets burnt, and in a big way. Take the collapse of ZeroGen in Queensland, which was meant to deliver clean coal power. After an investment of $106 million from the Queensland government and $46 million from the Australian government, ZeroGen collapsed in a heap and taxpayers' money went up in smoke. It went up in CO2 probably.",139
295,Mr MCCormack,BILLS,A lot of hot air.,141
296,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS,"Yes, a lot of hot air, Member for Riverina. But the failure of renewable energy projects is not unique to Australia. In the United States we have seen the $700 million Solyndra project and the Beacon Power and Enerl projects collapse, despite receiving funding from a US program very similar to the clean energy finance corporation concept we are debating here in this House this evening. Then we saw the collapse of the Solar Trust of America, which had a $2.1 billion guarantee from the US energy department. I am sure the US taxpayers are looking forward to paying that back over the next years-as if they have not got enough debt. These overseas failures plus the collapse of ZeroGen and the experiences with the solar farm and Solar Dawn should have sent, you would think, a message to the Gillard government. But so beholden are they to the Greens, so beholden are they to the Independents, that they are keen to push on and play Russian roulette with $10 billion of taxpayers' money. There are concerns about the impact of this huge amount of money on the existing renewable energy marketplace. Current investment in renewable energy is being driven by a bipartisan commitment to a 20 per cent renewable energy target. It is this target which is driving investment in renewable energy at the moment. Many of these investments have secured finance on a commercial basis with little or no government financial assistance. The fear is that the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the creation of a $10 billion funding slush bucket will distort the market and undermine existing renewable energy projects. Technologies which are not commercially viable without a substantial government handout will all of sudden be competing with projects which are currently receiving investment using existing technologies. So the government will not only be rolling the dice on speculative new renewable energy projects but could in fact be discriminating against the viability of current projects. The end result will be a lose-lose for all involved, including major renewable energy projects. I am also concerned at the way the government have appropriated the $10 billion in funding for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Because of the massive debt that this government have racked up in the past four years, they decided to treat the $10 billion in funding as an 'equity investment' in the government's financial statements. By calling it an 'equity investment' the government have been able to remove the funding from the budget bottom line. Given the government's track record, it is indeed a leap of faith to call these projects an 'equity investment'. In an accounting sense, we know that equity is defined as asset minus liabilities, but we all know that based on past performance these projects are likely to be big on liabilities small on assets. This essentially means they can claim to be delivering a small surplus when really they are spending taxpayers' money like a drunken sailor and that, if you include projects like the NBN and like this one, they will have a huge deficit indeed. What they are doing here mirrors what the government have done with the National Broadband Network. They are providing funding off-budget so that they can distort a bit of a fiddle, they can distort the financial figures and they can make it look like we have a surplus. It is so small it is not even really a clayton's surplus; it is a mirage. Mrs Griggs: A figment of their imagination.",141
297,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS,"A figment of their imagination; an illusion-that is correct. Everyone in the House knows that this legislation is only being debated because of a deal between the Prime Minister, the Greens and the Independents. The $10 billion is nothing more than a pay-off to the Greens for their one vote in the House-$10 billion for one vote; that is a very expensive vote indeed. The fact is that I am surprised that the Independents would ignore the wishes of their electorates, ignore common sense and vote with the government on this farce. It is indeed very regrettable. What is also extremely disappointing is the cold hard reality that this $10 billion in funding will do absolutely nothing for the environment and reducing carbon emissions. As my colleague the member for Flinders has consistently noted, the $10 billion fund will create no new renewable energy. Prior to the creation of the fund the target was 20 per cent. Now that the fund has been created the target is still 20 per cent. There will be no additional renewable energy because of this expenditure. So all that this taxpayers' money will do is sideline existing renewable and technologies, which are currently more expensive technologies, but the renewable energy pie will not grow. Questions over the environmental benefits of such a huge government spend have also been raised by the Centre for Independent Research Studies. Research fellow of the centre Dr Oliver Marc Hartwich has released a report titled A waste of energy: why the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is redundant. He is a very wise man. Dr Hartwich notes in his report: The physical effect of energy subsidies is precisely zero in an environment where the total emissions are pre-determined by a trading scheme. Not a single gram of carbon dioxide is saved by pumping money into renewables. We all know that under the carbon tax the government's own figures forecast that emissions will rise. We all know that while we are introducing the planet's biggest carbon tax some of our biggest trading partners are either walking away from carbon pricing or embarking on a major increase in their use of fossil fuels. It is absolute folly for Australia to be risking $10 billion of government money on a Greens slush fund when there is no evidence that it will cool the planet, change the climate or deliver any meaningful environmental outcome. The only thing we do know is that this government has no mandate to appropriate these funds and the Greens will use this as platform in the lead-up to the next election. What a disgrace it is that the government can use creative accounting to waste so much money and leave such a massive legacy of debt for future generations. The next federal election will be not only a referendum on the carbon tax but also an opportunity for Australians to decide on what they believe should be the priorities for the next government. Australians can decide whether they wish for $10 billion of their hard-earned money to be spent on a speculative pie-in the-sky renewable technology program which is likely to lead to massive capital losses or whether they want to return to sensible economic management. This government should be condemned for introducing this legislation and it should be ashamed for placing so much taxpayers' money at risk. It is not only undemocratic; it uses questionable accounting techniques and it gambles tens of billions of dollars on speculative projects. That is why the coalition opposes this legislation and it is why the Independents should vote against this legislation. That is why they should move away from their support of the government and support good old common sense, which is that you do not waste $10 billion and you do not invest money when you know you are going to lose it. It is about time the government came to its senses and abandoned this crazy plan.",142
298,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," It is a pleasure to follow the member for Cowper and that passionate rendition of why this bill, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, will be such a failure for Australia. He is passionate about it because he understands that $10 billion is an expense that Australia simply cannot afford at the moment. When the government is doing everything it possibly can to produce a mythical $1.5 billion surplus, including the removal of $5 billion out of the Defence budget, it is incredible in the extreme that we are in this House today debating a bill off-budget to appropriate $10 billion to hand out to people on projects that may not be viable. Nothing could underscore that point more than the member for Parramatta scurrying into this chamber before question time in an urgent rush to outline her committee's inquiry into a bill for $10 billion. I think it is very important this House highlights that that committee inquiry for $10 billion of Commonwealth money took just two hours of that committee's time. The member for Moncrieff absolutely demolished this committee inquiry, this so-called sham inquiry, that took two hours to investigate $10 billion of expenditure by the Commonwealth, and he made some excellent points about that. Questions have to be asked about what is going on with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill and the associated bills before us here tonight. It is the case that the government speakers we have heard on this bill were not persuasive in any way, shape or form. Their arguments do not make sense. They do not make economic sense and they do not make environmental sense. When you listen to the government, they say, 'We have got a carbon tax coming in, we have got a carbon price and we have got all these things happening but, all of a sudden, we also need to add money into the renewable sector because it is not viable.' Why then are we introducing a carbon price on electricity if not to make investment in renewable energy more attractive? That is one of the stated purposes for having a carbon tax in the first placewhich you see if you look at all of the gobbledygook in the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I will quote from the explanatory memorandum. Under 'General outline and financial impact' it says: Australia is a late starter in the transformation to clean technology due to its access to low cost fossil fuels. What a terrible thing. It goes on: This transformation will require substantial capital which the private sector alone may not be able to provide. Current global financial conditions, the complex nature of Australia's electricity markets, the cost of renewable energy, and the preference of investing institutions for listed assets inhibit the financing of the clean energy sector. A normal person would want to know what that meant. What that means essentially is this is a hideously expensive form of power that nobody in their right mind would invest in and that the government has to subsidise because nobody will look at this as an option in the real world of the private sector. That is the danger that this government is exposing taxpayers to-$10 billion of exposure riskwithout any concern or regard for a return or any of this so-called commercial filter the government speakers have spoken about. In estimates the Treasury has been very clear that 7.5 per cent of a loss has already been factored in. That is just a lazy $750 million-and there is another billion dollars we could have kept in Defence and kept our soldiers in the field in a stronger way. If this government honestly wants to put to this parliament that the loss rate out of this $10 billion will be 7.5 per cent then I would take that-because there is no doubt, when you read the provisions of this bill, about the lack of scrutiny, the lack of oversight and the lack of commercial know-how or nous into how this money will be administered. The actual proposition itself is that you can go around and hand out to these enterprises that are already identified as not viable or not worthy of financing money from the taxpayer and somehow they will become viable. I think what you understand from all of that is that the Commonwealth does not intend to make a return from this bill. We are actually writing off $10 billion of Commonwealth money today. I am a little old fashioned but $10 billion to me is still a lot of money. I remember when $1 million was a lot of money. It still is today but now we throw around billions like it is going out of fashion. Ten billion dollars, to all those hard working taxpayers in western Sydney, in my electorate, is too much money for us to be giving away for what is essentially a government commitment to a minor party. I want to address that because I think it is important in the context of this legislation to understand why the government would hand out $10 billion off budget to a Clean Energy Finance Corporation when all the evidence from around the world tells us that these government corporations handing out cash, without expectations of return-or even when they try and pretend they are going to get a commercial return-do not work. There are so many good examples around the world. Names that come to mind are SpectraWatt from the US, Evergreen Solar, Solyndra and Beacon Power. They have all had huge losses and were completely unviable in their operations in the US. All of the taxpayers' money was totally wasted. The reason we are debating these bill and this legislation is because the government has made an off-budget commitment to the Greens. We heard earlier today in this chamber, when the member for Melbourne was here, that there is a shortage of government speakers who want to speak on this bill when it is a $10 billion enterprise. I think the evidence here is quite damning. Whenever the government passes a bill of this nature and they have a much vaunted initiative of the Gillard government or the Rudd government, what we see is a procession of Labor speakers saying, 'This will benefit my electorate'; 'This group is going to benefit'; 'The planet is going to be saved'; 'The environment will be better off'; 'All of these companies will be able to make renewable energy so much cheaper and easier for all of us.' But, on this $10 billion expenditure, we have hardly had a government member speak in this chamber. It is their initiative. The shame they feel for this measure is apparent. But there was one member here willing to defend this project, and that was the member for Melbourne. He came here in he and angrily asserted why this was good idea. I think that is a very telling and revealing situation. The member for Melbourne was passionately saying that this massive stateowned corporation that will be splashing around $10 billion of taxpayers' money to green corporations and green entities that are unviable and unprofitable is a worthy thing and a fantastic thing-but you cannot find a government speaker here today to come and do the same. We know why-it is because they know it is a dog. They know that this money will never be recovered by the Commonwealth. Indeed, we are looking down the barrel here, if we do not form a government, of a massive liability to the taxpayer. When you continue through the provisions of this bill, you can see the fundamental flaws of this approach to policy and one reason that we must oppose this firmly as a parliament and as a coalition and one reason that we must always, when these things come up, have a very strong examination of why governments should not be behaving in this fashion. That is because, in my view, when a government appropriates or borrows money and then seeks to turn it into commercial money, it cannot function in the same way as the market or the private sector in assessing the risk accurately and taking the risk, because there is no risk to anybody-any person that is putting up the capital. Who is taking the risk in relation to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation? It is the taxpayer. It is 20 million taxpayers. It is the people out there that earn the money. They cannot make a decision about how this money is to be risked or taken. When you look at the exact provisions here, of course the government does all of the things that it would usually do in relation to setting up a corporation. This corporation is exempt from the Income Tax Assessment Act, for example, so it will not pay any tax. What other corporation could enjoy that? When you look at all of the things that government does using its negation powerthat is, by a negative, saying, 'It won't have to pay tax and it won't have to do anything, but we'll give it $10 billion, and here's hoping that something good will come out of this'-and when you go through the provisions of this bill further, there are lots of specifications about procedure, about functions and about what you would regard as a set of financial parameters. But, of course, there are no real explanations of how this will benefit the environment or the economy. In fact, all through the explanatory memorandum and the provisions, you see that this will make power more expensive. This will actually deliberately make electricity generation more expensive in Australia today-so it becomes a double whammy. You read things like this particular part on page 11 of the section 'General outline and financial impact': The fiscal and underlying cash balance impacts include a prudent recognition that some investments will not be recovered, and interest revenue. The fiscal balance impact also includes the concessional component of loans. This treatment reflects budget accounting standards and is consistent with the treatment of similar investments. You just get the sense from this that what they are doing with this Clean Energy Finance Corporation is totally Orwellian and they know it. That is why they are not here in this chamber to defend it. There is no way that the government can behave as a corporation, and it is not the role of government to behave as a corporation. Government is for governing and doing the things that we ask it to use the right to use force to do, and that is not to behave like a commercial entity or corporation. Every time a government has attempted to behave like a corporation or a commercial entity, it has failed miserably, whether it be administering banks or running other kinds of commercial enterprises. It cannot be subject to the same rules of commercial operation, and indeed it is specifically exempted from the Income Tax Assessment Act and other acts that deal with commercial operations. Instead of creating the settings or understanding that a government is there to create the environment for other commercial sectors and the private sector to flourish, instead of saying, 'Yes, we could actually encourage renewable energy by relieving them from the Income Tax Assessment Act, for example'-which is a random example that they use for their own corporation but is not good enough for other corporations-'or relieving them from other provisions so as to allow them to be able to compete and do their business more effectively,' the government say, 'No, we're going to borrow or appropriate $10 billion of taxpayers' money and give it to people that are already assessed as not viable by the banks and other investors.' This is a highly, highly risky proposition-one that gives me grave concern. When you look around what all of the members of this place have had to say-I listened carefully to many of those in the debate-even the member for Longman, at the tender age of 22, understands that the government cannot operate this way. He remembers and has learnt that government cannot do this, and every time it has attempted to do this it ends in misery. I guess this is a pitch from me to every Labor member of this place. We understand that you had to offer the Greens something to stay in government. We understand this was a $10 billion offer to the member for Melbourne and the Greens to keep your shabby government in power. But think about what will happen to this $10 billion of taxpayers' money down the track. Think about all of those people that you come in here and talk about every day. You say, 'We're handing money to families and other people. They need it. They're under pressure. Electricity prices are rising.' Think about what will happen to all of those people who have to pay off this debt for years and years to come-because there is no doubt that debt is going to be the only outcome of this bill. When you look at some of the arguments that have come forward from the very few and Labor members that have come into this place to speak, they say, 'Well, Britain is doing this. We should go ahead and do it. Britain is the model for this.' You look at their claim that the US is doing this. As I raised before, there are very many examples of failure in the renewable energy sector, including solar-the member for Cowper just outlined some-that explain exactly why it is an extremely risky proposition for us to be doing this as a government and with taxpayers' money. The argument that this is somehow promoting clean energy over dirty energy is a complete and utter misnomer, demolished by the member for Dawson, who explained about the cost in materials, carbon emissions and time that comes with building these renewable energy projects. It is completely Orwellian to describe this as clean and that as dirty. We know that all human activity produces a change to the environment, and all human activity of production, whether it be renewable or fossil fuel based energy generation, produces emissions. We know that these particular wind turbines and other measures, which are often talked about in this House, are complete models of inefficiency in that regard. But there is not any suggestion or any real contention from the government that this will produce an environmental benefit. So, at the end of the day, we are going to be expending $10 billion of hard-earned production and taxpayers' money in a quest for clean energy that is really not going to produce any environmental benefit at the end of all of that. So, again, why are we doing it? We know why we are doing it, but there comes a time in parliamentary systems and in the parliamentary world when you need to take a stand on a government putting $10 billion off the budget, basically to keep itself in office, to hand out to projects that are completely unviable, without any real thought for recovering the money. That really ought not to be allowed in our democratic system. We should have very tight rules and requirements, as we do on the budget, and scrutiny of government and parliamentary processes that prevent that from occurring. The government say that they are venturing into the commercial world and are going to apply a commercial filter to this $10 billion, without paying any tax and without doing the things that they are supposed to be doingMr Ewen Jones: Payroll tax.",143
299,Mr HAWKE,BILLS,"and without any of the different things, as is being pointed out to me here by the member for Herbert. I just believe this should not be allowed in this parliament. When you look at what the government have argued and the lack of willingness to come in here and put their case, I think we all know what is going on. This is actually a very serious issue. I know that with $37 billion NBNs and other things going around this is only in the top 10 of Labor waste expenditure disasters, but $10 billion is $10 billion, and I am going to stand here on behalf of my constituents and the people of Australia and definitely say no to this government going into any sort of commercial venture.",147
300,Mr TEHAN,BILLS," I rise to support the previous speaker. This $10 billion bill, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, is one of the grossest wastes of off-budget taxpayers' money that you could ever see. This is the sort of bill where those opposite, after they have voted for it, will need to go and have a shower, because they know that this bill smells. They know that this bill is dirty. They know that this bill is basically a bribe. It is our great negotiator, the Prime Minister's, way of making sure that by any means she continues to keep that faint grip she has on office. But it really goes to the heart of what is wrong with this government. It is all about staying in power and it is not about the long-term interests of the country. The previous speaker mentioned that the only person who has really come into this place and, with glee, welcomed this bill is the member for Melbourne. We have not seen those opposite from the Labor Party able in all good conscience to bring themselves to come in here and support this bill wholeheartedly-and there is very good reason for that. It is a shabby, shabby piece of legislation. The speed with which it is being rushed through the House demonstrates the embarrassment with which this government holds this piece of legislation. I was called last Friday to see whether I was able to be a temporary member of the House Standing Committee on Economics to examine this bill, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012. When I asked why the haste, they said, 'There's two hours for the House economics committee set aside on Monday to examine this bill and the committee must report by Wednesday.' We have had to rush the report out today so that the bill could be voted on. Let us just consider that: there were two hours for the economics committee to review this piece of legislation. We spent the first hour, roughly, dealing with $5 billion in the bill and the second hour looking at the other $5 billion in the bill. It is sort of funny-and you have to step outside this place occasionally because $10 billion can sort of start rolling off the tongue a little-but then you look at the way this government spends money. That $10 billion will be added to our net debt position, which will be $144 billion by the end of the year. Today we saw the government shut down debate on us trying to bring attention in this place to the fact that the government wants to increase its credit card borrowing from $250 billion to $300 billion. While all this is going on, here we are, having a bill rushed through which will, off budget, commit the Australian taxpayer to $10 billion worth of government expenditure. It is worth looking at the mechanism to delivering this $10 billion. The government has set up an investment arm to do this with, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. During the hearing that we had on Monday, I asked the Treasury officials whether they remembered an organisation in Victoria called the VEDC, which was an investment arm of the Victorian government that helped send the then Cain-Kirner government broke. Sadly, the Treasury officials could not bring it to mind. They could not come to terms with the fact that there have been previous examples of such investment arms being set up which have lost taxpayers-in this case, Victorian taxpayers-large amounts of money. I remember the VEDC because one of the investment projects that they had was for Lake Eildon. They invested in a catamaran houseboat which was going to do wonders for tourism in the region. That halfbuilt catamaran sat on the shores of Lake Eildon for about five years as a constant reminder of what happens when government starts to take the crazy decision that it will pick industry winners, which is exactly what this bill does. I suppose if we are to say anything good about this bill it is that there is a tiny bit of honesty in it. It recognises that 7½ per cent, to start with, of the money invested will be lost. If there is any honesty in this bill at all, it is that the government has recognised that this Greens inspired piece of legislation will automatically lose 7½ per cent of the $10 billion investment. It might sound crazy, but at least there is a shred of honesty in it. Mrs Griggs: It's unusual!",147
301,Mr TEHAN,BILLS,"It is very unusual. It is interesting to ask, once you delve into these things, how they came about this figure of 7½ per cent. This was a question that was asked during the economics committee hearing. It was asked, 'There must have been some potential investment disasters that government has already been involved in which have made you come up with this figure. What is the basis of your decision that there will automatically be a 7½ per cent loss? Surely, there must be a Solar Flagships program or something else that has led to the 7½ per cent figure.' But they could not come up with anything. So it seems that they have plucked this figure out of thin air, which should be extremely worrying for the Australian taxpayer. They know it is going to make a loss. An opposition member: 750 million bucks!",148
302,Mr TEHAN,BILLS,"Yes, $750 million straight up, it is pointed out to me. And yet, when they were asked how they came to this figure, they did not know. There was no evidence based approach to coming up with this figure for the loss. One might think that this would worry this government. I got the feeling it did embarrass the Treasury officials who were there trying desperately to give some sort of credence to what was going on. You would think that the government would be embarrassed by this, but I must admit that those members of the government who sat on the House economics committee blindly sat there, shrugged their shoulders and went, 'Well, if $750 million is the price we have to pay, that's what we have to pay.' It is a real shame. Not only that, there was a follow-up question to this which asked, 'Given that there is no substance to this 7½ per cent figure, what happens if it loses more money than that?' Everyone just shrugged their shoulders. No-one knew. As a matter of fact, it seems to be wholly reliant on the board to make sure it does not. The information on how the board and its staff is going to be governed was very interesting as well. The board's salaries are going to be along the lines of those paid to members of the Future Fund board-we are talking of a chair on maybe a $2 million salary. Who will decide the salary of the staff? Will it be the Remuneration Tribunal? No. The board is going to decide what the staff salaries will be. An opposition member: Like the NBN.",148
303,Mr TEHAN,BILLS,"Yes. In this situation is the board really going to care what rigour is put into this? I do not think so. Seven and a half per cent, 9½ per cent, 15 per cent-if those are the losses, I think the board is just to be sitting there saying, 'Oh well, it's all right-we're not losing from this.' It is the taxpayer who is ultimately losing. This committee hearing was a real eyeopener and it was even more of an eyeopener when the representatives from the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency were asked: 'But isn't the 20 per cent of renewable energy required by 2020 already delivering investment into renewable energy anyway? Isn't this bipartisan commitment actually delivering this? Do we need the additional $10 billion if our Renewable Energy Target, and the renewable energy credits which are delivering that target, are already doing this job?' There was no answer to that-no answer to the effect that this $10 billion is not needed because we already have a bipartisan mechanism to deliver this anyway. What we have is $10 billion being spent as a bribe to keep the Greens happy. I would have thought there were better ways to keep the Greens happy than giving them $10 billion, but it seems that is what this government is prepared to do to cling to power. It is an unnecessary $10 billion because, as we heard in the evidence, the Renewable Energy Target-20 per cent of our energy from renewable sources by 2020-is going to deliver this anyway. That is very important because it also means that those companies which have already invested privately in renewable energy technology-in wind, solar and wave-will now see their competitors come in, using this $10 billion fund as a leg-up, and gain a commercial advantage over those players who are already in the marketplace. I must ask the government, how can this be fair? How can it be fair that existing players in the renewable energy space will now face competition from late entrants who going can use this $10 billion fund? What the government is doing is saying to those companies who have made investment decisions based on private enterprise with a little bit of assistance under the Renewable Energy Target: 'We don't care about those investment decisions you have made. We are going to support new entrants into the market which could potentially blow the investment decisions you have taken out of the water.' This bill hammers home another example of sovereign risk and shows that this government does not care. We see time after time that the government does not understand this. I am in my first term in this place",149
304,Mr Hockey,BILLS,And you're doing a great job!,150
305,Mr TEHAN,BILLS,"Thank you, Member for North Sydney. I have seen some incredibly interesting things in my time-it has only been a brief 18 or 19 months-but I must say sitting in that House economics committee for two hours on Monday was the most disturbing thing I have seen yet. It is alarming that this government is prepared to give away $10 billion, off-budget, of taxpayers' money without any consideration of the opportunities on which it could be spent. I hope all the members opposite know, as they vote for this piece of legislation, that it is the silver offered to the Greens to make sure they continue to support this government. I hope they go and have a long hot bath or a shower because they will need to; this bill smells. It smells to the Australian taxpayer and it smells of what it is aboutkeeping this Prime Minister in power.",150
306,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," I join with my colleagues in speaking on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation package of bills. These, of course, are part of the government's carbon tax package. They are about extending the reach of the carbon tax by creating a $10 billion fund to undertake investment in renewable energy technologies and energy-efficiency projects. The coalition has pledged, in opposition, to oppose the carbon tax and we will repeal it if we are elected into government. This also applies to this package of four bills. The carbon tax itself takes Australia out on a limb and will create additional financial stress for families and do nothing to reduce carbon emissions. It is bad policy. The CEFC is yet another example of poor policy, which demonstrates the inability of the government to be trusted to spend taxpayers' money wisely. To oppose this legislation is not to oppose the science of climate change. That is the classic spin that the government applies to everything. Based on the evidence available I believe our climate is changing, and I believe on the evidence available that human behaviour does contribute to climate change. I believe on the evidence available that reducing carbon dioxide emissions will slow down the pace at which the climate is changing. I have held these views consistently for more than 10 years. The coalition is committed to the same carbon reduction goals as the government. We are committed to reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by five per cent below 2000 levels by the end of 2020. To be clear: that is a bipartisan commitment. Where we differ from the government is the mechanism used to achieve these goals. We do not believe this is solved by increasing taxes and increasing government debt. We certainly do not believe that a $10 billion slush fund is the solution to economic and environmental sustainability. It is economically irresponsible, fiscally irresponsible and environmentally suspect. This set of bills empowers the government's CEFC with a very broad mandate to invest in risky renewable energy projects. Other than the requirement that at least half the funds be invested in renewable energy technologies by July 2018 and solely or mainly Australia based, the CEFC is given a very wide remit to spend taxpayers' money. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has assured Australians that the CEFC is a commercial venture and that the administration 'will apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions'. However, this is entirely contradicted by the explanatory memorandum for the bill, which admits that this filter 'will not be as stringent as the private sector equivalent ' and 'may accept a lower financial return'. The CEFC will be permitted to offer loans at concessional rates. Even worse, concessions can take the form of 'availability, tenor' or, it goes on to say, 'by absorbing additional risk'. Yesterday in the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics into this bill it was revealed that the government has already factored in a 7½ per cent loss on capital in unsuccessful projects each year, with Treasury officials describing that 7½ per cent estimate as 'conservative'. Yet somehow these investments are still expected to generate a return close to the government bond rate of four per cent-after all, this is being funded by borrowed money. The reality is that these investments will be highly risky, highly speculative and may not live up to the standards that would normally apply for commercial financing. If these investments were commercially viable, an organisation's first port of call would be a bank or private sector investor, not the CEFC. Even the government admits that 'some investments will not be recovered'. In fact, given the speculative nature of the renewable energy market, it is conceivable that no investments will be recovered. It is uncertain if these new technologies will ever produce a commercial return or a product that will help to create a renewable energy source. Given the risks posed by these investments and the fact that commercial markets would not provide finance to many of the speculative investments, it is hard to believe that such projects could conceivably be termed 'commercial investments'. If these projects were commercial investments, they would not require subsidised support from the government. As such, the government should call the CEFC exactly what it is: a giant, $10 billion slush fund. The Australian people deserve to know exactly how their taxes are spent. And when it comes to examining the accounting treatment of this giant government slush fund, you would expect that this expense would show up in the government's underlying cash position. But not under Labor. Despite the highly risky nature of the investments undertaken by the entity, the CEFC is blessed with having been given the green light to be accounted for in the same way as that other great commercial entity, the National Broadband Network: they are being treated off-budget. The coalition has long been concerned about the accounting treatment of the CEFC and, indeed, the NBN; and, if there is a change of government, I can promise everyone that I will get to the bottom of exactly why they have been treated in such a way and who advised it. Back in October 2011, along with the shadow minister for finance, I wrote on behalf of the coalition to the Australian Statistician and the Auditor-General, questioning how the $10 billion CEFC would be accounted for and whether they had made any recommendations as to the accounting treatment of the $10 billion fund. The coalition always suspected that the government was trying to push the majority of the CEFC off-budget. Nine months later, these concerns are realised. In reality we should have just looked at the government's record of treating politically sensitive material like the $50 billion NBN off-budget to justify our concerns. The government is trying to hide the full cost of the CEFC because responsible economic management is something quite foreign to this government. Treating this program as off-budget means that the vast majority of the spending will not hit the budget bottom line. Only two items will hit the underlying cash balance. The establishment and operating cost of $57 million over three years will be expensed, as will what can only be described as a small provision to recognise that some investments will not be recovered. That is a 7½ per cent loss on capital on unsuccessful projects. Operating costs are nearly $20 million a year. Bear in mind that the Inspector-General of Taxation has an estimated cost of $2.634 million for 10 employees to cover the entire taxation system as an inspector-general, yet this is going to cost around $20 million a year to run. The government acknowledges that some loans will be granted to renewable energy projects at concessional rates. Senate estimates this morning confirmed that this would be the difference between the expected market return of 14 per cent and the government borrowing rate of an average of 5.3 per cent. The impact of this concessional component, along with the operating expenses and the 7½ per cent provision for losses on capital for unsuccessful projects, means that the fiscal balance will be hit an additional $1.3 billion over the forward estimates. Only this government would provide money for investments that the private sector would not touch with a barge pole and then turn around and call them 'commercial'. What an absolute, damned affront it is to call them 'commercial' investments! Only this government would budget for potential investment losses, charge concessional rates of interest and the investments 'commercial', and then turn around and deem them 'equity investments' in order to avoid having the expenses hit the budget's bottom line. It smacks of Tricontinental and some of the other things I saw from Labor in the eighties, such as Beneficial Finance and all of their partners. What is worse, this expenditure is being made at a time when a budget surplus is looking less likely by the day and when the debt burden continues to grow. All in, taxpayers will be borrowing more than $10 billion in headline investment to fund the CEFC, which will only serve to add to the legacy of this government's debt. We do not have the capacity to repay this debt by asset sales-there is no Telstra, there is no Qantas and there is no Commonwealth Bank to sell in order to address the debt burden. These entities, the CEFC and the NBN, are not going to be worth crackers, because they are barely commercial. On the basis of any common understanding of the meaning of the word 'commercial', they would be considered uncommercial. This will be the legacy of Labor, and it will hang around their necks for as long as I am in this place. Apart from pointing out the lack of credibility on the accounting treatment of the CEFC, it is important to point out that this legislation allows for the use of derivatives in order to, amongst other things, 'indirectly achieve exposure to financial assets'. After all the rhetoric of the Labor Party and its war with on capitalism as initiated by the previous Prime Minister's arguments about the impact of derivatives trading during the course of the global financial crisis, they are now so opposed to derivatives trading that they are setting up a $10 billion fund that can engage in derivatives trading! Of course the coalition has major concerns about the application of this legislation and about the risks to which such financial products could call expose the government and taxpayers. Will the investments be effective? There are serious concerns. The CEFC may have distorting impacts on the market-and of course it will. When someone is in there with subsidised loans, of course it is going to have an impact. It is widely commented by renewable energy participants that the introduction of the government's CEFC will have an adverse impact on existing renewable energy projects. Of course it will, because this 800-pound gorilla, subsidised by taxpayers to make losses, is coming into the marketplace. Of course it will undermine any commercial ventures that are out thereand that, of course, will lower the tide for everyone. Also, it is widely accepted that the newcomers to the sector will be affected if they are not to get access to the fund. You are lucky if you are hand-picked by the CEFC, because you will have the benefit of a direct subsidy. But what happens if you cannot get it? What happens if you do not like the terms? There is that 800-pound gorilla in the marketplace which is going to undermine the market itself, and when the failure occurs taxpayers will pick up the tab because otherwise they will lose their money or equity investments. The CEFC is not charged with investing in the lowest cost technologies to produce the cheapest emissions reductions; its remit is to fund the technologies which the market considers to be unproven or too speculative or too risky for commercial financing. Although the CEFC will be established as an entity separate from the government, it is clear that its functions will carry out government policy. Its functions seem analogous to and to overlap with other government programs such as the Clean Technology Innovation Program, the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund and the Emerging Renewables Program. All these programs appear to be similar in nature to and to fit within the broad investment mandate of the CEFC, yet they are fully accounted for in the budget and nowhere near the sheer scale of the $10 billion energy slush fund. The government has a terrible record with energy projects. Its $700 million Solar Flagships program in Moree and the Solar Dawn projects in Queensland struggled to gain industry support. Along with the Bligh government, this government presided over more than $100 million in losses from the ZeroGen project despite clear warnings from the opposition and a number of industry experts. In fact, in response to the member for Groom's warning that ZeroGen would fail, the Queensland Premier said that he was 'on drugs'. Whatever drugs they may have been-and I can assure you that he was not on drugs; there was absolute clarity in his observation-he was proven right. Programs of this nature have similarly experienced massive failure and controversy in the United States. The failure of the $700 million Cylindra project as well the failures of as Beacon Power and Enel occurred under similar programs. There is also the recent collapse of Solar Trust of America, which had a $2.1 billion loan guarantee from the US government. Finally, I put on record my concerns about the comments made by Jillian Broadbent from the CEFC. Ms Broadbent wrote to me on Wednesday, 11 April at 11.44 am asking to meet with me in Canberra at a time of her suggestion, 17 April. Andrew Robb responded on behalf the coalition on 16 April. At that time. I was overseas meeting with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and officials in Europe, and, when we did not meet the timetable set by Ms Broadbent, she went on ABC radio on 17 April saying that the coalition, 'haven't been very interested in speaking to me, despite my preparedness to do so', She did this even though, as I understand it, she had already met with Malcolm Turnbull, she had already received a response from Mr Robb, she had met Mr Hunt and I was unavailable at that moment. If that is the way they are going to play the game, then there is all the more reason for us to get rid of this bad idea. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (18:29): It is always a pleasure to follow the member for North Sydney. His contribution basically wrapped it all up. But I rise today to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Bill 2012 and the suite of bills. These bills seek to establish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation-the CEFCgiving this corporation the ability to invest in financial assets to develop Australian based renewable energy technologies, lowemission technologies and energy efficient projects, and the power to enter into investment agreements and to make investments through subsidiaries. It has a duty to make sure that half of the funds invested by 1 July 2018 are invested in renewable energy technologies. These bills will also create the Clean Energy Finance Corporation special account, which will give $10 billion over five years to the CEFC. It is this government's intention that the CEFC will be self-sustaining once it has reached maturity and any returns to the fund would then be reinvested! We laughed and we laughed and we laughed! In reality this bill simply creates a $10 billion slush fund used to bribe the Greens over to the government side. It was the 25 pieces of silver they had to pay. In stark contrast to the idea of a selfsustaining fund the bill forecasts a financial loss as a result of operating costs and failed investments. Treasury officials will tell you that the loss is around 7½ per cent. What they do not tell you is that that loss of 7½ cent is $750 million, which they are prepared to walk away from on day one. Add to that the government's borrowing rate of 5.3 per cent on $10 billion and that is $530 million a year. So, straight up, at the beginning of the year, you drop one billion dollars every year. So away you go! The coalition has long supported the renewable energy industry and the pursuit of making renewable energy an affordable and reliable source of power. The renewable energy target of 20 per cent has bipartisan support in this House, but this bill runs the serious risk of distorting the renewable energy market and spending $10 billion of borrowed money to not produce any results. We already have our 20 per cent target for renewable energy by 2020. This target is driving investment in renewable energy. Regardless of how much this government spends on a renewable energy slush fund the target will still be 20 per cent. So we will still end up with 20 per cent renewable energy. Any renewable energy investment from this fund will simply replace other private sector investment in renewables. That means $10 billion will be spent on achieving nothing. I hate to harp on the point, but this government has not had the greatest track record in running anything so far, let alone a $10 billion slush fund. Mind you, no-one gives money away like this government, with no hope of a productive return. This could be the hook on which this government hangs its hat: 'We are the best at giving money away with no consequences. We are No. 1!' Now, that will cause pride when you guys are sitting on the verandas under your blankets in the old pollie home! These bills also seek to provide for the CEFC to hand-pick investments based on comprehensive criteria. The result is that, per contrary to the thinly veiled appearance of independence, the minister and this government has a high degree of control over who does and who does not get money from this fund. Couple that with no economic or financial basis for decision making, what could go wrong? There is a serious concern that these bills will distort the marketplace for renewable energy. We already have many companies around the country successfully running businesses in the renewable energy sector. They have found their market, created a good business plan, and are turning a profit. Now they have to compete with technologies and ventures that should be less competitive but will be given a hand-up by a selection panel. Instead of the market investing in efficient technology and well-structured businesses, the government will be investing in businesses that could not convince anyone else to spend the money on them. If you force cash into any market you will distort that market. In effect, you will place greater pressure on the existing businesses by doing this. I just do not see why this government cannot see that. You are running a real risk of shutting down an industry. The CEFC has not been required to consider low-cost technology when handpicking projects. Not only is this money giving an unfair leg-up to the fortunate few, it will be supporting the projects that the market has deemed too risky to finance itself. Even the explanatory memorandum acknowledges, in identifying the fiscal impact for this bill, that some investments will not be recovered. That is code for taxpayer loss on top of borrowed money. This is destined to be yet another expensive failure where the end result will be that the taxpayer will cop it in the neck to the tune of $10 billion and those businesses which have forged a market and products with hard work, will have to deal with the stink and taint this set of bills will no doubt leave behind. You really are running the risk of destroying an industry. Time after time we have seen that it does not work when government's try and handpick renewable energy projects. We had the Solar Flagships program in Moree and the Queensland Solar Dawn project that the member for North Sydney was speaking about earlier. I remember reading about it in the paper and seeing Peter Beattie on TV telling the member for Groom that he was on drugs if he thought this would fail. Yet, there we were, a little way down the line. Peter Beattie, to this stage, has not rung the member for Groom and apologised. The Queensland Solar Dawn project, struggles to gain industry support despite $700 million from the government. Of course, I am talking about ZeroGen there. When will we stop pretending that we can force the market? These bills are yet another Labor commitment funded by debt-$10 billion, and then we start to pay the interest. We have seen this Treasurer boasting about a budget that contains a surplus. Meanwhile they are using accounting systems to push through lavish and reckless projects without having to put them on the budget and present them to the Australian people. I have an idea. Why don't we take the defence spend off budget? That way you would have a $25 billion surplus! It would be easy! We could just take it all off budget and increase the debt. We could raise the debt level to $3 trillion and be done with it; run it all off budget. We could bring forward money out of the debt level to create that surplus so that everyone can feel warm and fuzzy. But it does not produce the right picture. You guys-this government-are leaving it up to the next generation to pay for a policy that is designed to fail, knowing full well that it will be spent on projects that nobody in the private sector trusted and on many that are bound to fail. Just like the NBN, this is a huge expense that this government do not want to be held accountable for at budget time. There are huge salaries at the NBN, and in this organisation, being paid out to people and we have no control over who they are. If this government genuinely had a commitment to renewable energy it had many chances to get on board, even in North Queensland. The CopperString project was aimed at bringing Mount Isa onto the National Grid. They were seeking $300 million in federal government funds to build the line to Mount Isa. If this was done, the impact on renewable energy would be huge. The North West Queensland Mineral Province is also home to one of the world's most exciting renewable energy corridors, with projects such as the Kennedy Wind Farm, with 700 turbines producing electricity at a projected $48 per kilowatt hour. The Kaiwedera Solar Project is another project which was to produce quality renewable energy. One thing you have to remember is that, as the member for Dawson so succinctly put it, renewable energy is not clean-you still must invest in all sorts of stuff to create the equipment that makes it. A huge amount of pollution goes into making the mirrors, the turbines and the fans, and transporting them. As the member for Mitchell said, every human endeavour affects the environment. The fact that the Kaiwedera Solar Project, which currently operate along the corridor and burn diesel for power generation, should have had this government and the Greens running to their aid. I do not blame Mount Isa and Xstrata for going on their own and building their own new power station. The messages they were receiving from both the federal and the state government were too weak and mixed for them to wait any longer. In short, the government talks a good game but it never, ever delivers. It could it be that they could not commit to infrastructure in North Queensland if it was to appear on budget. Maybe it was just not sexy enough for the Greens. Maybe it was not in the right part of the world. Maybe if it was in innercity Melbourne and it was about turning mung beans into cafe lattes, we would be throwing some money at it. Why doesn't this government support the MBD algae project more? Here we have a science based, high-skill project ready for commercial application which is being starved of funds by this government. It will take pollution out of any system to which it is applied and turn it into a protein source, a biodiesel, and sequester carbon. Tests at Tarong Power Station in the South Burnett have been very positive, with massive reductions in pollution-up to 40 per cent. If we integrated the MBD algae project into the design of a coal or gas fired power station, we would have cheap baseload power with zero emissions. Why isn't this government all over this project like it was 102 degrees in the shade and they were prickly heat? It beggars belief. Again, are they only interested in projects where the Greens decide what we will do? Are they only against it because it would have to be on budget? I am not a huge believer in conspiracy theories, but the more I watch this Labor-Greens government, the more I am convinced that there is another completely separate agenda here. This legislation is not about supporting renewable energy; it is about supporting the Greens. The fact that they can on one hand claim a budget surplus and then on the other try and slip through a $10 billion off-budget slush fund, and that they can claim to be in favour of renewable energy and then sit back as the CopperString project stalls, shows the hypocrisy of this government. We all want to see a strong renewable energy future; that is what we have the renewable energy target for. But splashing around $10 billion on projects that the market has rejected is an insult to taxpayers. This legislation is about a select group of latte-drinking, Vespa-riding, black-skivvy-wearing people picking winners at our expense. It is easy to punt big if you do not have to cop the losses. I suggest we send this mob to Randwick on the weekend with their own money and see how they go. Let's see how good they are on the punt-because that is what they are doing. But they should do it with their own money. This legislation is irresponsible, it is destined to fail and I do not support it. What this country needs is a government which will, in the first instance, do no harm. Secondly, we need a government that will get out of the way of the private sector and keep their hands out of the pockets of the people who are making a difference. We need a government which offers hope, reward, and opportunity for all, not just a select few. Think of the interest alone on thing, the money that you are prepared to lose on this, that you are prepared to throw away. In the meantime you have 21-year-old soldiers stationed in Darwin that you are pulling a return airfare off once a year. The government shows its hypocrisy on these issues. The fact that you are prepared to make the average person pay and you are prepared to let the Greens run this show is horrendous. This is my first term, as it is first term of the member for Wannon, who spoke before. We all come in here thinking of Mr Smith Goes to Washington, thinking we can change the course of the debate. But when nobody is listening on the other side, when you are in the back room and you have to cut the deal, you will do whatever it takes. That is what is wrong with this place and that is what is wrong with this government. They are not prepared to make the hard decisions. They are not prepared to stop these people from doing this. This is $10 billion. I scratched $1,000 once and thought all my luck had come at once-I never won another single cent. This is bad legislation. It should be shown up for what it is. I will fight against it all the through. When we are in government, we will repeal the carbon tax fully, we will get rid of this slush fund and everything that goes with it, and we will find out why the advice was what it was.",150
307,Mr CHESTER,BILLS," I have great pleasure in following the member for Herbert and his impassioned speech. Speakers on this side have covered a lot of territory here this evening and expressed a great deal of reservation about this legislation, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, and with very good reason. In joining this debate I want to reflect on the complete lack of trust which exists between this Prime Minister, this this government and the Australian people. There is a long list of reasons-and we have already heard many of them tonight-why the coalition are not supporting this legislation, but the most compelling one of all is the issue of trust. We simply do not trust this government to be able to deliver value for money under its Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Quite simply, I could not trust this Treasurer with 10 bucks, and I the certainly will not trust him with $10 billion of taxpayers' money. This does feel like deja vu all over again. As the member for Cowper remarked earlier this evening, this legislation has all the hallmarks of Labor's other financial disasters. People listening to the broadcast of this debate at home or in their cars might be thinking: how did we get to this judgment? Are we being a little bit too harsh on the Labor Party? I just say to people listening to this tonight: let's start with the Rudd and Gillard government's track record in delivering major projects and their financial mismanagement. I want to begin with prior convictions, if you like, so I will start with the home insulation debacle. That scheme way saw the tragic loss of four young people killed in the rush to implement the scheme. We had homes burnt to the ground and others severely damaged by fire. We had a legitimate industry destroyed as confidence was eroded amongst the Australian public in the whole home insulation industry and we had jobs lost. That was one of the greatest debacles in Australian political history, the hands of this government, shovelling money out the door in a so-called quest for clean energy. Then we had the Green Loans Program, which is one that a lot of people have forgotten about, and the training of assessors. I am testing my memory but I think the government intended to train about 1,500 assessors. But someone forgot to tell training organisations, so 10,000 Green Loans home assessors were trained. That would not be so bad, I suppose, if it did not come at any cost to the people involved, but people actually lost their hard-earned money to undertake that training. Those poor people put up amounts of $2,000 to $3,000 each to become assessors in the false hope that there was a job at the end of it. This government completely mismanaged the program so, unfortunately, these people were training for jobs that never existed. Again, it was a complete financial disaster, but at least in this case, as far as I am aware, no-one died in the government's mismanagement of that program. But the grand-daddy of them all is undoubtedly the government's Building the Education Revolution. This program, which amounted to about $16 billion, as I recall, was plagued with problems from the absolute start. In fact, it has got to the stage now throughout regional Australia that BER stands for 'builders early retirement'. Builders were in a position where they could inflate their prices to suit the market, they could move from the cities into regional areas, do a job and not necessarily take much care because they were never coming back to that town in their life, and the government picked up the tab. I think this program is the worse example of government mismanagement that I have ever been made aware of. Not only did it involve $16 billion, but the greatest concern of all was that the all at government refused to listen to local communities. This program was not based on need, on whether the school community needed an upgrade. It was the government's version of that old sideshow alley call 'Every child wins a prize'. In this case every school got a building, regardless of whether they needed it or whether they needed the template design, because that was what they copped. The only time there was value for money out the program was when the independent schools had control of some of the money. I will just reflect on comments made by the former head of Treasury, Dr Ken Henry, who told the ABC last week that value for money was only a second or third order concern, on that particular program, in terms of the government's stimulus package. I think that sums up this government: value for money was only a second or third order concern. But for the people who were having their hard-earned tax dollars spent in this manner, I can tell you now that value for money is the No. 1 priority they expect from us in this place. Value for money is what they want to see at every opportunity. The member for Cowper went through a long list of renewable energy failures in his speech tonight, and I will not go through them again, but he made the point that this government has not learnt from its own bitter experiences, let alone experiences throughout the world when it comes to clean energy programs. It is simply going out to the marketplace and saying to the Australian people: 'Just trust us, we will deliver.' Unfortunately, there is a huge deficit of trust in the Australian community when it comes to this government, and it starts at the Prime Minister's office. It starts with her now infamous line when she told the Australian people: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Every bit of legislation to do with the clean energy future, including the legislation we are discussing tonight, comes back to that line from the Prime Minister: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' I have said before and I repeat now that the Prime Minister has been partly true to that line because there is no carbon tax under the government she leads. There is a carbon tax under the government that Bob Brown leads and now Christine Milne leads. It is the grubby deal with the Greens which has forced this government into this position. I do not believe members opposite are actually being true to themselves in this regard. I do not think they believe a lot of the information they are forced to propagate throughout the community. I believe it is just because they have done a deal with the Greens that they are forced into this position, because I do not believe that members of the Labor Party could be so stupid. This Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a pay-off to the Greens, at vast expense to Australian taxpayers. In addition to the $10 billion, there is another little project we are not hearing much about at the moment, so it is good to see the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is in the chamber. This project is called Contract for Closure-and at the mere mention of this policy the minister has left the chamber. I think this Contract for Closure links very nicely into the debate tonight because of this government's obsession with pandering to the Greens. I am not sure many Australians understand what this Contract for Closure policy is all about. What the government has promised to do is to retire 2,000 megawatts of coal fired power generation in Australia. Basically, the companies are going to be bought out by the government-by taxpayers, who are going to cough up all the money once again-so the companies have been invited to express their interest in being part of Contract for Closure. What we have seen, though, since this was announced and the expressions of interest closed is that the government has gone strangely quiet on this process because, as I understand it, the negotiations are going absolutely nowhere. You always know when the Labor Party is in a bit of strife because the dorothy dixers put up in question time by the Labor Party backbench just stop. There has not been a mention of Contract for Closure, as far as I can recall, in months, because it is a dud policy. The Minister for Resources and Energy, who is not here tonight, knows it. He can barely even say the name of the policy, he hates it so much. He knows it is a disgrace. The minister for energy is the only one I have seen, actually, who has had a little bit of credibility. He has given himself a bit of wriggle room. He has backed away from the policy a bit, because he is on the record as saying there is actually no guarantee that it will go ahead if they cannot negotiate a price that suits the government. So the minister for energy has given himself a bit of wriggle room. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency joins me again. Contract or Closure we are talking about, Minister, just in case you had not heard the words for awhile.",157
308,Mr Combet,BILLS,I have heard of it.,159
309,Mr CHESTER,BILLS,"I understand. The minister has heard of it. But no-one is talking about it, Minister-because it is a dud.",159
310,Mr Combet,BILLS,It is commercial-inconfidence.,159
311,Mr CHESTER,BILLS,"Oh, because it is commercial-in-confidence! The DEPUTY SPEAKER Rishworth): Order! I will make sure the speaker continues to make his remarks through the chair.",159
312,Mr CHESTER,BILLS,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker Rishworth, I accept your admonition. The Minister for Resources and Energy has backed away from it and he is not talking about it, saying unless we negotiate a deal that suits the government. But I think that really is the minister's code for, 'Oops, we've stuffed up. We didn't realise how much this would cost to pay out the owners of the power stations. We'd really like to go quiet on this one. We would like to just sneak out of this one and let no-one really notice that we ever talked about Contract for Closure.' The mere threat of Contract for Closure has been a social and economic disaster for a region like mine. I know the minister at the table understands coal communities, but this policy of Contract for Closure has destroyed confidence in my region already, at a time when the economy is already soft. The government likes to blame that softness on other factors-and these are genuine factors: the high dollar, the European financial crisis, and high transport and wage costs. All of those are having an impact on heavy industry and on the manufacturing sector. But the question I continually put to members opposite-and I have yet to receive a decent answer to-is: Why are you making it harder? Why are you making it harder for Australian manufacturers? Why would any Australian government at a time like this do anything, anything at all, that would make it harder for Australians to compete on world markets? And I get silence like I have yet again tonight. Silence once again. Not one member opposite has got any explanation at all for why you would introduce a carbon tax and make things harder for Australian industry at this difficult time. (Ms Mr Ciobo: Because they promised they would.",160
313,Mr CHESTER,BILLS,"No, the Greens promised they would. Government ministers claim to stand up for local jobs; they do claim to stand up for blue-collar workers. Then they like to say that members on this side are overstating the impact of a carbon tax. I would like to refer briefly, in the time, I have left to a letter I received this week from a gentleman in my electorate who actually wrote to the Minister for Resources and Energy. This is a letter from Angelo Gaudiano. I have not got time to go through the whole letter, but I did get the opportunity to table it the other day thanks to the government's goodwill. Mr Gaudiano said: Since the formation of Energy Brix Australia in 1993 we have worked hard to survive. We have had to cut back in numbers and have sacrificed pay rises just so the company would remain viable. The company has also spent a lot of money and resources on the plant over the years to make it more reliable and efficient. The company and its employees have endured many hurdles and have turned a loss making business into a profit making business with a future. Since the introduction of the Carbon Tax, the Company has endured financial difficulties due to low electricity prices. Due to this financial strain on the business the maintenance on the plant has been reduced which has caused a downturn in production due to breakdowns. Once the carbon tax comes into effect at the start of July the business will be unviable. It will have to shut. Over 200 workers will lose their jobs and the community will be greatly affected with families leaving the area. … … … The Prime Minister promised that no one will lose their jobs or be disadvantaged by the Carbon Tax. The Union (CFMEU) promised that no one will lose their jobs or be disadvantaged by the Carbon tax. The Union promised it would work with the Government in ensuring alternative base load power stations be constructed in the area so that it will provide jobs for the long term. nothing has been done. ... … … … … I worry for the future of my family and I fear for the future of the community that I live and have invested in as I know it is going to suffer greatly in the very near future and take many years to recover from the effects that this unpopular carbon tax legislation will bring. I am also tired talk about clean energy transition by local governments and groups. Talk does not produce jobs. We need positive action now. So please take my letter seriously, I am very frustrated and scared about my future. Angelo is a boiler turbine operator who informs me the minister has not responded to his letter. What a surprise! What a surprise that people like Angelo simply do not trust this government! And why would they? Today I had the opportunity also to ask questions to the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government. I asked him some questions about the Regional Structural Adjustment Assistance Program. This little beauty is a $200-million program to assist communities strongly affected by carbon pricing! But, remarkably, given that the carbon tax comes into effect on 1 July-that there are going to be announcements, supposedly, on Contract for Closure, on 1 July-the minister informed me that the guidelines for this program have not been developed yet. What are we waiting for? It is less than five weeks away and the guidelines for the $200-million structural adjustment package for regional communities have not been developed yet. This Contract for Closure is a dud policy from a dud government and this Clean Energy Finance Corporation just adds to the long list of policy failures from a government that has forgotten who it is meant to represent. The Labor Party of old used to stand up So far for blue-collar workers like Angelo Gaudiano. Now it stands for staying in power at all costs, and it is doing pathetic deals with the Greens, who have never in created a job in regional Australia and are a direct threat to jobs in a wide range of regional industries. I have mentioned before in the House, and I will say it again tonight: there is an absolute crisis of confidence in regional communities directly linked to the uncertainty this government has created through its reckless decision to legislate for the world's biggest carbon tax. As long as this carbon tax hangs over the heads of Australian businesses it is hard to see that confidence being restored. Until this government actually asks the Australian people for their permission to introduce a carbon tax, they will never be trusted again. It simply staggers me that this once grand old party that claimed to represent bluecollar workers could come in here every day and still pretend that it represents the workers of this nation, when it has a policy in place to sack hundreds of blue-collar workers in power stations throughout Australia and has no plan whatsoever on the table to actually compensate those communities or provide alternative arrangements. The carbon tax will come into effect on 1 July and once this Contract for Closure policy is announced there will be more jobs lost in communities like mine. This government assures me-the minister assured me today-that the guidelines have not been prepared yet. The Australian people simply do not trust this government and its assurances, they do not trust this Prime Minister with their jobs and I would love to see her show the same passion for their jobs as she has shown in fighting to keep her own. (Time expired)",160
314,Mr CIOBO,BILLS," I rise to speak about the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 because this is quite an extraordinary bill. This is a bill that is delivering $10 billion of taxpayer subsidies through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to deliver so-called viable clean energy technologies. The extraordinary thing about it though is that the bill in reality not deliver viable clean energy technologies; it provides a taxpayer subsidy to those operators that seek to commercialise clean energy technologies. What we know, and this is a direct consequence of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into this very billDebate interrupted. NA The DEPUTY SPEAKER Rishworth) (19:00): Order! It being 7 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",162
315,Mr Albanese,ADJOURNMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I require that the question be put immediately without debate. Question negatived. Clean Energy Finance Corporation Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",162
316,Mr CIOBO,ADJOURNMENT," I am mindful of the time of night, so I will keep my remarks fairly succinct. What we know is that it is forecast that as a direct result of the operation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation taxpayers have a default rate of 7½ per cent of the forecast expenditure by CEFC. Seven-and-a-half per cent of the does forecast expenditure equates to $150 million a year of losses. Two billion dollars has been allocated to CEFC each year over five years-that is a $10 billion investment. Of that $10 billion it is predicted that at least $750 million of taxpayers' money will be lost as a result of defaults. That is the starting point-$750 million of taxpayer losses. I would say that if you go into a deal where the government says right up front, 'We're going to lose $750 million of taxpayers' (Ms funds and that's our starting point', then it gives some indication of this government's cavalier approach to the industry. But the way they try to defend it is to say, 'Yes, but we're probably going to seek to have a bond rate return on the total pool of investments'. We had the opportunity as part of the committee inquiry to test the basis on which the government makes its forecast. We BILLS looked at two crucial elements. The first question was: where does the 7½ per cent Bill 2012 default target rate come from? The answer: 'We do not know; it is effectively a direction from the government'. I would love to hear Bill 2012 the minister account for this because the 7½ per cent default rate is not based on best practice, it is not based on international benchmarks and it is not based on prior experience. It is only based on a direction from the government to the departments of Treasury and climate change. The second question was: on what basis is the benchmark made of a bond rate return, of three or four per cent return on the total amount of pooled funds? Where does that come from? Lo and behold, it comes from the same source. It is not based on international benchmarks, it is not based on global experience, and it is not based on any kind of analysis or modelling. Rather, it is a consequence of direction again from the executive arm of the parliament down to the departments that that will be the forecast rate. So the reality of the operation of the CEFC is that there actually could be substantially higher losses. Instead of being starting point of $750 million of lost taxpayers' funds, it could amount to being billions of dollars of lost taxpayers' funds. Instead of the return being a three or four cent return it could in reality be a return of negative three or four per cent, because the only people who have made this decision thus far are the minister and I guess a coterie of people around him. And that is it! Australian taxpayers need to understand that the Australian Labor Party is committing them to a $10 billion level of expenditure for the government to pick winners when it comes to clean energy technology. That should ring alarm bells. It rings alarm bells with the opposition. It rings alarm bells with the Liberal members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics who participated in the inquiry, but it does not ring alarm bells on the opposite side because it is just business as usual. It is just standard, typical practice from a government that has become fat and lazy when it comes to dealing with taxpayers' funds. That is the concern that I and others have. But more than that, make no mistake, the whole basis on which CEFC will operate is fundamentally flawed because, again from the evidence before the inquiry, it is clear that the sole purpose of the operation of the CEFC is to provide a taxpayer subsidy for clean tech that otherwise will not be commercially funded. They are called barriers to entry or barriers to investment. The Labor Party cannot have its cake and eat it too. You cannot say, 'Well, there is a market failure here, there is a reason why these start-ups, these commercialised entities, cannot receive private sector finance and that is because it is too risky and too pricey for these ventures to be funded. That is why we are going to suddenly come in like the cavalry with a $10 billion fund,' but then a at the same time say, 'No, there's not a heightened level of risk, it's okay'. The reality is this is a risky venture right from day one, which is why the Labor Party says, per 'We expect a 7½ per cent default-that is, we expect taxpayers to lose $750 million, which could actually be substantially higher'. This is a government with a bad track record. It is a government that now thinks it knows better than the private sector when it comes to investing in clean tech. It is a government which, as the very basic starting point for CEFC, acknowledges that these institutions, companies, or whatever they might actually be, cannot secure private sector funding at the level required to make a go of it. That is the whole rationale for this $10 billion fund and that is the reason why the coalition will rip it apart, because it is bad policy, it is bad use of taxpayers' money and it is Australian taxpayers that wear the risk of this investment, not the private sector. I am very pleased to say that we do not support this jaunt. We do not support risking $10 billion of taxpayers' money and we do not support a starting point that says we are going to lose $750 million-a figure that has just materialised out of thin air and is not actually based on international benchmarks. The final point lies with why this is actually taking place. I said I would be relatively brief, so I will finalise on this point. It is the opportunity cost associated with the operation of the CEFC. We already know the government is taking it off budget. We know the government has used tricky legislative implementation to ensure that they make it as difficult as possible for a subsequent government that would seek to repeal this particular agency. It is Australians who will have to finance this through borrowed funds. So this little jaunt down the road of being venture capitalists, which is effectively what the CEFC will be, this little jaunt at the direction of the minister at the table, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, will see Aussie kids for the next 20 years having even more debt to pay off to pay for this little venture capital expedition that the minister and others want to go on. They are the ones in whose apparent cause we are trying to do our little bit to clean the environment, even though the rest of the world is continuing to pollute. in their interests, apparently, that all this is taking place, yet they always seem to avoid the little asterisk at the end of that sentence, which is that the next generation of Australians will be paying all the debt and interest associated with this $10 billion junket. I am pleased to stand opposed to the CEFC. It is a bad decision. The government should not be in the business of thinking that it is smarter than the private sector because, if there is one thing that we have learned time and time again, it is that governments are not. I have absolute knowledge about one thing, and that is that this government certainly is not.",162
317,Mr COMBET,ADJOURNMENT,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (19:08): The House has been debating the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012. This is a very important package of legislation, and it continues to implement the Gillard government's historic reforms to build a clean energy future. I thank all members for their contribution to the second reading debate on each of these bills and the associated legislation, although I should observe that some of the contributions really have been quite misleading and misrepresentative of the purposes of the legislation. One only has to consider the accusation of governments picking winners to recognise what nonsense has really been spoken by some of those on the other side of the House. In fact, the opposition has a policy called Direct Action, which is picking winners. What we are doing here with the Clean Energy Finance It is Corporation Bill is establishing a corporation, vesting it with funds that will operate independent of government according to an investment mandate and make investments on a commercial basis. To suggest otherwise just completely misrepresents the legislation. I would also like to thank members of the House Standing Committee on Economics, particularly the chair, the member for Parramatta, for the inquiry that has been conducted into the legislation which built on the extensive consultation that the expert review panel, chaired by Jillian Broadbent, a Reserve Bank of Australia board member, undertook from October last year to March this year. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a very important part of the government's clean energy future plan. It will encourage private investment and help overcome financial barriers that were clearly articulated in the review report that was chaired by Jillian Broadbent to commercialising and deploying cleaner energy technologies. The fact of the matter, as was identified in the review report, is that investment in clean energy technologies often faces a range of obstacles in attracting financing. I outlined those obstacles in my second reading speech. The corporation will capitalise private finance into Australia's clean energy sector, renewable energy and low emissions technology using financial products and structures that address those financial barriers. They could include the provision of loans, loan guarantees or equity investments, but the corporation will operate on a commercial basis. The corporation, as I indicated earlier, will operate independently from government also, and it will focus on bringing private finance into the financing of renewable energy and low emissions technology investments. It is not expected to be the sole financier. In this way, it will build investor confidence in the clean energy sector. It is also important to note just in summary that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the carbon price mechanism and the renewable energy target have all been designed to complement each other and, in order to facilitate the investments that need to be made in renewable energy, in low emissions technologies, in clean energy and in energy efficiency, to work together so that we achieve the goal of reducing our emissions, meeting our international obligations and achieving a 20 per cent renewable energy target by the year 2020 at lowest cost to the economy. These components of policy will work effectively together. Finally, in relation to the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill and the two other associated bills, it is important to note that the amendment bill will provide for something that the gaseous fuels industry has been asking for and consulting with the government for quite a period of time. It is something that came out of the inquiry into the clean energy bills last year-that is, to facilitate the opportunity for LPG, LNG and CNG to come underneath the carbon price mechanism rather than fuel excise arrangements. CNG, according to this bill and consequent upon its passage through parliament, will come under the carbon price mechanism from 1 July this year, and LPG and LNG will come under the carbon price mechanism from 1 July 2013. The amendments in the amendment bill and the associated bills principally deal with that issue. With those remarks in summary, I commend the bills to the House.",164

327,Mr MORRISON,ADJOURNMENT," Sydney airport is a key driver of our local shire and economy, providing jobs for thousands in aviation and related industries. My constituents have a great interest in securing the airport's ongoing success, and planning for future infrastructure needs will be critical to that success. We have now reached the point where a second Sydney airport is no longer a bold vision, like the Sydney Harbour Bridge was when it was planned and built, but an overdue necessity. The Joint study on aviation capacity for the Sydney region report details two alarming warnings for my electorate and the Sydney community. Without supplementary second airport there is no ability for Sydney to grow our aviation capacity to realise our future opportunities and noise sharing at KSA will effectively be impossible within 18 months. In order to sustain Sydney as the aviation hub it is today, a second supplementary airport is critical to ensuring Sydney's continued dominance and prominence in aviation. Even on conservative estimates, demand for aviation services in the Sydney region will double to nearly 88 million passenger movements by 2035 and to 165 million passengers by 2060. International experience suggests that for every million passengers airports generate a thousand jobs. The most immediate employment benefits fall within the local area. Yet, without a second supplementary airport, on its current trajectory KSA's ability to grow new services will leave Sydney short. The status quo is not an acceptable solution for the airport needs of a major city of Sydney's global stature in the 21st century. If future aviation demand cannot be met, by 2060 we will have lost almost $60 billion in forgone expenditure and $34 billion in forgone gross domestic product. The New South Wales economy alone would forego $17.5 billion in gross state product. We are running out of time. Even if the site was fixed upon tonight, the timeline for developing and building something of this magnitude could be in the order of 15 years. It is imperative this government makes a decision on a site for a second supplementary airport for Sydney before the next election. It is a federal decision, not a state decision. Once decided we must work positively with the state government and not seek to fit up that government with all of the associated land based transport infrastructure costs. Seeking a blank cheque commitment in a advance from the New South Wales government for a site yet undetermined by the federal government is not practical and not helpful. No wonder the New South Wales Premier is proposing that the second Sydney airport not even be in the same state let alone in the same city. He has some experience in being fit up by this government for major transport projects. Without a second airport our capacity to share aircraft noise in Sydney would also be compromised. It is bewildering for my constituents why, when we are blessed with a coastline and a swathe of national park, aircraft on rivet 9 flight path still fly over Caringbah, Lilli Pilli, Grays Point and Cronulla, or oceanic arrivals fly loops over our southern suburbs before 6 am, or Boree 4 flights take the land rather than the water leg when they could route over vacant parkland or sea instead without disturbing anyone. The long-term operating plan introduced by the Howard government, supported by the legislated cap and curfew introduced by the government, has been a productive initiative to share aircraft noise and maintain community support for our airport. It is a critical component of the compact with the Sydney community to deliver peaceful and prosperous coexistence between the airport and local communities. LTOP rates rotate 10 different modes of runway use through the day to offer a reprieve to residents under the flight paths. Ministerial direction includes that the proposed changes to the elements of the plan should be tested with the public through the Sydney Airport Community Forum before being implemented. In this respect, I want to pay tribute to Mr John Woods and the special community representative, Kevin Hill, who serve on that forum. I was therefore particularly disturbed by the joint committee's recommendation that LTOP be reviewed to determine new, more effective measures of aircraft noise impacts and respite rather than the current runway-end movements. LTOP is clearly over. The report admits growth and operations at KSA will lead to loss of the capacity to share noise and provide respite. By 2015 nine hours of the weekday will have demand levels exceeding 55 movements per hour, the approximate point beyond which the LTOP noise-sharing modes can no longer be operated and parallel runway operations are required. By 2020 the report forecast that demand at all hours between 7 am and 8 pm, save for two hours in the afternoon, will exceed that aircraft movement limit. The only opportunities for respite would be after 8 pm and a small window on the weekend. Details of this review process are still unavailable. The last thing anyone wants is a return to the days when parallel runways were used, as the former transport minister Mark Vaile said, like the deck of an aircraft carrier in a war zone. With or without a second airport, we need to set our minds to developing LTOP mark 2. We need a new deal and a fair deal for all Sydney communities and we need a decision on a second supplementary airport as soon as possible . Both of these initiatives have my very strong support. (Time expired) National Reconciliation Week",170
328,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT," As a federal MP with a large Indigenous community in Ipswich and Somerset, and as Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I would like to bring to everyone's attention to National Reconciliation Week, which started on 27 May and continues until 3 June. The date commemorates two significant milestones in the reconciliation journey of our country. 27 May 2012 marks the 45th anniversary of the 1967 referendum which gave the Commonwealth the power to make laws for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and recognise them in the national census, which had the flow-on effect of allowing them the right to vote. The 3 June 2012 will mark the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia which legally recognised that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a special relationship to the land, that existed prior to colonisation and still exists today. National Reconciliation Week is an important annual event which encourages all Australians to talk about and celebrate Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who have lived in this great country for over 40,000 years. Reconciliation is more than just a wordit is about actions. Closing the Gap is about actions not just rhetoric. National Reconciliation Week extends over the course of a week to encourage Indigenous and nonIndigenous people to think about reconciliation and what it means to them. 2012 is a time to reflect on what actions we are carrying out in this parliament that demonstrate our respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The opening proceedings of the new parliament in 2008 incorporated a 'welcome to country' ceremony. This was initiated by this federal Labor government and it was the first time it had ever been done. It is now a permanent feature in all future federal parliamentary openings. In 2010, an acknowledgment of country incorporated into the standing orders for the Speaker to read out before the usual prayers at the start of each sitting day. An acknowledgment of country is a way of showing our respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. demonstrates an understanding and respect of the traditional owners' connection to the land or sea, and their history and culture. The House of Representatives ATSIA Committee includes an acknowledgement of country at the start of every private and public meeting it holds across the country. Currently we are running an inquiry into language learning in Indigenous communities. The committee has heard repeated evidence about the importance of the role of language and what it plays in terms of strong connection to land and culture and improving the well-being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The inquiry has highlighted the fact that Indigenous languages have been spoken in Australia for over 40,000 years and this is something of which all Australians should be proud. However, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are in sharp decline. Today there are about only 30 considered to be vibrant languages. At the time of white settlement about 250 Indigenous languages were spoken in Australia. The committee has been investigating programs and projects which aim to support the maintenance, transmission and revival of Indigenous languages. There are many dedicated people across the length and breadth of Australia working on projects to improve the vitality of our Indigenous languages. As a committee we have been looking at how we can work to improve Indigenous languages and assist these people as well to improve competency in English in communities, because that is the way for good education as well and good was outcomes in terms of vocation. In Newcastle the committee visited the Miromaa Aboriginal Language and Technology Centre, which has been a key feature and figure in developing support for language preservation and reclamation It through technology, particularly through the development of their computer program Miromaa. The word Miromaa literally means 'saved' in the Awabakal language and refers to an ease and also the way in which databases can be helpful in maintaining the organisation, analysis and production of material to assist language. The program supports about 150 Australian language projects and is being used internationally. From Halls Creek to Darwin, from the Utopia homelands to Sydney we travelled. Later this year we will have our report and over 150 submissions have been authorised by the committee. We look forward to handing down our report and its contribution to promoting Indigenous languages. (Time expired) Bennelong Electorate: Traffic Congestion",171
329,Mr ALEXANDER,ADJOURNMENT," As the representative for the people of Bennelong, I have spoken in this place about a large range of issues of concern to my constituents: cost of living, aircraft noise, economic management, leadership, education, private health insurance, animal welfare and local developments to name a few. The single issue that is brought to my attention every day, both from constituents and through my own experience, is an issue that causes incalculable stress in my community. That is the never-ending daily grind of traffic congestion. Bennelong incorporates four of the 10 most congested roads in New South Wales. Every person and business in our region is impacted on in some way by this unacceptable situation. There is a combination of reasons for this problem, many of which have their foundations in broken promises from both state and federal governments. For more than 12 years the former New South Wales Labor government promised the construction of the Epping to Parramatta and North West rail links. These two railway lines would allow tens of thousands of commuters who currently have no option but to use our road network to travel from the fastest growing region in the nation to Sydney CBD, and also between our city's next two biggest CBDs of Parramatta and Macquarie Park. Ten days before the 2010 election the Gillard government pledged $2.1 billion to build the Epping to Parramatta rail link. This money was listed in the 2010-11 MYEFO papers, but has since disappeared from sight. There have been no announcements and no information about pre-construction activities, and no mention of any costs of this project this year's forward estimates, which take us through to 2015-16. This is in sharp contrast to the New South Wales government, which promised construction of the North West Rail Link during the 2011 state election, allocated $2.8 billion in the 2011-12 budget and immediately commenced preconstruction activities, including community consultations and environmental assessments. In a perfect symbol of the Gillard government's politicisation of important infrastructure issues, they have rejected a request to make a financial contribution to the North West Rail Link. This is despite the New South Wales government submitting a 2,200-page impact statement that outlined the creation of 16,000 jobs and injection of $25 billion to the state's economy through massive productivity increases from tens of thousands of commuters not wasting hours every day stuck in traffic travelling through Bennelong. In contrast, when the announcement was made to build the Epping to Parramatta rail link, this project did not exist anywhere in the state government's 10-year infrastructure plan and the only submission received by the federal government was a five-page document. It would seem that if the NBN can be committed to from a few squiggles on the back of a drink coaster, then perhaps five A4 pages is overkill for a $2.1 billion rail network! Traffic congestion in Bennelong is also exacerbated by the costly 'point-to-point' tolling on the M2 Freeway, pushing thousands of cars onto local roads, and the lack of connectivity between the F3 and the M2, with flow-on effects throughout the region. Recently I joined my colleagues the members for Bradfield, Mitchell and Berowra and Senator Sinodinos to form a in Missing Link Action Network to fight for the prioritisation of the F3-M2 link. Despite the government admitting this is a vital piece of infrastructure, no funding has been listed for this in the budget. Our roads are victims of poor planning and cooperation is required across governments to resolve bottlenecks. I host the regular tri-level government meeting to ensure cooperation and communication between all three levels of government in our region. Our June meeting in a couple of these weeks will include a presentation from a senior manager of New South Wales Roads to continue this conversation. Short-term thinking has left Bennelong with a significant infrastructure deficit. Only genuine policy commitments that are prioritised by community need, not the political stripe of the particular electorate, will get commuters out of their cars, will clear our local roads and regain lost productivity, and will get our local community and our nation back on track. Second Sydney Airport",172
330,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," Madam Deputy Speaker, you have just listened tonight to the member for Cook's speech calling for a second airport for Sydney. I am heartened by the member for Cook bringing this to the parliament because I agree with him that the status quo cannot continue, but that is where my agreement with the member for Cook stops. All this humbug, cant, hypocrisy and double standards about the second airport has to stop. Very recently the Premier of New South Wales suggested that the second airport for Sydney, the gateway to Australia, should be here in Canberra in the national capital. This is outrageous. He suggested we can build and would like to have a very fast train. But, of course, he no regard for the cost of something in the order of $20 to $30 million per kilometre for a fast train, as if that would resolve the problem of a second airport for Sydney. The Premier is living in fantasyland. I suggest that the member for Cook get behind the member for Grayndler-who knows something about aircraft noise and happens to be the transport minister-in supporting the push for a second airport to be sited at Wilton, some 20 kilometres south of Campbelltown. It is an appropriate place for a second airport, subject to a rigorous EIS. Badgerys Creek is not an option for the Labor Party for a second airport for Sydney. Alarmingly, the member for Cook wants to have the long-term operating plan revisited. Tonight he advised that chamber that he wants a long-term operating plan Mark II. You would have heard me speak in this chamber over the last almost 14 years on many occasions about the Howard government's long-term operating plan which they went to in the 1996 election and the 1998 election and which committed to aircraft movements to the north of Sydney airport at 17 per cent. The people I represent and the people the member for Grayndler represents-and I notice the member for Sydney here in the chamber tonight, and I notice the previous speaker, the member for Bennelong-have to endure air-traffic movements double what was promised under the Howard government, and they never, ever had any intention of honouring a commitment to the people of Sydney that they would do something to alleviate aircraft noise. For almost 40 years now, since the MANS report, we have been talking about the need for a second airport in Sydney, and we cannot get bipartisan support. Worse, I have just had to suffer the member for Cook had coming in here tonight, and the member for North Sydney was also there-he is a former chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, he understands the issues and he knows that there has to be a bipartisan approach to this because by the year 2020 Sydney Airport is going to be stuffed. We need a second airport, not only in the economic interests of the state of New South Wales and our great country but also to alleviate the unbearable burden of aircraft noise, particularly over the inner-west of Sydney. It is having such an injurious effect to the people not only who I represent but also those who the member for North Sydney, the member for Bennelong, the member for Sydney and the member for Cook, to the south of Sydney Airport, represent that something has to be done. I have a message for the member for Cook, and he can convey that to Premier Barry O'Farrell: he has to stop the politics, wake up to himself and get behind the member for Grayndler and transport minister in supporting a rigorous EIS for a second airport at Wilton, because that is the obvious place to have a second airport. With the way we are going with the coalition they will never get an airport in Canberra; they will have a second airport for Sydney out at Broken Hill. It is absolutely farcical! I applaud the efforts of the member for Grayndler in pushing for the second airport because the Sydney- (Time expired) Enterprise Migration Agreements",174
331,Mr CHRISTENSEN,ADJOURNMENT," Last week the Gillard Labor government gave approval for over 1,700 foreign workers at the Roy Hill project in the Pilbara. It was an absolutely bungled decision, and we still do not know exactly what the Prime Minister knew or did not know about that decision. Now we see knee-jerk reactions from this government in response to their own stuff ups, which may result in increased cost burdens for the resources sector. At a time when the Minerals Council of Australia is reporting that it is 75 per cent more expensive for iron ore projects here in Australia compared with West Africa, it is not in the national interest to add more I support the sensible use of 457 visas where businesses struggle to find homegrown workers. In the Mackay region we would have businesses in serious trouble without 457 visas. We have many great Filipino and South African 457 visa workers in Mackay who have gone on to migrate here permanently-foreign workers who have become Aussie workers. However there is a disconnect, particularly when we hear mining companies say that they cannot find workers while people in my electorate on the doorstep of the Bowen Basin tell me they are desperately looking for work and are unable to find it. I know that there are many more jobseekers in capital cities. A number of locals have talked to me about the great expense they have incurred personally to get training but that they have not been able to secure a job in the resources sector. That is why there needs to be more rigour in the enterprise migration process to ensure that Aussies get the jobs before we open it carte blanche to foreigners, as this government has done. And a jobs board is not the answer. An extra page on the JobSearch website does not solve or absolve this government of its Roy Hill debacle, but at least the Prime Minister and others opposite will have somewhere to pin their resumes after the next election. We also know that cash incentives to relocate do not work on their own. The government scheme to offer $9,000 cash to relocate to where jobs are has already failed, with only 37 people taking up that offer. What will work is a comprehensive approach, such as the one pursued by the Nationals, which combines incentives for relocating to regional centres for employment with disincentives for doing nothing. The Nationals' regional investment strategy also includes tying skilled migrants costs. to regional areas and providing tax incentives for businesses. Young, mobile welfare recipients who refuse to take up gainful employment in the regions should not expect to continue to receive unemployment benefits. While this is not Nationals' policy, I agree with what hard workers in the resource industry in my electorate tell me about the idea of mandatory drug testing for welfare recipients. If it is good enough for a hard working miner, who pays taxes, to have to undergo a mandatory drug test then it is good enough for the person who receives those taxes via welfare. To argue against drug testing for Newstart recipients is to foster illegal activities while undermining the economy and the self-respect of future generations. If we are to be serious about keeping Australians in jobs, we must provide those incentives to get the unemployed to employment and provide disincentives for doing nothing. One thing that may make people think twice about pursuing a career in the resources sector is the spectacle of a public dispute as we are now seeing in the Bowen Basin. I call on the CFMEU and BMA to come to the table and sort this out urgently, because every day this goes on is another day Mackay families have less money in their household budgets. Unions should accept the fact that they are not management and drop all ambit claims to management functions. They should stop their push to squeeze subcontractors off BMA sites. But BMA should accept the more sensible union suggestions by agreeing to familyfriendly rosters, and adding an extra halfhour crib break for shifts longer than 10 hours. We need to keep mining strong, with unions and mining companies working together, and where a good Liberal-National coalition government is working to get Australian jobseekers into mining jobs-not causing job insecurity through a great big new mining tax and a great big new carbon tax.

So how can Western even know when they are available to be applied for? Western Australia has the most towns of any under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, but it is to get it.

431,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS," I will respond to that question issue. I make the point that I have no doubt about getting funding for this project; he has the point that the former government, in which and they did absolutely nothing in terms of progressing four terms to say, 'We promise to spend something one cent was put in from Commonwealth The fact is there are two elements of the budget the member that this is a vital project for Sydney, including the M5 East, and hence Infrastructure Australia to undertake a study to M2.

This is a lower government budget, and as a proportion coalition government introduced Auslink for the in 2015-16, the last year in the forward estimates, billion. That is still less than provided in Labor government. So, in spite of all we hear this year and in 2015-16 there will be less budget. So I ask the minister: is the $2.7 billion 2015-16 all that the government proposes to somewhere in the contingency reserve to ensure for roads that far out? My second question relates to the carbon been estimated that it will cost $400 million program as a result of the carbon tax. Has enable these projects to be completed, or are than the government had committed? Naturally, because of the fact that expenditure see a significant reduction in its road-funding as the minister said, was an alleged $3.6 However, there is actually only $2.7 billion urban communities.

That is a drop of $3.62 billion, or 58 expenditure on roads than in the last Howard of GDP it is lower than in 2004-05, when the first time. What is perhaps even worse is that the amount proposed for roads is only $2.7 the last Howard budget before the election of the about this government and its grand projects, money provided than was in the last Howard being provided in the forward estimates for spend on roads in 2015-16, or are there amounts that there is some kind of decent allocation tax and its impact on road construction.

One is with regard The fact is that, for example, two weeks ago of the Dinmore to Goodna section. It is Commonwealth money. We have allocated over opened six months ahead of schedule and payment. One of the things we have done transport ministers-was pay according to is finished, so the $400 million allocated last too hard to understand.

Indeed, it only got to 80-20 million after they were elected to bring it up to South Wales, an 86-14 split was considered 50-50. I ask the minister: if in fact the was good for Labor in New South Wales ought to meet 50 per cent of the cost, will the it ensure that that money is spent on the Pacific there have been significant reductions, I refer been no money announced in the budget for any note, however, that the government has said that finish in a few weeks time, is now only $388 put down at $488 million. I ask the minister: has taken away from the Cooroy to Curra in fact $100 million? Ever since the last budget, or questions in Senate estimates on that issue. I amount taken away in the last budget was $100 House and Minister for Infrastructure and rather extraordinary questions from the Leader to represent regional Australia.

It would be moment to do so. On the specifics of the design are meant to be temporary organisations. governments of both sides. No-one should reflection on the seriousness of the work that are in the nature of the model. That has been which I think goes back to Barry Jones. In the budget, the government has committed engagement in the Antarctic program itself. for Australia's Antarctic program, $6.7 million million to continue operation of the Australia-Antarctic our Antarctic operations. Let us not underestimate We are the biggest claimant in the area with played a very significant role-in particular Hawke in his work with then Prime Minister preserved and dedicated to science rather exploration.

There are a number of problems. First endangered or threatened species throughout always significantly limited. The work of surveys decisions first come to the Threatened Species limited data sets. That is the first problem second problem with the koala has been that goes on a threatened species list is based on the populations are, in some parts of Australia South Australia is a classic example, where should add, before anyone gets worried, that of number control that take place in South Australia. At first glance, some people work on the heaps of them and where they are actually in of habitat, it is hard to argue that they are iconic species.

I know around Peak Crossing, just outside of clearly whole ovals are set aside for that. on the protection of native fauna, particularly Environment, Water, Population and member for the question. The koala listing has come before the Threatened Species Scientific for Flinders has also taken a keen interest of all, a problem that we have in identifying the entire country is that the quality of data is is very important, but when many of these Scientific Committee they are grappling with that we have been faced with for the koala. The if you simply say that whether or not something how hard they are to find and how strong some of the koala population is unbelievably strong. there are actually programs to control numbers. I it does not involve culling-but there are issues basis that, 'If you have anywhere where there are such numbers that they are eating themselves out also in some way threatened', particularly with a bit much to say that here is a species that used that we are just willing to tap the mat and concede defeat in the vast majority of those find one. I do not want to see a situation where for that matter-the only possibility you have Australians have an expectation that protection something which is done rarely, but which example, with respect to the grey nurse shark, in different waters. On this occasion, the recommendations to me recommended that a listing status to Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT. The New South Wales government welcomed is fair to say, did not.

I think is afforded. That means that we had to do has been done previously. It was done, for where you had listings that applied differently Threatened Species Scientific Committee's that would only apply at the 'vulnerable' the decision. The Queensland government, it elsewhere in the parliament, but I remain of the the Queensland Premier had been saying that he would be suddenly outraged by federal standards. of the media clippings in Ipswich about the Mr Neumann. I have seen that in print there. the category of vulnerable is a few things. First in place to try to get the numbers to recover-a very closely with the states on that. Certainly being completely cooperative in playing that role it. It also means that for development proposals now needs to be taken into account. On the layer of bureaucracy? Yes, it does. But, let's species legislation to protect the koala we may as this job, some species that no-one has ever ridicule environmental protection. You always get who have not heard of the koala, and there not be seriously alarmed at the decline in 1990-so this is a fair way into your process of 40 per cent decline in the numbers.

We all know that without the difficult to implement, because the plan calls develop the detailed environmental watering parliament only yesterday, has so far refused the states, it is clear that the government is each state. What do you propose to do to achieve that? The government has failed to outline commitments which will reduce the impact on jobs, communities chairman of the MDBA, says that more water water infrastructure compared to water buybacks, you or your government that reflects these statements. on water buybacks but just $413 million on basin. For every one litre of water which has have been taken out of communities through government defer $941 million of Murray-Darling yet keep the money for largely unwanted buybacks remains complete.

The must become more efficient, just as farmers would like to know what the government's always, available for sensible dialogue with met with our shadow water minister, Barnaby briefly outline what came of Also, does the government have an estimate gigalitres, compared with what will be necessary allocations? If the states develop environmental environmental watering needs from what is the plan? Has the government decided to seek means other than water buybacks? If so, how too, because I know there are a lot of questions. I would like an update on the Nimmie-Caira Murrumbidgee, where historical extractions like to know where that is up to. I spoke with says that they have had a meeting with the state provided by the federal government for Just on something completely different, the government has decided in relation to rainforests?
