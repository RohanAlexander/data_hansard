0,NA,Unknown,"I^ouse of ftepresentatibes. Wednesday, 10 June, 191iMr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. SUPPLY BILL-SUPPL Y (WORKS tries AND BUILDINGS) BILL . Mr SPEAKER reported the messages from His Excellency the Governor General recommending appropriations of revenue for the purposes of these Bills. Motion (by Sir JOHN FOBBEST) proposed - That the messages be referred to the mittee of Supply.",11
1,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [2.32] As the messages which have been read cover two distinct Bills, they should be dealt with separately.",11
2,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,The Bills will be dealt with separately.,11
3,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The messages should be dealt with separately. A member may have something to say in regard to the recommendation of an appropriation for Supply, or he may have something to say about the other message, yet he may not wish to discuss, both messages. I object to this bunching together of separate messages. It has been done .before from time to time, but the procedure is incorrect, and although in this case it may. not cause much trouble, it will, sooner or later, lead to endless difficulties. I enter my protest against the course which is being pursued.",11
4,Sir JOHN FOBREST,Unknown,I made the motion merely as a matter of form.,11
5,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The Treasurer, as each message was read, should have moved that it be referred to the Committee of Supply. Had he done that, probably one message would' have been dealt with immediately, and perhaps only two or three words said regarding the other. The right honourable gentleman has not told us why the Government desire Supply at this time of the year, when it is in no need of it . The Appropriation Act and the Appropriation Works and Buildings Act provide for the ordinary services of the current financial year and for the construction of additions, new works, buildings, tas., and the Treasurer will have no need for Supply until the second week in July. Some Bpecial inducement must have been offered to the Governor General to obtain his recommendation of the proposed appropriations, and the House has a right to know from the Treasurer just what the proposal is.",11
6,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"Hear , hear I",11
7,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"If there is one member who, more than another, usually to be candid, straightforward, and clear, it is the Treasurer, and I am surprised that at this juncture he should receipt of withhold information.",11
8,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,Le t us hear what the Speaker has to say about the matter. Anything he desires me to do I shall do.,11
9,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not know how Mr Speaker intends to rule. He may say Comthat the course which has been taken is one that has been, taken before. I know that it has been taken quite a number of times.",11
10,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member, when Speaker, allowed it , I think.",12
11,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not know; but I have known messages to come from the Governor General to which his signature has not been attached, and whioh thereforo have not been read to the House. I suppose that the messages which have just been read are in order. I have known, too, messages to come from the Governor General dated as if signed on the day on which they were received here in Melbourne, although the Governor General himself was at the time nearly 600 miles away, in Sydney. Facts like these show how necessary it is to have the fullest discussion, so that we may Be informed of the reasons for the messages which have been read. The Treasurer has not spent within 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, of the votes authorized by the Appropriation Works and Buildings Act for the current financial year.",12
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What has that to do with it? The votes lapse at the end of the year.,12
13,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I know that they lapse. This helps the Treasurer to inflate his Budget by the starving of the Departments, which is what we should guard against. Throughout the country there are public works urgently needing attention, on which the Government has not spent a threepence, although money was voted for them months ago.",12
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,A great deal more has been spent during the current financial year than was spent in the financial year preceding it .,12
15,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Ver y little of the expenditure sanctioned by us last year, in connection with the Works and Buildings Estimates, has been carried out by the Government; or, at all events, if there has been any considerable expenditure, it has not taken place in constituencies represented by the members of the Labour party. The Government, apparently, are anxious to make the people believe that the deficit on the year's undertakings will be less than it would have been if they had not been in power. We shall have no financial statement from the Treasurer, since the financial year will probably ended when Parliament is dissolved. The Government, therefore, will be able Sir to go to the country and make all sorts of statements regarding the finances of the year without fear of contradiction. We shall not be in possession of the information necessary to enable us to refute their allegations. They hold the key to the financial situation. The Treasurer should be candid enough, therefore, to tell us now what proportion of the Works and Buildings Estimates remains unexpended. We want to know why certain works for which provision was made in those Estimates have not been carried out. We desire, also, to know when the general election is to take place, and upon what roll it is to be conducted. I appeal to the Treasurer to tell us what reasons he assigned for asking the Governor General to send down these messages to enable us to appropriate certain sums of money. I do not know whether His Excellency is, in this respect, like a former Governor General, but I trust that he first looked, as he should do, through the proposals submitted to him. Honourable members desire to know what information the Government gave the Governor General when they asked for these messages. 1 regret that the Treasurer should have seen fit to propose that the two messages should be discussed practically at the one time. There must be a separate Bill and a separate Resolution in' respect of each of them. At a later stage on the motion that you, sir, do now leave the chair and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply, we shall be able to deal with grievances, and I propose then to give expression to my feelings regarding the way in which public works have been starved by the present Administration. Even during the drought, in the early years of Federation, when we were suffering from great depression, the Departments were not starved as they are today. I do not know whether the Treasurer is under the influence of the Attorney-General, or the Prime Minister, but I appeal to him to deal with these two matters separately, so that we may consider them in a legitimate way.",12
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I desire to inform honourable members that the course followed in this case is in accordance with not have the custom of the House.,12
17,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Capricornia) [2.46] J Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Le t us get proposals .themselves.,12
18,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I shall be perfectly willing te allow this motion to' go if the Prime Minister will give us certain information.  chance.,13
19,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,He - has had the chance but has failed to avail himself of it . My chief complaint against the Prime Minister is that he is the champion political bluffer of Australia.,13
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,13
21,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"If that remark is not in order, I shall withdraw it , sir, and say that the Prime Minister is a clever dissembler. What reason has he for believing that he will get a double dissolution",13
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That matter is not before the Chair.,13
23,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Like the member for Kennedy, I think that the Treasurer should tell us why he asks for Supply. Is it proposed that there shall be a picnic of the Ministerial under the auspices of the Women's National League, or what is it for? We have no information. suspect that the Prime Minister has something to tell us, and I think he ought to tell us now. I know a little about newspaper work, and I know, too, that it is customary for Ministers of the Crown to dissemble. Before I consent to money being granted, I desire to know why the Prime Minister did not tell the newspapers that there was some truth in the statement that he had approached Governor General ? The honourable member said that there was no truth ever in it, and what has the Prime Minister to say in explanation that he, apparently, never Supplied the Argus, the idol of society in this with the information he gave to the Age?",13
24,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,He did give it the Argus was afraid to publish it .,13
25,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I cannot believe that an important piece of information could have been given to the Argus and not published. I desire to know why Prime Minister forsook the Argus, and why he told the Argus and other newsthem papers that there was no truth in statement that he had approached the Governor General ? to the Mr SPEAKER - I am afraid the honourable member is discussing another matter altogether.",13
26,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am offering reasons why, before we consent to referring to a Committee a matter like the expenditure, him a of public money, the Prime Minister should tell us why he did not tell the press the truth ; and why he should tell us what the Governor General said to him in consenting to grant a double dissolution under certain conditions. If the Prime Minister will dissemble to a great newspaper, he may dissemble in this House. The honourable member does not seem quite so happy today as he pretended to be on Priday.",13
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Nobod y is happy. It is all "" put on "" with the lot of you.",13
28,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Le t the honourable member speak for himself. I , like Mark Tapley, am trying to be happy under all honourable circumstances. It is fair to ask the Prime Minister what the Governor General said when he told the honourable member that he would give him a dissoluparty, tion of both the Senate and the House of Australian Representatives. . Was there any condition attached to that promise? There I was a time in the history of New Zealand when Sir George Grey asked Sir Hercules' Robinson, the then Governor, for a dissolution. Sir Hercules wrote a memorandum making certain requests in connection with the granting of that dissolution, and his last paragraph readI hope that the Premier, in making his statement to the House, will give my reply in my own words. the And , surely we in this House, and the people in the country, are entitled to what- know from the Prime Minister what the Governor General said when the honourable of the fact gentleman obtained the promise of a double dissolution. It may be said that honState, orable members on this side are already endeavouring to avoid facing the double dissolution; but, judging from the signs , but I can see in the political atmosphere, honourable members on the Government such side will get the fight of their lives. Never in the history of Australia was there an election such as the forthcoming the one will be, and never before were the opponents of the Liberals arrayed before as they will be when the next appeal the to the country takes place. At the risk of even holding up the election for an hour or two, we are entitled to ask the Prime Minister what the Governor General said, and we want a reply, not in the Prime Minister's paraphrase, but in His Excellency's own words. If the Prime Minister will indicate, by even an inclination of the head, that he is prepared to give that information, I will say no more.",13
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I propose t h at should allow ns to get into Committee.,14
30,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,And the honourable memon ber will be prepared to make a statecellency's ment on this question in Committee?,14
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [2.55] - Yes . In explanation should like to say that this is not the or the place to make a statement of the kind. When we get into Committee Supply, I shall be very glad to make a give it ? statement, if requested to do so by the Leader of the Opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT . we get into Committee.",14
32,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he, as head of the Government, has any objection to laying on the table of the House a copy of the reasons given to the Governor General in support of the Government's request for a double dissolution, and the actual words which the Governor General used in replying to that request? understood that the Prime Minister did not state H is Excellency's actual words. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I propose to make a short general statement later on. For the present, I may say that I do not propose to make public the correspondence and conversations which took place between the Governor General and myself, and which I regard as absolutely confidential in character. It has never been the custom in the Commonwealth to do so, and I know of no special reasons for commencing to do it now.",14
33,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any objection to stating the reasons for withholding the actual words used by the Governor General in reply to him, as His Excellency's respon-. sible adviser? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I can only say that I hope, in a few minutes, to make the honourable member full y acquainted with.the facts of the situation.",14
34,Mr FISHEE,Unknown,I asked for the actual words of the Governor General. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I tell the honourable member that I will give him substantially the actual words of the Governor General.,14
35,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It appears that the Prime Minister does not understand my question. I ask the Prime Minister whether he will be good enough to give to you Parliament and to the electors of the Commonwealth the actual statement he made behalf of the Government, as His Exresponsible advisers, requesting a simultaneous dissolution of the Senate and House of Representatives at this time, and the actual words of the GoI vernor-General in reply to that request? time. I think Parliament and the people are entitled to that information, and I ask of the Prime Minister if he is prepared to",14
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have already told the right honourable gentleman what I am prepared to do, and I propose to do it at the earliest possible moment - when ABSENT VOTING.",14
37,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"H as the Prime M in ister observed a statement published in Melbourne that the Government contemplate issuing a regulation which will seriously alter the basic principle of voting at the next election-namely , that an I absent voter will not be allowed to exercise the franchise unless he has made application for a vote on a day prior to polling day? Is it the intention of the Government to do this?",14
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have observed the statement made in the newspapers, and I have tried my best to find out how it got into them, but I am quite unable to do so.",14
39,Mr HOWE,Unknown,Is the statement true?,14
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have to say in reply to my honourable friends that the Government will not make any important alteration of any kind unless Parliament is made aware of it . DATE OF ELECTION : PRINTIN G OF ROLLS : URGENTBILLS .,14
41,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister another question with the idea of facilitating business. Is the honourable gentleman in a position now to state when the election is likely to take place; and, what is of equal importance, what interval tliere will be between the printing of the rolls, on which the election will practically take place, and the issue of the writs? If the Prime Minister will give this information I shall endeavour to meet him as far as practicable in these matters. I see no reason why the House sliould not be informed of the actual day of the election. There is no need to finesse in regard to the matter.",14
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How can I tell that until I get Supply?,15
43,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Government must bo informed as to what they propose to do. They are asking for a certain amount of Supply, and they must bo,contemplating an appeal to the country within the period covered by that Supply. I ask the Prime Minister whether he is now in a position to give the House the information as to the day when Parliament will be dissolved, and as to when the election will take place, and especially as to when the rolls will be ready, so that people may ascertain whether their names are on or off.",15
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Treasurer has all those figures, and will communicate them in his speech when asking for Supply. The trouble is that no one will wait for any one to tell him anything. Honourable members bail us up and catechise us at any time they please, when they could get all the information they desire if they would only wait a little. My own impression is that we can get a clean roll and an election in the early part of September- I think as early as the 5th September.",15
45,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What interval will that allow between the printing of the rolls and the issue of the writs?,15
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not kuow that I could give the right honourable gentleman the exact time. To have an election on the 5th September, and allow a month afterwards for the return of the writs-it was 24 days last time-woul d mean that the dissolution should be published on the 20th July. If we have the writs issued ten days afterwards and nomination day seven or eight days after that again, and the election twenty-one days after nomination day Ave shall be brought to the oth September, but we (shall also require nt least a month's Supply to cover the period for the return of the writs. That is why the Treasurer proposes to ask the House for three months' Supply, because if we proceed on this basis-and that is practically forthwith-w e shall need at least three months' Supply to tide us over the period covered by the elections.",15
47,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,And what about the rolls?,15
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I understand that AVC shall be able to get the new rolls printed in about a month's time. Mr J. H. CATTS - In New South Wales?,15
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . In Sydney the other day I had an interview with Mr Holman, Mr Cann, and Mr. Gullick, the State Government Printer. Mr Kelly and Mr MCLaren, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for New South Wales, were with me.  can bo printed in a month from now?",15
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No ; I mean that the rolls can bo printed within a month after they have been delivered to the Government Printer. Mr MCLaren said that he could begin to give the Government Printer the rolls during this week, so that we can practically say that in a month's time we may expect to have the New South Wales rolls. Then there is the question of the accuracy of the rolls. It seems to me that, in the circumstances, the better plan would be to make the revision of the printed rolls on supplementary rolls. These would necessarily be a little larger than in ordinary circumstances, because there will not be suflicient time to correct the principal rolls after they are published. There is, however, no reason why every name that is inadvertently put on or taken off rolls that are printed should not be accounted for on supplementary rolls. Whether names are on or off printed rolls, the matter can be put right on supplementary rolls. As to all these matters, I wish to say, right here and now, that the Government will co-operate with the Leader of the Opposition in any way he can suggest, and do anything to facilitate the election being carried out without a tittle of advantage to either side.",15
51,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"Will you agree to allowing the police to deliver claim cards? "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I am afraid that cannot be done; but I have no objection to any facility being given.",15
52,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Why not have a conference between the two parties, and have things fixed up properly?",16
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should be delighted to have it. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, I have tried to get hold of him once or twice, but, unfortunately, when he was available I was away in New South Wales. With this fight that is coining on, I do not seek to have a tittle of advantage for auy side. I want a straight, fair, stand-up fight, so that the country may decide the issue between us once and for all; and everything that will help to that end I shall be only too delighted to adopt.",16
54,Mr FISHEE,Unknown,"I reciprocate the statement made by the Prime Minister that every facility should be giveu to every person entitled to be on the roll to get his name on the roll, and have it kept there, and to have every facility to exercise his vote. I appreciate the statement of the Prime Miuister that nothing will be done by regulation to restrict the existing rights of any electors under the present law. On behalf of the Opposition I also accept the suggestion for a conference; that is, in relation to all matters incidental to the election that do not involve Government policy.",16
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know yet whether we shall issue new regulations or not; and what I said was that we should issue no regulation without acquainting the House with what was being done.,16
56,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Do I understand the Prime Minister to say that he does not propose to do anything by regulation which will not first be submitted to Parliament ?,16
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What ?,16
58,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I clearly understood the Prime Minister to say that the Government would not by regulation in any way interfere with or limit the rights and privileges of voters under the present law. I now understand the honourable gentleman to qualify that statement, and I wish to know whether that be so or notwhether he qualifies his previous utterance to the extent of saying that any regulation will first be submitted to Parliament.",16
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The statement. I have made will, I hope, be taken with the general statement. I made a little while ago. I am unable to say yet what regulations will be issued. I confess that I have none in my mind, but before speaking definitely I should like to consult the electoral oflicers to see if any regulations are necessary. Whatever regulations are issued I shall do my utmost to see that they do not take away from voters any privileges that they now possess. I suggest to the right honourable member that he should put his question on the business-paper for tomorrow.",16
60,Mr FISHEE,Unknown,This method of interrogation is much the quicker.,16
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know what regulations are in contemplation, but if the right honourable member will wait until tomorrow I shall tell him everything. I have no desire to keep anything back.",16
62,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not wish to trouble the Prime Minister too much, but I ask him to also take into consideration the suggestion made in regard to cooperating with the Opposition in arranging electoral matters as far as is possible and practicable. I have already indicated that I shall be glad to co-operate with the Prime Minister.",16
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am. glad the right honourable gentleman has mentioned that matter further, because when last on my feet there was a point that I overlooked. I should like to consult my right honourable friend as to one or two little Bills which are very necessary and urgent. One of these Bills relates to the powers of Royal Commissions.",16
64,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Le t there be three members of the Cabinet and three members from this side to consult.,16
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thre e 'from each side?,16
66,Mr FISHEK,Unknown,O r one from each side.,16
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I take it that we desire an adequate inquiry into the operations of the Beef Combine, and to that end we must clothe the Commissioner with the powers requisite to a complete investigation. If I remember aright, there is only one clause in the Bill. The other little Bill is the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, which expires so far as the iron bonus is concerned on the 30th June. There will - then remain a balance unexpended; and if there is no objection raised we propose - to introduce a Bill to - enable us to exhaust that money.",16
68,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Is this the only bonus that runs out? Mr JOSEP H OOOK - I tliink it is the only one.,17
69,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There is, I understand, about £9,000 left. Mr .JOSEPH COOK - My information is that the amount is about £10,000. These are the only Bills I can think of, and I should be glad I o have the co-operation of the Leader of the Opposition in putting them through.",17
70,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I - shall be very to co-operate with the Prime Minister the maltter, and 1 remind him that we throughout Australia ? on this side also have two or three littl Bills coming on. ELECTIONFUNDS : - COLLECTION.",17
71,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Has the Honorary M in ister noticed a statement to the effect that a gentleman named Hulyer has come over to Victoria from New South Wales to collect £30 0 to enable a candidate to oppose the Prime Minister? If Mr Hulyer succeeds in getting that £ 3 0 0 , will it be necessary to include it in the 'election expenses of the candidate he has in contemplation ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I think my colleague, the Honorary Minister, ought to allow me to answer this question. I do not know Mr Hulyer personally, though I know of him ; and all I have to say is that I congratulate him on his enterprise. It is certainly very interesting to find Labour enthusiasts touring Australia to collect money.",17
72,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,We have no Sugar Trust 1,17
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"MT . Hulyer is, I think, to be congratulated on his frankness in telling the country that this money is intended to employ paid organizers in my electorate with the object of beating me. Mr Hulyer is certainly very fran k about the matter, and, no doubt, his enthusiasm is to be gauged by the fact that he says'that if I-am beaten he ""will "" stand on his head."" I do not know that he could stand on a better part, for I think it is about the hardest about him.",17
74,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"H as the Honorary Minister taken in to consideration the fact, that at the last election £50 0 was sent from the Liberal Associations in Victoria to assist the candidature of the honourable member for Perth? Purther, has the honourable gentleman made any inquiriesregarding the £4,00 0 odd which, as recently admitted by the Premier of Queensland during a Court case, was sent to that State from Victoria on the occasion of the last election? Is the Honorary Minister endeavouring 'to ascertain how ithat money was <expended ? Mr. JOSEPH COOK : - I do not know that the facts are as stated; but what - are glad Liberals to do when Labour supporters in are collecting al l the funds they can It is well e known that in most of the electorates Labour candidates are now actively engaged in a .fierce political canvass. Why does the honourable member call attention to these things?",17
75,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Because a'tten'tion was called to what is being .done on the opposite side.,17
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There was only some personal reference to myself.,17
77,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,My question had personal reference to the honourable member for Perth. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Then I shall not make - personal reference to other members who are busily canvassing their electorates now at the - expense of the - Australian Workers Union.,17
78,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I should have stopped the first question of this kind that was asked, because such questions do not come with in the category of those that may be allowed, either with or without notice. I hope that no f u r ther questions of the kind wil l be asked, and that only questions relating to the business of which Ministers have control will be put.",17
79,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"T wish to make a personal explanation in regard' to this matter. I remind the honourable member for Kennedy ""that the money to which - he referred was not sent to me, but , as ; he is probably well aware, througJi m'o to the Liberal League of Western Australia, a very different thing. accounted for in the usual way, and the honourable member can, at any time he - likes, see the receipt given for it .

81,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"In view of the statements continually made that many thousands of names have been lef t off the electoral rolls, would it not be a good thing to do what we did last year, that is, to have copies of the rolls hung up in the post-offices for a month before we have a dissolution, so that citizens could see whether their names were enrolled ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I hope that the matter may be considered when I confer with the Leader of the Opposition. Our position is this: We have been granted an immediate dissolution, and anything done in the meantime must have the concurrence of both sides. see no reason why we should not agree together, so that arrangements may be made which will be as perfect as possible. The suggestion of the honourable member is a very important one. ADVICE TO GOVERNOR - GENERA L.",18
82,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I ask the Prime M in ister whether the Attorney-General was called upon to supply to His Excellency the Governor General a certificate similar to that which is supplied in regard to every Bill before it is assented to, or in some otlier form, certifying that the conditions of section 57 of the Constitution had been satisfied? I ask, further, if His Excellency consulted the Attorney General in regard to the conditions of Section 57, and if he obtained any other legal advice ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - My honourable It was friend has asked me questions which I cannot answer. We have done our best as a Government to inform the mind of the Governor General regarding section. 57, and every aspect of the political situation. It was our duty to do that, and we have done it to the best of our ability. NA OFFICER .",18
83,Mr RILEY,SOUTHSYDN EY RETURNIN G,"Can the Honorary Minister give any good reason why the Returning Officer who was appointed for South Sydney has not yet taken up his duties, but is still retained in the Head Office, although hundreds of persons are desirous of enrolling their names, and have no one to instruct them?",18
84,Mr KELLY,SOUTHSYDN EY RETURNIN G,I shall bring the matter under the notice of my honourable colleague who is administering the Electoral Department.,18

87,Mr FALKINER,STRIKING OF NAMESFRO M,"When the Prime Minister confers with the Leader of the Opposition, will he see, not only that I every facility is provided for the enrolment of citizens, but that everything possible is done to strike out names which should not be on the rolls. In many cases whole families living near the boundary of two divisions have their names on the rolls for both?",18
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STRIKING OF NAMESFRO M,"It is as i m portant that the names which should not be on the rolls shall be struck out as that names' which should be there, but are not there, shall be put on.",18
89,Mr FISHER,STRIKING OF NAMESFRO M,"Is the Minister aware that there are in certain families living in Melbourne, who have not changed their place of residence, members supposed to support one political side whose names have been struck off the roll, while, on the other hand, the names of the remaining members have not been struck off? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am not aware of that.",18
90,Mr FISHEE,STRIKING OF NAMESFRO M,I am.,19
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STRIKING OF NAMESFRO M,It is very much to be deplored ENROLMENT CARDS .  200 men are now engaged by the Electoral Department in purging or cleansing the rolls. Will the Prime Minister see that they are furnished with claim cards to give to citizens whom they find have not been enrolled ? The instruction received from Melbourne is that they are not to concern themselves with the putting of names on the rolls.,19
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STRIKING OF NAMESFRO M,I shall look into the matter. I cannot say offhand what should be done. DISPLAY OF WRITTEN ROLLS.,19
93,Mr TUDOR,STRIKING OF NAMESFRO M,"Will the Prime M in ister see that the written roll which is in charge of the Registrar is at his office every day, so that any person desirous of examining it to ascertain whether he is enrolled may do so ? The work of registration has hitherto been done largely by officers of the Postal Department, and, to prevent the Registrars doing electoral work in the ordinary hours of postal business, they are prohibited from bringing the written rolls to the post-offices. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I shall look into the matter, and shall see that everything possible is done to provide facilities for the examination of the rolls. POLLING FACILITIES.  ister see that ample accommodation is provided at all polling places? In the Calare division, particularly in Orange and Cowra, at the last election, there were only two voting compartments in booths where six would not have been sufficient, and a number of persons returned to their homes without recording their votes. Mr JOSE PH COOK - At the last election there was a great deal of congestion, even at the best-regulated booths. That we shall do our best to avoid this time, but it is difficult to provide adequate facilities, because it is impossible to say where absent votes will be polled. It is the polling of these absent votes that creates congestion. I know that last year many persons, after standing out in the cold and rain for some time, returned to their homes without recording their votes., We shall try to prevent congestion this time, but it is dimcult to make adequate provision for the polling in every case, because of the present method of recording absent votes.

95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STRIKING OF NAMESFRO M,"The Electoral Officer is placed beyond Ministerial control as to many of the most important functions that he has to perform, and I think that he ought to be. I do not think that any Minister should be able to dictate to him the conditions under which a general election should be conducted. We sliould have a guarantee, if possible, as I think it is, that everything will be done in a fair, upright, aud reasonable way. That guarantee can be given to the public only when the Chief Electoral Officer is entirely beyond the control of auy party, and free from passion, prejudice, or.any other influence of the kind.

I have in my electorate a Returning Officer who tells me that the police can move to take names off the rolls, b ut that they cannot place names on the rolls. I ask the honourable gentleman to make to the Chief Electoral Officer such representations as will lead to every opportunity being given to the police to put on as well as to remove names from the rolls.

NA CASE OF MR . S. SMITH.",22
114,Colonel RYRIE,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"the Minister of Home A f fair s , upon noticeWit h reference to the letter dated 12th May, written by the Resident Engineer, Jervis Bay, to S. Smith, an applicant for employment1. Why was the applicant asked for the name of his union? 2. Was Smith's application subsequently refused ? 3. If so, why? 4. Is it correct, as stated by the honourable member for West Sydney, that the late Government never asked the name of an applicant's union ? 5. Is it correct, as suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney, that every applicant for employment is now asked the name of his union? . 6. Was another painter, of whose name the Minister was made aware by the honourable member for West Sydney on 28th ult., subsequently employed?",22
115,Mr KELLY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low1. Smith was asked for the name of his union, because in his letter to the Resident Engineer, while stating that be was a unionist, he did not state to which of the two unions he belonged. There nre two painters' unions in Sydney. I am informed that there is a federated body registered throughout Australia under the name of the Federated House and Ship Painters Paperhangers and Decorators' Employees of Australasia. A disagreement occurred, and the New South Wales branch then registered under the State Act in the name of the Amalgamated House and Fhip Painters Paperhangers and Decorators' Employees Association of New South Wales. The federated body then formed another branch in New South Wales, which, [ understand, has not yet obtained registration. 2. Yes. -3. Because, in the opinion of the Resident Engineer, his statement of experience was not satisfactory. The reply sent to Smith was on a stereotyped form to the effect that there were no vacancies at present. '4. Under the late Government the Works Branch was instructed to write to or inquire df the Secretary of any Trade Union if any men were required, or if men applied at the office they were asked whether they belonged to a union. 5. No, it is not correct. The Government has no objection to its employees belonging to unions, and throws absolutely no bar in the way of the employment of unionists. The principle of every artisan having an equal opportunity for Government employment is the only innovation it has introduced. An instance of this is the case of the employment of Painter C. York at Jervis Bay mentioned below. 6. The painter in question-C . York-applied for work on 21st April, 1914, nineteen days before S. Smith applied, and, as his statement of experience was satisfactory, he was employed. When applying he did not state WORKS. whether or not he belonged to a union, and the Resident Engineer did not ask him before employment whether he was a unionist. Painter York took up work, and has continued to work to date. He was not asked whether he belonged to a union until the matter was referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney. It has now been ascertained that York has been a unionist for 15 years. CONFERENCE OF PARTIES .",22

130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,What is it exactly that you want to know?,23
131,Mr FISHER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I want the text of the communication made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government to the Governor General, and the actual words of the reply of His Excellency.",23
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [8.3] - I shall so far accommodate my right honourable friend as to deal with the inatter at this stage. It is a very unusual thing.,23
133,Mr FISHER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,It is an unusual procedure.,23
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"It is an iinusual procedure, and under ordinary circumstances the Government would be forced to seriously consider whether it Yass. would permit its policy and course of conduct to be dictated by the Opposition. However, I waive that objection now. My 3 reply to the right honourable gentleman is this: I advised His Excellency the Governor General, in accordance with the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution, to dissolve simultaneously the Senate f and the House of Representatives. I assured him that the requirements of the Constitution had been complied with. I pointed out to him the almost equal numbers in the House of Representatives and pro- the small number supporting the Government in the Senate. I pointed out that in consequence the Parliament was unworkable, that it was impossible to manage efficiently the public business, and that, in my opinion, a dissolution of both Houses should be granted. His Excellency's reply was to accede to my re; quest, and to grant an immediate simultaneous dissolution, on. condition that a definite assurance was given that the financial position was such that adequate provision could be made for carrying on the Public Service during the period of time covered by the elections. In reply to that, I reminded His Excellency that adequate provision existed for Supply to the 30th June, and that I proposed, with His Excellency's peimission, to inform Parliament of His Excellency's decision, and to at once ask Parliament to make provision for Supply to cover the election. I also told him that I did not propose to invite the House to do business other than Supply, and that as soon as this was granted we should recommend him to prorogue Parliament immediately and proceed at Once to the elections. His Excellency gave mc the desired permission to inform Parliament of his decision to dissolve both Houses, and to prorogue Parliament as soon as adequate provision for Supply had been made.",23
135,Mr MATHEWS,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,The Prime Minister did not state the conditions attached when he announced the Governor General's decision.,24
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I have His Excellency's permission to say that this Statement, contains practically all that took place between us as to these matters.",24
137,Mr MATHEWS,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,The honourable gentleman did not tell us that His Excellency had made that condition.,24
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I have left out no important word even; I have, as far as possible, adhered to the text of the correspondence - that has passed between us.",24
139,Mr FENTON,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Why not give us the original documents?,24
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"For the simple reason that I regard the conversations ancl correspondence between the Government and His Excellency the Governor General, and especially that between the Prime Minister and the Governor General) as, in their very nature, secret and confident ini. The House may take my assurance that it is now in full possession, in every particular, of the decision of His Excellency. No material fact, and no material word, have been omitted from my statement. I make that assertion solemnly to the House.",24
141,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"West Sydney) [8.7]. - The Prime Minister has given what he assures us is au exact statement of what has taken place between him and His Excellency the Governor General; but we have not heard any of the reasons which must have been supplied to the Governor General to induce him to take the gravest step yet taken in the history of the Commonwealth. Surely it is not too much to ask for the memorandum which, we understand, was sent to His Excellency, setting forth the constitutional and other grounds for a dissolution of the two Houses. The Prime Minister says that his relations with the Governor General are confidential. It is no doubt proper and necessary that these sliould be confidential ; but this is a matter which touches Parliament vitally. Parliament has rights, and is surely entitled to the fullest information concerning the reasons which induced the Governor General to grant a double dissolution. Before the Governor General agreed to do this, ho must have required something more than the mere assurance of the Prime Minister that the requirements of section 57 of the Constitution had been fulfilled. The Prime Minister's statement on this particular point is meagre to the point of vacuity. A ll he tells us is that he advised His Excellency, in accordance with the provisions of section 57, to dissolve simultaneously the Senate ancl the House of Representatives, and that he assured His Excellency that the requirements of the Constitution had been complied with. But surely this is not all! No Governor General will assent to any Bill until he has received a certificate signed by the Attorney-General that it has been passed by both Houses, and that there are no reasons why he should not assent thereto. Are we to assume that the Governor General was satisfied, without some definite legal assurance to that effect, that the requirements of section 57 of the Constitution, so far as the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was concerned, wore fulfilled. Being a layman, he must have had recourse to legal advice, and to whom would he go for it but to the Attorney-General? Surely a bare statement by the Prime Minister that the conditions of section 57 had been complied with would not suffice to satisfy His Excellency, without precedent, legal training, or even knowledge of the facts to guide him? The Prime Minister says that he does not propose to furnish to the House a copy of the memorandum suggesting reasons why the Governor General should dissolve Parliament. He says these should be regarded as confidential. Let me remind him that it has been the practice to publish memoranda of this kind. In the Votes and Proceedings of tlic Yictorian Legislative Assembly are to be found various memoranda submitted to Governors, givingreasonsfor the dissolution - of the State Parliament. Keith, in Responsible Government' in the Dominions, gives many such cases. Not only has the head of a Government supplied Parliament with the reasons which he furbished to a Governor for a course that he desired to be taken, but Governors have been called upon to furnish, and have furnished, memoranda of the kind. I am unable, on the spur of the moment, to quote particular cases; but every one knows the outcry in the press of Australia, so recently as the other day, when, the Governor of Tasmania having refused .a dissolution to Mr Solomon, and having then granted it to Mr Earle, the correspondence between him and Mr Solomon was not forthcoming, having been destroyed, or, at any rate, not being .on the, file. It is surely suggestive as. showing how widely the attitude of the press in that case differs from its present attitude. In any case, the question of whether or not the publication of such correspondence is sanctioned by precedent is not yery much to the point. It is not so much whether it has been done as whether it ought to be done. The dissolution of the Senate is itself without precedent. For - we have to remember that the Senate is an integral part of the Constitution. It has rights co-ordinate with those of this branch of the Legislature'. It acted strictly in accordance with those rights, and for doing so it is to be dissolved. We want to know why. We have a right to know. The Treasurer has furnished the House and the country with admirable reasons why that course should not have been pursued. Had he, instead of the honourable member for Parramatta, been at the head of the Government, the Senate would not have been dissolved.",24
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I do not say that.,25
143,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I have not at hand the right honourable member's excellent reasons', but some of my honourable friends will put them before the House.",25
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Le t us have them.,25
145,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Section 57 was drafted to meet a real dead-lock on national questions. I call attention to the fact that the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was introduced with the deliberate purpose of creating a deadlock. The Bill does not deal with a vital question, it deals with a dead one. The thing it proposes to do has been already done. Yet the Senate has been dis 7 solved. It is most material, therefore, that we should have the recital of the facts put before the Governor General in order that we may know whether His Excellency was correctly informed as to what the facts were. I am perfectly persuaded that on an imj>artial review of section 57 no Court would say that the Senate ought to be dissolved in such circumstances. Let me put this to the Attorney-General: Supposing he had to argue before a Court-if such a thing were possible-whethe r the action of the Governor General was or was not constitutional, would he, for one moment, expect the Court to believe that, uuder section 57, the Senate, which was created as the foundation of the Federal system, must be dissolved because it had thrown out a petty measure that it was invited to throw out? No Court would so hold. It is, consequently, most material that we should know the terms of the memorandum to the Governor General in order that we and the country may learn whether His Excellency has been correctly advised in this matter. In the very nature of things, His Excellency could not be familiar with the facts, except upon information given to him by his Advisers. He had not the advantage of being a resident here for any length of time, and of knowing the facts first hand. He had to take everything as it was stated to him. It is clear that when it is to the advantage of a party that the Senate shall be dissolved, and when it is the avowed intention of that party to create a dead-lock which will technically satisfy section 57, the reasons, which that party furnished to His Excellency in support of the request for a double dissolution should be available to the Parliament. I hope that the Prime Minister will furnish us with those reasons. If he declines to do so, we must assume that they will not bear public examination. If they were sound, if they will bear examination, why should he hesitate to lay them on the table, and to let us see what they are? The provisions of section 57 have been abused in order that party interests may be served. The scope of section 57 is qualified by other sections of the Constitution. The Constitution as a whole must be looked at. The section cannot be taken as standing by itself. It hasreference to the Senate, and to the powers of the Senate under, the Constitution. It has reference not to a deadlock created by one party to serve a party interest, but to a dead-lock between two branches of the Legislature: the one representing the States, and the otlier the people as such. It has reference to a real dead-lock-a n actual stoppage of public business. But i u this case there is no dead-lock, no stoppage. On the contrary, indeed; for no sooner had the Government Preference Prohibition Bill been rejected than proposed legislation was showered on .'the table. fewer than five Bills, I think, were introduced after the summary jection of this measure by the Senate a second time. How could there be a dead-lock when it was proposed to go on with all this legislation? It was not until the so-called dead-lock bad been reached-and reached by deliberately withholding and blocking necessary legislation-that the Government commenced to go on with the work of legislating in the interests of the country. % How could there be a dead-lock in such circumstances? And how could the Governor General-, if he was supplied with a full and detailed statement of the facts,, say that a dead-lock within the meaning of section 57 had been reached ? In these circumstances, it is obvious that this Parliament has a right to see the reasons submitted to His Excellency. We shall want something more than a mere capitulation about the practice being to treat all communications with His Excellency as confidential, or ""any other mediaeval doctrine, to satisfy us. We want to see the reasons themselves. I hope that the Gbvernment will supply us with those reasons. I hope that the Attorney General will enable us to understand the extent to which his advice was sought, and the nature of that advice. These things are very material. We must suppose, in view of the difficulty that a layman feels in the face of section 57, that neither the Governor General nor the Prime Minister was capable of giving a satisfactory interpretation to it , and I hesitate to believe that the Governor General would have acted if it had not been upon the advice and the assurance, in writing, of the Attorney-General himself. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-At torney-General) [8.24] - The honourable member for West Sydney has put forward what I believe to be an entirely new view of the relation of Cabinet Ministers to the Governor General. He has stated the proposition that upon the demand, of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Ministers, who, on taking office, enter into relations of the most absolute confidence, and subscribe to the oath ofsecrecy' as to every communication that is made, are bound to tell the House the substance and the exact details of the advice which they have tendered to. the Governor General. That is a position which has never been put forward in any repreNo sentative House in the British Dominions. reMr WEST - We have not had a double dissolution before. "" Mr W . H . IRVINE - No ; and probably the honourable member does not want one now. The honourable member for West Sydney has also said-and it seems to me to be a very remarkable position for a lawyer, and especially for one who has occupied the position of Attorney-General in a Federal Government to take up-that there must have been a certificate by the Attorney-General upon which the Governor General acted.' The honourable gentleman has probably in mind the fact that before any Bill which passes this Parliament receives the Royal assent, through the Governor General, His Excellency must receive a certificate from the Attorney-General.",25
146,Mr FISHER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Hear , hear! Mr W . H . IRVINE - E very one knows that. But what has it to do with the exercise of the Governor General's discretion in granting or refusing a double dissolution? We have listened to a vast amount of criticism with regard, to the meaning of section 57 of the Constitution, and, in the interests of getting on with at least some business, we have refrained for the most part from answering it . The latest criticism of this kind is a statement by the honourable member for West Sydney, which appeared in the press yesterday, and which, I take it , was communicated by the honourable member himself. It is not the report of a speech, but a deliberate, carefully prepared statement by the honourable member as to the position of the Governor General, and of the Government, when dealing with questions arising under section 57 of the Constitution. When I read that statement, I was filled with amazement.",26
147,Mr ARTHUR,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"No doubt. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I shall tell honourable member why. I was surprised not merely that a man who possessed long political experience should have put such divisions. sentiments on paper, but that a man who had occupied the position of Attorneyto State rights? General could have dealt with this inatter in the way in which I am going to show the honourable member dealt with it . shall read only those passages which late to this particular matter. The first one. of these passages in this remarkable stateSydney ment isThe Senate has been dissolved improperly. It did nothing that it was not entitled under the Constitution. It was, in fact, charged by the Constitution to do the very thing it did do. . . . The Senate acted within its constitutional rights. If it did there is no need for a Senate, and it ought be abolished forthwithListen to thisThe question is, Was the Senate under Constitution within its rights in rejecting measure ? Now is that the question ?",26
148,Mr FISHEK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The honourable member says "" Yes . "" Mr W . H . IRVINE - The Senate was absolutely within its constitutional rights in the most explicit way, pointed to the in rejecting that or any other measure, and the Governor General is absolutely great within his constitutional rights in giving effect to the position that arises upon rejection. I must remind honourable stitution, to financial issues. members of one important fact. who have read the reports of the debates at the Convention will know that the vision embodied i u clause 57, for enabling, in certain circumstances, both Houses of the Parliament, which was then being created, to be sent to the electors, was condition which formed part of a general bargain between the larger and the a "" put-up "" case. smaller States. Without it , the larger States, as appears from every page of report of the debates at the Convention, would not for a moment have assented to the principle of equal representation i the Senate. It was stipulated as a conrights dition upou the riglit of equal represenmeasure tation in the Senate being given that if , as was inevitable, certain difficulties arose argument ? between the two Houses, thus differently constituted, there should be an appeal from those differences to the electors he reiterates it right through. by both Houses. That was embodied in the Constitution for the pose of giving a constitutional appeal to this House, which represents the whole of the people, against the decision of a under the House rejecting its advice, which represents the people, not according to numerical proportions, but according to State",27
149,Mr WEST,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Does that not apply only Mr W . H . IRVINE - We have had I many arguments put forward from the reother side, and here is an entirely new The honourable member for East says that this is only intended to be brought into operation in cases relating to State rights. In other words, the to do honourable member's contention is that in the one case in which the Senate was given the right to protect State interests not, its decision can be overruled; but in all to other cases, which do not apply to the protection of State interests, its decision cannot be overruled. Another argument the put forward by one of the leaders of the this Labour party in another place was that this section related only to financial measures.",27
150,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Not only to financial measures. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Senato r Pearce, / collocation of this section, and argued at length, and most specifically, that it was intended to apply, and only did apply its on a proper interpretation of the ConWe have Those not heard a word of that argument in this House. Now the argument put forward proby the honourable member for West Sydney is that the section never can be applied in cases where the Senate is acting a with in its constitutional rights.",27
151,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"It cannot be applied to Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable the member said that as long as the Senate is acting within its constitutional rights this section can never apply. The Senate n is always acting within' its constitutional in agreeing to, or rejecting, any sent up by this House.",27
152,Mr AETHUK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Is that the gist of his Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member starts with that argument, and I shall read again what the honourable member express purfor West Sydney saidThe Senate has been dissolved improperly. It did nothing that it was hot entitled to "" do the Constitution. It was in fact charged by the Constitution to do the very thing it did do. . . . The question is: Was the Senate, under the Constitution, within its rights in rejecting this measure? A little lower down he refers to a supposed analogy, on which he presumes that advice was tendered to H is Excellency, between the powers and basis of the House of Lords and the Senate.",27
153,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Is that the first letter, or the second one? In the first he argued the other way. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not know. I have read only the one. The honourable member for West Sydney went on to point outThis point needs special emphasis. There seems to be good reason for the opinion that in the present case this fact has been ignored, or has been ingeniously glozed over by the legal advisers to the Crown. What right had the honourable member to say that? He knew nothing. He did not know whether the legal adviser of the Government had given any advice to the Governor-GeneralA supposed analogy between the powers and basis of the House of Lords and the Senate, and of those reasons which afford sufficient grounds for granting a single dissolution, have apparently been considered sufficient, but the rights and liabilities of the Senate are determined, not by the traditional ,relationship between the Commons and Lords of Great Britain, nor by expediency, but by the terms of a written document. The honourable member's argument is that it is entirely false and wrong to suppose the same principles to apply in the granting of a double dissolution under this section as had been applied in connection with a dissolution of the House of Commons. But I find that no longer ago than the 17th A p r i l , 1914, the same honourable member, speaking on the Addressin-Reply, said thisSection 57 was passed to deal with deadlocks legitimately arising on great questions between the Houses. As to the position of the Governor General in this regard, my contention is that, as to a double dissolution, the Governor General will be guided by exactly the same reasons as in an ordinary dissolution in the Lower House. The honourable member had forgotten his own argument when he rushed into print with an entirely new one. ter he went on to sayAnd this must be interpreted according to its spirit, and always with the presumption that, as the Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senate, so any doubts as to the powers of the Governor General under section 57 must be resolved in favour of that presumption, and so against a dissolution of the Senate. As to the question of expediency, the same may be said. What does that mean? I will read it again, and show how I read it , and I challenge the honourable member to say whether his argument can bear any other construction. And thisreferring to the written document or Constitutionmust be interpreted according to its spirit, and always with the presumptionWhat presumption? that as the Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senate, so any doubts as to the powers of the Governor General under section 57 must be resolve.1 in favour of that presumptionthe presumption that the Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senateand so against a dissolution of the Senate. That entirely confirms the view which the honourable member put forward before, that so long as the Senate is acting within its constitutional rights, there can be no double dissolution.",28
154,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I say that under those circumstances there can be no double dissolution. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member says that whenever the Senate is exercising its constitutional rights there can be no double dissolution. I am not going to take up time with this matter, nor am I going into the so-called merits which occupy the last portion of the honourable member's argument. But in one place he saysiThe discretion of the King's representative as to the dissolution of the lower House is unfettered. The Constitution does not bind bim in any way. He may accept or reject any advice without other consideration than the public welfare and traditional practice. But with a double dissolution the position is quite different. The honourable member said less than a month ago that the position is exactly the same in the case of a double dissolution as in the case of single dissolution. His argument now is that, although the Governor General has discretion to act in In the lat- dependently of the advice of his Ministers in granting a single dissolution, in the case of a double dissolution the case is quite different, and he is bound to act on the advice of his Ministers.",28
155,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I did not say anything of the sort. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What the honourable member says isThe discretion of the King's representative as to the dissolution of the lower House is unfettered. The Constitution does not bind him in any way. The honourable member says that the Governor General has only to consider the public welfare and traditional practice. Then he saysBut with a double dissolution the position is quite different. What conclusions are we to draw from that?,28
156,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I say that in connection with a double dissolution the Governor General must first be satisfied that the conditions of section 57 have been complied with.,29
157,Mr WH IRVINE,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The honourable member continuedFor advice upon the legal position lie must go to the Attorney-General, without whose certificate he assents to no Bill. For unless that be so, the question of whether it is expedient-expedient , I mean, in the interests of the people, not in the interests of partyto dissolve does not arise. That is the position of the Governor General' under the Constitution. I ask the honourable member to say whether he is quite ingenuous with the House and the country in making the statement, in connection with this Bill , that it is the duty of the Governor General to obtain the certificate of the Attorney-General before he assents to a Bill , and to allow it to be implied that the same considerations apply to a request for a double dissolution.",29
158,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I did not same things."" But the Governor General must look to the Attorney-General for advice. Look at section '58 of the Constitution.",29
159,Mr WH IRVINE,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"On e honourable member says he has been told this, and other honourable members say they have been led to believe that, but the real fact is that honourable members on the other side have been so long fed by their legal advisers with a kind of constitutional soothing syrup that when they suddenly awaken from their slumber, and find this horrible thing facing them, they are not quite masters of their intelligence. The honourable member for West Sydney has invited my attention to section 58 of the Constitution, which saysWhen a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to this Constitution, that he assents'in the Queen's name or that he withholds assent, or that he reserves the law for the Queen's pleasure. The Governor General may return to the House in which it originated any proposed law so presented to him, and may transmit therewith any amendment which he may recommend, and the Houses may deal with the recommendation. What on earth has that to do with it?",29
160,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"It shows, and it is the : practice, that before the Governor General signs any.proposed law the At torney-General must give him a certificate that he may safely do so. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Everybod y knows that, and the honourable member in his official capacity has signed many such certificates, just as I have. I would remind the honourable member that those signatures are given to Bills which have passed both Houses, and because they have passed both Houses, the Governor General is entitled to the advice of the Attorney-General as to whether he is at liberty to give assent to them at once. The position we are now considering is not with regard to a Bill that has passed both Houses, but as to a Bill that has passed only one House, and to which assent coujd not be given under any circumstances.",29
161,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Does the honourable member say that under section 57 the Governor General would not accept from the Attorney-General an assurance of some sort that that section has been complied with? say "" the Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member's statement, that a legal certificate is required from the Attorney General before the Governor General can exercise his power under section 57, is absolutely removed from the situation, and has nothing to do with it .",29
162,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Sho w us the memorandum. Mr W . H .

But I will tell the honourable member that I am perfectly prepared to say that every condition required by section 57 has been fulfilled. ' The honourable member cannot point to anything in the section that has not been fulfilled. The whole position rests on this-the Constitution has given to this House, as the popular Chamber, and to the majority of the members of this House, as an inalienable right, the power to challenge, under section 57, the right of the other House to reject the Government Preference Prohibition Bill. Under its constitutional powers, the other House is entitled to reject any measure it chooses, subject to this-that this House, acting through the Ministry, which has the confidence of the majority in it, can ask the Governor General to appeal from that decision of the Senate to the people of the Commonwealth.",29
163,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Sectio n 57 deals with dead-locks. Will the Attorney-General say that he gave to His Excellency the assurance that this is a bond fide deadlock? Mr W. H . IBVINE - I am not going to say one word about His Excellency; but I tell the honourable member that this* is an absolutely bona fide dead-lock. An essential part of the policy of the Government was to put an end to that system of spoils to the victors which his Government initiated. If we had not, as one of our very first acts registered, as far as we were capable, in this House, placed it beyond the power of any Government to do that again, we would have been guilty of an absolute betrayal of the trust we were given.",30

Does the honourable member talk of spoils to the victors in connection with the retainer he now holds? Does he tell the country that, while the Commonwealth is in conflict with a company that may cost us tens of thousands of pounds, he is receiving his salary as Attorney-General, and yet is so tied, because he is in the hands of this company, that he dare not give the Government advice in regard to the matter? Yet we have the honourable member coming down here talking about spoils to the victors. We know that, even as late as a few days ago, a unionist applied for a position, but was turned off because he was a unionist.",30
165,Mr KELLY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,That statement is untrue. [74],30
166,Mr SPEAKER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I ask the Honorary Minister to withdraw that remark.,30
167,Mr KELLY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The statement of the honourable member for Kennedy is absolutely without foundation, as has been proved in the House already. However, I withdraw the remark.",30
168,Mr SPEAKER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I ask honourable members on both sides to endeavour to restrain their impetuosity in regard to interjections, because one interjection leads to another, and at once results in creating disorder. I can only keep control with the assistance of honourable members. I , therefore, call upon honourable members on both sides to support the Chair in trying to preserve order.",30
169,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I still repeat the statement that two letters were sent to the Department, and that the man who declared himself a non-unionist was taken on.",30
170,Mr KELLY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,That is not correct. They were both unionists.,30
171,Mr SPEAKER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,A moment ago I asked honourable members to refrain from interjecting. I shall name the next honourable member who does not cease interjecting when called to order.,30
172,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I still maintain that the interpretation placed upon the letters read by the honourable member for West Sydney was correct, in spite of any attempt to cover up the matter. I ask honourable members who talk about spoils to the victors to mention any particular case where Liberals have been in power in which positions have been given to their opponents. Not only have I seen hundreds of justices of the peace created for political purposes, but I have also known all these positions given to political supporters time after time. The Attorney-General should be the last to talk of spoils to the victors. But I did not rise to speak on that matter. Had it not been for the honourable member introducing it, I would not have said what I have. I wish to speak on another matter. . The action of the Prime Minister has led to the discussion to-night. On Priday he came down to the House, and, in the midst of cheers of honourable members on the other side of the Chamber, he gave a garbled statement which was quite contrary to that he has made today.",30
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I rise to order. Is ib in order for the honourable member to say that I made a garbled statement to the House? His remark is offensive.,30
174,Mr SPEAKER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"As the Prime M in ister regards the remark of the honourable member as offensive, I ask the honourable member to withdraw it .",31
175,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I have nothing to withdraw.,31
176,Mr SPEAKER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The honourable member knows that it is the custom when an honourable member regards an epithet or a statement referring to him as offensive it is withdrawn, even if the remark, taken by itself, is apparently not offensive.",31
177,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I withdraw the remark, but the Prime Minister came down to the House and made a statement which was totally at variance with the statement that he has made here tonight.",31
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I did not.,31
179,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"This is what the honourable member told the House on FridayA day or two ago I tendered certain advice to His Excellency the Governor General, which he has been pleased to accept, and I have to announce to the House that His Excellency has decided to dissolve simultaneously both Houses of the Parliament so soon as the ordinary provision has been made for the conduct or the Public Service during the time of the elections. It did not appear from that statement that there was a condition attached. The statement the Prime Minister has made to-night is that the Governor General attached conditions to the granting of a double dissolution, and that was the part which the Prime Minister tried to conceal from the House on Friday. knbwn exactly what the Governor General did say-and we understood at the time that the Prime Minister was reading from a document- it is quite possible that many of the things that have been said in relation to the action of the Governor General would not have been uttered. Now we find that the Governor General laid down certain conditions. These are that the Government must obtain Supply before a double dissolution will be granted.",31
180,Mr JH CATTS,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,In both Houses.,31
181,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The Government are in a nice position. They have dered certain advice for a double dissolution, and the Governor General has laid down certain qualifications to the granting of that double dissolution, and if the Senate refuse to give the necessary Supply, if there is any honour left among - Ministers, the only course they w i ll have is to resign from their positions at once.",31
182,Mr FENTON,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Jo e Cook will never do that.,31
183,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I quite agree - with the honourable member. If Supply is not granted, there will be another insult meted out to the Government, and I have not the slightest doubt they will pocket it just as they have done in other cases ever since they have been in office. Another remarkable thing has been disclosed. The honourable member wishes to know what is the procedure in these matters. I can tell the Attorney-General that in the very State from which he comes, Victoria, the whole of the correspondence that took place between Sir Thomas Bent and Sir Thomas Gibson-Ca'rmichael was published. It is therefore idle for the Attorney General to say that what took place between the Governor General and the head of the Government is sacred, and should not be published. The greatest child in political matters knows that there are more books than one can carry out of a library setting forth reasons why certain Governors have given certain decisions. It is a common thing for such matters to be published from time to time, yet the Attorney-General tells us that it is a sacred thing that ought not to be touched, and that the advice given by the Attorney-General should not be made known.",31
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I have never said Had we any such thing. This is all imagination.,31
185,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The Attorney General said that these matters should not be made public, and that they were sacred, and that he would not make them public. He said that he had taken an oath of secrecy, and all that sort of thing. Let me tell the Attorney-General that, day after day, the press pointed out that the cause of his absence from the Chamber was that he was preparing the document that was to be presented to the Governor General setting forth the case for a double dissolution. The honourable member has told us to-night that every phase of the ten- question in relation to section 57 has been placed by him before the Governor General.

189,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"It is true that the Government have done it , but knows better than the Prime that it is not a creditable thing",32
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Why not ?,32
191,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The member knows that his great leader in New South Wales at one time, Sir Henry Parkes, when he found that he had a majority of only four, said that it was sufficient with which to carry vernment, and resigned.",32

193,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"When my leader will found that there was a majority of one against him, he took the only honourable course lef t to him, and that was to in his resignation. The honourable member and for Parramatta was sent for, and with formation of his Government a Speaker had to be appointed, which left honour the able members practically evenly divided. it There was an honourable course for honourable member to follow, and that was, the moment he found he could not carry on business, to tender his resignation tion, or ask the Governor General to solve this Chamber. Had that been done, and the present Government had come [ 7 4 ] -* back to power, I do not hesitate to say that, under the circumstances, the Senate would have been compelled to make certain compromises- to back down in many instances in relation to measures sent from this House.",32
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Who would compel them ?,32
195,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Neve r mind. When the Senate refused to pass legislation, then would have been the time for the Government to ask for a double dissolution. To-day there is an overwhelming majority on one side in the Senate, and if there is any trouble now, it is not caused by either House, but by the people of the country. I u my opinion, had the Prime Minister followed the course I have suggested, a dissolution of this Chamber would have been granted, and we would have known exactly where we were.",32
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,It would have meant a double dissolution later.,32

Personally, I do not care whether Bill be passed or not, because means absolutely nothing. Tothe night the Attorney-General has endeavoured 'to show that what the Convention had in mind when framing the Constituwas a dead-lock between the two disHouses in a merely casual way. I do not hesitate to say, however, that any one who reads the Convention debates on this section must come to the conclusion that it was never meant that one party or the other should create dead-locks. Mr Wise, in the Convention, moved an amendment that there should be a single dissolution instead of a double one, Sir Edmund Barton pointed out that the only likely cause of a dead-lock had been removed by the Constitution, inasmuch as "" t a c k in g "" by the House of Representatives was debarred, while the Senate was prohibited from initiating money Bills.",32
201,Mr ATKINSON,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Si r Edmund Barton was wrong, for a dead-lock has come about in another way.",33
202,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The dead-lock has come about in exactly the way that was pointed out by the present Treasurer at the Convention.

Knowing, as we do, that the Constitution of the United Barton saidStates of America has been used for the purposes foreign to the intentions of its frawars, you may depend upon it that as time goes every possible device will be used to gain political influence and power by taking vantage of the form of the Constitution. The right honourable gentleman not only foretold the present position-whic h he denounced then, though he is in favour the step now proposed by the Governproperly ment",33

When Mr MCDONALD - Howeve r that may be, the right honourable gentleman went on to sayWhat will happen under the proposal for a dual dissolution ? A measure will pass the Lower House, we will say, without any difficulty, and it will go to the Upper House. In that chamber there is a great discussion about it. The newspapers favourable to the Government will at once begin to threaten the Upper House that if they do not pass the measure they will be dissolved. While they are considering the measure a pistol will be held at their head. Is that the sort of Constitution we want to create in this country? Is that what we desire?-that the Upper House sbould be coerced at the beginning-that it should be told, "" If you do not pass this measure in the way that we have passed it, you will be dissolved.""

During the same debate in the Federal Convention, Sir Edmund "" Dead-lock "" is not a term which is strictly applicable to_ any case except that in which on the constitutional machine is prevented from properly working. I am in very grave doubt adwhether the term can be strictly applied to any case except the stoppage of legislative machinery arising out of conflict upon the finances of the country. A stoppage which arises on any matter of ordinary legislation, of because the two Houses cannot come to an agreement at first, is not a thing which is designated by the term "" dead-lock ""These are the words of the leader of the Convention- "" Australia's noblest son,"" as I am reminded-wh o was thought so he much of that he was made first Prime Minister, and was afterwards given a seat on. the Bench of the High Court.

It is only when the fuel of the machine of government is withhesitatingly, held that the machine of government comes to a stop, and that fuel is money. It will be seen that Sir Edmund Barton took the point that there is no dead-lock until the whole machinery of government has been stopped, and that this can be brought about only by the stoppage of Supply-the very view to which the At torney-General to-night took such strong exception. I do not attempt to question the legal knowledge of the Attorney General, but I refer him to the words of Sir Edmund Barton. The present situation has been brought about by means of a measure of no importance, whether it be passed or rejected, because the Government have already declared that there shall be no preference to unionists. No one accused honourable members opposite of favoring preference to unionists. What, then, was the need for an Act of Parliament to prohibit it? Was it necessary to assure the country of the views of the Liberal party on the subject? Was it thought that the people did not believe Liberal members wben they said that they did not favour preference? Or did honourable members desire to advertise themselves, and to pass the measure as a monument to their wonderful intelligence? This is what Sir Will i a m MCMillan said, speaking at the ConventionI do say that if you create any machinery which, under the guise of settling dead-locks, will really be used to create dead-locks, you will strike a blow absolutely at the power and dignity of the Senate. Sir George Turner also expressed himself in this wayI am quite in accord with those who say that we are not to allow one House to dominate the other unless we know that particular House has the people at its back, and that in endeavouring to force certain views upon the other Chamber, that House is simply carrying out what is really the will and desire of the people of the Federation. Sir Josiah Symon, referring to the double dissolution, saidIf it exercises that function, you are to it credit for honesty and bona, fides. If it is still out of harmony with the Lower House, let the Lower House go to their constituents with whom the Upper House says the House of Kepresentatives was not in harmony. If the members of the House of Representatives come back from their constituents with the mandate for that particular piece of legislation, this Senate, like every otber Second Chamber, will be bound to give"" way. If the Senate does not give way, then I say, at once and unsend it to its constituencies.",33

209,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The mandate of the people would have been recognised. In Victoria, a measure dealing with the franchise was rejected by the Upper House nearly a dozen times, and the legislation of the Lower Houses has been similarly treated by Upper Houses in all the States. But do we hear the Liberals advocate the dissolution of the Legislative Councils of the Parliaments of the States? No . Liberals do not do that, because these Councils are composed of men of their own way of thinking politically; of representatives of vested interests. Their members are the landed proprietors, and big capitalists, against whom the members of the Liberal party have not the courage to say a word, because it is they who support the party, and give to its members their political significance. But while Liberals are not prepared to attack the Legislative Councils for opposing the w i ll of the Lower Houses of the State Parliaments, they are very ready to attack the Senate for opposing the will of this House. That is because the Senate represents the working classes of Australia. The one desire of honourable members opposite is to strengthen their party by hook or by crook. I do not find f a u l t with them for that, but they had no right to drag in the Governor General, and to give bring Federal politics into the political mire by violating every constitutional principle and right. The Prime Minister told us on Friday last that the Governor General had granted the double dissolution-. At the time we were not very clear what was meant. It was not u n t i l we got the Hansard report that we knew exactly what the Prime Minister had said. Now that there is likely to be a noise, and there will be a pretty big noise about this matter, the Prime Minister has consented to give us further information concerning the decision of the Governor General.",34
210,Mr RODGERS,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,You are climbing down. You stated that had you known the conditions you would not have had anything to say.,35
211,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I said that had we known the conditions it is probable that certain statements which had been made concerning the Governor General would not have been made. It appeared to me and to other honourable members on Friday last that the Government had merely asked for the double dissolution, and that it had been granted. Now we find that the Governor General imposed certain conditions. If the Senate refuses Supply, what will the Government do?",35
212,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"There is a constitutional way of meeting the difficulty, but it is one to be taken only in extreme cases.",35
213,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"We have known that course to be taken, and afterwards those responsible have gone down on their bended knees to the new Government begging them, to introduce an Indemnity Bill . That happened when Lord Chelmsford was Governor of Queensland. Government resigned, and a certain gentleman was sent for, who formed a new Government, and its Ministers were duly sworu. The Premier then asked for Supply, but the Opposition refused to give it . Then what was done ? The Government induced the Governor of Queensland to sign an Executive minute granting them a large sum of money to enable them to carry on over the elections. Having done that, their first act was to create 300 odd justices of the peace to go round the country and canvass votes for them. But in spite of the struggle which they made to uphold the action of the Governor, the people ""turned them down by an overwhelming majority, and with the advent of the Kidston Government to power we witnessed the humiliating spectacle of their predecessors having to ask for an Indemnity Bill to cover their i l - correspondence? legal acts.",35
214,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,There is another way oub of the difficulty.,35
215,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Is that the proposal of the honourable member for Werriwa ? Does he suggest that the Governor General ought not to have imposed a condition in regard to the granting of a double dissolution-the condition that Parliament will be dissolved only in the event of Supply being granted ? Do I understand the honourable member to in fer that the Governor General will grant a double dissolution even if Supply be not granted ?,35
216,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,I make no suggestion of the kind.,35
217,Mr HUGHES,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,What does the honourable member mean then ?,35
218,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"If the honourable member did not mean that when he suggested that there was a way out of the difficulty, what did he mean ? Let me tell him that if the Governor General attempted anything of that character, he would be the sorriest man in Australia.",35
219,Mr SPEAKER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I ask the honourable member not to drag the name of the Governor General into this debate, in such a way, and especially to refrain from making statements that imply, if , indeed, they are not actual, threats. It is a most improper thing to do, and I cannot permit that sort of thing to be done.",35
220,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I do not hesitate to say that to save the whole situation which has been created, and to stop the statements which otherwise will be made A from the public platforms of this country, the first thing which the Governmenb should do is to bring down the exact document which was presented to the Governor General, so that we may know exactly where we stand. Such a step would clear the political atmosphere very materially. We would then know the position that we occupy, the position occupied by the Senate, and also by the country. Until that has been done, there is bound to remain a certain amount of suspicion. I wish to know whether the Attorney General prepared a document setting out the reasons why a double dissolution should be granted, and sent it on to the Governor General. The Prime Minister in his statement admitted that there was other correspondence which he does not feel it would be proper for him to disclose. What is the reason for withholding that Is it that there was something placed before the Governordeneral which was not exactly as it should be, and which would have a tendency to mislead him ? Or is it that the - Government do not intend to allow their reasons to be placed before the public? Are those reasons of such a shaky character that they are afraid to let the public know what they are? I very much regret that the Ministry have not given us full and complete information in regard this matter. We want - it , and the sooner we get it the better it will be for all concerned. At the - earliest possible moment, the Ministry should place before us the whole of the correspondence which has passed between them and His Excellency the - Governor General upou this question. There is no reason why that course should not be followed. I hold in my hand the Votes and Proceedings for the 1909 session of the Victorian Parliament, in which the whole of the correspondence between the Governor of this State at that time-Si r Thomas Gibson Carmichaelwas published. I merely cite this fact as an argument in support of my contention that the correspondence between the present Government and the Governor General in regard to the request of the Prime Minister for a double dissolution is not sacred. Why was it necessary to publish the documents to which I have referred ? For exactly the same reasons as operate in the present circumstances.",35
221,Sir JOHN FORREST,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"They were published at the time, but only after the must resign. elections, when a new Government came into office.",36

It was because of these statements and of the odium which attached to vernor that it was deemed necessary to publish the documents in question. I not hesitate to say that the present istry should follow a similar course, and publish the whole of the correspondence in regard to this matter, so that the Governor General may be relieved of the odium which has been cast upon him.",36

224,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Exactly , and I say to that those kindergarten politicians are to be found in the Senate. I did not for a moment believe that when the test measures were sent to the other Chamber they would be sent to a body of men who were so unacquainted with our written Constitution that they could not see clearly that a double dissolution would be granted if those measures were rejected a second time. But the position was so absolutely clear that fifteen years ago the prediction was made by the present Treasurer as to what would happen in such circumstances. Now that that prediction has been fulfilled, the members of another place seem to be quite unaware of the discussions which took place in the Federal Convention at the time section 57 of our Constitution was being framed. The right honourable member said that only a technical difference would be required between the two Houses, and then if advice was tendered by the Prime Minister for the time being to the Governor General to grant a double dissolution, either that advice not must be accepted or the Prime Minister In the latter case there would be an abdication of the powers of members of this House at the dictation of I am sure if the boot were on the other foot honourable memA t the bers opposite would not argue that posiI cannot conceive of of there being twenty-nine Liberal senators so destitute of common sense as to act in the way that the present Senate has acted, but if there had been twentyH e nine Liberal senators who had acted in for the same unconstitutional way",36
225,Mr SPEAKER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Order ! I must ask the honourable member not to reflect on the Go the members of the Senate.,36
226,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"When in the Convendo tion it was said that the Senate would M in - have the power of throwing out measures, even if they had been made a test questiou between the two Houses, even the representatives of the smaller States at the Convention never thought the day would come when senators would act in that peculiar fashion. I do not wish to make any reflection on the want of intelligence of honourable senators; perhaps they acted according to their fullest lights, but nobody will say that those lights were very wise ones. they seem rather comparable with the foolish virgins. The Attorney-General quoted from the statement of the honourable member for West Sydney that appeared in the papers last Saturday. he had only read the same honourable member's utterance that appeared the day before he would have seen how the honourable member himself foresaw that a situation had been created in which, in his opinion, the Governor General could grant a double dissolution. He did not go so far as to say whether he should, or should not, but on the day before he knew whether a dissolution was to take place or not, he uttered the following wordsEither Mr Cook does not understand the position of the Ministry created by the recent summary rejection of the Preference Prohibition Bill, or, understanding, he is ignoring it. But it is a position that cannot and will not be ignored. It calls for action, and that immediately. Let me state the position shortly. The idea that the Parliament can go on with the threat of a double dissolution hanging perpetually over its head is unthinkable. It is also absurd. Section 57 provides a solution for dead-locks. The principle underlying the section is that the legislative machine having been brought to a standstill by disagreement between the two Houses upon some matter of such grave importance as to make further progress impossible, a double dissolution may, if His Excellency pleases, be granted. The essence of the whole tiling is that, lation being impossible, an appeal to the electors must follow. He then went on to say that, if Mr Cook liked to delay, the position would be entirely changed, and addedThe provisions of section 57 having been technically satisfied-(1 do not even admit this)-the Government may ask for a double dissolution. True, they may ask; but only if they do so at once. Did uot the Government do so at once ? Are they not accused now of doing it at once? He went on to sayAnd on this point there can bo no doubt at all. The situation having been created, it must be nt once resolved one way or another. Inaction is fatal in the matter. I quite agree witn the honourable memberBut in the meantime the right to ask for a double dissolution on the first test Bill is Mr Conroy. lost. And such a position is in accord with common sense. Time is the essence of the contract. Even if Parliament would allow Mr Cook to hold this threat over its head indefinitely, the section would not allow it. And here are very important words, utI n fact, tered after careful consideration by an honourable member who has just given us a dissertation the other wayTherefore, either Mr Cook must summon up enough courage to ask for a double AbIf solution at once, or must for ever hold his peace. That statement by the honourable member was a complete answer to his letter of the following day. He has refuted his argument out of his own mouth. When honourable members opposite cheered - the other day on hearing that a double dissolution had been granted, it appears now it was only a sham cheer-anothe r instance of bluff. I did not want to hear it , and I confess that I did not cheer. When they cheered I really began to wonder how many sensible men there were in the House except myself. If a body of men are in such a state of mental confusion that they do not even know the plain words of the Constitution, and act in such a manner as to force a double dissolution, it does not lie in the mouths of members on the other side, or in another place, to complain of it when they get it . They asked for it , and now they are howling because they have got it. They do not like the taste of it .",36
227,Mr WEST,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Who brought in the Bill ?,37
228,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"This side brought it in. I admit that I was one of those who suggested that some such proposal should legis- be brought forward ; but I went much further. I suggested that the test should be not only as to preference in the Government service, but as to preference anywhere-in the Courts or otherwise. I hold that no Parliament has the right, under laws, to grant preference to any citizen, but that every citizen ought to be able to go before the High Court of justice of his country, as Parliament should be, and get a fair field and no favour. That principle is being entirely departed from . The provision I suggested ran as follows:Notwithstanding anything contained in the Arbitration Act, no Court or Judge shall grant preference to any citizen or class of citizens. That was plain, short, and simple; but, with a consideration for the feelings of members opposite which seemed to me at the time to be very weak, the Ministry met them more than half-way. first brought forward the ordinary business, and some time afterwards brought forward the Bill , saying, "" We will put this so mildly that even the most extreme man amongst them can accept it if he likes. If the Senate intends to let us do any business at all, surely it will accept a mild proposal of this sort."" The Bill absolutely tested the sincerity of honourable members opposite as to whether they intended to allow any legislation to go through. Honourable members on the other side had boasted that they would take advantage of their numerical major it y in the Senate, and not allow legislation to go through. We tried the Bill in this House first, and it was soon plain that there was no intention to let legislation go on. A mil d and moderate Bill , providing that no preference should be granted in the Government service was brought for w a r d ; but the other side sidered it so important that they discussed it day and night. Although one or two of them said it was not a serious Bill , the opinion of nine out of every ten in the party was against that view. They considered it so serious that they continued to discuss it for day after day, and week after week. It was sent up to another place, which summarily rejected it . It was brought forward again this session, passed by this House, and again sent up to another place, where it was rejected without a moment's consideration. It was treated in the way in which we were told Labour senators would treat all legislation brought forward by the Liberal party. In the circumstances, what other course was open to our party but to ask for a double dissolution ? Every requirement of section 57 of the Constitution had been complied with. We had the opinion of the honourable member for West Sydney, who was Attorney-General in the Labour Government-a n opinion given as late as Priday last-that everything had been done to create the required situation under section 57. I cannot understand how the honourable member was able tonight to go back upon that expression of opinion, unless it was that he thought thab the public would remember only the last and not the first statement made by him on the question, or that they would not imagine that any public man would be so lost to what was due to himself as They to say one thing one day and something quite different a day or two later. He also thought, perhaps, that the speech which he delivered to-night would be published in Hansard, and read by thousands who would not see his first statement as published in the Melbourne newspapers.",37
229,Mr WEBSTER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,The same statement was published in the Sydney press.,38
230,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Then I am still more surprised at the audacity of the honourable member for West Sydney. He would seem to be more indifferent as to what he says than I at first imagined him to be. The honourable member for Kennedy, another member of the Labour party, has pointed out that this situation was foreseen years ago. Surely, in the circumstances, everything has been done to justify the granting of a double dissolution. Let us test the situation by changing the position of parties. If there con- were twenty-nine Liberal senators, whilst the Labour party had a majority of one in this House, does any one imagine for a moment that in the event'of the Senate twice rejecting legislation passed by this House, and the right honourable member for Wide Bay advising the Governor General to grant a double dissolution, his advice would not be followed. There is no doubt about the matter. The position of the Prime Minister for the time being, no doubt, is made all-powerful, but I have not heard of any case in which advice tendered to the Governor General by the late Ministry was rejected. They cannot quote an instance. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Kennedy, who has occupied the position of Speaker, advocating the publication of all documents. He would not do that as between members of a Cabinet.",38
231,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,They are doing it .,38
232,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Some people steal, but that is no reason why every one should do so.",38
233,Mr WEBSTER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Some men rave, but that is no reason why we should all do so.",38
234,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"I agree with the honourable member that some men do. That is why we get so tired of him. No M in ister would dream of publishing correspondence as between himself and the rest of the Cabinet without the consent of every member of that Cabinet. There is not one instance in which the correspondence between the Governor General and the Government for the time being has been published. In 1904, Mr J. C. Watson, the first Labour Prime Minister, advised His Excellency to grant a single dissolution, but he never dreamt of publishing the correspondence. 1909, when the right honourable member  a dissolution, he did not of publishing the correspondence which passed between himself and the Governor General. What is more, no one on this side had the bad taste to suggest that the parliamentary procedure which had so long been followed should be departed from by the publication of the correspondence. There must be absolute confidence between the Governor General and the Government, and between the Governors of the various States and the State Cabinets. They must be allowed to speak together freely, and without fear of repetition.",38
235,Mr WEST,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,What nonsense!,39
236,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The honourable member would apply very strong names to any one who sought his advice in secret, and then, without his authority, published the advice which he gave. much more important is it that the same rule should apply in respect of the public life of the country ? I have given instances where two Labour Prime Ministers applied for a dissolution, and did not supply the House with any information as to the facts which they put before the Governor General.",39
237,Mr BURNS,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,Were they asked to supply it?,39
238,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Of course not. Honourable members on this side believed that the Labour Ministry would know what was due to themselves and to their own position in the matter. I am surprised at the very great lengths to which the Prime Minister has gone to-night in giving information as to what transpired between the Governor General and the Government. It ought to have been quite sufficient for him to state that he had advised Hi s Excellency to grant a double dissolution, and that that advice Was accepted.",39
239,Mr MCDONALD,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,But it was not; conditions were imposed.,39
240,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,We are told that His Excellency accepted his advice subject to Parliament granting the necessary Supply.,39
241,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"The Prime Minister told His Excellency that he would ask the House for Supply, and His Excellency was satisfied.",39
242,Mr CONROY,UNIONISTS ON PUBLI C,"Quite so. If blame Again, in is to be attached to any one it must belaid at the door of the Prime Minister for going further than any previousdream Prime Minister-certainl y further than any member of the Labour party has evergone-in supplying information to this House. He is responsible for the advice given, and must accept the blame for it, if there is any blame to be attached to it - The honourable member for West Sydney has admitted that section 57 had been full y complied with. If the position had been the other way about - if the Liberals had been in the majority in the Senate, and the Labour party had had a majority of one in this House, would not honourable members opposite have said that the Governor General was acting as a partisan if in similar circumstances he refused a request for a double dissolution ? And they would have had some ground for such a statement. What becomes of the bold utterances on the part of honourable members on the How other side, and in another place, too, that they were anxious by every means in the i r power to obtain a dissolution? Is it trueall those utterances were made with a view to deceive the electors? Is it true that the members of the Labour party distrust the good sense of the people, and do not now want to go before the country ? Quite recently they were ranting and raving to us about the good sense of the people; but now it appears that they arerather fearful of an appeal to the people,, and if I am a judge of public opinon,. judgment will be passed upon the unscrupulous opposition they have shown rothe Liberal party proceeding with its legislation on very much more f r u it f u l and sounder lines. Do not let us hear again from honourable members these fearsome grumbles against having to face a double dissolution. The request has been granted, and nothing can get over that fact. We have to make the best of the position. The best course for honourable members on the other side is not to go about attacking any person who is incapable of replying, not to commit what I call a wanton act of that sort, but to behave as mento admit that they have got what they sought, or pretended to seek, and not to cry out now and to confess to the peoplethat they were shamming the whole time and did not think that the gun was loaded. I ask my honourable friends oppomarkable site to be "" s p o r t s "" in. the matter, put on a bold front , even if they do not quite feel it , at least to have the appearfor ance of courage, even if their hearts sunk and they have to pick them up of their boots.",39
