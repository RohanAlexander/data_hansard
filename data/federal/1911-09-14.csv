GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S ADDRESS - IN - REPL Y. Debate resumed from 13th September operation (vide page 42.3), on motion by Mr order BRENNANThat the Address-in-Heply to Hi s Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to the House.",15
20,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Fremantle) [2.42] When we adjourned last night I was dealing with the reference in the Governor General's Speech to the passing of the Navigation Bill., and I suggested that the Inter-State Commission should first be appointed, in order that that measure might be properly administered. Section 98 of the'Constitution provides that the power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State, and it seems to me therefore that we shall be putting the cart before the horse, in passing a Navigation Bill before the Government have appointed the Inter-State Commission for which the Constitution provides, to deal with all matters relating to navigation. We have in section 100 of the Constitution a further reference to trade and commerce, that section declaring that the - Commonwealth shall not by any law or - regulation of 'trade and commerce abridge the right of a State to the reasonable use of .the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation. These subjects have to be dealt with by the power that deals with trade and commerce, and while the Ministry have been asking for new powers, the fact Destares us in the face that many things have been left undone that ought to have been the done by the Commonwealth. We are told in His Excellency's Speech that the exactions of trusts make an extension of Commonwealth power imperative. I can hardly to understand the Attorney-General agreeing to the inclusion of that paragraph in the New Speech, having regard to the views expressed by him in an article which he cono r m s tributed to a Sydney daily newspaper. o r m at i o n In that article he wroteIt is not only illogical and unfair to complain about the Trusts; it is also very foolish. .For the Trust is really a .labour-saving device, and most effective. The anti-Socialist who. wishes to destroy Trusts is .like the old Luddites who wished to destroy machinery. The early trades unionists f e l l into the vulgar - error of regarding machinery as a device of the Evil One, which ought to be destroyed. They have now learned better; they no longer seek to destroy machinery, but to control .it. But the antiSocialist is still a troglodyte in this matter. He wants to club the Trust. Yet the Trust or combine is not merely a labour-saving device, and SPEECH : the best ;and latest at that, but it marks a notable epoch in the history of production and of civilization. The central ideas of the combine are coand systematization. It substitutes for chaos and combination for competition. It takes cognizance of factors utterly ignored by the old barbaric ways of cut-throat competition. by These being the opinions of. the Attorney General, surely any proposal on the part of the Government to interfere with, or injure in any way, trusts and combines must be contrary to his idea of what ought to be done. The paragraph I have just read from the article written by the honourable gentleman was quoted by the Barrier Miner, and in commenting upon it and upon his reply to a leading article appearing in itscolumns, that newspaper- a friendly critic, as it points out, of the honourable member's indiscretion, and more disposed to shield than to expose his weakness-doe s not .hesitate to describe as a distinct untruth his denial that he was ever against trusts. In a pamphlet dealing with"" the subject we find this commentWe should not be inclined to call it more than an unconsciously biased misrepresentationof fact; but could certainly quote dozens of extracts from Mr Hughes' speeches on hisreferenda proposals which would simply blow his claim to consistency out of the water. Of course, we cannot tell what Mr Hughes meant to say, but what he did say over and over againwas in very startling contradiction to the statements contained in his article. We are not particularly concerned, however, .with, this aspect of the matter;.nor to show, as the.Barrier Miner easily does, that the second extract from his article, which Mr Hughes triumphantly quotes, in no way really qualifies his previous eulogy on trusts and combines. The baselessness of Mr Hughes' claim to consistency is ruthlessly - exposed by the Barrier Miner. Surely the Attorney-General brought, his party into disrepute during the referenda campaign, seeing that he then publicly ad? vocated proposals to deal with trusts monopolies that were altogether foreign co the opinions expressed by him in articles - contributed to the Sydney newspapers. exposing the Attorney-General, the Barrier Miner has done a great service to the Comis monwealth. That newspaper stated that it had only refrained from exposing him - before ,the referenda was taken because really held the position of a Labour jourwas Mai. It. felt, however, that it must expose him as scon as the vote was taken, since, Labour of 14,770. although he held the exalted position of Acting Prime Minister, it could not put up with his - inconsistencies. Therefore the proposition to deal with trusts surely cannot have been inserted upon the advice of the Attorney-General. One would almost think it was necessary to obtain his advice before any action was taken. Regret is expressed at the result of the referenda, but why regret? The Labour party practically asked for a vote of confidence in their platform from people, and they did not get it. They instead, a vote of confidence in the Liberals. The Prime Minister, as he left Australia, sent a final message to the people worded somewhat in this way: "" The people's wish will prevail."" It did prevail, and hope it will again if such propositions put forward. It is stated in the speech that "" Important measures for the welfare - of the people of the .Commonwealth will submitted for your consideration."" sume that had the referenda been carried, the words "" for the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth "" would have been left out, because certainly measures might bers. have been submitted that would not have been for the people's welfare. An alteration of the Electoral Act is foreshadowed, presentation. and I claim that that Act requires very grave alteration. While the readjustment - of the boundaries of many is highly necessary, no stronger argument for a move in that direction could put forward than the figures published the Age of n t h October, 1910, in an sis of the voting at the last Federal tions. That paper, which was then a supporter of the Labour party, said boldly that the Electoral Act had hopelessly being broken down.",15
21,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Did the honourable' member say that the Age was a supporter of the Labour party ?,16
22,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Certainl y it was at that time, but when it analyzed the position of things, it went the other way, beand cause it saw it was barking up the wrong tree, and that in the end the Liberal party must come to the front. I rather, admire In the pluck of the present Ministry in proposing to revise the Electoral Act, which at present the most unsatisfactory measure in existence in the Commonwealth. According to the Age, the total number of it votes cast for Labour in New South Wales 259,630, and the total for other candidates was 244,860, or a majority for Yet in New South Wales the Labour party had seven members more than the other party. In Victoria, on the other hand, where the Liberal party had twelve members and the Labour party only ten, it took a majority of 40,413 votes to put those two extra members in. In Queensland the Labour party has six members and the Liberals three, but the number of votes polled by the Labour party over the number polled by the other side was only 4,861. Adding the majorities polled the in New South Wales to those polled, in got, Queensland, we get a total majority of 19,000 odd, returning no fewer than ten members to this House, yet in Victoria it took a majority of over 40,000 votes to put in two members for the Liberal party. I Surely the Electoral Act requires alteraare tion if such results obtain on the aggregate voting. In Western Australia, the most thinly-populated State of the Combe monwealth, it took 15,012 votes to put Sir I preJohn Forrest in for Swan; yet, in New South Wales, the most thickly-populated State, 14,000 odd voters put in seven mem",16
23,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It proves unequal re get equal representation before long, and of the divisions out he will go.",16
24,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That will not worry be me so much as it will some of those gentleby men who are getting a living at the game.. analyThe Age, summing up the position, said, elecspeaking of the Labour partyIn the whole of Australia they polled only a minority of votes, the small surplus of 2,26a against the Labour party. That is a very extraordinary state of things. No one can contemplate the facts without feeling that our electoral machinery has hopelessly broken down. It is therefore very nearly time that the machinery was altered or repaired. I hope some better system of recording votes will be introduced, and that the divisions will be so altered that equal representation may be obtained. It seems ajmost impossible to secure anything like reasonable representation under the present system, which should, in fairness to all parties, be altered. I hope we shall be able to arrive this session at a system more equitable to the people of the Commonwealth. There is also a paragraph in the speech regarding the question of life, fire, unemployment, and invalidity insurance. I think it will probably be best to leave life insurance alone, but I am certain that fire insurance had better be left alone. I am not so much against State life insurance as I am against State fire insurance. Some one asked me once on the platform why I was against State fire insurance, and my answer was that I had never known an employer or any one else who would purposely injure an employd or any other person; but we have heard of smart gentlemen who would realise on tlieir assets if they thought their demands would be met by the State. In this connection I heard a good story the other day that may be new to honourable members. A fire had occurred in a large building, and one of a group of gentlemen who were discussing it suggested that it was caused by a gas light on the top floor. A second gentleman ventured the opinion that it was caused by an incandescent light on the second floor; but the owner of the building said he was almost convinced that it was caused by an Israelite on the ground floor. Such a story as that indicates very good reason for rejecting this fire insurance proposal. I have before insisted that it is absolutely necessary to appoint an Inter-State Commission ; and my opinion is borne out by an article written by one of the leading legal authorities of Australia. The article, in my opinion, proves conclusively that the Government of the Commonwealth cannot be carried on unless an Inter-State Commission is appointed. The writer saysOne of the main ends of union is to insure that trade and intercourse throughout the Commonwealth should be absolutely free and untrammelled. . . . . The power thus to act as the guardian of inter-State trade and intercourse is given by the Constitution in the widest terms. It is involved in the power "" to make laws with respect to trade and commerce amongst the States."" . . . It may be that powers will be conferred upon it respecting navigation and Mr Hedges. shipping, particularly the navigation of interState rivers, and, beyond doubt, it will be endowed with the fullest powers, judicial and administrative, in respect of inter-State trade and intercourse upon railways throughout the Commonwealth. The latter powers are of more immediate and practical interest, and with them only I propose to deal in this article. Let me now answer a question which is likely to be put at this point. Why should not the enforcement of the right of the citizen of the Commonwealth in these matters be left to the ordinary Federal 1 judicial tribunals? Why should it not be left to the Federal Courts to decide in any case whether a railway rate, or charge, or regulation is in contravention of the laws of the Commonwealth? The answer is plain. Experience has shown that a Judge, no matter how high his qualifications, and whether sitting with or without a jury, is an exceedingly unsatisfactory tribunal for the decision of such matters. Expert knowledge in the management of railway traffic, in the local conditions of different parts of the country, in the statistics of trade and produce; expert knowledge immediately and at all times available is essential to satisfactory dealing with such cases. Not only so, but there is necessity for a body with administrative as well as judicial functions. . . . But with its great authority and knowledge, and its large discretion in dealing with rates judiciary, it may well force an agreement between State railways upon a reasonable system of Inter-State rates. I should like honourable members to notice this part of the articleSo, also, in regard to the adoption of a uniform gauge, the traffic arrangement under Commonwealth control for the mobilization of the Commonwealth Forces and other railway matters of Australian concern, such a body cannot fail in exercising a potent influence in bringing about agreement and harmony in the working of the State railway systems. If the experience of England and America is, as it undoubtedly has been, in favour of the permanent expert judicial and administrative body, rather than the merely judicial tribunal, how necessary it is that we should profit by that experience in the conditions obtaining in Australia. That clearly proves that in advocating the appointment of an Inter-State Commission I am supported by one of the highest legal authorities in this country. But the Australian Inter-State Commission will have to investigate and decide upon the validity of rates, charges, and regulations, not only in their trade and business aspectsIt will be seen that it is contemplated that the Commission will have to deal with trade and business. but from other points of view arising out of the position which our State-owned railways have hitherto occupied as factors of State policy. Then againIndeed, the more the subject is considered the more evident it becomes that the Inter-State Commission must contain within itself expert knowledge of a high order in railway and trade matters, and in the condition of Australian manufacture and production, and that it must also contain within itself judicial experience and attainments which will command the confidence of Australia. The Constitution has recognised the importance of the work of the Commission by the status which it has given its members. They are to be appointed by the Governor General in Council. The appointment of an Inter-State Commission should be regarded seriously. We are entering into all kinds of schemes, including the building of railways to connect with the State railways; and in the administration there will be required expert knowledge, which, in my opinion, is not at present available by this or any other Government. With the writer of the article I believe that a fixed body would administer these matters in a manner creditable to the country. The present haphazard way of dealing with intricate problems, for which experience and high class professional knowledge is required, must result in disaster. We ought to obtain the best men available for the Commission, and put them in a position to deal with the commercial and other questions which must arise, before any serious steps are taken to obtain uniformity of gauge on our railways. They should be provided with a proper engineering staff, and a staff of metallurgical chemists, with advisory boards. In fact, they should be able, on touching a button, to produce any kind of knowledge required for the efficient discharge of their duties. The Inter-State Commission should be a body beyond reproach, to which Parliament could refer at any time for information on any subject connected with trade and commerce; and trade and commerce, we must realise, embraces all means of communication and transit. The framers of the Constitution being of the opinion that the Commonwealth could not be managed properly without the appointment of an Inter-State Commission, it is merely muddling along to continue from year to year without appointing it. This is not a party question. The Commission was to be part of the machinery of government, and it has been shown that many of the functions of the Federal Government cannot be exercised without it. Had it been established when it should have been, many powers would have been readily granted to the Federation. such matters as the establishment of a uniform hall mark the States would have been pleased to give the Commonwealth full jurisdiction.",16
25,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Who is the high legal authority of whom the honourable member spoke?,18
26,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I referred to opinions expressed in a paper by "" R. E. O'Connor, QC, New South Wales, member of the Drafting Committee of the 1897 Federal Convention."" If that gentleman was good enough to be appointed a Justice of the High Court, his opinion on the Constitution of which he was one of the framers is worth reading. In regard to postal administration, I have to complain that we are still very far from uniformity. On two or three occasions I have pointed out that the returns supplied to Parliament by the different States are not uniform. Steps towards uniformity have since been taken, but the returns from New South Wales still differ in form from those from Victoria. I have a word of complaint, too, regarding our position in connection with wireless telegraphy. It was recently stated in the newspapers that the British Admiralty finds it impossible to get into touch with Australia by means of wireless telegraphy. I am pleased to know that an expert has been appointed to deal with the subject, but he should have been appointed before the tenders for wireless stations were advertised. The form of the tender was ludicrous. One could hardly say whether it was a tender form or an offer. There must be something radically wrong in the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department, seeing that money for wireless telegraphy installations was voted by Parliament in 1906, and nothing has been done yet. A monopoly was then given to the Department,. but it has since been handed on to an irresponsible syndicate which has done practically nothing. I should like to know who was responsible for altering the tender form to which I have referred. Tenders were asked for the installation of stations at Sydney and Fremantle, but after the forms had been sent out, intending tenderers were notified that alterations were to be made, and - it was written on the forms in red ink that preference would be given to any system having a distinctive musical note.",18
27,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,It was explained to the honourable member last session that that In provision was inserted at the request of the British Admiralty by my predecessor.,18
28,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The whole thing has been a muddle from the beginning. The only system then possessing a distinctive musical note was the Telefunken system, and some one behind the scenes had sufficient influence to get the tender forms altered in its interests. I fail to see that the British Admiralty was to blame. It was prepared to recommend any system with which its vessels could communicate, and finds now that it cannot communicate with the system which has been adopted.",18
29,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,We are installing two stations from which we shall be able to communicate with the rest of the world.,19
30,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"For years no progress has. been made with the installation. A private individual could within two or three days install at King Island a station which will communicate with Sydney, but the Postmaster-General's Department has been unable in six years to install stations at Sydney and Fremantle. I hope that the expert, who has been appointed will not be hampered by the officers who are responsible for the present muddle.",19
31,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,He will have a free hand.,19
32,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,He should have a free hand. I hope that now things will be pushed ahead.,19
33,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Has the ground been cleared at Freinautle yet?,19
34,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It must have been cleared by constant walking over it. visited the site with the Postmaster-General. We met and conversed with the surveyors on it, and had our photographs taken. Some time afterwards, on my return to Melbourne, I rang up the Department to ask how things were getting on, and wasinformed that the surveyors would take charge within a short time. I ventured tp reply that I had seen them on the ground some weeks before, but I was assured that I must be mistaken. I wonder whether the head office is equally well informed in others matters. If the administration is as bad in matters that we know nothing of as it) has proved itself to be in regard to the installation of wireless graphy, we need a new system. The time has arrived when the Post, Telegraph, and Telephone Departments should be administered by a Commission of four or five or more members. A bank or an insurance - company cannot be governed without permanent heads. It . is absurd to have Uhe management of a big Department like that controlled by the Postmaster-General, subject to continual changes of policy by reason of changes of Government or alterations - of portfolios. I think that the Customs Department should also be controlled by a permanent Board. These big Departments cannot be satisfactorily controlled by Ministers, who possess no> special knowledge. The establishment of the Inter-State Commission should be a step towards better management. In conclusion, I express the hope that the Government are seriously considering the report submitted by Admiral Henderson, and that they will recognise that it is idle to spend money on an Australian Navy until we have provided depots, coaling stations, and so forth, 1 along the coast, as recommended by that officer. To build ships before we have the means for repairing and maintaining them is very like purchasing a horse before you have a stable to put him in. I do not say that every recommendation made by Admiral Henderson should be carried out at once, but all that is essential to the maintenance and upkeep of the vessels now on order at Home should be attended 1 to without delay.",19
35,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"East Sydney) [3.27] - In my opening speech in this House last session, I made what was regarded as a rather strong comment on the practice of debating the Address-in-Reply to the Governor General's Speech, when I saidPersonally, I regard the debate upon the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply as a superfluity, which should be abolished at I the earliest possible moment. In the face of that expression of opinion, some honourable members may think that I am guilty of inconsistency in rising today to address myself to this motion; but in view of the ridiculous position in which certain members of the Opposition have placed themselves before the electors of the country, I cannot resist the temptation to deal very briefly with some of their statements. The openingparagraphs in the Governor General's Speech, dealing with the Prime Minister's visit to the Old Country, and with the work of the Imperial Conference, were referred to at length by the Leader of the Opposition whose retele- marks I carefully followed. I was determined to grasp what he was driving at, and his speech when summed up appeared to me to be nothing more than an expression of very grave doubt as to the loyalty of the people of Australia. If there is one feature more than another of the honourable member's public life that I have always admired, it is his consistency and his attempt at all times to play the part of a big Australian. Australian aspirations have always been uppermost, in hismind, but when we examine the' speech' made by him on the motion now before us, we can come to no other conclusion than that he has serious doubts as to the loyalty of ! the people of the Commonwealth. Let me say at once that I have none. The people of Australia are as loyal as are His Majesty's subjects in any other part of the Empire, and they have emphasized their loyalty on all occasions. When we come to inquire into the origin of the Australian people we find that 93 per cent, of them are British born. Can any honourable member doubt the loyalty of the Irish race? Will not every one admit that they are amongst the most loyal subjects of Great Britain, and that the children of the Irish abroad, up to the third and fourth .generation, are as strong in their loyalty to Ireland as ever their forefathers were? Then again, no one sings more about the bonnie hills of Scotland than do the Scotsmen in Australia, although by the way very few of them go back to Scotland. It cannot be denied that they have a great admiration for their native land, and ""that they would readily come to its help in time of trouble. And so with the Welsh and the English. I never 'have a moment's doubt as to the loyalty of the people of Australia. The Canadian Magazine for July last contains an article written by a Canadian dealing with the education which, the King received in his youth, and the knowledge that he obtained, in his early manhood, of the oversea .Dominions of the Empire. The writer points out that no British monarch has ever had the same opportunities to visit the oversea Dominions as have fallen to the lot of King George, and that he has availed himself of those opportunities to the full. He quotes a paragraph from the work on the cruise of the Bacchante, which is full of meaning, and tends to confirm the views I have enunciatedOur Australian fellow subjects consist of the stoutest, staunchest English, Welsh, Scotch, and Irish men, who are showing at the present time an amount of energy and activity in everything that makes a people great which has never before been surpassed .in the whole course of English history. The writer emphasizes the spirit, aims, and ambitions of Australians. I felb constrained to make these remarks on the question of loyalty, believing that the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, suggesting as it did some sort of disloyalty on the part of the people of Australia, - should not be allowed to go forth without a protest. It seems to me that Parliament has reason to congratulate itself - on the fact that - during 'the life of the present Government we have had no complaints as to its administrative ability. ""We all recognise that it is the duty of an Opposition to play the part of critics, and since no reflections have been cast by it on the administrative abilities of the Government it seems to me that Parliament, and especially the Labour party, has reason to feel well satisfied.",19
36,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Does the honourable member differentiate between administrative ability and administrative acts?,20
37,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"When I have concluded my .speech I shall be pleased to educate - the honourable member, and to give him all the information that is so necessary to make him a useful member of this House. There - being no complaint against the administrative acts of the 'Government, the Ministerial supporters have little to which to reply. I - shall probably be hauled over the coals when I urge that some limitation should be placed on the speeches of honourable members. After all.; however, it is only a' very .small concession to ask, and if the proposition were seriously considered I think that it would soon be conceded. The conclusion has long since been arrived at by public men in other parts of the world that those who make long speeches show that they have failed to marshal their facts. A man who had done so would not be tempted to make long speeches, which, after all, tend only to confuse those who listen to them. Mr MCKenna, First Lord of the Admiralty, in submitting to the British Parliament his Navy proposals, providing for an expenditure of something like £45,000,000 or £50,000,000, had so marshalled his facts that he was able to deal with the whole of them in one hour and a quarter. Contrast this with the speech made last week by the honourable member for North Sydney. Some allowance must be made foT the fact that he is a new member; but 'no one can deny that his address'was a'marvellous one. It related almost solely to something done ten or twelve years ago, and to men who had been elected since then three times to the Federal Parliament, and every one of whom had held Ministerial office. The honourable member's address occupied two and a half hours, and the Liberal press thought so much of it that it devoted exactly 2J inches of space to it. Then, again, the honourable member for Pafkes, on Tuesday, spoke for two and three-quarter hours, and, dealing with the 'Imperial Conference, made observations which were in very bad .taste. He ought to know very well that the Imperial Conference is simply a gathering of representatives of the various Dominions ancl the British Government, called to allow of an interchange of views on Imperial questions. The Conference has no executive power; but it may pass solutions expressing the aspirations wishes of the oversea Dominions, and that way may bring the future legislation of the various Dominions into accord, far as possible, with that of Great The fact that the resolutions were down after being debated does not that they had no effect. Our representaof tives gave expression to their opinions, that was all we expected of them. Parliament of an Oversea Dominion would give the Imperial Conference executive power. This is the place in which these questions should be decided, so far as Australia is concerned, and I am equally confident that the British Governarticle ment and the Parliament would refuse delegate their powers to their three or representatives at the Conference. I sider that the honourable member's remarks were made with a view to belittling representatives, but, whatever the object the honourable member had in view, it not be denied that our three delegates That seems very strange. did more to advertise Australia than any previous delegation. They did not go along Pall Mall shaking hands with duchesses, and dukes, and lords, humbugs. They went among the people tering the Territory. and made them understand that in far displaced tant Australia a welcome hand would be held out to them. That is the sort of deleplace, gation that we want. We do not want a few Australians decorated up with feathers in their hats, like peacocks, parading streets of London. We want men to tell the people of. the Old Country about resources, and about the opportunities exist in Australia for those who come to better themselves, lead happier and comfortable lives, and rear families under conditions that are not known in the older world. That is the real object of people of Australia in sending such delegaobtained tions Home, and I am confident that the people of Australia are satisfied that our representatives knew their work, and did well. No other honourable member in this debate has mentioned the Papuan trip. During the recess, I believe most of the members of this Parliament were invited to take a trip to Papua. When the first replies were received, I believe about members accepted. Before I deal with what took place, let me define what I sider to be the duty of a member of Mr West. Federal Parliament. During the recess he ought to see vvhat Australia really is. The people did not elect him simply to travel from his own State to this Parliament, reand to sit on the cushions, and wear them or out. They expected him to see what Ausin tralia really is. Very few members know anything of Australia as a whole, as and I believe some members of the Britain. House were actually not aware that turned the Federal Parliament had control mean of Papua. I know there are thousands people in Australia who had no idea and that Papua is a Territory of the ComNo monwealth. In every recess, the members of this Parliament should travel beyond their own States, and be educated as to the all real, wants and interests of Australia. I understand that after the first list of members was made, out for the Papuan trip an appeared in the Age calling the Goto vernment very strongly to account for the four project. I believe the Leader of the Opconposition was prevented by business from getting away, but, at any rate, as soon as our he withdrew his name, the list dwindled down until finally not a member from the canother side of the House made the trip. I can assure them that those who didgo had a very good time, and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. We were shown over Papua in a and manner that did credit to those adminisEvery facility was in our way, in order that we might secure all the knowledge possible about the and every official in Papua rendered every service he could to us. Whoever appointed the administrative staff, I honestly the believe that they appointed men who are thoroughly capable, and understand their our duties towards the Territory and its that people. The administration, so far as we here could see it, was humane from top to more bottom. I look forward to the time when the Possession will be of great value, and I am sure that all of us who went there the will be glad to place the knowledge we on the trip at the disposal of any Government which desires to legislate for the benefit of Papua. I hope that kind of it excursion will be continued in every recess for the benefit of honourable members, and of Australia itself. The Leader of the Opposition informs me that he did not accept the invitation to make the trip to Papua, and that if his name was on the list fifty it was a mistake. If that is so, I gladly make the correction. We have conhad a great deal of trouble in connection the with the Public Service Act. I have nothing to say against the Public Service Commisssioner, because I realise the difficulties of his position; but I hope the Government will alter the Act. One matter that I should like to see attended to in any amendment is the abolition of the classification. There is too much discrepancy between the wages in the General Division and tjhe Clerical Division, and between the opportunities' offered in the two divisions for rising in die Service. This applies particularly to the Postal Service. If a man enters the Public Service as a mechanic, I do not see why he should be prevented from rising; but those in the General Division have not the same chances as those who do clerical work in the Clerical Division. Since the present Government came into power the minimum wage at the age of twenty-one has been raised to £ 1 16 a year. Let me illustrate my point by tihe case of two brothers, one of whom, with an aptitude for mechanics, enters the General Division, and the other the Clerical Division. The one who enters the General Division finds that it will take him seventeen years-it used to be nineteen years, but it is regarded as a great concession the period has been reduced to seventeen -^before he can receive £ 1 5 0 a year._ The man in the Clerical Division receives £116 a year at the age of twenty-one, and in four years rises to £ 1 6 0 a year. This is part of an old system that has been handed down to us for many years, by which those who follow clerical occupations seem to get priority in the making of any appointment. The only qualification necessary seems to be that they do not dirty their clothes. Apparently, as soon as a man soils his hands with any kind of tool, he is placed in an invidious position. I do not think that sort of thing ought to obtain. I have been at the Postmaster-General over this matter for some time, but I can get no redress, because the Act requires altering. In Sydney, there is one branch of the service in which tliere are eighty-five ployes, and the authorities say that there Ls no clerical work done in it. To my knowledge, however, shorthand work is done in it, plans and diagrams are drawn out, and other clerical work is done, and yet the men are kept in the General Division. That is not right. If the men are doing clerical work, and only getting General Division pay, they have good grounds for complaint, and are justified in asking for redress, j trust that the Government will give us an opportunity of amending the Public Service Act this session. The honourable member for Richmond referred last night to the remarks made by the Prime Minister at Brisbane. The honourable member, I understand, told us that the Prime Minister in the course of that speech said that the desire of the Government was that the Commonwealth Parliament should be given the same powers as those exercised by the State Parliaments. If that be so, I do not see how the honourable member for Richmond could find any fault with the remark, because it was always understood that, in regard to the powers handed over to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth should be as free to exercise them as had hitherto been the States. Under the State Constitutions, the State Parliaments may do whatever they like for the good government of the people, and there is nothing to prevent a State nationalizing even a fish-shop, an oyster-shop, or any other business. The Federal powers, however, are by no means so extensive, as was well shown in the case of the Seamen's Compensation Act and the recent case of the boot trade. Some that honourable members of this Chamber, during the referenda campaign, made some very silly remarks when addressing the people; and I think it ill became them to cast contempt and ridicule on the proposal. The object of every member who went throughout the country on that occasion should have been to educate the people as to what the referenda really meant; and we were told by the Leader of the Opposition and members of his party that the question before the country was not a party one. I do not know whether he was affected by the company he was in, but the Leader of the Opposition told the people, when in Victoria, that everything would be centred at Yass Canberra, and when he was in Sydney he told them that the centre would be Melbourne, which was quite enough to give many persons there a nightmare. Howem- ever, I should like to read to honourable members some of the stuff that was talked to the people of the various States by some of the opponents of the referenda. Miss Grace Watson is, I believe, a fairly intelligent woman, and it seems a pity that her ability should be put to no better use than spreading falsehoods and misrepresenting the position to the Ladies' Liberal League and others. Addressing a meeting of that league at Port Pirie, Miss Watson said If the Referendums are carried you ladies will have Justice Higgins regulating the quantity of sauce you will he allowed to put on your meat and the quantity of lemon peel you put in your cakes. I am sure all you ladies are interested in church work, and if these proposals are passed the Labour unions will allow you to make cakes and sweets for church bazaars. The railways will belong to tliem,. know what the Constitution is. and that will, be very nice for the Labour to go riding round the country, it. You have an early train from Port Pirie, and that is only a convenience for the Labour men. It is altogether too early for us women to use, and we have not been considered in the matter. Then, the honourable member for Wakefield state - and it is a wonder he did not wear his boots out, seeing how much he ran about- time. when addressing the Chamber the other evening had nothing but abuse for perThat sons belonging to trade unions, and of him we readMr R. W. Foster, M.H..R., evidently bad' nightmare at Henley Beach last week. This dress are very presentable. is a specimen of the balderdash he uttered :"" The grouping together of the four questions in one is the biggest confidence trick that has in a somewhat humorous style. ever been palmed off on the people of Australia, and if the Referenda are carried will be a revolution in Australia more and more terrible than that in France century ago.."" That is from a gentleman on the Liberal side, who went out to educate the people of Australia. I did think, however, that the honourable member for Parkes would have shown a little consistency, considering that he cultivates the tone of a gentleman, and is altogether a very superior individual. Outside of this House, however, my opinion of that honourable member is rather small. He told us that he had addressed seven meetings during the campaign; and I say that to every one of these meetings there was a special invitation to ladies; indeed, at three meetings out of the seven only ladies were admitted. In my opinion, one of the reasons that the honourable member Parkes, is returned to this House is that there are to more women than men in his electorate; and I am certain he could not get an audience of males in the city of Sydney to listen quietly to such balderdash and nonsense he talks. An intelligent man could not listen to the honourable member without throwing something at him or leaving the Crown. meeting, or I do not understand what tralians are. When the referenda proposals were before the House the honourable memthe ber raised no opposition to them. The orable member for Flinders on that occafare sion, in reply to the Attorney-General, it would require neither more nor less was asked by the proposals to make the Constitution what it should be, and, as the honourable member for Parkes knew Mr West. can very well that he could not go before a meeting of men without having, that opinion not slung in his face, he had the common sense to talk to women, who did not really At one men of those meetings the honourable member but we pay for for Parkes said I am quite satisfied that if the Federal Labour Party were given full control of affairs we would soon be on the brink of a civil war, because if these political buccaneers get the power in tlieir hands they will rapidly bring about a of affairs that peaceable, quiet, and law abiding men would not stand for any length of break. I am quite sure that something would is the sort of stuff talked by an honourable member who certainly enters this House with a good deal of dignity, and had a whose appearance, manners, and style of Honourable members laugh, but this is a serious matter, although I may be deemed to deal with it It is there hardly credible that a man who possesses bloody the confidence of the electors of the over a National Parliament, should make such speeches. The aimof every honourable member should be to add' dignity to this assembly, and to make his fellow-citizens understand the aims and objects of - the Parliament in which he is a representative. We are told over and over again that the aim of the referenda was party advantage; but, as a fact, the object was to give this Parliament the full power that it was always understood had been taken over from the States. ""At any rate, that was may the opinion of all until the High Court gave what I regard as erroneous decisions, though I cannot blame the High Court, because the Constitution is open to the construction given. The honourable member for however, as I have said, told, women things which he dare not address understanda meeting of men; and we can quite the fear that was put into his audience. I feel that I would be neglecting my duty if I did not call attention to as such conduct on the part of a man,_ who has been repeatedly elected to the highest position short of that of a Minister of the The people of Australia can Ausoffer no better gift than a seat in the. National Parliament. I hope that when referenda are discussed again such nonhonsense will not be talked, but that the welof the nation will be the first consaid sideration. I do not propose to weary the than House, because, as I have already indicated, I am not in favour of this debate on the Address-in-Reply, but the temptation to speak was too great, in view of the statements that have been made from the other side. Some reference has been made to the press, especially in connection with the referenda; and I do not think there ever was such unanimous opposition as was shown by the press during that campaign. Never before, I should say, did the press get so many advertisements, both metropolitan and provincial; and here it may be interesting to consider what the press really is. There are people who imagine that the press is run in the interests of people; but that is the biggest mistake which could be made. If a newspaper is owned by a company it is conducted in the interests of the shareholders, and, if by a proprietor, in the interest of that proprietor alone. Those who run the press are business people. Naturally they serve the side from which they get their emoluments. Those who manage them would be false to their shareholders or to their proprietors if they did not do so. On Saturdays the morning journals are all very big productions, so that you wonder that you get so much for your penny. I have measured up the columns of some of tliem, and find that in a Saturday's edition, the advertisements account for seventeen and a half pages of matter.",20
38,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Is that in the Sydney Morning Herald or the Daily Telegraph?,24
39,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The difference between them does not amount to 3 inches. There is another three pages of what is known in newspaper parlance as scissors stuff, and three and a half pages which are the work of the leader-writers, reporters, and news editor. AH the papers charge 6s. an inch for advertising matter, which is equivalent t 0 £57 I 2 S - VSP> a as o edition brings in £1,008 for advertisements. Carpenters, miners, rouseabouts, and people like that do not advertise or read advertisements, and therefore the conductors of newspapers do not consider them particularly. I have assisted to run a couple of newspapers, and the first thing I have said in each case is, "" We need a smart fellow to get advertisements,"" because it is the advertisements that make a paper. Those who conduct our newspapers opposed the referenda because the press is the biggest monopoly in Australia. I doubt whether the shares of the Sydney Ferries Company have been more watered than those of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, a concern which pays 22J per cent, on its capital, and a reading of its balance sheets suggests that it may put something to reserves for the future advantage of shareholders. All the newspapers are subsidized by the Governments of both the Commonwealth and the States. The postage on newspapers is a tenth of the ordinary letter rate, and the State Governments provide early morning trains for the conveyance of metropolitan newspapers to the country. The newspaper proprietors know that they have a soft thing, and are not going to give it up; hence their antagonism to the referendum proposals. From the the way in which strikes have been referred to during the debate, it might be imagined that there is only one party to a strike, but there must be two, and, in my opinion, the strikers are not more, and sometimes less to blame than the other fellows. We have heard a great deal in the press about what the trades unionists do and say, but let me draw attention to the following statement of a doctor dealing with the strike of medical men in Adelaide, and published by the Melbourne HeraldAny doctors coming here under engagement to the dispensary will be absolutely ostracised, and they will not be allowed in the hospitals, and we shall, of course, refuse to meet them in consultations. I have told my patients that if they are dying I will not attend them in consultation with a dispensary doctor, and we all mean to stick to that. The newspaper adds To put the position more strongly is difficult. But by way of stressing his point, this doctor added : "" We will not touch the dispensary people with a 40-foot pole."" Those are the views of a gentleman who has had the advantages of a college education, and occupies a very different position from that of some honourable members on this side, who have had a hard road to that a Saturday travel, and have educated themselves by their own exertions. Cr. CARTY SALMON - Does not the honourable member approve of the attitude taker* up ?",24
40,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I have the greatest respect for the medical profession. For nineteen years I was secretary to the largest friendly society in New South Wales, and for twenty years I was on the Medical Board of an institution having 16,000 members and 50,000 persons to look after. My opinion is that doctors should be-well paid, but I do not think that language such as I have read will do good. During the debate, much has been said about the sugar strike. On my return from Papua I stopped at Cairns, and made inquiries, which led me to believe that the men had good reason for striking - The business people of Cairns informed me that it would be a good thing for Northern Queensland if the strikers won the day, because if cent wages were given, those engaged in the sugar industry would be likely to make that part of Australia their permanent home, instead of being content to rush up from Melbourne and Sydney and other places in the south merely for the harvesting season, spending elsewhere the money earned in-the district. The men ask for an eight-hours' day, ancl would any honourable member dare to advocate on trie public platform the whom he employs. abolition of the eight-hours' principle?",24
41,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Would any member of the Labour party dare to do so?,25
42,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"No ; because we have had experience of the hardship of working for more than eight hours, and know how social conditions have been improved by the adoption of the eight-hours' day. The shortening of the hours of labour makes for better citizenship. Twenty-five years ago, in the city of Sydney, the men in the baking trade used to work for very long hours. We tried to get for them an eighthours' day, but were opposed by men like the honourable member for Parkes. At the time, I used an illustration which I will use again now. On one occasion a little child came running to its mother in tears. The mother asked, "" What is it, dear child ?"" and the youngster, sobbing, replied, "" Mother, I have seen a man in your bed."" She was told that it was her father. The incident is a forcible illustration of the interference with family life caused by unduly long hours of toil. Honourable, members opposite do not understand, as we do, how necessary it is to have an eighthours' day. From the age of fourteen years until now, I have never known what it is to have a day's rest. When I am in Sydney every night is occupied with attempts for the bettering of some one's condition. The sugar strike will benefit Northern Queensland by establishing there a yeomanry which will settle the land and bring prosperity. In the busy season the men may have to work twelve hours a day, but there will be four hours overtime to be paid for, and the wages then earned will carry them over the slack season. In this matter I share the opinion of the business men and property-owners of Cairns, who no doubt secretly supported the demands of the men. The honourable member for Nepean has referred to the Lithgow strike, and I may say that, together with another unionist, I went to Lithgow in the early days to form a union amongst .the miners there. We found the men working under conditions dethat were anything but creditable to those who were controlling the mines and other industries in the district. After some time, unions were formed, and the conditions of the workers at Lithgow were improved; but I was very sorry to see the local ironworks fall into the hands of Mr Hoskins. I believe him to be a good business man, but he has one fad, and that is that he should be able to do just as he pleases with those He does not care a button for any one save himself. He thinks that he ought to be able to play the part of a Czar or dictator over those whom he employs. Perhaps he cannot help it, but that is really his character, and as long as Mr Hoskins controls the Lithgow ironworks he will want such conditions to prevail. The day for that sort of thing, however, is gone. Those who work in an industry should have a voice in the determination of what their pay and hours of labour shall be. I am one of those who hold that the workers in an industry have just as much right to say what should be done in that industry as the man who owns it. The proprietor of a factory has no more right to say that his men shall work twelve hours a"" day than I have to say to the Opposition, "" You must resign your seats in this Parliament."" If Mr Hoskins had been prepared to bend to reason, no strike would have taken place. He sought, however, to destroy one of the principles of unionism when he dismissed from his employment a man who had attended a meeting as a delegate from his union. Over thirty years ago, I was a representative of the miners in Newcastle at a delegates' meeting, and it has long been the practice when such a meeting is called to allow the delegate from each pit or district to attend it. It is just as necessary that the delegates from the unions should be allowed to attend these meetings as it is that the proprietors should attend meetings of their own-. Mutual understandings can be brought about only by this double combination, and for the safe working and the interests of every industry it is essential that the delegates from the workers' organizations, as well as the proprietors, should meet from time to time to discuss questions affecting them. But because the delegate in question went to such a meeting, Mr Hoskins dismissed him. He had nothing else against him; he' was a good workman, but he was simply told that he was not wanted.",25
43,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Stil l Mr Hoskins reof litigation. ceives the bounty.,26
44,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I am dealing, not with the bounty, but with the strike itself. Some twenty-five years ago, the boilermakers union had a dispute with Mr Hoskins, who then said that he would see the union to a place that I shall not mention. He has consistently held to that attitude from that day to this. The boilermakers union is a powerful organization, and it has never - had a man in the industry outside its ranks save in the case of men employed by Mr. Hoskins. From these facts, honourable members will gather some idea of Mr. Hoskins' disposition, and the manner of man he is to run a great concern like that of the Lithgow ironworks. During the last twenty-five years, we have progressed not only in the production of dollars, but in respect of the conditions of those who produce the dollars. Mr Hoskins, however, says, "" I am going to do just as I have done in years gone by."" He knows that disorganization amongst the men must tend to his advantage, and he views the situation in a purely selfish light. One can come to no other conclusion than that Mr Hoskins is prepared to take all and give nothing. We are promised in the Governor General's Speech that a Bill will be introduced to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and I am sure we shall all endeavour to make that measure as nearly as possible perfect. Every one thought that the original measure would be fully operative; but again and again, when an attempt is made to take advantage of its provisions, a ruling of the High Court declares those particular provisions to be invalid. There is now before the Court a case with which I shall not deal at length, but which has gone on so long i Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member must not discuss that matter.",26
45,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Ver y well, sir. must be something wrong with the Act, or with the machinery under it, when it costs the workers in an industry from £8,000 to £10,000 to bring their case before the Court. It was never the intention of this Parliament that a body of men trying to secure redress should be put to such cost. - Unfortunately, it often happens that, even after all this expense has been incurred, the whole proceedings are declared by the High Court, on appeal, to be null and void. I am sure that the people of Australia are prepared to sanction any legislation that will do away with so expensive a system I am no lover of strikes, and it is a pity that in this intelligent age we cannot devise a means of doing away with them. But all these obstacles in the way of bringing a case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court are largely responsible for the present situation. A union without money cannot attempt to appeal to the Court for redress; and, however much we may be disposed to disagree with strikes, we must admit that, while this state of things lasts, some machinery must be available to the men to protect themselves from the exactions of those who would take from them more than is their fair due. I congratulate the Government on the way in which they have administered the affairs of the country during the recess; and I may say at once that I am very pleased with the effect of the progressive land tax. I am confident that if we should be so unfortunate as to be removed from office twenty years hence, there will be no attempt on the part of our successors to repeal the Land Tax Act. I was recently given an illustration of the benefits of the Act in a direction that is probably new to some honourable members. The illustration shows that the tax has put the needle into some of the monopolists. A gentleman carrying on business in Sydney, and owning over £80,000 worth of land there, desired to purchase a piece of ground in another part of the city, in order to prevent another man in the same line of business from coming into competition with him. On making inquiries, however, he found that the price wanted for the allotment was £480 a foot, and, since he owned £80,000 worth of land, and would, therefore, be liable to pay land tax at the rate of 66. in the £ 1 , he recognised at once that if he purchased that block of ground he would have to pay in respect of it taxation to the extent of £ 1 2 per There foot. That fact led him to give up his idea of acquiring the block, and another very decent firm was, consequently, able to secure it, and to start business in a part of the city where, otherwise, it would have been impossible for it to open up. The tax, in other words, knocked out the monopolist. I should like now to have the views of honourable members on the question of immigration. I have recently been looking up some works on Canada, which were not obtainable in the Parliamentary Library, but which I secured from another source. These works deal with the question of wages in the Dominion, and I gather from them that the 'temptation which Canada offers to British workers to emigrate is very great. British tradesmen find that they can earn as much as 16s., 17s., and 18s. per day in Canada. Stonemasons there receive as much as £ 1 per day, and in the United States, not far from the Canadian frontier, bricklayers and stonemasons receive from £ 5 10s. to £ 6 ios. a week. If such high wages are obtainable in Canada, is it likely that those intending to emigrate from Great Britain will come to Australia, where bricklayers and stonemasons receive only is. 4d. an hour? Many recent arrivals are not tradesmen. Although they came out as tradesmen, it is found that they have been specializing in some particular branch of their several trades, with the result that they have not been receiving very big wages in the Old Country. But good tradesmen are just as scarce in London, and some other large cities in the Old Country, as they are in Australia.",26
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Are tradesmen scarce in Australia?,27
47,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Specia l classes of tradesmen are scarce here as well as in Great Britain. One cannot help expressing regret that so many people are averse to putting their sons to a trade. I know that, in my own case, my mother .said, "" What! Put Jack to a trade where he would get his hands dirty? Not I . "" And so I was put into an office, where I remained for a time. I did not like it, however, and I knocked the chairs and the books about with such results that at last I was allowed to leave. I then had to be put to a trade. The tendency in Australia appears to be the same. Mothers apparently desire that their sons shall be ""respectable,"" through wearing a clean coat and being able to eat their dinner in the evening in the same clothes that they work in. Something ought to be done to induce our Australian lads to follow trades and callings instead of rushing to desks. Every one can see how they are running after billets in the Clerical Division of the Postal Service. A great cause seems to be the respect that^is attached to collars, cuffs, and ties. It does not seem to satisfy the ambition of lads to send them to a trade or calling. I have two apprentices in my trade now, but they do not seem to take to the work with the same love as they would to a clerical calling. One of the temptations is that a lad of sixteen or seventeen can earn more by serving over the counter of a shop than he can at a trade. .There appears to be the same tendency in the Old World, and that is one of the reasons why we are not obtaining really good tradesmen among the immigrants. I have engaged some of these men, and they have' done the most stupid things that could be imagined. Many people have a dread of - giving a position to any of the new immigrants, because they do not seem to understand their business. It is not that the people here have any feeling against them as "" new chums,"" or even that they will not give them assistance. It is simply because the newcomers have not the mechanical ability which their trade or calling requires. We ought to bring out immigrants who know their business. They would be an asset to the country; but the immigrant who does not know his trade is a disadvantage to the man who employs him, and is in a false position himself. It is very disagreeable for an employer to have to discharge him, knowing that it will be a hard jobfor him to obtain another position. I notice that Canada is having the same experience; and I read that in fifteen towns in Canada the only persons unemployed are the new arrivals. I am confident that Australia has in power a Government who are looking after the best interests of the country; and, so long as that Government remain in office, the people will deserve to be congratulated. I notice in the Speech that my old friend Sir George Reid is to have a new office in London, and I hope he will have good accommodation when he comes to occupy it.",27
48,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Wimmera) [4-45]-The Address-in-Reply deals with many measures which we shall have an opportunity to discuss individually at a later stage of the session - but I can find no other means than the Address-in-Reply debate by which the policy of the Government can be attacked or criticised in a comprehensive manner. One justification for a debate of this kind lies in the fact that the whole of the Government policy is before us, and that it is open to every honourable member to express his opinion upon it in a way which would be impossible when individual measures are before the House. The programme placed before honourable members for the session comprises a fairly comprehensive list of paragraphs; but it does not contain a very large number of measures to be introduced and discussed in this House for the first time. Most of the Speech is made up of an historical review dealing with acts of administration, or of amendments of measures already on the statute-book, with some promises as to future legislation. The gorgeous ceremony of the Coronation is referred to in a brief paragraph, and the work of the Imperkil Conference is dismissed in almost the same space. The Prime Minister's speech, on the work of the Conference, also occupies a very small space in Hansard, and, generally speaking, the result of the meeting of that body will be regarded by most honourable members as disappointing. A large number of subjects were listed and debated, but very few of a practical character were passed in anything like a concrete form, which would help the consideration of larger questions of statesmanship by the Parliaments of the self-governing Dominions. It is to be regretted that, in two practical directions, where the Conference might have done important service, nothing useful, resulted. I refer in the first place to the proposal made by the representatives of Australia at the previous Conference for the institution, of a Secretariat, representing all the self-governing Dominions, and, in the second place, to the large and important question of preferential trade, upon which the people of Australia have spoken with no uncertain sound - a policy laid down by that distinguished statesman, Mr Joseph Chamberlain, a few years ago. An explanation is due from the Prime Minister to the House of why the Australian delegates did not fight the Declaration of London more vigorously, and why, after opposing it, they failed to vote on it when it was finally put. The Declaration of London has been criticised, and, considering the important trade relations, of Australia and Great Britain, and the large amount of produce being carried' in our ships, an amendment of the clause which deals with the prizes of war and the rights of belligerents in time of war to seize goods to be landed on the shores of Great Britain, was highly desirable. It is not at all surprising that the Prime Minister did not push forward the practical question of preferential trade, seeing that he is out of sympathy with it, and I venture to say that, in that regard, he is not in harmony with the feeling of the great majority of the people of Australia. I am pleased to observe the statement that the youth of Australia are responding loyally to the call of duty under the operation of the compulsory training system. I think that is one of the best results of the legislation of this Parliament. Not only shall we be able to equip the youth of this country to defend it when called upon to do so, but we shall be helping under that system to develop proper character in our young men, and thereby assist the State Parliaments in their work of character-building. I believe the necessary complement to the compulsory training principle is a system of technical education, which should be established by the State Parliaments throughout Australia. If that is done we shall have two most powerful influences at work building up the character of the youth of the nation, and supplying that element of self reliance so necessary in the formation of all strong characters. I desire to congratulate the previous Government, and the honourable member for Parramatta, who was Minister of Defence in it, upon having passed the first measure establishing a system of compulsory training for the Commonwealth, and the present Government upon endorsing that policy and extending the principle. I believe the Government have interpreted the feeling of the great majority of the people aright by continuing our naval policy. That policy was the product of a Conference held in London in 1909. At this, Australia was represented, and the resulting recommendations were accepted by this Parliament. The Government are amplifying that policy, which, I believe, is enthusiastically approved of by the overwhelming majority of the people of the Commonwealth. The project for the creation of the Federal Capital will merit the most serious consideration of this Parliament. The honourable member for Echuca has already given notice of a motion that no further money should be expended by this Parliament in that direction until the people have an opportunity of giving their endorsement. I am not prepared to speak dogmatically as to the feeling of the whole of the people on this question, but I know the State of Victoria, and, I believe I can speak safely as to the State of South Australia. I think, indeed, the majority of the States of the Commonwealth, if the question were submitted to them, would record an overwhelming majority against the expenditure of millions of pounds in the Federal Territory before we carry out the important public works now awaiting execution. While we have thousands of miles of railway to build throughout the continent, it is absolutely unjustifiable for this Parliament to spend the money drawn from the people by taxation in building up a Capital at an enormous expenditure at this early stage of our history. The failure of the Government to deal more effectively and decisively with Tariff anomalies shows also that they are out of touch with the feeling of the people. The proposal of the previous Government was to appoint a Tariff Board to collect exact information, be presented with certain recommendations, so that Parliament might scientifically move anomalies which necessarily arise from time to time. That, in opinion, was a statesmanlike idea, but that nothing has been done, owing to the displacement of the previous Government. The number of .votes gained by the States, present Government on account of their Protectionist professions is, I think, rated. My own opinion is that the present Government was returned because it had been struggling to get into power for some time, and it presented an aggressive policy, with all sorts of extravagant promises. At standard gauge substituted. the same time, I believe that a large number of Protectionists voted for the present vernment because, for some reason or other, their promises in favour of high Protection seemed more acceptable than those of the late Government. How sadly dence of those electors was misplaced is shown by the fact that, up to the present, a parallel case? nothing has been done to carry out the hustings pledges. The action, of the Minister of Trade and Customs in sending out lars, in an endeavour to compel traders and others, as a condition of improved Prodo tection, to lay bare the secrets of their business, deserves the condemnation of every right-thinking man in the community. Such a circular, if carried into effect, would pel every manufacturer, trader, and busigauge ness man to reveal the inner operations his business, which alone make for successf u l and healthy competition; and such procedure Parliament should not sanction on the part of any Minister. It is by the Government at an early date to troduce a Bill for the construction of a line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie; and, under the circumstances, it may not be sible, when the Bill is brought forward, make any alteration in respect to the It is most unfortunate that, now we are linking up the whole of the capitals by railway, greater endeavour is not made to gauge. have adopted the widest gauge.",27
49,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Why ?,29
50,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Because the tendency are not difficult. on the part of congested populations world over is to widen the gauge. gauge of 4 f t . 8$ in. is, I know, regarded that is only to be expected. as the standard, but the present Government have frequently stated that they make their own precedents, and are not bound, even by practice, where they think improvement is possible. No doubt 4 f t . 8J in. is the gauge in the United Kingdom, and the to gauge agreed to many years ago by the Society of Engineers; but the late Mr. reHarriman, who was, perhaps, the greatest authority on railway construction and manmy agement in the world, expressed the opinion it would be necessary, before very long, to broaden the gauge of the railways connecting the main centres of the United in order to increase the traffic over the one pair of rails-that , probably, it overwould be found necessary to extend the 4 f t . 8£ in. gauge in America to at least 6 feet. It is true that in the United Kingdom there was one main line on the broad gauge, and that it was removed, and the It is only reasonable to suppose, however, that where Gothere was the one single line on the broad gauge, side by side with railways on the narrow gauge, the traffiq coulid not be worked satisfactorily, and, therefore, the the confialteration was justifiable.",29
51,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Does not Australia offer,29
52,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I do not think so.,29
53,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The bulk of the milecircuage here is on the narrow gauge.,29
54,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That may be; but I not think any engineer would seriously contemplate reducing our gauge to 3 f t 6 in. For some peculiar reason, 4 f t . 8 | in . is regarded as the standard, but every concomstant traveller must admit that the broad offers a steadier run for passengers, of and is capable of a larger train load.",29
55,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That is all right, but a the question is the cost of the alteration.",29
56,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That , of course, is proposed very important; but I am now dealing in with a proposal to build a new railway over 1,000 miles in length. When the Bill is introduced the Government may be able posto give us some information as to the into vestigation made before the decision to gauge. adopt the 4 f t . 8 i in. gauge.",29
57,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Gradient s affect the possibilities of a railway more than do the,29
58,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I understand that on the proposed line the gradients generally Regret is expressed in the the Governor General's Speech that the The referenda proposals were not carried; and I addressed a large number of meetings; and I can say emphatically that the people of Australia, in voting against the referenda, were not opposed to any reasonable amendment of the Constitution. Any definite proposal of the kind was received more heartily than any other remarks I had the opportunity to offer. The proposal of the Government was to transform the present Constitution into one which would give us neither unification nor Federation. That was one of the principal objections, and the people voted against the referenda more because they were not inclined to extend the power of the present Government than because tliey were opposed to necessary amendments. The people are agreeable, .1 believe, to give a reasonable extension of constitutional power and authority, but they opposed the referenda proposals as being of too sweeping a character, and probably the greatest influence was their objection, at this stage at least, to trust the present Government with more legislative authority. In the Governor General's Speech it is stated that the progressive tax on land values is having a satisfactory effect on land settlement, and is attracting a desirable class of immigrants. We shall require a little more concrete evidence as to the truth of that statement. The attractions to the immigrants are being offered by the State Governments, which are purchasing land from private owners. This process of repurchase commenced long before the Federal land tax proposals passed this House, and would have continued had those proposals never been introduced. The increased immigration is entirely due to the efforts of the State Parliaments, and the provision of the necessary land is the work of the same authorities. Under the circumstances the claim put forward on behalf of the Federal Government contains, in my opinion, no element of truth. Living as I do in the country, and understanding something of country conditions, my experience is that the land tax has been successful in four directions. It has drawn from the people of Australia £1,500,000, thus creating an enormous surplus of, perhaps, £1,000,000, and offering opportunities for the greatest extravagance on the part of the Executive. It has placed a tax on country producers, and thus rendered them less able to compete in the London market with the primary producers of the world. ; Mr Scullin,-How much are general producers paying towards this tax? [18]",29
59,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,They are paying pretty considerably.,30
60,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,How much? It is a very small fraction.,30
61,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,It will not be possible to say accurately until we have the return which has been asked for by the House; but my experience is that a large number of the most important section of the producers are at present contributing very substantially to the tax.,30
62,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Not to the Federal tax. i Mr SAMPSON - Yes , to the Federal tax. Thirdly, the tax has depressed land values all over the country districts of Australia, prices having gone down to the extent of £ 1 and £ 1 ios. per acre, as mentioned by the honourable member for Grampians.",30
63,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Is that not good for people who desire to buy land?,30
64,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Whil e the tax has depressed values, it has not, in any instance, enabled the class of people whom we desire to help to get on the land. 'For two or three years prior to twelve months ago, before this tax was imposed, there was a busy market in land throughout Victoria, and land-owners were actively engaged in subdividing holdings, and selling them readily on terms so liberal as to make it impossible for any Government to give easier conditions. While the tax has brought down the value of country lands, it has not stimulated the subdivision of estates, nor increased settlement. In fact, during the last twelve months there has been almost a cessation of land sales in the country parts of Victoria. In the cities landholders have passed on the tax to the tenants by increasing rents, and these, again, have, in many cases, passed it on to the consumers by raising prices.",30
65,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,How can a land tax decrease values and increase rents?,30
66,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The tax has decreased values in the country, where the worth of land depends upon its productivity; the price of products being determined by the demand for them in London markets. The country landholders are not in a position to pass on the tax, but city landholders, in many instances, can pass it on to the tenants, and the tenants, if they are shopkeepers, can pass it on to consumers by increasing the prices of the commodities which they retail. The prices of country lands have been depressed to the extent of from the 25 to 30 per cent. In that statement. I have the corroboration of the honourable membei - fior Grampians, who speaks for the. Western District, as I do for the Wimmera.. Only last, night I heard, onreliableauthority, that severalblocks, which, fifteen, months, ago were sold at from- £ 6 ' ios. to £ 7 an acre, did not fetch, more than. £ 5 5s:. an acre two or three, weeks ago. A certain' amount of.' subdivision is: stilli proceedMinisters' ing ; but the salesare very few, compared, with theactivity of the: three or four years; preceding the last twelve months.",30
67,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Would the Liberal party repeat the land tax if it gpt into power ? 1 Mr SAMPSON.. - I am not discussing what, may take, place in. the future. I am merely criticising the statementin the Speech that, the progressive tax on land values is having a satisfactory effect, on land settlement, and attracting a desirable class of immigrants. My reference fo. the sugar question will be short, because I shall' have another opportunity to discuss, it. There is, as. every one knows,, a duty of £ 6 a ton on. all sugar importedinto Australia.. During the recent strike the. Attorney - General threatened the Colonial Sugar Refining Company with, the remission of that duty/i and, according to figures which he used,, the yearly consumption, of sugar in. the Commonwealth is something like 200,000 tons,, on which the. company makes a profit of £90,000, or about 18s. 6d. per ton; but in New Zealand,, where, there is no duty,, and the. consumption is only 50,0.00tons a year,, the company makes a profit of £70,000, or about 28s. a. ton. If those figures are correct,- it would suit the company to have the duty removed, because that would enable it to' import free crude sugar grown, by coloured labour in. F i j i and. other Pacific Islands. The company is a large and' wealthy concern,, which should have beendealt with longbefore by the Government, under the-anti-trust, law.",31
68,Mr HALE,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Does ; the honourable member suggest that itisa trust ?,31
69,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"As to whether its operations are in restraint of trade is a question on which we require more light; but no serious endeavour is made by Ministers to deal with the trusts, the anti-trust law being a dead letter.",31
70,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What about the Coal Trust?,31
71,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Althoug h the Government take credit for initiating the prosecution of the Coal Vend, it was really commenced! by the previous Government:",31
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Mr Wise told the Court that he was instructed tosaythat thosefor whom he was-- appearing did not i-ntencli toinjurethe Vend in any way. Mr SAMPSON' - Evidentl y the Government have no great disposition to deal with the trusts, and the Eliminations of against them are mere flamboyant hypocrisy.",31
73,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Who pays the. Excise duty?,31
74,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The people of Ausr tralia.  well,, because it is the only Victorian concern that is not asking for more Protection.",31
75,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I think that it is doing too well; and its operations should be inquired, into..",31
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Nothin g would suit die company better than the abolition-, of. the duty.. Mr SAMP'SOiY - Thefigures used by the Attorney-General indicatethat, so that his threat was an absurd one. As' for the measures foreshadowed in the Speech, I shall deal withthem as they come before us\ Weall desire that our legislation shall 1 foster the great industries of the Commonwealth' and attract people from the Old Country, who will', increase our population and strengthen our defence. I trust that the Government, having' seen the wisd'om of the proposal of the Deakin Administration 1 to appoint a Royal Commission to. inquire into the sugar' industry, will adopt its other proposal, the. appointment of a Board for the thorough investigation of industrial and manufacturing conditions, so that the Tariff may be. considered by honourable members in. the light of. full', exhaustive, complete, and exact, information.",31
77,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Laanecoorie) [5.25.] - I - desire to address myself briefly toi the motion at. present under discussion^ realizing, as I do, that by my speaking now ini general terms, upon the proposals of the Government time will probably lae conserved when we aredealing with, them in detail. In the first place, I> must express my disappointment at. the manner, in whichi the Governor General's Speech, liasbeenprepared' and presented toi Parliament. I fear, that it was? first of all; submitted to the: varioussub-Committees', which, I understand, the supporters of the Government aase in the. fiabit of. appointing;, and: thattheir: reports were furnished in such a. waiy that themembers of the Cabinet ultimately intrusted with the duty of placing them in a readable form before the House found the work somewhat difficult.",31
78,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The honourable member only dreamt that.,32
79,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable member looks as if he had had a very bad dream. Time will probably cure him. of the nightmare from which he is suffering. There is no continuity of thought in the Speech as presented to us. Matters relating to Home Affairs and External Affairs are inextricably confused, showing that the sub-Committees to which I have referred have not done their work quite as faithfully as one might have expected. The Government are to-be congratulated upon their statement with regard to the Australian Navy. The paragraph dealing with the question is probably the shortest in the Speech, and it is certainly remarkable for its modesty. The party responsible for the Governor General's Address on this occasion has never been lacking in a full ap-' predation of the value of its efforts, and we find in this case that it is content simply to state that steady progress is being made in the construction of the ships of the Australian Navy. I do not wish to strike a discordant note, nor do I want to put forward what is known as the purely Stale idea, but I hope that the Govermnent in the future will pay a little more attention to the pressing necessity for a proper expansion of this work. I trust that they will not put all their eggs in one basket, and that they will not adhere to the policy of settling in one part of the Commonwealth for all time the important work of constructing the ships of the Australian Navy. Mr - CANN - Amongs t how many ports would the honourable member divide that work ? Dr. CARTY SALMON - Not more than three. I do not say that the advice which has been tendered to us by experts has not received some attention at the hands of the Government, but it certainly ought to receive from them the fullest and most careful consideration at a very early stage in our navy-building efforts. The work is a great one for us to undertake, and dt is we'll ithat we should remember the recent fate of the Russian fleet, which was bottled up in a ""harbour whence it found it impossible to emerge. We do not desire that our naval works shall be confined ito [i:8]- 2 any one part of the Commonwealth where they will either be subject to attack or may be rendered inoperative and useless by an effective blockade.",32
80,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Concentratio n of the Navy is now the policy.,32
81,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I am talking now of the building of the Navy. The concentration of a navy to enable it to strike an effective blow is very different from the concentration of shipbuilding yards-yard s in which our ships are to be constructed-so that we may be able to strike a blow wherever it is required. The reports presented to the Government - regarding the suitability of a spot on the coast of Victoria should receive the attention of the Government, and we should have, at a very early date, an indication of their policy in this respect. We all hail with much satisfaction the project of building these ships within our own borders. We want to have them built here. We desire that our people shall be employed in this very necessary and urgent work. We desire, above all, that Australia shall be self-contained in this regard, so that we ""may not have to depend on other parts of the world for a supply of the proper class of ships. In paragraph 12 of the Governor General's Speech we have the statement thatThe effect of the Tariff upon Australian industries is being carefully watchedby my Advisers, with a view to revision whenever the information obtained by them shows this to be necessary. I commenced with the statement that I had formed the opinion that the preparation of the Speech as a whole was the work of several sub-Committees. I certainly think that, this paragraph .contains the combined wisdom of the whole of the Labour party. Nothing could be more non-committal. 1 defy the most ardentFree Trader in the House to .find any fault with it.  Free Traders are there on the honourable member's side of the House ?",32
82,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,My troubleat present is that the dominant majority in this House - has evidently in its rankssufficient Free Traders to completely chloroform such Protectionists as my honourable friend' who has just interjected. They have been able to put the Protectionist section of the party in such a condition that all they can do is to point to the fact that there are on this side of the House a few Free Traders.  some more from this side whenever they want them.,32
83,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"We shall be prepared to take the honourable member whenever he chooses to cross over. We realise, however, that the ties which bind him, as well as others, to his party are far too strong to allow even a man of his independent spirit to go one inch across the dividing line. History has shown that no one could expect from the Labour partjy more severe opposition than it offers to the man who asserts his independence. We have seen during the last few months some telling instances of the enormous disciplinary power which that party wields over its members.",33
84,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It is nothing to the treatment, of Mr Henry Willis by the Liberals of New South Wales.",33
85,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable member is extremely unfortunate in his illustration. He ought to know that in the New South Wales Parliament his party was strong enough, not only to take one Speaker from the chair, but to obtain another from the other side. He cites that as an example of the discipline exercised by the Liberal party, but I think he will be rather sorry that he saw fit to give it. I am somewhat; amused with the attempts that are being made by the more vociferous - of the party opposite, and also by the (members of the Free Trade party, to divert my attention from paragraph T2 of - the Governor General's Speech, to which I desire tjo direct attention. That paragraph - does not deal with Speakers, or happenings in other States; it deals rather with the position to be adopted by the Government regarding a policy vital to the Commonwealth. That; policy has been placed before the people time and again, and on each occasion has been affirmed by larger majorities.",33
86,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Canno t the honourable member ' ' bide a wee ' ' ?,33
87,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It was last submitted to the people on the occasion of the general election of 1910, and I venture to say tjhat some of my honourable friends opposite would not have entered the doors of this Chamber but that they were regarded as staunch supporters of the Protectionist policy.",33
88,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"And we still are. - Dr CARTY SALMON - Yet , to use - their own words, they are prepared to ""bide a wee."" They are prepared to accept a non-committal statement of this character, and to ask Protectionists who are not bound by party ties-wh o are not bound by caucus rules ancl methods-to do the same. Mr W. H . JBVINE - The v tell us to "" Watch and pray.""",33
89,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I .believe that they are watching, but whilst they are doing so the importer is "" preying"" upon the people of Australia, and upon our trade and commerce generally. These honourable members will have a very heavy indictment against them when they appear before their constituents.",33
90,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Does the honourable member for Parramatta endorse all this?,33
91,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I am sure he will agree with my statement regarding the punishment to be meted out, even to members of the Ministry like the Minister of .External Affairs, who has time and again stated in this House that he places the question of Protection above all others.",33
92,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,-Never .,33
93,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable gentleman has time and again demanded a proper and efficient revision of our one-sided and mutilated Tariff. We are not permitted to lift the veil from what occurs in another place where policies are made, and where every movement taken by the present Government is carefully marked out for them by those who for the time being hold them in the hollow of their hands. We are not allowed to penetrate the veil. But perhaps t|he honourable member for Maribyrnong, who asks us to "" bide a wee""-wh o would have us believe that something is to happen in the immediate future, but does not say that it will-ma y have in mind something that has happened in the chamber with the locked door which no one is allowed to enter unless he takes the oath of allegiance. The honorab'.e member for Corangamite a few moments ago said something about dreams. I wonder what kind of sleep is being enjoyed by those members who only a few months ago were urging upon the previous Government the necessity for an immediate revision of the Tariff. They talked about Tariff anomalies with tears in their eyes, and, I. was going to say, with curses in their throats.  diles.",33
94,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable meinber has seen the tears, and has drawn attention lo them on more than one occasion. I regret thati the Minister of Trade and Customs is absent, for he was in the very vanguard of this movement. In the name of all that was Australian and patriotic, he demanded that an immediate revision of this iniquitous Tariff should be undertaken.",33
95,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Ne w Protection what he demanded.,34
96,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Not at that time. The honourable member's memory is playing sad tricks with him. I am afraid that the pure ozone of the vast ocean over which he has been travelling failed tp penetrate his brain; or that, if it did, the good effects have been dissipated by the fifty banquets which he and some of his colleagues attended in forty days. The Minister of External Affairs has apparently a proper appreciation of the title of his office. Seemingly, he pays far more attention to the outside world than he does to Australia. If he were paying attention to the Commonwealth, he would realise the condition to which our home trade has been driftin g ever since the last revision of the Tariff.  Fusion Government do when they had a chance to deal with the matter?",34
97,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"There is that puling cry of the mind utterly deficient in argument. I will tell the honourable member what the Fusion Government did. They attempted to get this House to pass an Act which would provide for the establishment of a Board of Trade, having for its object",34
98,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,When was that Bill submitted ?,34
99,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Who said a Bill was submitted ? The honourable member ought to recollect what occurred in another place with regard to the matter about which I am speaking. Tf he read contemporary history as carefully as he apparently scans the sayings of all those unfortunates who happen to be opposed to him in politics for the time being, he would get a better idea of policy than he now seems to have. I have told the honourable member what the previous Government attempted to do, and what their desire was.  tliey did. They did nothing.",34
100,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"At any rate, they went with a definite promise and a pledge to the country, which they would have carried out had they been returned with a majority. If they had not carried it out, they would not have been supported by honourable members like myself. Happily, I am not tied like the honourable member for Indi, who has to support his party right or wrong as soon as they have come to a decision on any matter affecting is the platform. He may oppose them up to the hilt, and may form part of a minority which numbers only one less than the majority, and yet he will be compelled to vote with the majority, which has the power to dragoon him into voting against his wishes and his pledges. Happily, I am not in that position. Had the late Government been returned to office, and had they not immediately dealt with the matter in the fashion they had promised to deal with it, they would have received very short shrift at the hands of Protectionists like myself, who are bound, not to a Caucus, but simply by the pledges we give to our constituents.",34
101,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Did not the honourable member's Caucus have to support him for the Speakership, when he only had a few votes ?",34
102,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"No . The the honourable member ought to know, if any one does, that statements made regarding private meetings have to be taken with a grain of salt. One thing for which I admire members of the Labour party is their loyalty to each other and to their Caucus meetings. Without that loyalty it would be impossible for. them to have achieved anything like the success they have obtained in the past. The honourable member for Werriwa has made two statements in one sentence, which I am very glad he has given me an opportunity to deny. He asked, "" Were not your party compelled to vote for you for the Speakership when you had only a very few votes?""",34
103,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I meant to say that the honourable member had only twenty votes. I was repeating the statement of the honourable member for Fawkner.,34
104,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I am not going to discuss with the honourable member the number of votes given on that occasion.,34
105,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The honourable member would be revealing Caucus secrets if he did.,34
106,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I am not bound, like the honourable member is, to keep secrets of that character. No pledge is given by the members of the party to which I belong to maintain secrecy regarding the party meetings. The honourable member said my party were bound to support me for the Speakership when I was nominated. Not only were they not bound to support me, but they did not support me. ",34
107,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"This is about the first time the honourable member for Maranoa has quoted that gentleman as an authority. I give the honourable member for Werriwa my word of honour that not only was no promise binding any members exacted, or even asked for, but every member of the party did not vote for me on that occasion. I hope that that three-fold denial will convince him, and convince also those who so industriously circulated that story, not only in Victoria, but all over the Commonwealth, as an evidence of the fact that the Caucus system did exist in the Liberal party.",35
108,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable member for Balaclava gave a different impression. He said he was trapped, and would not attend a Caucus like that again.",35
109,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I refuse to be tempted into a discussion of the actions of other honourable members. It is quite enough for each of us to defend his own actions, but I may say that the action of the members of the Labour party on that occasion, when they tried to draw a number of other honourable members from what they said was their allegiance, did not reflect credit on them. Let me return to the question of Protection, and the utter failure of the present Government to deal with it in any fashion at all, to say nothing of a satisfactory fashion. The Minister of Trade and Customs was one of the most ardent and - constant advocates in this House for relief from those Tariff anomalies from which he and a number of other Protectionists pleaded that the community were suffering. He no sooner reached the position of Minister than he showed, not only a forgetfulness of his previous protestations, but a callous disregard of the position of a large number of workers in the trades which are at present inadequately protected.",35
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,He is seeing the light-becomin g a Free Trader.,35
111,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I believe he has been kept in the dark. Under the sent system of government, he is not allowed to exercise his own free wilh He has not the opportunity of doing what he said he would do if he had the chance. member's electorate? IHe is not allowed to come down fo this Housewith a list of the very anomalies which he himself presented to the House and asked the House to deal with on a former occasion. It is more than significant when a Minister acts in this fashion. He has shown a callous disregard of the fate of certain industries, and his treatment of deputations was not that of a friend. He desired to pose before them in a sphinx-like fashion, pretending that if only they opened their mouths and shut their eyes something would be given to them. When specific instances, of distinct hardship were brought before him from time to time, they were treated by him in a careless and off-hand fashion, which no Free Trade Minister sitting in that chair under any' prp.vious Administration would have dared to exhibit. But we have to accept everything from this party, realizing that the Minister is not the mouth-piece of Parliament or the people of this country. He is not there to carry out the policy of Protection, which has been affirmed over and over again by vast majorities of the Australian peoole. He is there simply to act as - the mouth-piece of the body which meets upstairs. It is not good enough for the people of Australia that this sort of thing should be allowed to continue.",35
112,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,How will the honourable member alter it?,35
113,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The only way to do it is to put the present Government out of office; and I realise that nothing but an epidemic is likely to effect that. Their majority is so solid that not a single vote on their side would be cast against them, no matter what act of political turpitude was committed by them. The solidarity of the party is so strong, the loyalty so perfect, and the discipline so cruel, that there is not the slightest chance of removing them from their place. The Government are trifling with a great national policy, which has been placed before the people in an unmistakable fashion. It was placed before them by the very men who are betraying it today as the reason why they should be elected to this House. I am' alluding now particularly to the State of Victoria. I know that, in New South Wales, Protection is not thought so highly preof now as it will be in the near future.",35
114,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What industry requires more Protection in the honourable,35
115,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The two principal industries in my electorate are mining and agriculture. Under the system which the present Government have pursued,- agriculture is in nobetter position than, it was, and mining is in a very much worse position than it was a few years ago. Mines have been closed down in my district owing to the added cost of machinery and other materials,, due to the ineffective Tariff that we now have. Honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Barrier, the most ardent Free .Trader in the House, laugh at us.",35
116,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable membei for Hume said that I put the last Protectionist Tariff through by my votes, when some of his own supporters would not vote for him.",36
117,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"We know how the Postmaster-General pleaded for one. particular branch of the mining industry when the question of oregon timber was before the House. We know how he. button-holed members, and went round this place doing his duty to his constituents in, the fashion that he believed would best benefit them, and we also know how he. caused other industries in this country to suffer irretrievably by the votes he then gave.",36
118,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The honourable member said' I did my duty to my constituents.,36
119,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable member is proud tP, havein, his constituency, and to regard as his constituents,, those silver lords, to. whom, members of his party have more than once directed their attention in no very complimentary terms. The honourable member did good service to them. I ' believe he increased considerably the -'dividends paid to those who were already - drawing fat returns from that particular branch of the mining industry,, but his trouble and concern for the industry ended so soon as the confines of Broken Hill were passed. The honourable member had very little concern for the mining industry in other parts of the States. The engineering and machinery industries of this country are suffering from the unfair competition to which they are being subjected from outside. The result is. that they have closed down, and qur supply has been practically limited to that from oversea, and that we have been compelled to pay higher prices for very necessary parts of machinery.",36
120,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It is not true, then, that some of the manufacturers are short of men?",36
121,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Yes , it is. [One of the reasons why a mine in my district suspended operations was that the Postmaster-General, or his. Department, attracted the mea from, their ordinary avocation by the bribe of higher wages for a limited, period. They were attracted' to the city, to. which they came in crowds, in order to get work at the undergrounding of the telephone lines,, for which workthe Minister had increased the amount of pay.",36
122,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Are the men being paid toomuch ?,36
123,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I do not. say that.,36
124,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"What is the point, then?'",36
125,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I trust that the Minister will not put into my mouth words I have not used. No one is more 1 competent to make use of a suggestion, of. the kind than is the Minister; and I cannot allow to pass thesuggestion he has just made that I think the men are being paid too much.",36
126,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I - merely asked the question.,36
127,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I do not think they are being paid too. much, and I haye never saidso.",36
128,Mr THQMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"What is. the point, then?",36
129,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Brough t up, as I was in a mining district, no one knows better thanmyself what the men suffer who work underground.. The honourable member for Grey knows my district, and the conditions under which these men are employed ; and' he further knows that if they are offered a temporary job at high wages elsewhere, the temptation is often too strong, and they find their places filled' when the temporary work is over. There is no more unsettling thing in any com-, munity than the. giving of higher wages tp men for work not of a permanent character. No true political economist-and every honourable member opposite thinks he is. a political economist-ca n view with equanimity a proposal in the direction of a temporary, rise in wages which will have the effect of unsettling an industry.",36
130,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Then I suppose wages ought to be kept lower !,36
131,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I do not desire to enter into a discussion of that question; I was asked for an instance, and. I have given one.  miners in the honourable member's district specially sent for? ",36
132,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I have so far respecially frained from interfering, but I must honourable members, and the Postmasteropinion, General especially, to cease these continuous interjections in the form of questions to the honourable member for Laanecoorie.",37
133,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"On many platsame forms, and before many boards of direchaps, tors, I have said that the pay which the miner receives is nothing like commenthe surate with the work, or with the danger to which he is exposed. But, no how poorly paid he may be, it is better that he should have steady employment than that he should be attracted away from wife and family to the city, under the syssion tem of centralization which has been so ties, prejudicial to the advancement of our people in the past.",37
134,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,That argument would apfacilities ply against bringing immigrants here.,37
135,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"To honourable for members opposite, immigration is like what King Charles' head' was to the unfortunate Mr D i c k ; they refer to it on every conceivthe able occasion, and I confess I do not see pertinence of the interjection. Before leave the question of Tariff reform, from which my honourable friends opposite seem most anxious to draw me, I that, amongst the people of the country, there is a feeling of grave disappointment and dissatisfaction, and that feeling is most keen amongst members of the Labour party. Members of political leagues throughout Victoria, at any rate, have in the street and from the platform voiced their disapprobation of the inaction of the Government on this all-important matter. The GovernI ment are putting too great a strain on the loyalty of their followers by asking bers of those leagues, who are pronounced Protectionists, to sit still and suffer sent inaction on the part of those they have supported. As to the Post and Telegraph Department, the Postmaster-General seems to have failed lamentably to appreciate the attend to. true position that it occupies in a country such as ours.  member for Echuca said the present master-General is the most successful have had.",37
136,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Is the honourable member for Indi so wedded to the opinions of the honourable member Echuca that he is asking me also to adopt them ? When an honourable member speaks on this side, he speaks for himself, while honourable members opposite, we selected to speak for the party. ask On this side we have independence of as well as independence of action ; and if an honourable member thinks fit to eulogize the Minister, there is no reason why the rest of us should eulogize him in the way. Postal communication is, perthe most valuable of all the forces that are created by the Government; but Minister seems to have placed the Department on a pounds, shillings, and pence matter basis of a most sordid and mercenary character. He regards himself as the particular custodian of the revenues of the Dehis partment; and he desires, on every occawhen applications are made for facilithat those facilities shall not only not result in a loss, but shall actually provide a profit. The consequence has been that are being denied to people who undoubtedly deserve them. Opportunities closer and more frequent communication have not been made available; and the last order issued from the Department is in direction of cutting down, to the extent the of 40 per cent, in some instances, the I already meagre allowances paid to certain, people who are doing the country's work.",37
137,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,To what does the honordesire to say able member refer?,37
138,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,To the cutting down of the pay of the already poorly paid officers in the allowance offices established in various country districts.,37
139,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,It is not so.,37
140,Dr CART YSALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I am sorry that I have not my papers with me; but ask the Minister to take note of the case of the officer at Leonard's Hill , where the mempay of £ 1 9 has been reduced to £ 1 7 .  the prehas dropped off, I suppose?",37
141,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Not only has the business not dropped off, but the officer has now a telegraph and a telephone to  for attending to the telephone.",37
142,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"No , he does Postnot; under the new arrangement he rewe ceives a lump sum, which is not anything like that he previously received.",37
143,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Is the honourable member sure that this officei gets a lump sum, irref o r spective of the work?",37
144,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Yes .,37
145,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I shall be glad to have know, are the facts of the case.",37
146,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The officer's name is Wilkie. Under the old rule he received 3d. per telegram, and i d . per telephone message, representing about ios. per month, but that payment is to be discontinued, and he receives a lump sum which, as I say, is not nearly so large as the previous remuneration. There are other similar cases in my electorateThe Postmaster-General seems surprised; but I cannot credit that such things can _ be done without his cognizance, or even without his order; at any rate, we hold him responsible.",38
147,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I am not shirking responsibility.,38
148,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The Minister has started a new practice of closing all post-offices at 6 o'clock.,38
149,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The best thing I have done since I have been in office.,38
150,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It seems to be very easy to satisfy some people. If the Minister is satisfied, 1 presume that all the people have to do is to say that they are also satisfied.",38
151,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,If they are dissatisfied they can shift me !,38
152,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I venture to say that the thousands who are inconvenienced are not saying that they are satisfied. Although the Minister has made merry on more than one public occasion in reference to the number of messages handed in at certain offices after 6 o'clock, if he will take the aggregate number handed in throughout any given year, he Avill find that it amounts to many thousands.",38
153,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Such messages are now being handed in before 6 o'clock.,38
154,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable gentleman is placed on a pinnacle of selfsufficiency, which, I venture to say, no other Minister has reached, and he cannot lie expected to know to what extent the curtailment of this particular privilege affects a large number of persons. The people are the best judges as to what is the effect on them; and I fail to see the cogency of the argument of the Minister as to what has been done in Western Australia. I have never regarded that State as particularly up to date. When the Commonwealth started there was no one more subject to the ridicule of the honourable members from New South Wales than the right honourable member for Swan, who was recognised as the leader of the Western Australian party. That State was regarded as the most backward of all, and openly called the "" Cinderella "" of the States, and yet it is from the West that the Minister is drawing his inspiration for up-to-date methods.",38
155,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,It is a good thing for Victoria that there is a Western Australia 1,38
156,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Perhaps it is a good thing for Western Australia that there is a Victoria. I do not wish to improperly praise my own State, but none in the Union has done more for the Commonwealth than has been clone by Victoria. Its people not only settled their own territory, but did much to settle New South any Wales, Queensland, and the greater part of Western Australia as well.",38
157,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,We should like more Victorians in Queensland.,38
158,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable member shows a truer appreciation of Victorians than does die Postmaster-General, although he represents the Barrier, and it was Victorian capital and enterprise, and, very largely, Victorian miners, who kept the Barrier mines going at a time when they were threatenedwith extinction. I am sorry that there is a lack of appreciation of Victorian character by a man who owes so much lo the State.",38
159,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What about Queensland ?,38
160,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I am sorry that the Minister has compelled me to make a statement which, I think, he would prefer should have remained unmade. The Central administration of the Postal Department of the Commonwealth has suffered more from having too many Queensland officers in high positions than from any other cause.",38
161,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I ""do not think so.",38
162,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I should be sorry to speak as an apologist of the Minister, and am now voicing, not his opinions, but my own, and do not expect his concurrence. He would probably have more sympathy with the people in our country districts if he had a better knowledge of their conditions.",38
163,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The honourable member should withdraw what he said about Queensland officials; it was grossly unjust.,38
164,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,We owe a great deal to Sir Robert Scott.,38
165,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,He is one of the best officers the Commonwealth has had.,38

Similar claims are made by the labour parties of the States, even where they have never 'been in power. 'Only a few hours ago the Leader of the Victorian Labour party, speaking in regard to an application for a Wages Board for night ""watchmen, complained that the Anti-Sweatcalled ing League, as well as the Trades Hall Council, had 'been favourably mentioned.

183,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I accept the information given by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and shall do my best to take advantage of it. As a matter of fact, the Labour party were so halfhearted in the support of their referenda proposals that many of them did not care to recommend them to the people. That is one reason why such a large vote was cast against them. The members of the very party that was responsible for these proposals were loudest in their complaints regarding the want of information concerning them. They did not understand fully their force, and members of the Political Labour Leagues frankly made that admission at public meetings throughout Australia.  was it that they did not understand them?",40

187,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.,40
188,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I desire to draw attention to the question of immigration with a view of urging the Government to make it a truly Commonwealth matter, and to prevent, as far as possible, the unfair competition that is now taking place between the States. I have been told by a passenger on one of the large ocean-going steamers that within the last few weeks a steamer, having on board a large number of immigrants, on arrival at Fremantle, was boarded by the Premier of Western Australia, who delivered an address to the immigrants, with the resujt the great majority of them left the ship, arid proceeded to take up their quarters in that State. I do not know whether any of these immigrants were assisted by the Governments of the other States, but since the whole of Australia is intimately affected by this question of immigration the Commonwealth should take over the work, and see that a fair distribution takes place as between the various States. Coming to the question of Defence, it is to be regretted that the principle of compulsory training has been subjected to so many untoward happenings. We have had to contend with all sorts of difficulties owing to the unpreparedness of the Department for the new work, and consequently a fair trial has not been given to the system. I know that a great deal of work has been done, especially by the Area Officers, who are being shockingly underpaid. They are all men of experience, and had to submit to a very searching examination. They had also to give up their private businesses, and to go into camp for a considerable period in order to properly fit themselves for the work expected of them and they are receiving from the Department the magnificent remuneration of £150 a year. I know, from personal inquiries, that it was anticipated before these officers were appointed ""that they would not be required to devote more than one evening a week to their work. As it is, the majority of tliem are working every day, and many of them far into the night to overcome the pressure of work put upon them. It is a pity that the principle of compulsory training has not had a better send off. It ought to have had a better start, having regard to the long period that elapsed between the decision of the House that it should be introduced, and the call made upon the Defence Department to provide the necessary material. The uniforms for which the cadets were measured many months ago are just coming to hand. I have inspected some of these uniforms, and, speaking as one whohas had personal experience-sinc e I acted 1 for the Victorian Minister of Defence during the time that contingents were being sent to South Africa- I do not hesitate to say that the material and workmanship are first class. Great credit is reflected on all concerned. The greatest abuses of the contract system have taken place in other instances, notwithstanding the supervisionand control of the Army Department, and it is pleasing therefore to find that such good material being used in this case. I would refer specially to the leather used in the manufacture of the belts. All that I saw were made of first class material, and the only-wonder is that the contractors have been able to supply the goods for the price at which they tendered. (The provision of drill halls is a very urgent matter. Happily, the winter has passed, but the training of the lads indie open air during the winter months must have a very prejudicial effect upon them. It will also detract from the popularity which the system has gained. As an ardent believer in the system, I am sorry to see anything interfering with the appreciation of it by the people. I hope that municipalities having halls suitable for drill purposes will 1 allow the Defence Department the use of them free of charge, and where these are not available, I trust that the Department will see its way to provide them. Many parents object to the compulsory training system on the ground of the exposure to which their boys have beensubjected during the winter months. The officers and all concerned have been most considerate, but the wholei experiment has not had a fair trial owing to the fact of drill halls not being available. Such halls are not costly structures.",41
189,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,But in most municipalities 1 they would have to be built of brick.,41
190,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Some municipalities have halls that are utterly unsuitable. Special floors, special ventilation,, and a minimum of dust are necessary.",41
191,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Patrioti c citizens out my ivay are building halls.,41
192,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Thos e who are coming to the rescue of the Department are to be highly commended, and I envy the honourable member the representation of such citizens. In my electorate,, also, a great deal has been done by individuals to popularize this system, which most of us believe will be for the benefit of the country. Before we adjourned for dinner I referred Co two postal matters. I have since refreshed my memory by reading the letters relating to them. I find that in one case a person in charge of an allowance office has been informed that the allowance will be reduced from £ 3 4 to £ 2 8 a year ; whilst the person in charge at Leonard's Hill has been informed of a reduction from £ 9 to £ 1 7 a year. l",41
193,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,For what reason?,42
194,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,That is more than I can tell.,42
195,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,But the honourable member is explaining the facts. Probably the reductions have lieen made because there is less work to do.,42
196,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"There is more work, telephone and telegraph business having been added.",42
197,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I shall inquire into both cases. 5s the honourable member is aware, those in charge of allowance offices are paid according to a scale.",42
198,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Quite so. Last year the Department proceeded to reduce the remuneration paid in respect of allowance offices; but the Minister put a stop to the practice. We are now having a return to it.,42
199,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Because the allowances may vary every year. Next year there may he a rise of £ 5 in the cases referred to by the honourable member.,42
200,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The person in charge of one of these offices was told that, with the introduction of the telephone and the telegraph, payment would be by results, and that system was followed for a brief period. An intimation has since been given, however, that a fixed sum of £ 2 per annum is to be paid in respect of that one branch of work. Considering that it is. yielding ios. a month, £ 2 per annum is scarcely a fair remuneration. The Governor General's Speech is one of the lengthiest and most portentous that the Commonwealth has ever seen, and we have in it indications that the Government intend to pursue the policy of their party-that they intend to perpetuate the system regarded in other parts of the world as an Australian experiment-of making Parliament merely a registering machine. This Parliament is to divest itself of all its powers of deliberation and choice. Those powers are to be handed over to an irresponsible body, formed without either the sanction of the great body of the electors, or any proper method; and that body is to dictate to the Parliament, which is to become a mere registering machine, the legislation from time to time to be brought into, effect. Would our honourable friends opposite view such a proposal with the equanimity they at present display if they were in Opposition, and it came from the Government side of the House?",42
201,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Circumstance s alter cases.,42
202,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable member is able, in his present circumstances, to view with a good deal of equanimity a proceeding which he would most forcibly oppose if it emanated from a party of which he was not a member. The question that we have to consider transcends all others. It is the question of the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth. If our friends opposite can show that this so-called method of government-this method of control-wil l cause the greatest good to the greater number, then they will have justified it.",42
203,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,--Do we not appeal on our programme to the people in the same way as the honourable member's party do?,42
204,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"No , the honourable member altogether loses sight of the great difference between the body to whom he appeals and the body to whom we appeal. The honourable member appeals to a body which is tied hand and foot, and which is bound to vote for the party programme and the party nominee, while on this side it is the policy and the policy alone for which people are asked to vote.",42
205,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The trouble is to name the party on the honourable member's side. It is variously called the People's party, the Liberal party, and the Old Ladies' party.",42
206,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I am sure the last-named party would welcome the honourable member as a recruit. I am surprised at so profound a student, as the honourable member for Werriwa adducing such an argument. I do not say that he believes in it, for he must know the enormous difference there is between the appeal made by a free and independent candidate to a free people and that which is made by the nominee of a party to those who are bound to vote for that nominee.",42
207,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I was the nominee of one party, and Colonel Ryrie was the nominee of another, and we went to the same people.",42
208,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable member talks about appealing to the same people, and also of appealing on a platform, but all the sophistry in the world cannot alter the actual difference that exists between the two parties. The one is composed of people who are bound. From the moment that a man joins a Political Labour Leaguehebinds himself to vote for the selected candidate of that league. There is no league of a similar character on this. side. TheLiberal leagues offer the most perfect freedom to their members to vote as they please.",42
209,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What about poor Willis? What are the Liberals going to do with him?,43
210,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That is the kind' of argument which is advanced by the irresponsible members of the party. The honourable member is talking of people who have nothing to do with the party or with the bond that binds the party together. The honourable member could not conceive of a member of his party doing what the gentleman whom he calls "" Willis "" has done. Will he not see the enormous difference there is between the two parties? The one man is free to do as he pleases; the other is bound to db as his party tells him to do. The appeal made by the members who are following the Government today is an appeal to class prejudice, and it is only by that means that they have secured the temporary majority which they enjoy. When the people of Australia thoroughly realise the ineffectiveness of the policy placed before them by honourable members on the other side they will speak with no uncertain voice, and will undoubtedly repeat the decision they gave upon the 26th April last.",43
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Parramatta) [8.1]. - I almost hesitate to obtrude myself into a debate in which every one seems so happy, and when all the faces confronting me are so smiling and jocund. Mr FISHER. - Are we to have a change?",43
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I hope not. I shall do my best to make the few observations I intend to make so as not to provoke anything differing from what has been witnessed this afternoon. After all, the country is happy, and prosperous, and smiling, thanks, my honourable friends say, to the existence of a Labour Government in office. But, whatever may be the cause, I think we all ought to congratulate ourselves that the country is in such a prosperous condition. I suppose this accounts for the fact that during the administration of the high offices of State by the Labour Government it has not been found necessary to summon Parliament too hastily, or to sit too lengthily. This Government, amongst other things, set out to make precedents. They have done so in more respects than. one. They have been' in power for about two years, adding together their two terms, and they have been working in Parliament six: months out of the. twenty four.. The other eighteen months they have been in recess.. That, of course, does not matter when we have a good Government in power, and when the country is prosperous. I presume that, this is a. foretaste of the new unionism in which, they so strongly believe-smal l work and. large pay; 25 per cent, of parliamentary work and 75 per cent. of. play, or shall I say of rest? At any rate, that is their record. I congratulate them on it, and presume that what Robert Blatchford calls "" the bottom dog "" is still weltering away in his misery outside; but there are not many of him, and. the country is very prosperous, and! so I suppose it does not matter.",43
213,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"How . does the honourable member make out that the Government have been, twenty-four months in. office?",43
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"J am talking of their twoterms. The last time the present Government were inoffice they occupied their places for seven months, out of which they met Parliament for three weeks. Now, again, in about eighteen months of office-, they have five months of parliamentary work to their credit.",43
215,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,It only shows what they can do when they get there.,43
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Indee d it does; but I have> been all the time picturing what would have happened hadany other Government treated the House and country to the same thing. My honourable friends would have taken apoplectic fits in their furious denunciation of any Government which could so trifle with the interests of the public, and particularly with the industrial conditions of the country. Now, however, everything seems to be quite right. As Browning would sayGod's in His heaven; All's right with the world. And here, under the Southern Cross, a Labour Government reigns supreme. I am aware that this Parliament meets later than usual, because of a very interesting fact. We are reminded of it in paragraph 3, which states that a delegation was specially invited to the Coronation of His Majesty King George V . ; and accordingly three Ministers deemed it necessary to travel to London to transact Imperial business there, taking with them a very large 'staff. Here, again, I must congratulate the 'Government on observing - fully all .the comventionailities of the - situation, and, if I may say so, again setting up precedents, in that they took with them the largest suite that ever journeyed from Australia to London. I 'am sure we ought .ail to be very glad that the Prime Minister has sustained the .dignity iof Australia in - a way that is in every way becoming and worthy. If , 'Occasionally, it has led to some curious 'incidents abroad, I - am sure the 'Prime Minister is not altogether ^responsible for them; but, really, some of the things that - happened during this journey aTe worth quoting. I propose to quote one which came under my notice a little while ago. The Prime Minister, in his travels, visited Rome. Naturally, an Imperialist of the first water such as the Prime Minister is today would want to obtain a glimpse pf Imperial Rome, and .accordingly .he and his large suite journeyed thither. Tbis is what the British Australasian says of that journeyThe >Roman - papers on May 5 came out with IL special paragraph headed, "" The Australian mission in Rome,"" and saying, "" His Excellency the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Fisher, arrives to-night in Some with his suite, which is composed of seventeen people, en route for the Coronation of King George of England. Apartments have been engaged for His Excellency at the Hotel Regina, Rome.""",43
217,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,That ; must be a comic paper.,44
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Not at all. I am surprised at the honourable member suggesting such a thing. The facts are correctly set out. There were seventeen people in die honourable member's suite. At any rate, he may be congratulated on having upheld the dignity of Australia in a way that some of the miserable people on this side have never thought of doing. I feel I ought to congratulate him on doing it so thoroughly. Whenever a delegation of the kind has gone Home previously, a couple of Ministers have been considered enough, with an Under-Secretary between them; but, on this occasion, there were three Ministers, three Under-Secretaries, a private secretary, and a courier, to make up the suite of .the Prime Minister - though Ministers are to be congratulated on having .stood out all through for higher union wages, for .even here prices have gone up. Senator Pearce told us the other day that his price for going to London was £700. Colonel Foxton was paid £ 5 0 0 ; and I believe that no subordinate Minister, who ever left the shores of Australia on a .London mission, has ever received .more.",44
219,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I .do not think that is. corMr JOSEPH .COOK - I think it is. In the old days, whenever a Postmaster General was .sent to a Postal Conference, that was the recognised amount, with £300 for the Under-Secretary. I think that Mr. Dugald Thomson and the Attorney General, when they went to the Navigation Commission, were given £500 each. We have not yet seen what the Minister 'of External Affairs received-; but, just before the Prime Minister came back from London, the Acting Treasurer stated that the sum total paid on account of .this mission was £7,390, made up of £1,000 each for the Ministers, £450 each for the UnderSecretaries and the private secretary, and £250 for a courier. The Ministers did what was befitting the dignity of Australia on this very important occasion. We cannot blame them for putting up the price,, since the Prime Minister always believes in good wages.; and I , for one, shall .make no complaint on that score. As to the Governor General's Speech itself, its length appals one, and its importance is first rate; but there are some marked omissions. For instance, the term "" new Protection "" has disappeared.. For many years past, it has appeared in all Government programmes, but now .the Labour party have dropped it out; and the Prime Minister has not yet vouchsafed any explanation for the throwing overboard of this - inconvenient plank.",44
220,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Surely the honourable member will not quarrel with the Government about that?,44
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I do not know as to that. I have asked for a working, explanation of new Protection, for I have always been a believer in it, if it can becarried into practical effect. Since we are to encourage the industries of Australia, through the Tariff, the worker is entitled' to a good share of the Protection ; and I desire to see a scheme elaborated by which he may receive more. The worker has been led to believe he will get more; but, an opportunity now presents itself to provide for it, the whole thing has gone overboard. It is lost; and, I suppose, it is twenty fathoms deep in the Pacific by now --",44
222,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,It is buried in the High Court Law Reports !,45
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Eve n that fact might have been mentioned here, considering the important part new Protection played in the recent referenda. Whether it is to be resurrected or not, I do not tend to know. The Government express their sincere regret at the defeat of the referenda; and we can well believe in their sincerity; but here again there is no reference to new Protection, or industrial matters of any kind. The trusts, which did the Labour party such good service at the referenda on every platform, are again pushed to the front. Either to cover up a retreat on the part of my honourable friends opposite, or, as a matter of propaganda on the public platform, these trusts have been their best friends. Day in and day out, the Labour party have denounced trusts with a fury that,has made the welkin ring; and now the trusts are use3 to cover up the defeat, they suffered on the 26th April last-to soften down their poignant regret at the tremendous victory of Liberalism and common sense which then occurred. There are two Bills mentioned here; and I wonder why. One is to provide for compensation to seamen, and the other is a Navigation Bill. Since the referenda took place, the Attorney-General has declared that neither of these proposals can be given legislative effect; and, if that is so, why are they in the programme? I shall presently quote a statement made by the Attorney-General in an interview after the referenda, in which he particularly referred to these measures, and declared that this Parliament could not now legislate in regard to them. Is this mention of them in the programme pretence and make-believe, or was the interview a make-believe? It must be one or the other; either the Parliament has the power to pass these proposals, or it has not. If there is no power, the Bills have no business in the programme; and if there is power, then the Attorney-General had no right to deceive the public of Australia. I do not propose to say much in regard to the Governor-Gaieral's Speech itself, which is as vague as it is comprehensive. Paragraph 32, for instance, informs us that consideration is being given to the question of life, fire, unemployment, and invalidity insurance. That is a large order, covering four or five fields of experimental social legislation; and yet these are grouped in a vague statement, which means nothing. At any rate, such measures cannot be touched this session, as all who know anything of our business are quite aware. This paragraph is merely inserted lest some honourable member on this side should give notice to deal with any particular aspect pre- of such legislation. However, it has now been relegated to the sweet by-and-by. The next paragraph tells us that the progressive tax on land values is having a satisfactory effect on land settlement, and is attracting a desirable class of immigrants. As to that, I shall quote a statement made the other day at Mudgee by a State Labour member, Mr Dunne, who saidThe Labour party would terminate the lancl hunger by making available several million acres in different parts of the State at one time. At Wagga there were 1,600 applicants for 14 homestead blocks at an upset price of £ n 5s. per acre. That is a very scathing commentary on the paragraph in the Governor General's Speech. I have thefiguresregarding settlement for the first six months of the year in New South Wales, which, I suppose, is typical of the rest of Australia. The record of the Liberal Government in New South Wales for some years shows an average settlement at the rate of 4,365 holdings per annum; while under the Labour Government",45
224,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What figures is the honourable member quoting?,45
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I am quoting figures that the honourable member cannot controvert.,45
226,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The figures are absolutely incorrect! Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-Does the honourable member say that before I have quoted the figures?",45
227,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I mean the figures already quoted.,45
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Th efiguresare taken from the I'ear-Booh of Australia, and have, I believe, been brought up to date from departmental returns laid on the table of the State - House. These returns show that in the first six months of this year the original and additional holdings numbered 1,423, or at the rate of 2,846 per annum; or just half the number unde'r the Liberal Government in the preceding year. No doubt honourable members opposite can do all the talking necessary for both sides; but, now that they are in office and clothed with responsibility, they do not come up to the level of those they so bitterly denounced. The figures show that, with a crushing land tax helping them, they have brought about only half the settlement that took place in the corresponding period year. So much for the satisfactory way in which this land tax is assisting settlement and attracting a "" desirable class of grants."" I wonder what my friends oppothe site mean by "" a desirable class"" of imeffect. migrants. Here we have land being thrown open by the Labour Government at an averpartment, age price of £ 4 ss. an acre; and that not much encouragement for the poor man to go on the land. It would take him a long while to buy such land, even from Government; but this is the way in which this tax is cheapening land, in order to sist the man without means to become land user and an independent citizen of Australia. The figures show that this tax is proving an unmistakable failure. The first year, beyond all others, should show the effect of the tax in forcing on to the market and in promoting settleministration ment. In succeeding years its results be less evident. But, notwithstanding that the tax is a crushing imposition on the large land-owners, we have seen that not facilitated settlement, and that there less settlement under Labour Governments than there has been for many years past under Liberal Governments. Nearly every honourable member on Ministerial side of the chamber who has spoken has told us that we cannot challenge the administration of the Government. We give instances which the administration is .and yet that cry is repeated. If they mean that the Government is not to be challenged on the ground that rupt, or that Ministers hold their offices improperly, they are right. But for isters to be honest and incorruptible - negative virtue at this time of day political history of Australia. If , other hand, it is claimed that Ministers have obtained better results from the - partments which they control than been given in the past, I advise them - wait a little longer. The Budget has been 'promised foi the 20th September.",45
229,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Not so early as that.,46
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I read the - statement in a newspaper. During Budget debate detailed reference will - made to the administration of the Departthe ments. At present, I shall content myself - with saying that some of the claims - Governor General's Speech are pudent. It will be shown later, stance, that the Naval Agreements of this last Government are absolutely, and almost word for word, the proposals of their predecessors. As to the land defence policy, immithe sketch outlined by what was called Fusion Government has been given There are only two points on which 1 would seriously criticise the Defence Deand I shall defer the criticism is for a week longer. When I see this Labour Government spending millions of the people's money in creating a navy and the army for the defence, not only of Australia, but of the Empire, it is my place as to support it, and to reserve all criticism a which is not absolutely necessary. I congratulate Ministers> upon giving effect to the recommendations of Lord Kitchener, though they have departed from his scheme in some directions in a manner that may in land the long run prove disastrous. The adof the Postmaster-General's must Department is not perfect, though the criticism of that, too, must await a more convenient season. We shall then ask for it has explanations as to the delay in inis stalling wireless telegraph stations, and as to why men have been put into the service without being asked to compete against others, and placed over the heads of men the already there and eligible for promotion. As to the occupants of these snug billets, I know nothing, and make no allegation, but I wish to know why Ministers have in set aside the practice which has been in defective, force since Federation? '",46
231,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,To what does the it is corhonorable member refer?,46
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"To the apMinpointment of Mr Binnie as accountant at is a the Military College, among others. Honin the orable members must not imagine that on the everything is right because all our complaints have not been voiced in this debate. DeThere is more reason for criticising the adhave ministration of the Departments today to than there has been for some years past. Nothing could exceed the importance of the last Imperial Conference. It is a matter for congratulation that the Empire responded cordially and willingly to the the invitation of the Home Government, and be that another milestone has been passed in progress of the Empire towards its more complete and effective organization. in the If nothing has been done to better most imthe organization of the Empire, I for indo not know who is at fault; bfct the Minister of .External Affairs, in an terview-I am not sure whether in .London or here-declared that that is .so. more severe criticism could be passed an outsider upon the proceedings of the Conference. The Minister, in effect, said '.that if nothing had been done to improve .the organization of the Empire, we should .be thankful .that the doors were not shut in our faces. At any - rate, Ministers good advertising agents when in London, though what the representative of the Northern miners thinks about that I do know. He sits silent like :a sphinx, and .not .even .the .Prime Minister's speech at Penny Pictorial.

"" I was born,"" Mr Fisher said, in answer to a questionHonorable members will see presently why I refer to these detailsin Ayrshire, Scotland, on August 29th, 1862.

237,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,And another interest I have in the place is that my wife is native of it.,48
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Quite so. this interview, the Prime Minister went to speak of the conditions of labour in Australia. The interviewer writes"" And now, can you tell me,"" I asked, "" what are the prospects of the average working man who is thinking of going out to Australia?"" "" Excellent, without doubt,"" was Mr Fisher's reply. "" He need never be afraid of getting work to do so long as he is willing and able to do it. Mind you, I do not say he would be able to pick and choose; far from it , but I know, in my own trade-mining-that there is a continual demand for good men from ios. per day upwards. It is much the same in other branches of industry; good tradesmen need never be out - of work."" "" What class of people would you advise to go to Australia then?"" "" Every one who is dissatisfied with his present in England. Of course, we. mainly want people who are willing to settle on the there is also a very good opening tor manufacturers, but in any case, they will all get 1 a welcome. Australia is big enough to take millions of the right sort of people; but, at the same time, I would strongly caution people not come out without a little money."" "" Is there any prejudice against the new comer in Australia, Mr Fisher?"" "" None whatever; nearly all the people in Australia are either British or of British descent. Take myself, for instance, I found people only too willing to give me a helping hand."" "" How do wages in Australia compare with wages in England?"" "" They are a good deal higher. In some trades they are twice as much as in England, but, of course, vary considerably all over Australia. Carpenters, bricklayers, and miners are a few which might be instanced as well paid men."" "" Now, it has often been stated here, Mr. Fisher, that though wages are' high in Australia living is correspondingly dear. Do you find that so?""

Are we to take it, then, that the only unemployed in Australia at present are those who will not work? It seems to me that the Prime Minister cannot escape from that position. He went on to sayBut in Australia a man can always get agricultural work at 20s. a week and his keep.",49

255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I do not think so, but it was stated in this House at least twenty times last session by honourable members opposite, that farm labourers received much less. There is the answer given by the Prime Minister far away to all the gentlemen who made those statements. He was askedCould you recommend people any particular States to go to? and repliedIt all depends on a man's trade. Queensland and Western Australia employ a large number of men in mining, but Victoria and New South Wales offer unlimited scope lo agriculturists. The interviewer saidDo you prefer living in Australia to Britain, Mr Fisher? That seems to have been a superfluous question. The honourable member repliedYes, certainly I do. Australia has been very good to me, and I think it is an ideal workingman's country. You see, Australia is so sparsely settled that a man does not get the fierce competition existing in older countries.

Ours is always an appeal to reason, and therefore when they talk of the reasoning powers of the head of our party they touch us on a very tender spot. However, I am in so generous a mood to-night that I shall not retaliate, except to advise the Prime in Minister when next he goes abroad not to do that kind of thing on his return.

285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That could not be called a matter of substance. It dealt said. only with the relationship of Australia with the Colonial Office, and a proposal making better use of the High Commiswhen sioners. I.do not know that the honourable member waxed very enthusiastic even over that minor proposition. The honourable member made a very tame speech about it. Altogether the result is that the Conto ference has not furthered the Imperial tical relationship at all.

There are many things to be done, even in the process of develophad ment along our present, lines, well worth journeying to London to consider, and wherever some of these stand to the credit tions of the delegation. But really the ber of proposals that were "" turned little down"" peremptorily, and after the memslightest debate in some cases, seems to suggest that we are not yet ready for closer reImperial political relations, and that the Imperial frame-work remains absolutely undisturbed so far as the mission is conthe cerned. In my opinion, our relations to the Imperial Govermnent are no better The which Prime Minister has plumed himself since the coming back on two facts. "" First of all, he claims that we have the right now to make an independent treaty with a foreign an nation without reference to the Imperial Government; and, secondly, that he has it been promised that the Imperial Governwill consult us in any matter likely the to affect the Empire as a whole before taking definite action. Does the Prime Minister think that that is a fair deal? To me it seems a one-sided affair, since we the right to be consulted before the alterImperial Government moves finally, while claim the right to move finally ourselves without consulting the Imperial Government. I am very much surprised that Mr. Asquith, Mr Lloyd George, or any Imperial Minister agreed to that for one in; and I can only imagine that, if they Imdid, they wished, in a sense, to humour by the Prime Minister. I am the more inclined to think it is a claim of the Prime HarMinister which has not been discussed with the Imperial Government.",51
286,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I do not think it was to humour us, or that that was quite what I",51
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I hope I am for not misquoting the honourable gentleman I say he claimed that as one of the great gains, of his visit Home. Am I right? The Prime Minister is evidently not in a humorous or a very courteous mood to-night, since he disdains even say whether I am quoting him rightly. I poli can only take the newspaper interview, : which appeared in either the Argus or the ThereAge, or both, as followsOn the subject of the commercial treaties entered into by the Dominions, he (the Prime said that he now regarded it as peropen for any Dominion to enter into a treaty with a foreign nation without it to the Imperial Government. In the same connection the Imperial GovernmentHe links the two things, together ;. I do notundertaken that the Dominions would be informed of any pending commercial treaties possible, before any serious negotiawith other nations were commenced. numWhere is the reciprocity in that? . Mr FISHER - The words "" affecting the Dominions "" ought to be there.",51
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"There is no such - qualification here. But even so, I doubt if that carries the honourable .gentleman much - further. I take it that almost any treaty affects the Dominions. Our trade is almost as widespread in its ramifications, and almost as varied, if not of quite such volume, as the trade of ttie Mother Country. All sorts of commercial relations affecting the Mother Country affect us also; and I doubt if it would be possible for the Mother Country ito make ;a treaty of substance or importance without affecting the Colonies, or for us to negotiate any such treaty without' affecting the Imperial Government. There ought - to ;be absolute fairness, - equality, and reciprocity in those matters which profoundly affect the relations of the Empire as a whole. We ought not to negotiate treaties without paying the Imperial Government the compliment of consulting it, and neither should the Imperial authorities conclude treaties without reference to the Dominions. 'There »re other .aspects '©f #ie Imperial Conference 'to which I 'shouldl 'like to refer, but I .must pass on to Other matters. whole position seems to - me as .summed up by the Times, which is not .an unfriendly - critic of - the present .Prime Minister, and is certainly a warm .advocate of all that tends to the closer political organization of the Empire. The Times saysNo .part of the Empire can be a part of Empire merely at such times as suits its venience. Either it flies the British ;flag or it does not. There is no middle course. To war in common and peace in common is the ordinary undertaking of any two Powers which enter 'into an offensive - and defensive - alliance. It must be manifest that Imperial :paitnership can have no - stability - if based upon a weaker sense of mutual obligation 'than that which two allied people 'however remote 'their systems and their race - day Iby the This applies to all the Imperial relations, as well as ito the flag. The Prime ister is pluming himself on what is not all a fair reciprocal .relationship, but a selfish one which can rhave no ;perpeople manency. I should now like to say a .word or two on the question of - pledges the-referenda. I hope that the "" Glorious 26th"" may be held to cancel the :to "" Glorious 13th."" During last session we on this side did not take very much stock in the number thirteen, but we ginning to ithink that it is not such a number after - all-no t - so very unlucky, when .considered - with its multiples. The ""Glorious 26th"" cannot cancel the Government out just yet-worsee luck for the country-bu t it certainly has wiped out all .stigma attaching to - the 13th April last year. I hope, amongst other things, that the 26th has cancelled the selfcomplacency of honourable members opposite; and, although they are displaying !a 'little just now, I cannot .help thinking it rather partakes of the .nature of Dutch courage. During ilast session the humblest member of the 'Labour party would sit .alone - on those benches, and jeer out 'something about the 13th, and they - all looked down on us c-ver here with the utmost condescension. I 'hope that since the 26lih - that - attitude will cease. Mr Frazer/-We have not ""gagged"" honourable members opposite, .as they "" gagged "" us I",52
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I hope we shall be ""' gagged '"" if ever we - make 'sudli 'a politically indecent display as honourable - members -'opposite 'did; we - shall deserve to -'be "" gagged "" if we ever imitate their tactics. The people of Australia - are beginning ito 'appreciate .'honourable 'members - opposite and (heir propaganda at their proper The value. A year or 'two ago there was a feeling that the La'bour party - ought to be given ! a trial. That party 'have modified their programme in recent years to 'such an - extent 'as, in many instances, to trench on a good Liberal programme, and many good Liberal planks have been annexed and put into the fheir propaganda; - so that people began to conthink that no serious harm could result if make fhey were given a trial at the helm. But - immediately the La'bour 'Government began their career, they concocted means for the destruction of the States-for whittling away the powers of the States .until they 'binds - should Ibeeome mere municipal bodies, instead of the sovereign States they are toImperial Statutes, which allocate their powers and our own. When the MinLabour Government began to put their at mauling hands on the State Constitutions - rather and powers in 'this way, many of the very who gave them - a trial decided that: they were going beyond their platform and to the .people, and were initiating --a programme - which 'had not 'been submitted ithe'electors. It was because of this that the (Labour Government were ;given such short - shrift on the 2.6th April-; and ihe are beLabour party did - more to defeat their bad own propaganda'then - than'even we on this - side could hope to do. There was .such a mu'ltiform .and .varied ;array of arguments used to suit the particular complexion and prejudices of the various States as to make it impossible to know exactly where the party stood with reference to the referenda. For instance, at a great meeting in the Sydney Town Hall we were told by the Attorney-General that, unless those powers were given, the Commonwealth Parliament would be like "" limping cripples,"" unable to move in the direction of carrying out the wish and will of the people as expressed at the last election. I am sorry the Attorney General is not here, and particularly regret the cause. Trusts, which, on the authority of the Prime Minister to-night, are not doing much damage, so far as the food and home comforts of the people are concerned, were regarded by the Attorney-General as very bad in some places, and very good in others. For instance, when addressing the Chamber of Manufactures in Tasmania, he was emphatic in the statement that the Government were not against trusts, but against any damage they might do, and that the powers were required as reserve powers, not necessarily lo be used, but to be held, in order to prevent the trusts, which were rather favoured than otherwise, from going to extremes. On the other hand, if a Labour constituency were visited, the tune was immediately altered, and trusts were described as octopi crushing ancl squeezing the life-blood out of the people. Altogether, the community were really flabbergasted, and unable to judge where the Attorney-General and his confreres stood in regard to trusts. the Prime Minister told the people that the power of nationalization was not necessarily to be used, and while the Attorney-General said they were reserve powers that were asked for, Senator Pearce, two days later, in Hobart, said, "" We intend to use the powers, and that intention is known to the trusts. Hence all this trouble. If these powers are given to us, we should proceed to nationalize the sugar, the shipping, and the tobacco industries. We mean to use them, and they know ih right enough."" While he was saying that, the Attorney General was telling the people here that the powers asked for were only reserve powers. In London, the Prime Minister told the same fairy tale. He said that there was no question of nationalizing :any industry; that the Government only desired the power to do so. The tender regard of the Prime Minister, and of the Premier of New M-r. Joseph Cook. South Wales, while in London, for vested interests and the investing public was very remarkable. When the Labour parly was in opposition, its members constantly denounced the investing public. The Stock Exchange was the bete noire of the present Postmaster-General.",52
290,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What did I say about it?,53
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The honourable member continually asserted that we were doing all we could do to favour and benefit the Stock Exchange. He declared that the appointment of accountants to investigate the accounts of the Telephone Department was a sop to the Stock Exchange.,53
292,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I might have said Chamber of Commerce.,53
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The honourable member referred to both bodies. There would be no difficulty in finding the passages in HansardThis is a statement of the attitude of the Prime Minister when in LondonAsked whether he had found that the advent of the Labour party to power had disturbed the British investors, he replied, "" There is still an uneasy feeling among some ill-informed circles."" . . . He emphatically declared, however, that this fear was groundless. . . . "" The Labour parly's proposals and policy contemplate no attack on legitimate investments. Their only aim is the safe development of the Commonwealth. It is quite foreign to the Labour party's policy to attack special interests."" He said to the moneyed people of Great Britain, "" Your investments will be quite While safe; send your money to Australia."" The Premier of New South Wales said much the same thing. This is one of his statementsStatistics showing the expansion of business and the increases ih the people's production and expenditure had also helped to ensure the confidence of the investors, and to destroy the canards of interested politicians.",53
294,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What is wrong with such statements?,53
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The members of the Labour party tell different tales, according to their environment. When the Prime Minister is among capitalists, and those controlling the money power of the world, his voice changes. They discovered in Great Britain that he has two voices.",53
296,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Who said so?,53
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The Morning Post.,53
298,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That was in regard to Stead's interview, the accuracy of which was denied by the Prime Minister.",53
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It was that the which gave occasion for the comment. The newspaper accepted the Prime Miniswas ter's denial, but said that it had been learned in London, while he was there, that he spoke with two voices. No men mocracy. can be more accommodating than the Labour leaders to those whom they denounce from the public platforms. The Government has recently received the encomiums of many of the capitalists Australia. The Chambers of Commerce speak in the highest terms of the good work which the Ministers are doing. How Labour members manage to ingratiate themConstitution selves with both sides I do not know. Liberals went on to the Labour platforms they would be told, "" You are not Caucus men, and we have no time for you."" It was surprising to hear a leading polielastic tician on the Labour side tell during the recent campaign, not to go near a Liberal meeting. That was playing pretty low down.",54

306,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Is not that true?,54
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"No . Constitutions are not to be treated like ordinary Acts of Parliament, which may be scrapped of from time to time. In scrapping a Constitution, you need to take care you do not scrap the liberties enjoyed under it.

313,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"A variegated the voice, if the honourable member will have a definition, is one which declares in this case that the money power is the one thing to be destroyed here, and the thing to be coaxed and approved in London. In Melrebourne, the Attorney-General told the people that the only way we could secure increased wages, particularly on the railways, was by voting for the referenda; going into the country districts of Victoria, he told agriculturalists that that was the only way to secure reduced fares and freights. I happened tofollow the honourable gentleman in. Orange, and saw by the local newspapers that some people there had been questioning him in regard to the' institution, known in Tasmania as "" Tattersall's."" Some of the good people of Orange were very much inclined to vote for these proposals if they would enable them to deal a blow at Tattersall's, and the Attorney-General told them, "" The, Federal Government is the only party that can deal with this institution in Tasmania."" When hewent to Hobart, he. solemnly assured the people, there that the, Federal Parliament, under the powers proposed to be taken, could not touch it.",54
314,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I was chairman of his meeting there, and he never mentioned the mattei.",55
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I say that is Tasmania theAttorney-General told, his audience that the powers proposed to. be taken, would not affect Tattersall's. Was, the honourable member chairman of aLl the. Attorney-General's meetings, in Tasmania?",55

317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"If I did, I withdraw die word Hobart,"" and' substitute for it the word ""Tasmania."" congratulate the honourable member on all he can get out of that. My statement is quite right. Tasmania being a very small State is keen on the question of State rights, and the Attorney-General assured the people there that they need have no fear in that regard. Their State rights, he said, were secured under the Constitution,, and no power could take them from them unless they agreed to their surrender. He termed the constitutional provision which gives Tasmania anequal voice with the larger States in the Senate the principle of "" Federal Democracy."" I do not know what Federal or State Democracy is, but I do know what Democracy itself is. The Attorney-General, however, invented this title for the Democracy of Tasmania, and he assured them that their State rights would not be interfered with. It was my business, of course, to quote to them the real Mr Hughes. I showed them how he had contemptuously referred to Tasmania as not being bigger than his own electorate, and how their State rights had been declared to outrage every principle of Democracy. Then we find that the Prime Minister, inmy ow.n electorate, invited the people to vote, for the referenda proposals as they would safeguard tke interests of the toiling masses, as well, as the interests of the investing public and. those who belong to the more fortunate part of the community. Senator MCGregor, who followed him, declared that everybody who was opposed t© theproposals was a lunatic. Then we had the manifesto, issued by the Government, in which we were solemnly adjured to look at America, where there had been a tremendous war, costing 600,000 lives and 2,ooo-,ooo,.ooo. dollars. The alternative toi voting for these proposals, said the manifesto, was possibly a repetitionof that state of affairs on: Australian soil. Statements like these, exaggerated and wrongin every - particular), could not. fail to have but. one effect. Then, again, we have heard a great deal about the literature circulated throughout the campaign, and it has been said many times during this debate that we made the question a party one. Tn. reply,, let me quote from a dodger which, was circulated throughout Tasmania. When the Labour party found thegroundslipping from under their feet, they turned on. the 1 old engines, and ground out the rfentime.itwhich has done service on so many occaI sionsWorking men and women : This is a party question, anational' party question. The Labour party is. thenational party. TheFusion, party is the anti-national party. Workers!' Look around you and you will find on the one side (the "" No "" side) solidly ranked in force, every sweater and monopolist, every Conservative and reactionary, every capitalistic paper without exception throughout Austialia, every parochial politician. On our side, stands Democracy. Another paragraph ranVote ""Yes."" This is a party question. One of the greatest party questions, if not the greatest, that Australia has yet had to face. The people are again opposed' by the force thathas oppressed them for centuries pastThe honourable member for Denison must have had something to do with this circular.",55
318,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I never saw it.,55
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It continues The fight is a continuation of the same, struggle for freedom that has. scarred the ages sine* greed first strove to fatten on its weaker brother; the issue-the pitiless, tearworn, heartrending issue-the same, Money versus Humanity. Vote ""Yes""^-This is a party question. The Federal Government has been elected by an overwhelming majority to carry out certain reforms. To obey the will of the people it asks for certain powers. Without those powers the will of the people cannot become the law. Vested interestsThe Prime Minister assured investors in London that they were not to be interfered withwould seek to choke the voice of Democracy by distortion of the issue; the same interests that the people have turned down. Could there be a more clear-cut party issue? Vote ""Yes."" This is a party question. There are many more paragraphs, each headed with leaded type, "" This is a party question."" "" Where do you stand? For Australia or against it . "" ",55
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It was authorized by the Bass Divisional Council of the W.P.L., whatever that may mean.",56
321,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,It means Women's Political League.,56
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It means the Workers' Political League, or, it should be, the Workers' Political Leg-pullers. In view of that statement, let us hear no more about the party issue which was raised in that contest. This was the last straw to which honourable members opposite clutched, and they worked the cry for all it was worth. However, the electors took a sane and reasonable view of their Australian duty, and ignored these party appeals to passion. I come now to the last quotation which I intend to make, and it is from an utterance by our old friend, Mr King O'Malley. He declared that all those who were opposed to the referendum wereadvocates of human slavery . . . whose lineal descendants were those in the United States who wished to extend the slave area so that the bloodhounds, with clots of human blood clinging to their hanging jaws, might chase escaping niggers over the plains of Western America. AH those who are against the referendum you can smell them before you can see them. What was the result of this appeal to the people? Every Liberal division voted to - preserve the Federal character of the Constitution. Twenty-eight Labour divisions, irrespective of the views which they held upon other matters, also voted in favour Of Federation as again Unification. Those divisions comprise Calare, Cook",56
323,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The honourable member's party won at the referendum?,56
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Yes .,56
325,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Then why rub it in?,56
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I hope that we shall never rub it in as my honourable friend and his party rubbed into us the results of the 13th April last year. I am merely tabulating the results of the recent referenda. I think I may fairly be permitted to enumerate the electorates which had the good sense to turn down the proposals submitted to them. Those electorates included Dalley and East Sydney. Where is brother West? What ""was he doing during the campaign? They also comprise Gwydir, the Hunter, Macquarie, and the Nepean. In reference to the. Nepean division, we are told that the result means nothing. At any rate, we shall see what we shall see. I was very glad to'learn that my old friends at Lithgow also turned down these proposals.",56
327,Mr CANN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Onl y 1,100 electors voted in that constituency out of 5,000 whose names are on the roll.",56
328,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Did the honourable member say his ""friends"" at Lithgow?",56
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Yes , I did. I had a very successful meeting there.",56
330,Mr CANN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,How did the audience treat the honourable member?,56
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Ver y well indeed ; and whoever told the honourable member anything different misrepresented the facts. I could never hope to have a better meeting. The other electorates which voted against the Government proposals included New England, Riverina, Robertson, and Werriwa. Even the profundity of Mr. Hall's arguments, with all his constitutional law, could not avert that result. Then the electorate of Bourke voted in the same direction. Where was the representative of that constituency, with all his turgid rolling eloquence? The other divisions which voted "" No "" also included Corangamite, Corio, and Gippsland. The people of Gippsland are good sensible Federalists, and do not believe in Unification. Then there were the electorates of Indi, Wannon, Adelaide, and Boothby. The last-named constituency ran away from the Minister of External Affairs for once. The electorates of Brisbane, Herbert, and Wide Bay, also voted "" No."" Even the Prime Minister's constituency would not be "" bull-dosed.""",56
332,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"In the electorate of Herbert, there was a majority of over 3,000 on the "" Yes "" side.",56
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Then that constituency is wrongly issued in my list. The electors of Wide Bay voted "" No,"" as did also those of Bass, Denison, and Darwin.",56
334,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What about the electorate of Yarra?,56
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I need not trouble myself with the electors who were so benighted as to vote "" Yes."" How is the position affected by the result of the referendum ? That is a pertinent question to ask. J n this connection, it is well to remember that the Attorney-General declared that without these powers we should be "" limping cripples.""",56
336,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,So we are. about the sugar industry?,57
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Are the Governmatter ment "" limping cripples"" so f ar as their to do. ability to help the workers of Australia is concerned ?",57
338,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Yes .,57

340,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Every other Ministry signal will occupy the same position.,57
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"If the stateremain. ment of the Minister of External Affairs be true, he and his colleagues are occupying their positions with degradation to themgramme, selves, and to the political institutions of Australia.",57
342,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,To the degradation of those who kept the Federal Constitution tinuesin hobbles.,57
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Any Ministry which clings to office, which has behind it a great majority, and which tells the counwage. try that they are "" limping cripples,"" is decannot grading its position, and ought not to tinue in power for ten minutes. Ministers have been defeated on all the essentials their policy, and yet they still office, place, and power, whilst telling the people that they ""are "" limping cripples "" who cannot help them.",57
344,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The honourable memus ber's party would limp still more badly.,57
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I hope we the should never attempt to succeed to the posithe tions occupied by Ministers i them. But there is another alternative which I might mention with bated breath.,57
346,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,What is that,57
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I dare not menvoted tion it, because I should have some honorthey able members opposite flying at my throat. of thousands of votes. The Attorney-General did not make this statement on the spur of the moment when general election. he was disappointed and depressed. He took a few days to survey the situation, that is the conclusion at which he arrived. He also saidThe Commonwealth still remains unable to legislate in respect of New Protection, trusts to count them. and combines, monopolies, industrial matters, navigation and shipping, and those other matters which are closely related with them. It cannot make a general company law. I was very much surprised to hear that that is soIt cannot grant compensation to seamen. What are the people of Australia going to do about it? I think that there is a prior question to What that one. It is not so much what are the people of Australia going to do about the as what this Government is going",57
348,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"We did not vote "" No.""",57
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The AttorneyFor my part, I see no reason to alter my opinion. I feel perfectly convinced that the defeat will in the near future be turned into a victory. The facts and circumstances necessitating the amendment of the Constitution We were elected last year by the people of Australia, by the biggest vote ever recorded during the history of the Commonwealth. We were elected to carry out a certain definite prowhich was clearly set before the electors, and vigorously denounced by our opponents. The Attorney-General, after enumerating t,he legislation passed last session, conBut all attempts to carry out the rest of our programme must prove abortive. We cannot give effect to ' the New Protection. We cannot insure to every worker a fair and reasonable We cannot nationalize monopolies. We deal effectively with trusts and combines. conWe cannot pass general navigation laws. Is that correct, and, if it is, why is a of Navigation Bill included"" in the programme clutch to for the session?We cannot provide compensation to seamen. Here, then, is the question. The people put us in by the largest vote on record to do certain definite work. The Constitution will not permit to do it. We ask that the Constitution be amended in order to enable us to do what people sent us into Parliament, by the largest vote on record, to do. The people, by smallest vote on record, refused to agree f they vacated to these amendments. Regarding that small vote, I have only to make this observation, that if all those ? who voted on the previous occasion had with my honourable friends opposite, would not have won by many scores The poll at the referendum was 148,000 less than at the The majority was 250,000, so that, if every one ot"" the and 148,000 votes had been counted on the Labour side, they would still have been in a minority of over 100,000 votes.",57
350,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,That is not the way The honourable member should count all those who did not vote as being on our side. That is the method he adopted at the last election.,57
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That is the method which I am following. said that if every one of the number had been on the side of the Labour party they would still have been in a minority of over 100,000.",58
352,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,No .,58
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"There are the facts- a poll of 148,000 less than at the general election, and a majority of 250,000 against the referenda. My honourable friend is here, and his colleague is away sick, but it is time that we knew what the Government intend to do about the very serious situation which has arisen. Do they intend to ignore it? Are they going to treat the verdict as if nothing had happened? Let them listen to the wise words of an eminent statesman in another part of the world as to the seriousness of the results of the referenda on the position of the Ministry as representing responsible government in AustraliaMr Asquith, while disclaiming any intention of making any controversial reference to the Commonwealth's internal affairs, said he did - pretend to say what effects the decisive majorities against the referenda proposals might have in Australia, but he asked whether, if the like situation occurred in England, such a rebuff would not seriously damage the prestige and authority of any Government in upholding the legislative and administrative system developed and perfected in Great Britain, and the basis of the general lines of policy the country desired their representatives to pursue. It is quite clear, from this statement, that the British Prime Minister would have found it his 3uty instantly to return the seals of office to trie King had this referendum taken place with a similar result in Great Britain.",58
354,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,tH e does not say anything like that.,58
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"He could not say it, of course, because he points out that he is careful in the statement which he is making. But to any one reading between the lines it must be clear what was - in his mind, namely, that the referenda sent the Government reeling back, and denied them the power to carry out their own policy. In this respect he agrees with Ministers themselves. But, although they are limping cripples, tliey are here. I do not know how they are going to get along; I suppose that they will crawl, if fhey cannot walk or run-perhap s limp along. Here they are with every vestige of authority and power stripped from them, on the statement of the Attorney-General, to carry out their programme. Although all their efforts have been "" rendered abor1 have tive,"" yet they come here as if nothing had happened, and submit to us a string of propositions, some of which they declare themselves not to be in the possession of the requisite power to carry out. However, there is one thing outstanding in all this debate which I think is very satisfactory to both sides. These proposals are to be re-submitted to the electors. We have the positive statement of the Prime Minister on that point; we also have the definite statement of almost every other Minister. I hope that there will be.no shirking of that issue between now and the next general election. Let it go to the constituencies again, and let my honourable friends have all the advantage which they think their advocacy will give them. Let the issue from now on be straightforwardly faced, and I for one shall welcome the next appeal. It will be a great deal more decisive than the last one.",58
356,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I think it will ; we not shall have none of the other side returned next time.,58
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I do not believe that my honourable friends will ever persuade the people of Australia to tear up their Federal Constitution, however prolonged the issue may be, or however potent their eloquence and their organization. My honourable friends have raised one of the issues in Australia which rises far above party. I believe that the Australian people in their sanity, wisdom, and deliberate judgment, and in view of the teachings of history, will turn down these proposals as often as they may be submitter! to them.",58
358,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,You will get a surprise.,58
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"If we"" get a surprise, I hope it will not be a greater one than my honourable friends got on the 26th April.",58
360,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,We were not surprised at all. If we did not let you win once there would be an end of it. It did not concern us last time whether we won or not; we wanted you to be here. ;,58
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Her e is another statement which I hope will go with the rest, that on the last occasion they were simply fooling the people, or trying to take rises out of them, that they were not earnest and sincere in their advocacy of the proposals, and it did not matter to them whether they were carried or not. I hope that that will go down in Hansard* because it will be a very useful thing to tell the .people.  honourable member, it wiil go down, but not as that of any one else.",58
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I hope that all the statements are going down. The honourable member for Gwydir said that last time it did not matter whether they won or lost.,59
363,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,If it had not been for Hansard you would not have had any arguments to use last time.,59
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"There is the position. Our position will be as it was on the last occasion- a declaration of the Federal principle as applied to the Government of Australia. I shall quote again, as I did at the referendum, these wise words of His Honour Mr Justice Higgins, when the industrial power was incorporated in the Constitution many years agoOX course, I shall be told that this is a matter for Ibe States. I admit that if a dispute is confined to a State it ought to be dealt with by that State. . . . All I ask for by this amendment is that just as Victoria can deal with Victorian 'trade disputes, that just as New South W.ailes can deal with New South Wales trade disputes . . . so the Federal Parliament shall be enabled to deal with disputes which are Australian. I say that that is a Federal axiom, true now,, and true for all time. It marks a distinction from the un-Federal proposals of my honourable friends opposite. I have a profound belief in the discernment of the people of this country. I have a profound belief that, in their ultimate judgment, they are nearly always right. They may make a mistake, and come to a wrong decision occasionally; but, given time, they soon turn to a sound, wise view of political proposals. I also believe that, with the wisdom and energy and clarity of view pos sessed by the great body of the electors of Australia, they will repeat the same vote when next they are faced with the same issues at the general election.",59
365,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Wentworth) [10.12] The chief impression I gained when listening to the eloquent and able speech of my honourable friend the member for Parramatta was one which, I think, will be shared by all honourable members on this side of the House. That impression was one of the extraordinary difference in the manner with which honourable manbers opposite greeted the results of the last two appeals to the Australian electors. On the previous occasion my honourable friends were honestly triumphant. They viewed the result of the appeal to the electors with something more than public satisfaction. They felt that, whatever was in store for the country, they - and especially those of them who occupied seats on the front Ministerial benchwere "" all right."" The result of the last appeal, on the other hand, leaves them - comparatively unmoved. Their policy seems to have gone by the board, but they themselves are "".all right."" And that is what I understood to be .the idea underlying the interjection of the honourable member for Gwydir, for the honesty :and straightforwardness of which this House is deeply indebted to him. He told us that the results of the referenda did not matter, so long as the members of the Opposition continued to sit in opposition in this Chamber.",59
366,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"If the results did not matter, why did we work so hard to secure a different decision?",59
367,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I observe that since the last appeal to ithe people my honourable friend who interjects has tried to disguise his identity. Whilst I was listening to the honourable member for Parramatta, I am bound to .say that, for a moment or two, I felt that he was going to persuade honourable members opposite to throw the cause of self interest overboard, and again face the electorate upon their wide altruistic mission of bettering Australian conditions by means of the great, noble Labour policy and platform. For a moment, I say, I thought that he was about to convert them; but when I looked at honourable members again, when I saw the happy, the comfortable, the almost- I may say it without offence-well-fe d appearance of those who occupy the benches opposite, I 1 confess that I felt a slight feeling of satisfaction that the severe course of dissolution was not about to overtake them for some months to come.",59
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I omitted to quote the Attorney-General as saying, immediately after the referenda, that his party did not regard the result as a vote of want of confidence.",59
369,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I could not understandthat one so adroit as the Attorney-General is should have so betrayed his Ministerial security as to make the statement which has been, attributed to him. I - could not think that he, a Minister of the Crown and acting leader of his party, would have stated without qualification that the results of the referenda made his party powerless is the. country for the remainder of the period of this Parliament ! Such a confession would have been tantamount 'to admitting that he would be false to his trust to the people of Australia if he remained in officeunder those: circumstances. However, I desire to pass, away from these disagreeable topics, and to consider some of the more pleasing episodes of the recess through which we have, just passed. Reference has been made in this House to the. work done at the recent. Imperial Conference. I am not one of those who cavil at the late meeting of this Parliament. I . believe - that the work done at the Imperial Conference, and the work attempted there, was well worthy of the attention of the whole Australian people. For, after all, what is done at theseperiodical Conferences affects as vitally the Australian people through their security,, and the insurance upon their labour,, asalmost any action that can be taken in the Parliaments of the Dominions. I was rather gratified with thespirit in which the Prime Minister and the other members, of tlic delegation visited the Old Country.. The first statement made by the Prime Minister upon his arrival in England was one which, I think, showed the great advance which my honourable friends opposite, have made in the direction of racial unionism during the. last few years.. When I say that I was gratified, I do not wish to. make honourable members opposite uncomfortable. I should not think of doing that.. I shall quote some of his remarks, because, coming f roim the source they did, they will be invaluable in educating public opinion as to the true position of Australia in the. Imperial Constitution, and as affording a gratifying instanceof the change of opinion on the part of the Prime Minister. I intend to quote first the statement which was made by him to the London Daily Mail on the 16th May. This was practically my honourable friend's first statement in London.",59
370,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Is this another message from "" Julia ""?",60
371,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"No ; this is quite on the other side. The Prime Minister stated that ""we""-that is Australiaare prepared to put at the disposal of the British Admiralty in time of danger to the Empire the Australian Navy.",60
372,Mr RYRIE,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The Prime Minister did not say that the other night.,60
373,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I - am gratified to know that he said so in London when he was free from any of those influences which might divert his better judgment.,60
374,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,He always says the same thing,60
375,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I wish we could say the same of my honourable friend. It is not in any cavilling spirit that I say that the opinion I have quoted showsthe remarkable change in the views of our honourable friends opposite of recent years. The change has been brought about by external' pressure upon Australia. I eanremember the time when our honourable friends oppositeused, to say that: expenditure upon defence was a wicked waste of money. They unanimously supported a resolution in this House that the defence of Australia must not cost more-than about £1,000,000 per annum.",60
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,".£500,000 .",60
377,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,That was when the other side had control.,60
378,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"No ; it ""was when my honourable friends oppositethought they had control, and had not. I have forgotten the exact amount that was suggested, but I think that our honourable friends considered that, taken together, the expenditure upon naval and military defence should not exceed £1,000,000 per annum.",60
379,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"No , £500,000.",60
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"And later they made it £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",60
381,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Yes , eventually. It was £700,000 plus the amount paid under the hated Naval Agreement, which would bring the total to nearly £1,000,000. Honourable members opposite have, since that time, been greatly influenced by the increasing external pressure upon the Commonwealth. They have begun to realise what every sane person must realise in time - that, after all, the defence of Australia is not merely a question of defending Australian coasts, but of defending the interests of Australia wherever they may be threatened. Faced with that obligation, honourable members opposite have had to look beyond the shores of Australia to the progress of the produce of Australian labour across the trade routes of the world. They found that the question was not to be considered from any parish-pump point of view, but as a matter for co-operation with the Mother Country for our mutual advantage. It is because they have begun to realise that view that the Prime Minister, when free from the restraints of any influence which might be exercised in this country, was able, on landing in the Mother Country, to make such a statement as that which I have just quoted. I do not think that the Imperial Conference was at all wasted. It has undoubtedly taken us a considerable step onwards, and, although that was not done on the initiative of our delegation, I do not quarrel with them on that account. They were extremely fortunate in being able to take part in the first Conference at which questions of Imperial foreign relations were laid open to the representatives of the self-governing Dominions. As an Australian, I have often thought that, after all, whilst we claim to tie a self-governing people, we are without full powers of self-government. Our position is really this: We are charged with the duty of defence, but we have not the opportunity of knowing officially against what we have to defend ourselves. The diplomatic agencies, the expert knowledge, and the channels of international information are at: the disposal and direction of only one of the Parliaments of the Empire. The other Parliaments have, in the past, been absolutely without any information of an official character upon foreign affairs. We may trace the effect nf that in the past history nf defence movements in the Australian .States. Honourable members, and especial Iv those who represent Victoria, will renu'ivtber the stir made in Australia in the early eighties which led to the creation of a series of Australian Navies. These Navies owed their rise to the friction existing nt that time between the Mother Country and Russia, and to the presence in the Pacific of a Russian Fleet. The newspapers, and not the Governments, brought this danger to the minds of the people of the various Australian Colonies, and they all started to create Navies. Victoria began on a big scale by importing two post/ - aptains and establishing a Navy of no less than thirteen vessels; and, for the time, the Victorian Navy was by no means a /natter for contempt. It was organized on I'lficient Imperial models, so far as they could be arrived at at the time, and every' thing went on merrily for a few years. In the early nineties financial depression came upon the Australian people, and the interest of the newspapers""was diverted from the Mr Kelly. menace of the Russian Fleet in the Pacific to the crying need for economy in the finances of the various States. Although the Russian Fleet was still in the East, and the necessity for the defence of Australia continued to exist, if it existed in the early eighties, Australian politicians, being without any knowledge of, or responsibility for, foreign affairs affecting the Empire, were easily able to divert their minds from the problem of defence to the problem of retrenchment, to which the press and the people insisted they should devote their attention. As a result, the Navies of the different Colonies were wiped out of existence as offering the easiest opportunity for a retrenchment without offending voters. This extraordinary piece of Colonial history was due to the fact that the Australian people, whilst being self-governing in local affairs, were not given full information in respect of their national position. In ray humble judgment, we shall never be able to make sane preparation to defend ourselves until we have an official and continuous means of knowing what our risks really are. This Conference, for the first time, has had discussed in secret amongst the representatives of the various Dominions the risks to which all our people are exposed. I understand that the conversation on the subject was absolutely full and frank. But how soon afterwards was it that a new situation arose in European politics, .which has not yet been removed from the chess-board ? The Minister of External' Affairs will know that only a week or two before the German Empire sent war-ships to Agadir Bay, he was having placed at his disposal all the knowledge with which the British Foreign Office was endowed, and there was not one whisper at that Conference, nor could there be, of this new move in the international rivalry of nations, though it is one which vitally affects every producer in Australia. If any one of the possible contingencies occurred, and the ambition of the German Empire was to establish a naval base at Agadir, that naval base would command the approach to the markets in Europe of the produce of more than half the Australian population on the last available trade route open to us in time of war. I quote this, not to minimize the effect of what was done at the Imperial Conference, but to show that, with the best desire in the world for mutual co-operation, there will always be difficulties in the way of the proper participation of Colonial peoples in the affairs of Empire, until there is some reconstruction of the Imperial Constitution which will enable Australian representatives to be constantly in touch with these things. I admit that the time is not yet opportune to begin to discuss them constructively, but the time is opportune to point out the difficulties in front of ns.",60
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The difficulties will be much greater now because of the promise to consult us before doing anything.,62
383,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"That makes our position infinitely better. I cannot help feeling that you cannot bring about a better state affairs until you put the whole difficulty the limelight. That is what will be done now more or less so far as it can safely done by the Mother Country consulting the Dominions, and showing them the importDominions ance of foreign treaties before asking their participation in them.",62
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"We cannot make any recommendations'without taking the reconstantly sponsibility for them, and, in the absence of machinery, we must take the responsigates bility without full knowledge and disof-date cussion.",62
385,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Of course, we must take the responsibility, and the moment the Auswith tralian people recognise that we have to responsibility for all that is done name, they will begin to see that it will be worth their while to think of getting into the Imperial cart, instead of being dragged at its tail. I compliment Ministers upon the clearness with which they have seen the necessity for Australia knowing, in interests of Australians, what is taking place in the wide world beyond our borders. 1 compliment them upon the frankness with last session. which they admitted the great step forward taken at the Imperial Conference in this regard, and I sincerely hope they will folmade low up what has been done there by arranging that, whichever Minister holds the portfolio of External Affairs in the Commonwealth, shall have an opportunity, at least once every year, of going to England to consult with the British Foreign Minister as regards the foreign perils of people.",62

387,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I would make it as often as possible. ['9] The difficulty is that foreign alliances are entered into for purposes of self interest, and, generally speaking, to arrive at a safe balance, which will prevent any disturbance of the public peace. The friend of today may be the enemy of tomorrow, and the man who is charged with directing the foreign policy of England will not be likely, as I was informed when in England, to place upon record with anybody not directly responsible to himself or to the same authority-the House of Commons-as he himself is, information which might be extremely inconvenient if it leaked out ten or twelve years hence. Consequently, he can only afford, in the public of interests, to be truly frank if he is face to into face with the person to whom he is giving the informaiion. He will give that inforbe mation freely and frankly, as I understand the position, to any representative of the who cares to go to consult him. The office of Minister of External Affairs of the Commonwealth would at last become worthy of the name if the Minister could be obtaining such information as that which we are now proud that our delehave received, but which will be outa year from today. It must be constantly renewed if the name of "" External Affairs Ministry"" is to be anything more than a mere pretence. Before dealing the balance of the affairs of the Contake ference, I may be allowed, perhaps, leave in our to continue my remarks tomorrow. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
