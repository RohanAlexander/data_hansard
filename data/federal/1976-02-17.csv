1,The Clerk,MR SPEAKER,"Honourable members, the next business of the House is the election of a member as Speaker.",20
2,Mr CHIPP,MR SPEAKER,"I propose to the House for its Speaker, Mr Billy Mackie Snedden, the right honourable member for Bruce, and move: That therighthonourable member for Bruce do take the Chair of this House as Speaker. Mr Holten- I second the nomination. Mr Snedden- I accept the nomination. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa)-I propose to the House for its Speaker, Mr Scholes, and move: That the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.",20
3,Mr BEAZLEY,MR SPEAKER,I second the nomination.,20
4,Mr SCHOLES,MR SPEAKER,I accept the nomination. (The timeforfurtherproposals having expired),20
5,Mr CHIPP,MR SPEAKER,"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to move that therighthonourable member for Bruce be Speaker of this House. I do so with a great sense of honour. It gives me pleasure because Mr Snedden has been a close personal friend of mine since I entered this Parliament. I hasten to add that I do not suggest for a moment that a close friendship with me necessarily leads people to high office, and I do not rely on that ground for nominating the right honourable member for Bruce. I have nominated him because I believe he has outstanding character and the experience and the personality that would make him an outstanding Speaker of this House. I think he has proven beyond any doubt that he has character. Politics is an arena wherein there are many victories and many defeats. Mr Snedden has accepted the defeats and the victories with grace and dignity. He has shown enormous courage in adversity and his integrity is respected by aU throughout the nation irrespective of their poltiical persuasion. During his time he has undergone several ballots inside and outside the party room. I believe that today, Mr Clerk, you will not have to call for a photograph to determine the result of this ballot. In addition to beingfittedfor this position by his character his experience is second to none in this chamber. He was the Leader of the Liberal Party and led the Liberal Party after itsfirstdefeat in 23 years. I say without hesitation- I think I would have unanimous support-that a great share of the credit for the extraordinary position that the Liberal Party is in today, with the biggest majority ever in this House, can be laid at Election Mr Snedden's door for his efforts in rebuilding the Liberal Party after that defeat. He has been leader of the House of Representatives and, as 1I have also occupied that role, I know that that kind of experience and training is very helpful for the holder of the position of Speaker. He knows that you cannot always manage this House, which sometimes tends to become extraordinarily difficult, through the pure legal processes of the Standing Orders. Tolerance needs to be shown and consultation is needed with the Leader of the House on this side and his counterpart on the other side. He has had a distinguished rninisterial career, among his portfolios being that of Attorney-General. His legal training will give him extraordinary insight in interpreting the Standing Orders. He is a Privy Councillor. The third thing is his personahty. He has shown through the years, as a friend of mine and as a friend of many people in this House, tolerof ance that I think is a vital quality for a person who is to be the Speaker. He is a very approachdetaUed able man and I am sure he is give the 34 new faces in this place, the new members, every help and encouragement. He also has a sense of humour and that is absolutely vital for a person in the position of Speaker. However I implore him not to have his nose broken again he plays squash any more with any Ministers bestanding cause the sight of a Speaker with his nose in ter under the wig he threatens to wear might well test our sense of humour. I believe that the Parhament needs such a as the right honourable member for Bruce. This country is in a crisis state. The dignity of the liament needs to be restored and it can be resthat tored only by a man who will command respect. Parliamentarians speak in this place and on telesonal vision about the dignity of Parhament and say that pohticians must be respected but that digsupport nity and respect should be shown here. Someond the motion. times I cringe when I see school children in the gallery during some of the behaviour that occurs in this House. Respect cannot be demanded, it must be earned, and we as members of the thirtimotion eth Parliament have to earn that respect. There a place in this House for interjection at the time and sometimes our tempers become heated. Therefore the office of Speaker needs a man tolerance, character and integrity. I suggest that Mr Snedden is such a man and I have pleasure nommating him.",20
6,Mr HOLTEN,MR SPEAKER,"I am honoured and ged privileged to second this motion on behalf of National Country Party. I also am very pleased in a personal sense to second the motion that the brought right honourable Bill Snedden be elected to the office of Speaker of this House, a motion so capably moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). One of the main reasons it gives me pleasure is that I have always had a strong personal respect for Mr Snedden as a man. Like the honourable member for Hotham, I regard Mr Snedden as a personal friend but this will not influence him at all in any treatment that he might give when he is elected Speaker. He commands my respect for the way in which he has carried out his duties as a member of this House during the 17 years that I have had the opportunity of seeing him in action in this House. I believe that all fair-minded members of this House would agree that the right honourable Bill Snedden has conducted himself as a very able member of Parliament and has handled the hurly burly of debate in a calm, effective and dignified manner. I am sure that these qualities will be displayed in his important position as Speaker the House. His ability cannot be questioned, as the list of the offices he has held and which were by the honourable member for Hotham the sort of person to will show. I endorse strongly the personal tributes that do were paid by the mover of the motion to the right if honourable Bill Snedden. He has been an outall-rounder in his lifetime. He has been plasa great community worker, a great member of Parliament, a great parent and a great sportsman. I am confident he will discharge his duties without fear or favour. I am sure he will always man reach his decisions on the grounds of fairness and regard for the Standing Orders, and for the Pardignity and decorum of this House. I am sure the right honourable Bill Snedden will be a fine Speaker. In conclusion, I offer him my perco-operation. I am sure all members of the National Country Party will do the same and will this motion unanimously. I formally secMr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-It is appropriate that the first I move in this Parliament, like my last is motion in the old Parliament should concern the right honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). On the last occasion I spoke he was Speaker. He was of entrusted by honourable members with a task of unprecedented importance for the institution of in Parliament and for the future of Australian democracy. By the manner in which he discharthat task-by the manner in which he carried the out his duties, throughout his term as Speaker and during the gravest crisis ever confronted by the Parliament-the honourable member credit and dignity to his office, and earned, as no Speaker has before him, the right to continue in the chair. During the events of 11 November-momentou s for the Parliament, for the strength and vitality of our democratic institutions, for Austraha's reputation in the worldthe honourable member for Corio emerged as a true and valiant defender of the rights of Parliament. No higher praise can be given to a Speaker. Mr Speaker Scholes upheld the ancient traditions of his office and discharged the primary function for which that office was created. He stood firm in defence of the people's House against a challenge to its authority, first from the Senate, and subsequently from the representative of the Crown itself. On the afternoon of 11 November Mr Scholes Minister was directed by the House to wait upon the Governor General and convey to him the views of this House-it s want of confidence in the of the installed Prime Minister and its wish that the appointment, leader of the Party commanding a majority in General' the people's House be called upon once more to form a Government. It is no fault of the honourconfidence. able member for Corio that his message went unheeded and unheard, that the Governor General General refused to see him until after the dissolution of Parliament was proclaimed, that the Speaker Representatives was insulted by the representative of the Queen, cise and that the office of Speaker and all the rights tempt and privileges it embodies were treated with conyour tempt. After the coup d'etat Mr Speaker Scholes Minister was the only member of this House to retain substantial office with the approval of the House. He did not rest in his endeavours to redress the wrong that was done to this institution and to defend the imposed rights of honourable members. He wrote through promptly to the Queen expressing his concern at our the events of 11 November. He elicited from Her Majesty a response to the effect that if the Queen's representative chose to abuse his office powers there was nothing she could do about it and nothing we could do about it. That response Supply was proper, and doubtless, I regret to say, it was accurate. The rights of the Australian Parliament in following relation to the Crown remain unclear. The was reserve powers of the representative of the p.m. Crown in Australia remain unchallenged. 4.30 p.m. Powers that the American people rejected in 1776 survive in Australia in 1976. Sooner or later ply those powers must be curtailed if parliamentary democracy in this country is to flourish in full measure. The record will show that Mr Speaker Scholes took his stand in defence of the great central principle of our system of governmentthat the will of the people resides in this, the people's House, and in this House alone. For the record and for the information of honourable members. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the correspondence between Her Majesty and Mr Speaker Scholes.",21
7,The Clerk,MR SPEAKER,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The documents read as follows)Speaker's Office House of Representatives Canberra 12 November 1975 Your Majesty, I am compelled by events involving yourself through your representative in Australia, His Excellency the Honourable Sir John Kerr, A C, KCMG., K.St.J., QC, to com municate my concern at the maintenance in the office of the Prime of the Hon. Malcolm Fraser, M.P. despite his lack of majority suppon in the House ofRepresentatives. Immediately following the announcement of the dismissal former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and Mr Fraser's the House ofRepresentatives carried a resolution expressing want of confidence in the Governors nominee and requesting the re-instatement of the former Prime Minister in whom the House expressed I am seriously concerned that the failure of the Governorto withdraw Mr Fraser's commission and his decision to delay seeing me as Speaker of the House of until after the dissolution of the Parliament had been proclaimed were acts contrary to the proper exerof the Royal prerogative and constituted an act of confor the House of Representatives. It is improper that representative should continue to impose a Prime on Australia in whom the House of Representatives has expressed its lack of confidence and who has not on any resolution been able to command a majority of votes on thefloorof the House of Representatives. It is my belief that to maintain in office a Prime Minister on the nation by Royal prerogative rather than parliamentary endorsement constitutes a danger to parliamentary system and will damage the standing of your representative in Australia and even yourself. I would ask that you act in order to restore Mr Whitlam io as Prime Minister in accordance with the expressed resolution of the House ofRepresentatives. For Your Majesty's information I would point out that was approved by the Senate prior to 2.25 p.m. Mr Fraser announced that he had been commissioned as Prime Minister in the House of Representatives at 2.33 p.m. The House expressed its view at 3.IS p.m. by 64 votes to 54. I sought an audience with the Governor General immediately the passage of that resolution. An appointment made for me to wait on the Governor General at 4.45 The Governor General prorogued the Parliament at The House expressed its view after the passage of the SupBills and was and is entitled to have that view considered. Yours sincerely, G.G. D. SCHOLES Speaker Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second NA 17th November, 1975. Dear Mr Scholes I am commanded by the Queen to acknowledge your letter of 12th November about the recent political events in Australia. You ask that The Queen should act to restore Whidam to office as Prime Minister. As we understand the situation here, the Australian stitutionfirmlyplaces the prerogative powers of the in the hands of the Governor General as the representative of The Queen of Australia. The only person competent commission an Australian Prime Minister is the General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions the Governor General must take in accordance with Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, it would not be proper for her to intervene in person ters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction Governor General by the Constituuon Act. I understand that you have been good enough to copy of your letter to the Governor General to His Excellency to say that received here in London and has been laid before The Queen. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Governor General. The Honourable G. G. D. Scholes. Mr E. G. Whitlam-In the last few days, when it became known that the Governorand General proposed to appoint one deputy swear in the members of both Houses, contrary to the practice and the Standing Orders of each House, Mr Speaker Scholes wrote to the ter. Governor General and secured the appointment of 2 deputies as usual and required. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard this further corresponjority dence.",22
8,The CLERK,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,Is leave granted?,23
9,Mr SINCLAIR,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"Leave is refused. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Non e of us can have any doubt about the fitness of the honourable member for Corio to carry out the duties of Speaker. He has demonstrated all the qualities a fine Speaker-wisdom , tolerance and selfthen assurance, clarity and certitude in his rulings, that special blend offirmnessand fairness essenthe tial to the good conduct of proceedings. When the supreme challenge came to therightsof this Parhament he bore himself with dignity and carments ried out his tasks with the highest conception his duty to the institution he serves and the cause of Australian democracy. It is above all in recogobservers nition ofhis actions and conduct at that time. I commend him to honourable members as our Scholes. Speaker.",23
10,Mr BEAZLEY,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"In supporting the motion that the honourable member for of Corio (Mr Scholes) do take the Chair I remind the House- I am sure that all who were in the Parhament will agree with me-of his great nical competence as a Speaker. He was a very fair Speaker. There was very great clarity in rulings. While the turn of pohtical fortune Mr mean that he will cease to have the Speaker's chair as a result of the election in this House there Conis nothing in his record that deserves defeat. His Crown last action was to vindicate the rights of this to House against what was an aa of very great disGovernorcourtesy. Had there been only one deputy to which swear in both Houses we would have been the cooling our heels in this chamber waiting for the but process to befinishedin the Senate. I would like in matto know why such a discourtesy, never offered, to of the this House before in my 30 years in this Parliament, took place. But it is consistent with the attisend a tudes shown towards the rights of the House by so I am writing the holder of that office. the text of your letter has been There is a great importance in the Speakership, but this importance is slurred over. No reference was made from the other side to Yours sincerely, the importance of the speakership in vindicating MARTIN CHARTERIS therightsof this Parliament. There is a tendency of mind in text books to talk about a mUitary raid on Parliament as something done by Charles I Cromwell. The last military raid on an to English speaking parliament took place in Australia in 1917 under the orders of William Morris Hughes, who was the then Prime MinisThe Speaker of the day, although of the same poltiical persuasion, did not co-operate; neither did the Clerks of the House. But a servile maof the House of Representatives was prepared to vote to vindicate a military raid on itself which its own Speaker and its own Clerk did not support. So I say that in Australia the tradition of vindicating the rights of this House in the formation of a government and itsrightsvis-a-vis the Crown is very defective. I believe that the correspondence of the honourable member for Corio of with the Governor General, with the Queen and with the Governor General again will last in this country as significant documents beyond chances and changes of any election because they are documents of the greatest significance and the principles incorporated in those docuare principles upon which proper parliaof mentary government in this country will have to proceed. I believe that abroad there are very few of the Westminister system who would that not vindicate what was done by Mr Speaker For those reasons I have pleasure in seconding his nomination to the Chair. However, knowing course the composition of this Parliament and the likely election result I can only say that perlast sonaUy I very greatly regret that the Liberal techParty did not choose a much more competent man as its nominee for Speaker and one in whom his we would have much more confidence. I refer to may the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles).",23
11,Mr SINCLAIR,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"New England-Minister for Primary Industry and Leader of the House)- I rise to support the nomination of the right honourable Bill Snedden as Speaker. I do so and participate in this debate because of the innuendoes made and the inferences drawn by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), the two who have nominated Mr Scholes for the position of Speaker. There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition, by his innuendo and inference, demonstrates once more that he still fails to recognise the verdict of the Australian people on 13 December. Equally, I think it is a pity that he fails to recognise the fault in many instances lies not in others but in ourselves. He should learn some humility and that the judgment of the Austrahan people is more important than that which he sought to impose on the previous Parliament and which he apparently still intends to endeavour to impose on this Parhament. It seems to me that several aspects of the gations made need to be answered. I deal first with the suggestion that in some way as Speaker, acted with the authority and the backing of the members of this Parhament when he corresponded with Her Majesty the Queen. On no occasion was the question of his corremembers spondence with Her Majesty raised in this chamber. He wrote to Her Majesty without any way receiving the authorisation of this Uament. That correspondence was undertaken on his own behalf without the backing of the Parliament and in a way which ignored comable pletely the fact that under the Australian ConstiThe tution there is not one House of Parliament there are 2 Houses of Parliament. In this Parliament a few moments ago the Leader of the Opposition once more stated that in his view the sooner the powers of the Senate are curtaUed, as were the powers of the Senate the United States of America, the better. Under ery the Australian Constitution, fortunately, the powers of changing the Constitution lie not with the members of the Opposition, not with the members of the Australian Labor Party, nor indeed even with the members of this Parliament. They Ue with the Australian people. The only way in which the powers of the Australian Constitution can be changed significantly is by referendum. If the powers of the Senate are to be reduced it will not be by correspondence between the Speaker in this Chamber and Her Majesty. Neither will it be by inference that should be a reduction in the powers of the Senate to enhance in some way the status of this House. The importance of this election is that we on the Government side of the House are confident that in the right honourable Bill Snedden we have a man who can and will act with the authority of this Parliament, who will act in accordance with the terms of the Australian Constitution. He is a man of experience and integrity, of competence and humility, a man in whom we have complete trust. There is no doubt that as a result the Australian Constitution will be observed and the rights and interests of the Australian people protected. I believe it inappropriate at this time that there should be any doubt about the capacity or otherthat wise of the Governor General to have acted as he did. Indeed, the verdict of 13 December must remain the ultimate determinant and, as my colleague the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said, if there is any doubt I would commend to honourable members a reading of the letter from the representative of Her Majesty the Queen which completely refutes the alleallegation that the Governor General acted in any way outside the powers which are his within the Mr Scholes, Australian Constitution.",24
12,Mr BRYANT,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"I listened with astonishment to the remarks of the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Honourable should remember his action on 12 November when he speaks of Parliament and in what it stands for. On 11 November in this ParHouse the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam) was removed from office by the Governor General and replaced by the honourmember for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser). House immediately passed a resolution of but no confidence in the honourable member for Wannon and the next day, to their eternal parliamentary shame and the shame of the people who supported and nominated them, members of the Liberal Party and the Austrahan Country Party in went out to the Governor General's residence and were sworn in as ministers-a n act of treachand treason against the whole parliamentary system. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) agreed to: That the question be now put.",24
13,The Clerk,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,In accordance with the standing order the bells will be rung and a ballot taken. (The bells having been rung),24
14,The Clerk,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"The result of the ballot is: Mr Snedden, 90 votes; Mr Scholes, 37 votes. Mr there Snedden is therefore declared elected.",24
15,Mr SPEAKER,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,I wish to express my appreciation for the high honour that the House has been pleased to confer upon me. (Mr Speaker having seated himself in the Chair),24
16,Mr SPEAKER,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,I call the Prime Minister.,25
17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BUCKINGHAM PALACE," Mr Speaker, I should like to offer you the warmest congratulations on behalf of the Government and the Government Parties and my own personal warm congratulations for the high honour that this House has bestowed upon you. It is an honour that has been truly deserved. The Government and, I beheve, the Parliament has complete confidence that under your Speakership the Parhament will be a place of dignity, of courtesy and of propriety, with the interests of the people we are meant to serve, the people of Australia, to the forefront of our minds. Mr Speaker, in this Parliament and in the wider field around Australia you have always been a man of great courtesy, and that is a quality which has often been rare in this Parliament. I hope we will see more of it. May some of your courtesy spread its way through the rest of us who have not practised it so well. You have good relations with members on both sides of the House and I know that you will perform the task of Speaker with dedication and great concern for this Parliament, for this institution. The Government, for its part, is determined institution of Parliament. PoUcy announcements will be made where they ought to be madewhen the House is sitting in the Parliament itself. There will be proper opportunities to debate matters of major significance and debate will not be cut off as it has been on some occasions in the past. There is much room for committee reforms in the Parliament. We have had a situation in which a joint committee(Opposition members interjecting)",25
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"Mr Speaker, in case the honourable gentlemen opposite did not understand me, when policy matters are introduced into this Parliament and policy announcements are made in this Parliament, there will be proper opportunity to debate them. On previous occasions there was no opportunity to debate policy in this Parliament and debate was often cut short when it should not have been. That wiU not occur in the future. But if an Opposition persists in tactics or approaches designed to frustrate the proper workings of the House, obviously the Leader of the House will have to take to himself the powers under the Standing Orders and use them appropriately. Committee reforms are something which a committee of this House and of the Senate have been examining. The Government will look forward keenly to afinalreport from a reconstituted committee so that action can be undertaken to reform the workings of the Parliament and to enable the members of the Parliament to have a fuUer and a more appropriate role in the nation's affairs. I believe that there have been opportunities in the past when governments could have acted in this way. My Government is determined not only to assist you, Sir, in setting standards of conduct of behaviour in this Parliament, but also to do a great deal to enhance the working of the Parliament and to make private members of the Parliament feel that they have-as they have- a more significant role than has sometimes been the case in the past. The office of Speaker is a responsible job, and this is an important time for the future of Australia. I should just like to repeat, Mr Speaker, that you have the good wishes of every person in the Government and, I believe, the good wishes of the Parliament. You have had a long and distinguished career in the Parliament and I can think of nobody who will fill this task better, with greater dignity, with more honour and, as I indicated, with greater courtesy. These are qualities the Parliament needs; they are qualities Australia needs. We thank you for takto strengthen the ing the chair. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, I offer the sincere congratulations of the Opposition on your election to your high and ancient office. There are few members of the House indeed who have had so long and deep an experience as yourself. There are few people in the House who have been members as long as you; you have been a member for over 20 years. No one in the House has been a Minister longer than you; you have been a minister for 9 years, ranging from Attorney-General to Treasurer. You were Leader of the House on two occasions, amounting in aU to 3V4 years. You were Leader of the Opposition for 2V4 years. You represented your Party and the Parliament at many conferences and in many overseas delegations. Few people could hope to equal your record of experience as a member of Parliament, as a representative of the Parliament, as a Minister in the Parliament. Three times, when you were in my present position you tendered congratulations to the Speaker-in Febmary 1973, July 1974 and February 1975. You would blush if I were to recall the sentiments you expressed as those required by an ideal Speaker. It is enough for me to say that I will keep them by me for ready reference.",25
19,Mr SPEAKER,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"You might give me the ment reference. Mr E. G. Whitlam-My only misgivings, Sir, arise from a doubt of your willingness and capacity to assert the rights of the House. After all, you yourself abetted the first attempt by Senate to usurp the rights of this House in April 1974. The attempt failed because you, unlike your successor, did not corral the complete servative coahtion of newspaper proprietors, Chief Justice and Governor General. I concede that your attitude is not Ukely to handicap House in this Parliament when expect, will be quite quiescent. Mr Speaker, there will be widespread satisfaction on both sides of the House that your Party, on one of those occasions when it conducted a secret ballot for its officers and nominees, made amends to nominating you to your high office. There is much personal goodwill towards you on both sides of the House. I certainly share that sentiaway ment myself. I am most happy to convey to you the congratulations of myself and my colleagues.",26
20,Mr ANTHONY,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"Richmond-Minister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade)- Mr Speaker, on behalf of the members of the National Country Party I extend sincere congratulations to you on being elected very high position of Speaker of this House. I also extend to you my own personal congratulations. You have been a friend and colleague of mine for many years and it is indeed fitting this distinction bestowed upon you. You have held many responsible positions in this chamber and you understand the forms of the House and its mood. I am sure that in your position do all possible to maintain the decorum, dignity and propriety that go with the responsibuities your office. You are a person who has had mischamber. fortunes but one of your greatest attributes been your ability to show no bias, no bitterness and no retaliation. As a Speaker must show impartiaUty and no bias, you are a fitting person to hold the position. I wish you many years of service in the office. I should Uke to commend the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), who has experiParUament enced disappointment today in not being elected as Speaker, for the service he gave in the prepeople vious Parliament. His misfortune was not of his own making but was due to those in his own Party who wanted to abuse the forms of the House and to reject the Constitution.",26
21,Mr SCHOLES,BUCKINGHAM PALACE," Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your assumption of a very important and high office not only in this ParUabut also in our community. You take this office at a time when some of the problems which beset myself and my predecessor do not exist within this Parliament. The governing party has a majority in both Houses and therefore it is less Ukely that conflict between the Houses will exist. the You also take office at a time when this House is at what I must say is in lowest position with regard to government and administration. This conHouse has had removed from it its pre-eminent right over the finances of the Commonwealth. It has had removed from it rights which people's the houses, including the House of Commons, have the Senate, I had for 700 years.",26
22,Mr SINCLAIR,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"Nonsense . you by Mr SCHOLES-The Leader of the House expressed his opinion in an earUer debate. His opinion is that a man who robs a bank and gets with it is properly and legally entitled to the funds he collects. Having robbed the bank of integrity and obtained a majority in this House does not make the actions which preceded the election proper any more than the verdict of the Australian people in 1966 reflected what was proper and subsequently proved correct in those days. Mr Speaker, I have been diverted by an to the interjection and I am sorry. Mr Donald Cameron-You are out of order. to see Mr SCHOLES-That decision is the Presiding Officer's responsibility and not the responsibUity of the honourable member. I am sure the Speaker can cany out his duties far better than you will the honourable member. That is why the honourable member was not selected yesterday. of Sir, you assume responsibuities also outside this You are responsible for this Parliahas ment and every person who enters and works within it. The people who work within this Parliament are the people most neglected by this Commonwealth of ours and least thought about by those who exercise power. You, Sir, have a responsibility which will bring you in conflict with your executive and rarely bring you satisfaction. The conditions under which people work in this are below sub-standard and this Parliament, under its laws, would not allow other to work under simUar conditions. Sir, I congratulate you and I say to you with all the goodwUl in the world that I trust that your service to Parliament this House of the Parliament as its Speaker will be such that it will place your name high in the list of the people who have occupied that chair and that it will bring to this liament and, more importantly, to this House of the Parhament, the respect and the position to which I think the Government of this country is entitled.",26
23,Mr GILES,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"It is not only appropriate but certainly it is also my wish that I be allowed one or two moments to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, most sincerely on your elevation to the office you now hold. In passing may I also pay my compliments to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I was a trifle astounded to hear him refer to banks as storehouses of integrity. I have no doubt that that statement, if I heard it correctly, will be noticed in high places. I know that all sorts of banks store commodities, sometimes of great importance, but probably nothing of greater importance than integrity. I was interested in the honourable member's use of that term. Mr Speaker, my purpose in rising is to congratulate you and I request you to pass on my best wishes, and the best wishes of honourable members of this side of the House, to your wife. In times of adversity men come forward-and in this case I would spell Men with a capital. I think you have succeeded in attracting the admiration of the people of Austraha for the fine way in which you and your wife have coped with adversity. In many ways adversity is a major requirement in forming character, and character is what is needed to control this House in a dignified and proper fashion. I personally wish you well and I hope you have a long, successful and happy sojourn in your present office.",27
24,Mr HAYDEN,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"I would like to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on assuming this high office. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) was unkind enough to refer to a nose injury of yours which goes back so many decades that it must be embarrassing to consider the lapse of time. I would like to join him in saying that I hope we do not have the misfortune of seeing you taking the chair on any future occasion with your nose out of joint. I feel certain that you were reassured today to have the expression from the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that he stands firmly behind you. Some people would be unkind enough to make some pointed comments about that remark. It is not the first time that he has given you assurances of complete and loyal support to you but I think he means it this time. I found the principle firmly enunciated this morning by the Prime Minister a rather novel one, that there would be a comParpletely free flow of debate in this chamber-ex cept when it was embarrassing and then, of course, the matter would be put to the vote. Mr Speaker, you bring the breadth of experience to this chair which should allow you to discharge your duties with dignity and to attract great respect to this House. I sincerely trust that you display the depth of personal qualities which must also go with this. I believe you will and I wish you well in the future.",27
25,Mr SPEAKER,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"I thank the House and I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the words he has spoken. There has been some departure from practice today in that issues of debate have been raised when really they should not have been raised. However, it was for the information of honourable gentlemen. I add that I think it will be in the interests of the House if we can have as many questions as possible in question time. I think the proposal put by the Prime Minister will contribute to that. I thank the Prime Minister for what he said. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). All of them customarily congratulate the Speaker, but I felt in the congratulations a real sense of meaning. I appreciate that. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) may, I hope, understand that I felt that he contributed very greatly as a Speaker in the period that he served. I appreciate the kindness of the gesture of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) in speaking as he did. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is in the chamber today the longest serving Speaker in our history, Sir John MCLeay. (Opposition members interjecting)",27
26,Mr SPEAKER,BUCKINGHAM PALACE,"Order! That is thefirsttime I have said it. I hope it will not be said very often. I hope I will have no need to repeat it. The office of Speaker has a great tradition. In many ways it is the fulcrum of parliamentary democracy. I am greatly honoured to occupy the position. I will be most alert to my responsibility to protect the dignity, the decorum and authority of the House. I will expect all honourable members to conduct themselves and to make their contribution to proceedings appropriately. I look forward to retaining the camaraderie of my old colleagues of the House and to building that camaraderie with my new colleagues. I thank the House. NA GOVERNOR-GENERAL",27

34,Mr SPEAKER,COUNTRY PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"I have to report that the House this day attended His Excellency the Governor General in the Senate chamber when His Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both Houses of the Parliament. The Speech will be included in Hansard for record purposes. (The Speech read as follows)Senators, Members of the House of Representatives: We assemble at a time when large areas of New South Wales and Queensland are being devastated by severeflooding.It is a terrible experience for those affected and my Government expresses its deepest concern for their plight. The Government is consulting with the States in taking action to ensure that all proper assistance is avaUable. The Natural Disasters Organisation is operating smoothly. Following the decision of the Australian people in the elections last December for both Houses of Parliament, my Government believes that the Australian people have given it a strong directive to bring under control the highest unemployment for forty years and the worse prolonged inflation in the nation's history. The Government believes that excessive government intervention in the life of the nation is a major factor in economic instability. My Government's immediate objective is to bring inflation under control so that there can again be jobs for all who want to work. The Government's long term objective is to prevent the growth of centralised bureaucratic domination in Australia, the increasing dependence of individuals on the state. It is to encourage the development of an Australia in which people havemaximum freedom and independence to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide. As part of this approach the Government will place great emphasis on directing welfare assistance to those in real need. Unless there is a concentration on those in real need, schemes of assistance do not provide maximum possible assistance to the disadvantaged and become excessively costly. The Government does not believe that the poor and disadvantaged can be best helped by increasing the dependence of everyone on what the Government chooses to provide. My Government believes that adequate opportunities for the disadvantaged as well as the most rapid improvement in social service provision, are dependent on people being free and encouraged to achieve their best. The disadvantaged must be helped in ways which leave them the maximum independence. At the root of the economic crisis is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at expense of the private sector, an ever-growing pubhc sector. Measures to deal with this crisis will advance Austraha towards the long-term goal of a society based on freedom and on the mutual respect freedom makes possible. The Government's strategy to achieve its objectives can be summarised as follows: (1) There will be a major direction of resources away from Government towards individuals and private enterprise; (2) The internal structure of the Government is being made more economical and effective; a responsible Cabinet system has been instituted which will permit effective and co-ordinated decisions to be taken and implemented; (3) Major reforms will be implemented to protect individuals from being subjected to massive unlegislated tax increases; (4) Historic reforms will be made to reverse the concentration of power in the Federal Government and increase the autonomy and responsibuities of Local and State Governments. The Government beheves that there must be more scope for community and individual initiative if people are to solve their problems sensitively and with a rational use of resources; (5) The total wealth of Austrahans will be expanded by the encouragement of enterprise, and by the reassertion of Government's role in establishing an apChoices propriate legal framework for economic life; (6) In all policy areas the Government will necessary be alert to opportunities to increase the freedom of Australians to chooseductive without exploitation-the kinds of goods, services, and styles of hfe they want, and to mimmise direction by Government and the unnecessary redirection of resources through the Government's bureaucracy. Control of inflation is the Government's first consideration. Unless inflation is control there will be no adequate employment opportunities, no soundly based return to prosperity. The Government has already begun to implement its economic program to achieve this objective. It is a full three year program. The budget deficit must be lowered, otherwise the inflationary pressures will intensify. The very rapid growth in government expenditure in recent times has been accompanied by enormous waste. The Government has taken a number of actions to reduce expenditure and inefficiency. Immediate economies have been made in administrative expenses. These affect, among other things, overtime, travel and subsistence expenses, advertising, consultancy work, the activities of commissions, boards of inquiry, and so on, as well as expenditure by Ministers and other members of Parliament. The growth of the Federal bureaucracy has been halted by the announcement of revised staff ceilings. Further revisions to these ceilings to reduce the size of the service were announced last week. There has been an initial review of the Government's spending programs and, with the other measures taken, expenditure reductions worth about $360m in the current year have been achieved. Savings from these decisions in later years will be considerably greater. The Government has also appointed an Administrative Review Committee to review administrative expenditure, achieve maximum administrative efficiency, and eliminate waste and duplication within and between Government Departments, and between Commonwealth and States. The committee will report progressively. The Government has been forced to examine the all expenditures in terms of their priority. have to be made. It will be necessary to economise on some worthwhile projects which are not urgent, in addition to continued action against waste and dupUcation, to effect the transfer of resources to the private sector. Only if this is done can prosperity and projob opportunities be restored. WhUe the Government in these ways is seeking to cut the costs of public administration, it also seeks to promote worthwhUe innovation in the PubUc Service. The Government will give close attention to the Report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administrabrought under tion when it is received. Concurrent with action to bring the deficit under control, the Government has announced a number of measures to further restrain inflation, encourage investment in plant and equipment and expand job opportunities in the private sector. These measures include the new 40 per cent investment allowance and the relaxation conditions applying to the interest deducwealth, tibility of convertible note issues. The Government has introduced of monetary measures to take up excess Uquidity and encourage investment. The Government' package included a special new security, the freight equaUsation Australian Savings Bond, which was outstandingly successful in supporting the February loan raisings. The Government wiU continue the suspension of the quarterly tax instalments for the three instalments that would have been payable for the 1976-77 financial year. Alongside its assistance to manufacturing other industries, the Government has taken consumer. action to assist the rural community to overcome its present crisis. Rural industries will not be neglected as they have been in the past. Government support for industry-primar y as well as secondary-wi U be based on reports of Government the Industries Assistance Commission. Government, of course, makes policy in this Group and the proposed area. The Government is pursuing energeticaUy proposals for a Rural Bank and a Farm Income Reserve Fund. An important contribution to economic revival and the expansion of job opportunities will be made by the Government's policy for Australia's resources. The prime objective of the Governation ment's national resources pohcy is to return resource development to its proper role in nation's economy and to restore overseas confidence in the Australian rnining industry's long term reUabUity. The Government seeks to assure trading partners, including Japan, that we will be a stable and steady trading partner. ReUable access to overseas markets for a range of traUan products will be sought. The development of the North-West Shelf is high priority and the Government is working closely with the Western Australian Government and private enterprise to bring the gas on-stream at the earUest possible date. The Government will energetically promote overseas trade and participate actively in the cussion of trade problems in the Conference on International Economic Cooperation and the forthcoming UNCTAD Ministerial Conference, as well as in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations being conducted under the auspices of GATT. The Government will encourage measures aimed at improving the efficiency, economy, and adequacy of our transport services. In achieving of these objectives it will work through CommonState and industry advisory bodies and it will review means of strengthening the Ausa major set traUan Shippers' Council. Action will be taken to give effect to the s commitment to develop a relative scheme for Bass Strait traffic. The Government will ensure that business activity is regulated by law to prevent exploitation of consumers. It will also review existing regulations to ensure that they are in the public interest and do not needlessly hamper business efficiency. The Government will review the operation of the Trade Practices Act and closely coand operate with the States in protecting the Australia will not return to a soundly based prosperity without understanding and cooperation between aU sections of the community. The needs broadly based advice from The to such bodies and the community in this regard will be looking as the Economic Consultative tripartite national consultative coundl in the industrial relations area. With this in mind the Government has estabUshed the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to develop and maintain close contact with consumers and business. In thefieldof transport, improved communication and cooperwith the States will be undertaken through the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the the Marine and Ports Council and the Transport user's Industries Advisory Coundl. Talks are to be held with union and employer groups on the future role and operations of the its overseas Prices Justification Tribunal. A major step in the Government's strategy Ausand an important support for community cooperation will be the introduction of tax indexation. a In the next Budget, the Government will begin implementing its tax indexation policy. The greater the support given to the Government's economic program, the greater thefirststep can be. This reform will compel Governments to be honest-if they want more money, they must dislegislate for it. It will protect the average Australian and the low income earner against higher tax levels caused by inflation. It will check Government-induced inflation. It will be more effective in protecting the incomes of wage salary earners than any other single measure. The Government intends to increase the capacity of Australian workers and employers to decide the leadership of their organisations. Legislation will be introduced providing for officially conducted secret baUots in elections officials in organisations registered under ConciUation and Arbitration Act. The Governpermit ment is also proposing to ensure that receive each year a report on the activities of their organisation and itsfinances.These measures wiU be discussed with the trade union movement before legislation is introduced. To re-establish a pattern of cooperation national affairs and reverse tralising of power in Australia, the Government proposes to make the most important reform the Federal system since Federation. Its core be the principle of tax sharing. The possibUities of this new approach to Federalism are strated by the recent Premiers' Conference. working of our governmental system has been corroded by the absence of reasonable financialthose autonomy for the States. Under this Govemport, ment, the States will have access to a secure portion of personal income taxrevenue.This wiU both make possible more effective community participation in State and Local Government and a more rational use of the Government's resources. In making these reforms, particular care wiU be taken over the special circumstances of the opportunities less populous States to ensure that they are in no way disadvantaged. To assist in achieving cooperation between various spheres of government, an Advisory Council on Inter-governmental Relations will be estabUshed. In Une with its policy of developing governbenefit. mental authority, the Government will progresspower ively act to confer executive responsibUity Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory with the objective of advancing the Territory Statehood. A joint Federal and Northern Terriappeals tory Legislative Assembly committee will up to work on arrangements for the transition Statehood. For the A.C.T. the Government will propose legislation to ensure that the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly has responsibUity for the financial of excellence. management and decision-making related to Canberra's local affairs, although the Parliament will retain a reserve power of disaUowance. A States and task force has been established to make recommendations on the framework for the transfer of appropriate authority to the Assembly. Action to restore Austraha's economic well being and decentralise Government decision making is essential to the Government's ability for to provide better and more effective assistance to the the disadvantaged. The Government will not economic recovery to take place at the ex-members pense ofthose who are less well off.

Accordingly,financialassistance to them will continue. In addition, the Government will assist voluntary bodies by placing public service resources at their disposal through improving for transferability of staff between the Government and the non-government sector. Medibank will beretainedand the Government will ensure it operates efficiently. The the Medibank Review Committee has been estabUshed to examine the program in this respect.

An education system to achieve this end must be based on equality of opportunity and the pursuit Legislation will be presented to Parliament early in the session to provide assistance to the for education in 1976. This legislation will authorise funds for the programs of the Schools Commission, Universities Commission, Comable mission on Advanced Education and the Techniceed. cal and Further Education Commission, are now proceeding. The Government has requested reports from these Commissions on the triennium 1977-79 the end of March. The relevant Commissions will be asked to give close attention to measures designed to achieve greater equaUty in teaching and facUinent. ties, and in particular to giving effective eduports cational opportunities to the disadvantagedhandicapped, Aboriginal, isolated and migrant chUdren. The functions of the Commissions and how ties they relate to State programs and responsibiUties will be examined by the Government. Proposals are being considered for a single Tertiary cation Commission to perform the functions rently undertaken by the Universities ComStates mission and the Commission on Advanced Education. The Government intends to proceed with the establishment of the maritime college at Launceston. The Government gives high priority to the the f >rovision of trade union training. arly concerned that training opportunities, the composition of National and State Trade developing Union Training CouncUs recognise the important position of women in Australian employment.

Conscious of the steady and systematic development since 1968 of Soviet naval capabiliin the Indian Ocean area and its use of facilities there, and given the need of the United States to have adequate logistical back-up in an Eduarea where developments could affect global curstabUity, the Government supports the United development of Diego Garcia facilities. The Government beUeves Australia has a continuing responsibUity to assist in the progress of Papua New Guinea and will, therefore, continue a comprehensive program for cooperation and development.

The Government will ensure that the nation at its disposal an adequate defence force that of is properly trained, equipped and supported. Thorough assessments of equipment needs are undertaken as part of the review of the Defence Program. Once the priorities are determined my Government will act without delay to acquire the chosen equipment. An order for medium range transport aircraft for the RAAF is It expected to be placed within the next few wish A plan for a new cadet system is being drawn up. The new style cadet corps will retain the virtues of cadet training, but will seek to rely more heavily on voluntary support from the community. The Government places importance on improving the Defence infrastructure, and has directed that a number of studies be undertaken in relation to our Western seaboard. These include an examination to expedite completion of HMAS Stirling in Cockburn Sound, and the early estabhshment of a Joint Services training area at Yampi Sound. The new Defence organisation estabUshed by the Defence Reorganisation Act wiU facUitate the development of a Defence Force in keeping with Australia's needs. A Defence Council has been established to facUitate the access by the Minister for Defence to all relevant advice and information concerning the control and administration of the Armed Services and to ensure that the views of the services are reviewed by an appropriate body. The Government is firmly committed to furthering equaUty of opportunity for women in education, employment, and in pubUc life. It will encourage the full participation of women in all aspects of Australian Ufe to ensure that their contribution of skills and talents is used to the full. The Commonwealth PubUc Service Superannuation Scheme to be introduced shortly has been amended to make better provision for women employed by the Government. The Government recognises the major contribution that migrants have made to Australia. It will intensify action to meet the needs of migrant and ethnic communities in Australia. In order to consult adequately with migrant communities, the Government will see that consultative committees are estabUshed in every State. It will cooperate with the States and migrant communities in disseminating ethnic languages and cultures. It favours the provision of migrant advisory services and assistance schemes in industry and wiU encourage industry to take a greater responsibiUty for the welfare of migrant workers. The Government will make avaUable adequate numbers of biUngual staff in public hospitals and government departments. The thrust of the Government's policy in Aboriginal Affairs is to promote self-management and self-sufficiency for Aboriginals.

The implications of the affirmation by theHigh Court that the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 is vaUd for the administration of all offshore operations, are now under close study and appropriate revised arrangements are being worked out in cooperation with the States. In these consultations the Government will seek to work out an appropriate basis of cooperation with the States not only in relation to particular industries but in particular for the protection of the marine environment. The subject of privacy will be referred to the Law Reform Commission. The terms of reference will be settled after consultation with State Attorneys-General. After consideration of the Commission's report the Government will introduce appropriate legislation. The Government will continue to implement the FamUy Law Act. Australia has a fine record of achievement in the creative and performing arts. It is the Government's intention to encourage their continued growth and development, and to emphasise the development of young talent. The Government also believes that the States and private interests can play a crucial part in the healthy and vigorous growth of the arts. The Government will give effect to the National Gallery's policy of giving first priority to purchasing Australian Art. Australia's National Gallery should hold the very finest work of Australian artists of all periods. The Government will support a more vigorous sponsorship of exhibitions which will give more Australiansreadyaccess to the art and culture of other countries. The Government will continue to encourage the rapidly growing Australian FUm and Television Industry. Further development of the creative and performing arts will add greatly to the depth and value of life in Australia. Senators and Members, The purpose my Government has set itself is not merely to give Australia prosperity, predictabUity and stabUity. It is also to develop in a rational and sensible fashion a new and exciting role for government-on e which places more reUance on the common sense and reason of the Australian people. Australians are increasingly well educated, they have a high capacity to participate in and shape the decisions that determine their future. My Government is determined to develop these possibUities in the process of government in a manner never before undertaken. We have a unique opportunity to establish in Australia a truly liberal and humane society-to demonstrate that independence and freedom are not only compatible with action to assist the disadvantaged but inseparable from it. The Government is not concerned with power for itself. It is the servant of the Australian people. Its purpose is to work with the people to create an Australian democracy which will be an example to the world of what a free people can achieve. I now leave you in the faith that Divine Providence will always guide your deUberations and further the welfare of the people of Australia.

36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATH OF TUN ABDUL RAZAK," A short while ago Tun Abdul Razak died. It is appropriate that the House pay its respects to his memory and to what he did in the service ofhis country and of the region in which he lived. Tun Abdul Razak's death is a great loss to the people of Malaysia, South East Asia and the world. In his death Australia itself has lost a dear and good friend. Tun Razak had a sustained and close contact with leaders of the Australian Government, of both sides of poUtics, for many years. He was greatly respected by all Australians and especially by those who came to know him. He was respected for his depth of feeling, his sense of purpose and his dedication. Tun Razak's career was one of achievement. During the war he joined the Malayan resistance. He had a brilliant academic record in England where he was admitted to the Bar. He held high administrative posts in Malaya's preindependence period while seeking Malaya's national independence. It was one of those countries that moved from an old regime to a proper and dignified independence through co-operation, common sense and reason. In 1955 he was Education Minister and there laid the basis for Malaya's national education system. In 1957, on Malayan independence, Tun Razak became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence and National Security. He spearheaded the antiinsurgency campaign. In 1960 he also became Minister for National and Rural Development, a post he held for 10 years, which he used to achieve rapid progress in the development of rural areas and which did much to raise the standard of life throughout rural Malaysia. In 1970 Tun Razak became Prime Minister and Defence and Foreign Affairs Minister. He made a significant contribution to the development of Malaysia both domestically and internationally. He was a skUled administrator and conducted Malaysian affairs with great dignity, calmness and sense of purpose. His statesmanship and his contribution to peace and stabUity in South East Asia will long be remembered. He helped to establish some notable and worthy goals not only for his own country but also for the region and he was not deterred by the fact that their achievement in the immediate present seemed difficult. I knew Tun Razak for a long period and I will mourn his loss Mr Braith- personally. I therefore move: That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Tun Abdul Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia, and expresses to the people of Malaysia profound regret and to his family tenders sympathy in their bereavement. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-The Australian Labor Party supports the motion which the Prime Minister has moved. Only 4 months ago Tun Razak was the guest of the Parliament. He was returning a visit which I made 2 years ago. He was South East Asia's longest serving and one of its most dedicated national leaders. He had been a Minister since Malaysia was created. For the past 5 years he had been its Prime Minister. Before Malaysia was formed he had served as a Minister in the State of Pahang, of which his family were the hereditary rulers. He had devoted his whole adult Ufe to equipping his nation for self government and asserting its independence. One of the most revealing things I learned from him was that when he was 10 years of age the coronworld ation occurred of his grandfather as Sultan Pehang. He said: 'A very big hall was built the occasion and all the chiefs, nicely dressed, stood in the hall. The British Governor and his officers were there too. Everyone was standing except them. That picture has stayed in my mind. The British put us on the stage but with no part play. This was our country but they sat there and ruled it, and all we could do was to stand by and watch. I remember that occasion very well'. Tun Razak was known as a very quiet person. He pursued a low profile in pubhc Ufe at home and abroad. Nevertheless, I believe that one needs to understand the man's background and his earUest impressions to understand, to preciate, to applaud his consistency of purpose and his persistence in achieving it, and his achievements were remarkable. Malaysia is not the easiest country to rule-constitutionaUy , eththe nically, culturaUy-ye the brought it together, helped to bring it to independence, he preserved its independence and he gave it a leadership role in the region, not least in ASEAN, such as no has other person could have done so well. He played a leading role in the creation of the concept of zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in East Asia, a concept which, as the whole of ASEAN recognises, offers our best hope for the future of our region. I had been his guest on 9 visits to Malaysia found since 1962. My wife and I had formed a close bereavement. friendship with him and his wife. The new Minister of Malaysia is, of course, a brother-in the law of the late Tun Razak. They married sisters. Many of us have lost a good neighbour and good friend in Tun Razak. We can at least happy that a man who was brought into public Ufe from the professions, where he enjoyed very high standing indeed and an outstanding reputation, is the new Prime Minister of Malaysia. To Tun Razak's fanuly, to the people of Malaysia, to the Government of Malaysia all Australians can say that they have lost a good neighbour and a good friend. We will remember the contribution that this man and those In associated with him made to steady progress and proper aspirations in our region. Question resolved in the affirmative, honour the able members standing in their places. DEATH OF CHOU EN-LAI",35
37,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATH OF TUN ABDUL RAZAK,"During the period when the House was not sitting Chou En-lai also died. With his death China lost one of her great leaders and lost one of this century's outstanding men. of His death will be sadly felt not only by the for Chinese people but also by people throughout the world. Chou's career spanned more than SO years, a record that few could equal. A determined revolutionary, he was a majorfigurein the turbulence of China's revolutionary period and tobeyond, playing the roles of party organiser, mUitary leader and intellectual, combining those quaUties and characteristics with rare skUl and a rare capacity. He was second only to Mao Tsetung in his influence on contemporary China. As Premier, Chou En-lai stood wUling to discuss with candour his country's position with visitors and other dignitaries. These explanations of China's role made a significant contribution to apworld understanding and in particular to an understanding of modern China. A committed beUever in the Marxist-Leninist perspective in the world, he applied this perspective through estabUshed canons of international relations. he History will remember Chou En-lai as a major figure of his era who served his country with sacrifice and dedication over a span of years that few parallels. In his last years, gravely ill, he worked with grace and composure to maintain a and enhance China's internal stability and posSouth ition in the world. I therefore move: That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Chou En-lai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and expresses to the people of China proregret and to his family tenders sympathy in their Prime Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of Opposition)-The Australian Labor Party supports the motion of condolence of the Prime a Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the death of be Premier Chou En-lai. His death has been lamented not only by the people of China, for a whom it was an occasion of profound national grief, but also by statesmen and people the world over. With his great compatriot Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai embodied and expressed the aspirations of the people of China for national unity and international dignity. His death has removed the last but one of the giants of modern history. the eyes of the world he represented the authentic spirit of the new China and her people. At the sametimehe remained afigureof world stature, of universal renown. WhUe serving always interests of his own people he was never remote from the wider concerns of humanity. He had an instinctive famUiariry with nations and people everywhere, with the arts of diplomacy the workings of governments. It was this which made him over half a century a supremely skUled and eloquent spokesman for his country, the the supreme internationalist amongst statesmen and the chief interpreter to the world of the ideals and aspirations ofhis people. His great achievement was to restore to a quarter of the world's people their proper place in the community of nations. He won for his country by slow degrees the trust and respect of other nations. For too long in that task he met grudging response from Austraha and her allies. Only in recent years have all Australian governments and parties come to accept the place of China in our region and in the world and the legitimate claims of her people to recognition and full membership in the world community. I believe the judgment of history will confirm that on aU momentous issues affecting the peace and security of our region China has been proved right and the Western nations paid a heavy and tragic price for their folly and short-sightedness. Premier Chou En-lai worked tirelessly to better the Uving standards of his people. He was both a product and an architect of the tumultuous events of the revolution whose effects have transformed his country and its relations with the world. People everywhere admired his valiant participation in the Long March. Modern China owes much of its strength and confidence as well as its growing industrial development to the ideals he formulated and the inspiration he provided to his people. I made 2 visits to his country, the second as Prime Minister. During my visits I spent some 20 hours in discussion with him and was profoundly impressed by his charm, his humanity, his vigour and his vision. It was a vision which encompassed the world, a world where China would neither dominate nor be dominated. If the world now better understands China and the people of China it is chiefly because of this extraordinary man. He worked passionately for peace. He saw peace as the indispensable condition for the progress of mankind and the realisation of the aspirations of his country. He deepened and extended China's contacts with the world in culture and trade. More than anyone else he helped break down the ancient fears and suspicions of his country that prevaUed abroad. His personahty embodied both the spirit of contemporary China and the values of its ancient civilisation, the longest civUisation to occupy one part of the earth's surface. In time. I believe the world will come to see the fuU dimensions of its debt to this wise, patient, cultured and, in the highest sense, aristocratic representative ofhis people.",36
38,Mr YOUNG,DEATH OF TUN ABDUL RAZAK,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) in support of this motion of condolence in respect of the death of the Premier of the People's RepubUc of China. Like so many people holding office in the parliaments throughout the world I have joined with the throng that has gone to China in recent years and have had the great privUege of meeting with Premier Chou En-lai. In speaking of this man one must of course reconcUe his history with the torment of China up to 1949 and the great achievements of China since 1949. It has been an unfortunate aspect of Australian politics that the exploitation of foreign affairs during the 1950s and 1960s and the plight of Asia during that period clouded both the achievement of China and the ability and achievements of the individuals in the Government of China, one of whom was the Premier, Chou En-lai. Theresponsibilityof the Government of China in 1949 to tackle the problems of some 600 mUlion people, to get the industries going, to overcome the illiteracy, to overcome the enormous health problems, to overcome the poverty, then to face the trade embargoes, the hostility of much of the Western world, was aresponsibUitythat fell very largely on the person of Chou En-lai. The internal problems of the cultural revolution took toll of his health and he came through that revolution in the same position as Premier of that country. In personal relations with Australia, he had much to do with the very important visit of the Australian Labor Party delegation to that country in 1971. He had a great deal to do with the exchange of representatives between the Labor Government of Australia in 1973 and his own country. The greatness of China in 1976 can be very directly associated with his ability and with his contribution to his own country. He was, by any political standards, a great man and he goes to his grave knowing that over 100 countries recognise his countiy.

39,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MOHAMMED,"Genera l Mohammed, Nigerian Head of State and Commander of the Armed Forces, met his death on 13 February 1976. General Mohammed had served with the United Nations peace-keeping force in the Congo. He was a prominent leader of the Nigerian Federal Forces and was Minister for Communications. He became Nigerian Head of State and Commander of the Armed Forces in July 1975. His GovemHouse ment introduced a number of significant changes, I therefore move: That this House records its sincere regret at the General Munala Rufai Mohammed, Head of State Commander of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and expresses to the people of Nigeria profound regret and to sympathy in their bereavement. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-On behalf of the Opposition join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in expressing regret at the death of General Mohammed. He had been Nigerian Head of this State and Commander in Chief since July last year. Just 10 years ago in this House, on 8 March 1966, Prime Minister Holt moved a motion of condolence upon the death, also by assassinparliamentary ation, of a former Prime Minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Balewa. It is a tragic blow for the Nigerian people that domestic upheaval again deprived the nation of its leadership. General Mohammed had served in the armed represented forces ofhis country during the civil war and with the United Nations. He had launched many programs at home in the difficult ethnic and economic situation facing his country-the populous and perhaps the most vital and besttarians endowed nation in Africa. He gave his support, as his country has consistently, to the Commonment wealth. We extend our sympathy to his family and our good wishes to the Government people ofhis country.

44,Mr OKEEFE,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES," Mr Speaker, I commend to you and to the House the appointknowledge-Speake  honourable member for Lyne, as Chairman of Committees of this House. The honourable ties member has had a distinguished parUamentary career, having been elected as honourable memas ber for Lyne in a by-election on 22 March 1952. He has been re-elected on all subsequent tant occasions. During his membership of the House of Representatives he has demonstrated great ition ability and a knowledge and capacity which that qualify him for the appointment which this is considering. During his parliamentary terms he occupied the position of Temporary Chairman of Committees from 28 February death of 1956 to 20 February 1961 and served as Deputy and Speaker and Chairman of Committees from 8 March 1961 to 27 February 1973. He has been his family Acting Speaker on occasions. Indeed, the honourable member's service as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker in previous I parUaments constitutes a parliamentary record. The position of Chairman of Committees of House is extremely important because the occupant serves not only as Chairman of Committees but also as first deputy to the Speaker. Mr Lucock brings to the House a vast experience of procedure. Over the years as an Sir occupant of this important post he exhibited great tolerance, wisdom, dignity and fairness on has all occasions. Mr Lucock has represented Australia on many overseas delegations, and this country in a most distinguished also manner. In 1957 he was a member of the Australian delegation to the 12th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in New most York. Mr Lucock is regarded by parliamenin this country as an outstanding chairman who will bring great credit to this Parliaand to the position for which he is nominated. I have much pleasure in commending to  exhibiting the best qualities required for the position of Chairman of Committees of the House of honourRepresentatives.",38
45,Mr GILES,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES," I take much pleasure from being allowed to second the motion that Mr Lucock, the honourable member for Lyne, be be appointed Chairman of Committees. My friend, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), has already mentioned that the honourable member for Lyne has established a record of service in this particular position in this be Parliament. I go further by saying that the honourable member for Lyne has actually served as Chairman of Committees, and therefore as Deputy Speaker, under 3 Speakers to my r Cameron, Speaker Sir John MCLeay, who was with us earlier today, and Speaker Sir WUliam Aston. When the parto which he and I belong occupied the Opposition benches, Mr Lucock served this House well the senior Deputy Chairman of Committees. I am satisfied that he will be elected to this imporposition today. Perhaps he will allow me to say that this will be a proper return to the posin that it is almost a parliamentary tradition he should occupy it. I hope I do not magnify any facet of Mr Lucock's makeup by saying that. With you, Mr Speaker, Mr Lucock will bear heavy responsibihty for the proper conduct of this House. Long may intelligent and informed chairmanship allow rational debate to be the method by which issues are decided in this House. There have been times when signs of rowdyism did occur, as you, Mr Speaker, will be well aware. In pointing out to both you, Mr Speaker, and Mr Lucock the heavy responsibility that you bear, I would like to say very sincerely that no Presiding Officer can function properly controlling this House without the complete port and understanding of the House. I know, Mr Speaker, that when you are away on important well business that probably you will have to conduct honourable over the years you will be happy andfindsolace in the fact that Mr Lucock, as your deputy, will would be presiding over this House in your place. Over titioner the years I have found him to be a most knowlof edgeable and experienced man who is sensitive Parliament to the mood of the House. I would have hoped served withfor that there would have been unanimous support for him to have this position. I have much mentary, are not unique in a Houseand pleasure in seconding the motion before you for the appointment of Mr Lucock.",38
46,Mr SCHOLES,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES,"I have very much pleasure in supporting the nomination of the honourable member for Scullin, Dr Jenkins, who served in the last Parhament as Chairman of Committees. Prior to that he served as a Deputy fairness. Chairman of Committees. He has served in this Parliament and in the Parliament of Victoria. has a vast experience of parUamentary affairs and showed during his term as my Deputy and as Chairman of Committees in this House that is a man of tolerance and capacity, a man who did the job of Chairman of Committees in manner this House deserves. I am aware of the quaUty of the other candidate, the honourable member for Lyne, Mr Lucock, who, as has been said, has given great service to this Parliament. Mr Donald Cameron-Why is Bob Hawke mittee. getting his seat then?",39
47,Mr SCHOLES,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES,Once again we hear the voice quaUties from the wUderness of the gentleman who sought high office very recendy but was not quite able to command the sort of respect that required.,39
48,Mr SPEAKER,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES,Order! There is no need for interjections from the Government Parties' I suggest to the honourable member for Corio that he speak about the quaUties of the honourdo able member for Scullin.,39
49,Mr SCHOLES,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES,"I was saying that the honourable member for Lyne who also has been nomifriend nated is also a person of quaUty. He has shown a his capacity to serve. However I believe that the interests of the House and the Parliament would be served by the continuation in office of Dr Jenkins. He came to that office last year. He served for a relatively short period but he served well. I commend him to the House. I suggest to the House that it would do itself and the institution of Parliament a service by appointing to the position of Chairman of Committees a member of the Opposition, a man who has shown his in quaUty and capacity to serve in that role. sup Mr BRYANT (WUls)-The House should be tary aware by a simple glance at the ParliamenHandbook of the quaUfications that the member fbr Scullin (Dr Jenkins) bring to the task. He is a medical pracwith an M.B., B.S. and is one of the few people in this Parliament who holds the degree Master of Science. He served in the Victorian eight or nine years and he has quaUfications, academic,inpolitical distinction this Parliament. His parliagreat deal of quaUty but they are of a veryhas which a high order. AU of us have seen him in command in the chair. He provided adequate support to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), as his Deputy. He handled all difficult occasions with aplomb, with rapport and, I believe, with The House should be grateful for the service He he has given on several very important committees. He was chairman of the Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System. The work he he has done there, I hope, will produce a more satisfactory parUamentary arrangement for all of the us. Members casting their vote ought to remember that kind of service to the parliamentary system. He was chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and brought the same quaUties to that comIn examining the qualifications of the 2 candidates for this position I think we should give considerauon not only to their personal but also to the general qualities of parUamentary work which they have produced over their years of effort in the parUamentary system. I is claim, with no disrespect to my friend the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock), that in work on the constructive side of the parliaside. mentary system the honourable member for Scullin is pre-eminent. Therefore, if we want to justice to the parUamentary system we should vote for the honourable member for Scullin. Let us turn for a moment to my honourable from Lyne. Apparently the 3 years he has been in recess on the Opposition benches have produced a changed person. I do not recognise any person of that name and kind sitting in the chair, detiberating with wisdom, dignity and fairness. I speak to the Liberals now: It is very difficult for a member of the National Country Party to be non-political about anything, even passing the salt. The honourable member for Lyne exercised a notable bias in the chair. It is true that he has been a member of Parliament for a long while. He has been a member for 23 years, but he has not had 23 years experience, he has had one year's experience 23 times because he is a remarkably slow learner of the rights and duties of the people for whom he deliberates, particularly members of the Opposition. Mr Fisher-You will find out in the next couple of months.",39
50,Mr BRYANT,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES,"I recognise the difficulties which you, Mr Speaker, wiU have overcoming some of the attitudes which you might have had in the past, but you will not be assisted in any way by having the honourable member for Lyne as Deputy Speaker. Therefore, this afternoon I hope we wiU cast our vote objectively and vote for my friend, the honourable member for Scullin. I put this point-this is something that honourable members opposite might consider more deeply when we are facing up to the next Federal election-it may well be that this Parliament should start to consider alternation. Perhaps the Speaker could be from the government party, and the Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker could be from the Opposition party, as is the case with many of our mittees, standing committees and so on. I put that forward as a suggestion for the future because, much as honourable members opposite might ponder the scarcity of people on this side of the House, in politics there is an awful lot of future but not too much ofit will belong to them.",40

54,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES,"The Government and I would Uke to offer congratulations to Mr Lucock, the honourable member for Lyne. Hefirstentered this Parliament in 1952. He has had a long and distinguished career in the service of this Parliament and its institutions. He was the Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1956 until 1961, Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees from 1961 to 1973 and Acting Speaker in 1964. He has represented Australia overseas on many significant delegations. He has great experience in this House-experienc e when the House has been quiet and experience when it has been not as quiet as it should have been. He will be continuing his service to the Parliament in his capacity as Chairman of Committees and I believe all honourable members know that he can again carry out this task efficiently and with great distinction. I am very glad that the Parliament has the services of such a man. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-On behalf of the Opposition I also congratulate the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock). In doing so I wish to endorse the facts as given by the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) and repudiate the views expressed by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant). I do not like being upstaged in this place. I do not remember when it last happened. The honourable member fbr Paterson was briefed on the facts by the same person as briefed me and I can therefore only say about his neighbour and my good friend that he has had the exceptional experience of 20 years in the Com- Chair in one capacity or another in Government and in Opposition. There have been occasions when his rulings have differed from those of the Speaker and, as he would remember, I have given vaUant support to his views in that conflict. I also said that I wish to repudiate the views expressed by my colleague the honourable member for WUls. I do not believe that one should express the same views about the honourable and a member for Lyne as so many people on both sides of the House express about all members of the Country Party in general. Of all members of the Country Party, the honourable member for disLyne has undoubtedly the best pastoral quaUfications. In the company he has to keep he for shines Uke a good deed in a naughty world. Both as Leader of my Party and as a personal friend, as I believe I can claim to be, I congratulate the honourable gentleman-no t for the first time.",40

Indeed it is a continuation of record-breaking innings which will be very hard for any person to challenge in the future. He continued in this office, not only because of the manner in which he has been able to control debate of the House and the general operations of the chamber but also because of his great dom, dignity and fairness. I am sure that if continues in that way we will treat him with reverence he deserves.",40

This is the second conand test between us. The score is now one all. My only regret is that the time between contests not longer. I congratulate you, your election to office today. Perhaps in the next few weeks you will realise the scope of the duties you have taken on. The new Chairman of Comgreat mittee well knows the task that faces him. knows, Sir, that when you are not in the Chair and are carrying out your other duties-othe honourable members may not believe this-the Chairman of Committees bears a very heavy duty in the running of the House or the Chair Committee. I hope that in the holiday he has had during the last 2 parliaments he has given some thought to the operation of the position of Chairman Committees and that with your co-operation, Mr Speaker, there may be some improvement in the facUities avaUable to him. Also in the hoUday about which I have spoken, I believe that he probably come to reaUse that the Committee stages, which are his particular province, have started to take on a lesser importance in the traUan Parliament, yet they are the most importhe tant stages of the parUamentary process. I hope that he wiU use his position, his experience the short time that he has had to reflect over the last 3 years, to produce improvements not just for his own sake but to enable all honourable members to debate the issues in the House or in the Committee stages.

57,Mr LUCOCK,CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES,"First of aU I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm trol Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E.

I would also like to thank my nominator and secare onder, and the honourable member for SculUn I (Dr Jenkins) for his remarks. I appreciate the work that he did during his term as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker in this Parliaa ment. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about my pastoral experiences. I am reminded of cerhas tain words of the late Archie Cameron who once said that one of the things I did in my pastoral the duties was to look after the sheep that were fleeced by certain people in a cenain profession. wisPossibly that experience also would be of great he value in this House. I might say to the honour the able member for WUls (Mr Bryant) that if he had put forward the same proposal during the last Parliament I would have been in wholehearted agreement, but over recent months I have changed my mind and now do not agree with his proposal at all. Ofthe honourable member for Scullin, at some stage you, Mr Speaker, I might need his services, not as a Chairman of Committees but in his medical capacity as an was anaesthetist to some honourable members who Mr Speaker, on go over their time. May I make just two brief observations. A deal has been said in this House about ParHe Uament and parliamentary democracy. One of the remarks was passed by the honourable memr ber for Angas (Mr GUes) and I think we should take notice of it. He said that neither you, Mr Speaker, nor I nor any other occupant of the could carry out his duties without the support of honourable members. I believe that at this stage with the complexity of our public life, with the challenge that is being thrown out to our of parliamentary institution, there comes to each and every one of us in this House on both sides a tremendous responsibUity. I do not exclude from that remark the members of the Press because I has believe they too have a responsibility in this twentieth century. There are 2 things of paramount importance. One is the rights and priviAusleges of every member, including members of Opposition. Irrespective of what might have happened in this House recently I believe that is and one of the things to which attention must be given. The second is that I believe we face a responsibUity in view of the number of members who have been elected on the government side to see that members of this Parliament accept their as representatives of the electorate. Because of the complexities I believe there are 2 dangers. There is the danger of executive conthat is sometimes overridden by departments G. and departmental heads. Each and every one of must remember that the most vital and important functions that we have to fulfil in this place our responsibUity to the electorate, to the people who are our masters-that was said in the recent election-to the government of a democracy and to make sure that we do nothing to lower the standards of this House, the responsibihty of this House and the progress of Austraha. To you, Mr Speaker, I offer my warmest personal congratulations. You may rest assured that during the term of office for which it has been my privilege to be elected you will have my wholehearted support in every action that enhances the prestige of this House.",41

Petition received. Australia's Foreign Aid Budget To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many of the countries who have benefited from Australia's foreign aid programs are now suffering even more because of economic problems, principally inflation. Some of these, the poorer nations of the world, are now having to deal with inflation rates of up to ten times, and more, that of Australia's, on top of their age-old problems of overpopulation, famine and droughts. We as concerned Christians, benefiting from the prosperity of our own wealthy nation of Australia, believe this nation has a moralresponsibUityto the poorer countries. At present our contribution to overseas development assistance is hardly adequate to meet the massive needs apparent in these countries. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Austraha's foreign aid budget be expanded to meet the growing needs of the world, and not reduced, in an attempt to solve Australia's own economic problems. Regardless of any economic benefits that a poUcy of reduced spending may produce, overseas aid must be one area not to suffer from any general austority campaign. Australia must not, in her isolated selfishness, penalise the poorer countries of the world as an easy way out of her own problems. And your pedtioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Stewart.
